He also has decent speed and is always a threat to steal on the base-paths (17 steals last season). Aside from several younger, athletic infielders, the Blue Jays also have power bats that can anchor the middle of their lineup. Frank Thomas, the designated hitter, drove in 114 runs with 39 long balls last season, and Troy Glaus had 104 RBIs (38 HR) from third base last year. The Blue Jays have the pitching and pop in their bats to take a game on any given day, so Leyland will need to make sure his Tigers are fired up and ready to go for the beginning of the regular season., 3450=After months of anticipation, it has arrived \u2014 the game we all know and love: baseball.

Comerica Park is expected to be in relatively warm weather on Monday (high of 63), but wind may be a factor. With a day off on Tuesday, the Tigers will miss out on the warmest weather of the week, as temperatures drop to the high 30s/low 40s for the games on Wednesday & Thursday, when it is possible snow will be sighted. Nevertheless, it will be great to see the boys of summer back on the field once again. Each team has a clean slate, so everything in the past must be placed in the backseat as teams race for division records this season. For the American League Central, it\u2019s a literal tossup \u2014 every expert has a different pick, and every team that is not Kansas City has a legitimate shot at winning the division.
