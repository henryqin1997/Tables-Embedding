Doug Melvin, Milwaukee Brewers: Melvin is an interesting case; the Brewers purposely bottomed out their farm system to make a playoff run in 2011, the last year before they lost\u00a0Prince Fielder and their fortunes would change. \u00a0And change they have; the Brewer\u2019s player development efforts have not moved off the bottom of the league (their farm system is either last or dead last on every pundit list) while their on-the-field record has dropped (they\u2019ve gone from 96 to 83 to 74 wins in the last three years). \u00a0 Now they\u2019re the 4th best team in their division and it isn\u2019t close, and it is unclear what their plan is going forward. \u00a0 They\u2019ve got quality players at certain places, but have made odd signings (losing their 1st round pick last year to sign\u00a0Kyle Lohse of all people). \u00a0You can\u2019t help the\u00a0Ryan Braun situation, and they got unlucky with injuries (Corey Hart in particular) so perhaps this ranking is unfair. \u00a0But I still feel like the Brewers are adrift in terms of strategy and thus Melvin\u2019s ranked this low., 176201=Obviously the situation with the Dodgers and Mets prevents them from doing such a franchise-altering commitment.\u00a0 Plus both teams have half-way decent options playing at 1B for them now (James Loney and Ike Davis).\u00a0\u00a0 The Giants were at $118M in 2011 and seem tapped out; they have $84M committed prior to their Arb cases, including a potentially record-setting arbitration case with Tim Lincecum.\u00a0 They\u2019ll easily be above $100M once these cases are said and done.\u00a0 Lastly St. Louis: if they were willing to pay $25M/year, they would have re-signed Pujols.\u00a0 So clearly they\u2019ve reached a financial threshold themselves., 195429=A: (The allegation also being that Ripken was friends with Brady Anderson, whose 50 homer season seems awfully suspicious in hind-sight).\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s ever said a word about Ripken and PEDs.\u00a0 You have to think he was well aware of his legacy the closer he got to 2130 games.\u00a0 I\u2019d be shocked if he was shown to be a user.\u00a0 Him and Derek Jeter would be probably the two most shocking PED revelations in the history of the game, if they turned out to be true.\u00a0 Boswell doesn\u2019t think Ripken profiled to a typical user., 120775=Method #2: Ride your developed Core and use your prospects to acquire big names: (Washington, San Francisco and Detroit to an extent): The Nats have transformed themselves over just a couple of seasons, relying less on FAs to plug holes caused by an awful farm system to having most of their core team developed at home (See the table further below to follow the transformation of our team over the past few seasons). \u00a0Those spots they couldn\u2019t depend on have been filled by trades (three guys acquired by flipping prospects for them; in addition to Gonzalez Kurt Suzuki and Tyler Clippard also count here).\u00a0 San Francisco has seen their payroll skyrocket as they extend their home-grown talent, but for the most part they have stayed true to the team development concept.\u00a0 Their one major Free Agent (Barry Zito) is notoriously one of the worst contracts in baseball and it is somewhat surprising to even see him on the post-season roster.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t be if Tim Lincecum was pitching in 2012 like he has regularly done in previous seasons.\u00a0 Detroit was entirely in method #2 until they decided to spend money like the Yankees; we\u2019ll revisit in #4., 12671=6. Ben Cherington, Boston Red Sox.\u00a0 Normally I\u2019m really skeptical of GMs for teams with $175M payrolls who have success.\u00a0 But it is difficult to argue with what Cherington has done since taking over the reigns.\u00a0 He completely undid a ton of the damage that his predecessor had done by offloading two horrible contracts (Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez) and one malcontent (Josh Beckett) on the Dodgers and actually receiving prospect value back.\u00a0\u00a0 He has quickly built the Boston farm system back to where it is one of the best in the game (they have as many top 100 prospects as any organization out there).\u00a0 And they just won the World Series.\u00a0 Cherington loses some credit for the disastrous Bobby Valentine hiring that led to the even more disastrous 2012 season \u2026 but he also recognized the faults with both the team and the manager and led a complete 180 degree turnaround.\u00a0 And I laughed at Cherington\u2019s almost comical chasing of closers (as documented in this space in June 2013).\u00a0 But a title erases a lot of criticism.\u00a0 Boston remains well positioned going forward but will be depending very heavily on the fruits of their farm system in 2014 and beyond.\u00a0 If Boston turns these high value prospects into another playoff appearance while driving down payroll, Cherington\u2019s ranking will only rise., 22830=14. Brian Cashman, New York Yankees. \u00a0Some say that just the mere fact that Cashman has survived as long as he has in the shadow of the Steinbrenner family ownership of the Yankees should be proof enough that he is among the best GMs in the game, and certainly higher ranked than he is here. \u00a0 Fair enough. \u00a0But here\u2019s the inescapable facts: his farm system is deteriorating, the most significant player on the 2014 team actually developed at home seems to be\u00a0Brett Gardner, they had a $225M payroll last year and didn\u2019t make the playoffs, their rotation will pivot mostly on a 40-yr old\u2019s career renaissance, and their starting 2014 infield played a combined 200 games last year. \u00a0 \u00a0And they\u2019re being saved only by the grace of\u00a0Bud Selig\u2018s hatred for\u00a0Alex Rodriguez, whose suspension \u201csaves\u201d the team $25M this year (quickly spent on their new \u201c#3 starter\u201d\u00a0Masahiro Tanaka, to whom they guaranteed more than $175M dollars). \u00a0I dunno; maybe Cashman should be lower. \u00a0They have made the playoffs 4 of the last 6 years and have a title, and Cashman\u2019s early tenure record speaks for itself .. but at what point do you notice that the team hasn\u2019t done very much since the \u201ccore four\u201d have entered their decline phases and begin to wonder if Cashman isn\u2019t just a guy with a big checkbook instead of a good GM?, 190716=Now, is he coming to the Nats?\u00a0 If I was Mike Rizzo i\u2019d sign him in a heartbeat for 3yrs/$75M.\u00a0 I\u2019d balk at an 8-year deal.\u00a0 But, the rumors persist and have been swirling for more than 2 weeks.\u00a0 So where there\u2019s heat, there\u2019s likely fire.\u00a0 Boswell says that the key date is Jan 18th, the day that the Rangers either sign or cut bait on Yu Darvish.\u00a0 If the Rangers suddenly have $120M that they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have yesterday, they will sign Fielder., 20520=12. Chris Antonetti, Cleveland Indians. \u00a0Antonelli has subscribed to the same \u201cwheeling and dealing\u201d mechanism for building teams that Billy Beane has done, and it turned a perennial doormat Indians team into a 2013 playoff team. \u00a0They play in a small market and have an $80M payroll, and Antonelli has taken their farm system from awful to respectable in the last three years. \u00a0So the system is improving as is the on-the-field product. \u00a0So far, so good in Cleveland for Antonelli\u2019s tenure. \u00a0I\u2019m hesitant to push him much higher because i\u2019m convinced the Indians succeeded in 2013 on the backs of several very awful divisional rivals (for example; the Indians were 17-2 on the season versus the White Sox but only 4-15 versus the Tigers, quite a swing for a 90-win team; if they were that legitimate a team they would have been much closer to .500 against their divisional winner). \u00a0So slightly above the median looks good., 87146=Washington has sent a decent number of players to play in the WBC over the years, with very mixed results for the team\u2019s interests. \u00a0In 2006 the team sent seven different players to the inaugural WBC:, 206136=Now, based on the rules of compensation (as explained in the Kilgore\u2019s Nats Journal blog posting today), the first 18 picks of the 2011 draft are protected (usually first 15 but there\u2019s a few compensation picks in there from failed draft picks in 2010).\u00a0 So, IF Dunn is leaving (and the prevaling opinion seems to lean that way despite all realistic arguments against it\u2026), what the Nats now root for is a team in the \u201cbottom\u201d half of the first round to be the signing team.\u00a0 If this happens, we\u2019ll get their 1st rounder AND a supplemental pick.\u00a0 Otherwise we\u2019re looking at the supplemental pick plus the signing team\u2019s 2nd rounder.\u00a0 That\u2019s not nearly as nice of a haul frankly., 86052=I read a quickie piece with some Mike Rizzo quotes from the Washington Time\u2019s beat reporter Amanda Comak on November 11th, 2012 and there was an interesting tidbit at the bottom: per Comak, \u00a0Rizzo has not been approached yet about any Washington Nationals participation in the WBC, but would approach each request on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d to determine what is in the best interests of the team. \u00a0This got me thinking about possible Nats representatives on 2013 WBC teams., 7671=2. Andrew Friedman, Tampa Bay.\u00a0 Is there any argument that Friedman is this high? He took over in 2005 and within three years had the league\u2019s best record.\u00a0 They\u2019ve won 90+ games four years in a row in the league\u2019s best division.\u00a0 He\u2019s done this despite routinely having one of the lowest payrolls in the game, despite off-loading talent as soon as it becomes pricey, by stockpiling draft picks (11 of the first 75 picks in the 2011 draft), and by signing his key players early on to incredibly club-friendly contracts (see the deals that Evan Longoria and David Price signed pre-arbitration).\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, I daresay that the success the Rays have had in the draft was a driving force behind richer owners (hello, Mr. Jerry Reinsdorf) pushing for bonus limits on the amateur market.\u00a0 In 2013 the team had the 3rd lowest payroll in the game but still made the playoffs ahead of the Yankees (who spent nearly FOUR TIMES as much as the Rays).\u00a0 Many would say these facts by default put Friedman #1 and I wouldn\u2019t argue; only the drop-off in his farm system this year keeps him from overtaking Mozeliak.\u00a0 Call these two GMs 1 and 1-a., 4387=I created a GM rankings spreadsheet where I track all sorts of interesting information that you use to judge GMs (the link is also along the right hand side of the blog), and where I tried to quantitatively judge the 30 GMs. \u00a0The spreadsheet has GM tenure, market size, ownership meddling factors, Farm system rankings, 2012 and 2013 payroll versus W/L rankings, plus my attempts to quantify three facets of a GM\u2019s job: MLB success, Trades and FA moves and the Farm system. \u00a0I will freely admit; i am paying significantly more attention to performance over the past three \u00a0years than performance over the past 10. \u00a0Maybe that\u2019s fair, may be not. \u00a0But it hurts a long-time GM like\u00a0Brian Cashman who guided his team to the playoffs year after year (but, see Cashman\u2019s write up for my reservations on GMs of massive payroll teams)., 57038=Lots of questions about Mr. Williams. Photo Nats official 2014 via sportingnews.com, 205032=As posted by other bloggers today, October 28th 2010, (especially in this post here on the Nationals Enquirer which rather eloquently titles their posting with the obvious consequence of Dunn\u2019s Elias rating), the Nats dodged a huge bullet and will be fully compensated if Adam Dunn decides to leave via free agency (that is well, unless they do the unthinkable and fail to offer him Arbitration).\u00a0 The official Elias Rankings came out and previous estimates on Dunn were slightly low (resulting in panicked posts by yours truly and others about his being a type B free agent and thus making our entire mis-handling of the contract extension even more egregiously bad)., 167146=March 23rd, 2012 at 3:23 pm, 36925=28. Rick Hahn (Kenny Williams), Chicago White Sox. \u00a0What can you say? \u00a0The White Sox lost 100 games with a $118M payroll last year and have had the worst (or near to it) farm system in the game for years. \u00a0The White Sox organization is in a bad way, and i\u2019m not sure why Williams\u2019 stewardship was rewarded with the \u201cpromotion\u201d to team president. \u00a0 They lost 18 games in the win column from 2012 to 2013 and it is hard to see how they\u2019re going to be any better this year. \u00a0It does seem though that they are undergoing a \u201crebuilding effort,\u201d in that their payroll seems like it will be $40M less this year versus last and they\u2019ve moved some of their bigger salaries in \u201crebuilding mode\u201d moves (Alex Rios,\u00a0Jake Peavy). \u00a0So perhaps its slightly unfair to have Hahn so low, if he\u2019s entering into a purposely bad period. \u00a0Nonetheless; this set of executives got the White Sox where they are now, so their low ranking is earned., 65937=I think we\u2019ll all be pretty frigging sick of\u00a0Derek Jeter once August and September rolls-around. \u00a0Yeah he\u2019s a great player, first ballot hall of famer. \u00a0But so are about 20-25 other guys playing right now. \u00a0I agree with the questioner\u2019s rant about the over-coverage of all things Yankees. \u00a0\u00a0Boswell points out that Jeter\u2019s career WAR is one spot above\u00a0Bobby Grich, so as to temper some expectations. \u00a0That\u2019s harsh; even I recognize his importance to the game as a surpassing point than just whittling down all his accomplishments to one (dubious) number.\u00a0, 41586=Here\u2019s some other links relevant to this discussion, for your perusal.\u00a0 Wiki\u2019s list of all 30 GMs.\u00a0 Baseball America\u2019s excellent Executive database.\u00a0 Scout.com\u2019s Kiley McDaniel ranked the GMs by job security in Jan 2014. \u00a0 Buster Olney posted a \u201cPeer Review\u201d of GMs back in 2010, but its mostly obsolete with all the movement since.\u00a0 Still somewhat interesting to hear what GMs are saying about each other anonymously., 112891=Justin Verlander is one of the most important home-grown players in the 2012 playoffs. Photo unk via rumorsandrants.com, 2030=I\u2019ve had a draft version of a \u201cGM Rankings\u201d post written for nearly three years.\u00a0 Why so long?\u00a0 Because I started the post, got distracted, and then no less than seven general manager positions were filled/replaced in two very hectic weeks following the end of the 2011 season.\u00a0 There\u2019s no way you can judge how well a GM has done with just a few months on the job, so there was no point in trying to rank the GMs when a quarter of them were un-rankable., 103184=November 21st, 2012 at 10:59 am, 32535=24. Dan O\u2019Dowd/Bill Geivett, Colorado Rockies. \u00a0\u00a0The Rockies have a very unique front-office structure right now, resulting from an August 2012 shake-up that left industry insiders questioning the roles and the message coming from the team. \u00a0 Nonetheless, the direction of the Rockies leaves something to be desired. \u00a0 They\u2019ve drifted on the field, employed questionable starting pitching usage strategies, and generally are treading water. \u00a0Their farm system is starting to look up though; will that be enough to compete in a division with the Dodgers?, 76960=A: I hope you mean righty hitter only; he is a career .220 lefty hitter but .262 righty. If I was the Nats brass, i\u2019d try him as a righty-only guy. \u00a0But by all accounts\u00a0Danny Espinosa is a bit stubborn and may not be open to limiting a unique skill that he may continue to think distinguishes himself from other competitors. \u00a0I continue to wonder just how hurt he was last year \u2026 as others have said, it isn\u2019t like Espinosa suddenly forgot how to hit. \u00a0Yes he was always somewhat limited as a player, but 20-homer capable middle infielders don\u2019t grow on trees. \u00a0Boswell says the team isn\u2019t messing with Espinosa, and that they want to see what he can do in 2014. \u00a0Fair enough., 200028=January 11th, 2012 at 10:22 am, 86712=Lets take a quick look at the Nationals representatives on WBC teams from the past, talk about whether its really in the best interests of the team to even let these guys play, and then\u00a0talk about who may be candidates for the 2013 WBC regardless., 25293=16. Ned Colletti, Los Angeles Dodgers. \u00a0Seriously, how do you judge the job Colletti is doing right now? \u00a0 His team\u2019s payroll went from $95M in 2012 to more than $216M in 2013. \u00a0He\u2019s got $57M tied up in three outfielders not named\u00a0Yasiel Puig right now. \u00a0 You almost got the impression that Colletti called up Boston and just said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll take every sh*tty contract off your hands right now \u2026 i\u2019ve got money to spend and I don\u2019t care how we spend it!\u201d \u00a0On the bright side, somehow the Dodgers have kept a reasonable ranking with their farm system throughout all of this, but the skill involved with paying everyone on your team $20M/year is close to nil. \u00a0As with Cashman, I wonder if Colletti is ranked too high even here., 24305=15. Dave Dombrowski, Detroit Tigers. \u00a0Lots of on-field success thanks to Dombrowski sticking to his plan; he took over the year the Tigers lost 119 games. \u00a0 It is worth noting that 3 years later they were in the world series. \u00a0Now he\u2019s gotten them into the playoffs three years running, to which he\u2019s due plenty of credit. \u00a0But his farm system has hit rock bottom, he\u2019s spending a ton of money, and he\u2019s making very questionable moves. \u00a0The industry panned his\u00a0Doug Fister move (even if it seemed to greatly benefit the Nats) and people questioned his\u00a0Prince Fielder for\u00a0Ian Kinsler move. \u00a0They were weird moves for a \u201cwin now\u201d team. \u00a0Perhaps I should give Dombrowski more credit, but his 2013-14 off-season knocked him down a number of pegs for me. \u00a0If they miss out on the playoffs to an up-and-coming Royals team, he\u2019ll suddenly be on the hot-seat., 27348=18.\u00a0Terry Ryan, Minnesota Twins. \u00a0Ryan has been with Minnesota for-ever; hired in 1994. \u00a0He stepped aside and then was re-hired in 2011, and is now in a rebuilding phase. \u00a0The team let go one of its faces of the franchise last off season (Justin Morneau) and is going to begin a big youth movement this year. \u00a0They\u2019re going to be bad, but perhaps not Houston bad thanks to a couple of (odd?) starting pitcher signings. \u00a0Help is coming; Ryan has built on of the best farm systems in the game and it features two of the top 5 prospects out there (Byron Buxton and\u00a0Miguel Sano). \u00a0 Perhaps it isn\u2019t fair to rank Ryan here with Luhnow higher, but Ryan was partly responsible for the downfall of this team and the abhorrent starting rotation of last year. \u00a0But once their MVP-grade talents arrive at the majors, Ryan\u2019s work of rebuilding the farm system should be rewarded., 226837=BA\u2019s Jim Callis\u2019 top 10 Nats prospects (the comments are his\u2019) 1. Bryce Harper, of: Has monster power, though he won\u2019t match Strasburg\u2019s immediate impact. 2. Wilson Ramos, c: Matt Capps trade freed Ramos from being blocked by Joe Mauer with Twins. 3. Derek Norris, c: Still needs to polish bat and defense, but he has power and on-base ability. 4. A.J. Cole, rhp: First-round stuff earned him $2 million as a fourth-rounder. 5. Sammy Solis, lhp: Don\u2019t be surprised if the $1 million second-rounder outperforms Cole. 6. Danny Espinosa, ss: Solid defender has cannon arm and surprising pop (40 HR in 2009-10). 7. Chris Marrero, 1b: Best proven all-around bat in system, though little defensive value. 8. Brad Peacock, rhp: Runs his fastball up to 95, flashes solid knuckle-curve and changeup. 9. Michael Burgess, of: Power potential remains impressive, but will he make enough contact? 10. Yunesky Maya, rhp: Former Cuban national team ace got $8 million big league contract., 198943=Q: Does Fielder make sense if the Nats are planning on building a cost-controlled dynasty?\u00a0 The 1998 yankees didn\u2019t have any 30-homer players, let alone a big bopper at $25M/year., 132191=October 19th, 2012 at 11:48 am, 240070=I still see him focusing on the NL.\u00a0 Based on this \u2026 Dunn seems like he may have options in the NL, which means our chances of having him accept a 3 year deal with us less likely.\u00a0 Not good news for us in 2011., 78705=A: Yeah probably. \u00a0That\u2019s why you change managers; to change the message. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to disparage\u00a0Davey Johnson too much here other than to say what i\u2019ve said before; the team needed a new voice. \u00a0Boswell points out that Johnson\u2019s 2012 job was fantastic and that there\u2019s \u201cdifferent jockeys for different horses.\u201d I like that analogy., 219094=November 7th, 2010 at 9:35 am, 87780=The tournament was marred for the team by a blown UCL ligament to Ayala, who had undergone elbow surgery earlier in the off-season but pitched for his home country anyway. \u00a0The team did not want Ayala to participate in the inaugural event, did not want him used by the Mexican team, and team officials were \u201clivid\u201d by the injury, which cost Ayala the season and cost the team its 8th inning setup guy. \u00a0Ayala recovered to pitch again in 2008 but was never as effective, and was shipped out in 2009 for a PTBNL. \u00a0Coincidentally, I suspect the team still harbors some ill-will towards Ayala to this day. \u00a0Meanwhile the other two relievers who participated both experienced regressions in form; Cordero\u2019s ERA nearly doubled (from 1.82 to 3.19) from his breakout 2005 season while Majewski\u2019s numbers dipped slightly before he was traded in the big Cincinnati deal of 2006., 37968=29. Ruben Amaro, Philadelphia Phillies. \u00a0I\u2019ll admit that i\u2019m probably biased here. \u00a0While i\u2019ve given credit to other GMs whose teams have had success in the past several years, i\u2019ve not given Amaro the same benefit of the doubt. \u00a0And that basically comes down to several, clear facts; Amaro has destroyed the Phillies with multiple long-term deals for declining players, most notably\u00a0Ryan Howard\u2018s contract (widely considered the worst dollar for dollar contract in the game). \u00a0His team 3rd highest payroll in 2013 and nearly lost 90 games. \u00a0His recent FA moves have been laughable (Delmon Young and\u00a0Michael Young? \u00a0John Lannan as his sole pitching move last off-season? \u00a0His ridiculous contract extension for\u00a0Carlos Ruiz this past off-season?). \u00a0His heels-in-the-ground obstinant refusal to adopt any understanding or acceptance for analytics or modern statistical approach to his job makes me wonder just how asleep at the wheel his owner is. \u00a0He\u2019s let his farm system lapse while his on-the-field product falters. \u00a0He puts out mixed messages in regards to his direction (Cliff Lee mentioned in trade rumors? \u00a0Are the Phillies going to rebuild or not?). \u00a0But the coup-de-grace for me is the news that just came out that Amaro\u2019s organization has purposely attempted to sabotage college kids who spurned the Phillies last summer, ratting them out to the NCAA out of pettiness, spite or vengeance. \u00a0 Despite their WS win and appearances in the last 6 years, I cannot for the life of me figure out why Amaro still has a job at this point., 179509=All these teams seem to be pretty self-explanatory.\u00a0 Maybe Arizona gets into the market, but they\u2019ve gone to great pains to lose payroll, paring it down to just $56M last year while somehow winning the division.\u00a0 Their highest paid player in 2011 was just $5.8M.\u00a0 A $25M/year guy doesn\u2019t fit with their team., 139220=Below are my round-by-round picks. \u00a0Yahoo O-Ranks are given; this is Yahoo\u2019s rank for the player for the 2012 season. \u00a0Average Draft Rank (ADR) is listed as per MockDraftCentral\u2019s ratings, though honestly after the Holds guys start going off the board the ADR is mostly useless. \u00a0Plus ADR reports are based on the classic 5\u00d75 league, not the 6\u00d76 league that we\u2019re doing. \u00a0 But it does illustrate some of the over-drafts and/or value picks I got., 10474=4. Jon Daniels, Texas Rangers.\u00a0 Texas made the 2010 World Series with the 27th highest payroll in the major leagues.\u00a0 That in and among itself is enough to earn Daniels his street cred.\u00a0 However, his 2013 payroll had ballooned to $125M and they got unlucky by missing out on the playoffs by one game in 2013.\u00a0 Otherwise two World Series trips in four years is still nothing to shake a stick at, and the fact that they didn\u2019t win game 6 of the 2011 World Series still amazes me.\u00a0 Daniels\u2019 reputation is on the line though in a big way; his moves for Prince Fielder, for Shin-Soo Choo and for Alex Rios will be tested in 2014.\u00a0 The team will need everything it can get out of its (mostly) home grown rotation thanks to unfortunate injuries already suffered this year (Derek Holland tripping over his own dog).\u00a0 I give Daniels a ton of credit for accomplishing what he did with a $65M payroll; can he continue to do it with a $130M payroll?\u00a0 The bar only gets higher., 33301=25. Alex Anthopolous, Toronto Blue Jays. Anthopolous took over for the maligned JP Ricciardi after the 2009 season.\u00a0 In the time since, he traded Roy Halladay, acquired Morrow, traded for Escobar and Jo-Jo Reyes, acquired Rajai Davis, and perhaps most impressively offloaded the albatross contract for Vernon Wells.\u00a0 He had an 85-win team in the hardest division in baseball with a 70M payroll for 2011. \u00a0Then he went for it, emptying the farm system (which was one of the league\u2019s best in 2011) to acquire the likes of\u00a0R.A. Dickey and the whole slew of ex-Marlins. \u00a0Now he\u2019s got a massive payroll, an underperforming team and empty cupboards in the minors. \u00a0All the good work he did to prepare Toronto for battle in the AL east has gone for naught unless last year was just a big huge adjustment period for all these newly acquired veterans., 236294=Unless the entire 2010 season was just a charade and we plan on signing him anyway.\u00a0 Per Boswell there\u2019s a 3-year deal on the table now.\u00a0 But if you\u2019re Dunn, you HAVE\u00a0 to see what is out there right now, right?, 92402=Who from the Nationals franchise may make a 2013 WBC roster? \u00a0First off, thanks to James Wagner\u2018s 11/15/12 NatsJournal post we already know of three WBC participants; Solano\u00a0is on the Columbian team, minor leaguer Jimmy Van Ostrand is on the Canadian team, and A-ball catcher Adrian Nieto is on the Spanish team. \u00a0Curacao qualifies to play with the Netherlands, and I\u2019d guess that Bernadina would make a great choice considering the lack of Dutch players in baseball (Baseball Continuum\u2019s projections agree. \u00a0And as of 12/4/12 he\u2019s officially been listed as a Netherlands participant).. Venezuela is already qualified for the main draw and has a relatively strong possible team. \u00a0The Baseball Continuum blog posted an early projection of the Venezuelan team and listed Flores as a likely participant (specifically mentioning that Ramos wasn\u2019t considered due to injury recovery; I\u2019d suspect these two players to switch based on Ramos\u2019 recovery and Flores\u2019 awful 2012). \u00a0 If Henry Rodriguez was healthy i\u2019d guess he would be on that list too, but his season-ending surgery probably precludes his participation. \u00a0The Dominican Republic has perhaps the strongest depth and has no need for the recently called up Perez among its outfield depth. \u00a0Maya\u2019s defection eliminates him from discussion for the Cuban team. \u00a0(12/4/12 update): Chien-Ming Wang has been announced as a member of Chinese Taipei\u2019s team (for the purposes of this article I investigated all 2012 Nats)., 240484=October 6th, 2010 at 1:53 pm, 31745=23. Dan Duquette, Baltimore Orioles. \u00a0Duquette has had an odd off-season; his owner 86\u2019d two of his signings thanks to questioning the \u201cmedicals,\u201d which insiders point out is\u00a0Peter Angelos\u2018 method of nixing deals he doesn\u2019t like. \u00a0Must be frustrating. \u00a0Instead Duquette is now signing every re-tread FA who can\u2019t find a job thanks to the CBA\u2019s draft pick compensation issues, punting draft pick after draft pick. \u00a0The O\u2019s did make the playoffs in 2012, thanks to an unsustainable record in one-run games, and have had a decent run of success out of their farm system (Manny Machado\u00a0should be mentioned in the same breath as Trout and Harper frankly), but are they on the right track to get back?, 79530=February 19th, 2014 at 8:18 am, 231532=October 21st, 2010 at 3:32 pm, 136869=Last year we had Losses as a category instead of Holds but too many of the league hated the Losses category, but wanted to keep OPS as a 6th category. \u00a0So we\u2019ve introduced Holds as a category for the 2012 season. \u00a0I proposed this but rather inadvertantly; my strategy going into this 2012 season was going to be to go after the exact type of pitcher who normally gets holds; the setup-guy, the excellent specialized reliever who pitchers 60-70 innings but gets 70-80 K\u2019s with excellent ERAs and WHIPs. \u00a0With no Losses to worry about, the value of holding any type of pitcher increased over last year\u2019s edition of the league. The only downside was that we are also introducing a transaction limit for the season (65 over the 21 week season). \u00a0So picking good arms early will be crucial., 76327=A: Also borrowing from my Dec 2013 post, I\u2019ll go with Ohlendorf and Roark. \u00a0Ohlendorf as the long-man, spot starter rubber arm guy. \u00a0Roark with the hope he continues his magical run of exceptional command and fearless relief. \u00a0I know that only leaves on lefty out there, and leaves guys like Ryan Mattheus and\u00a0Christian Garcia in AAA. \u00a0Hey, I could be wrong.\u00a0 \u00a0Boswell doesn\u2019t seem to guess., 72397=A: Yes and yes. \u00a0McCann is a \u00a0huge loss. \u00a0Tim Hudson may not \u201cseem\u201d like a loss given the Braves pitching depth, but he was their opening day starter in 2013 and was their bulldog staff leader (if not an \u201cace\u201d in the literal sense of the word). \u00a0 They also let go\u00a0Paul Maholm, who gave them a ton of decent innings last year. \u00a0They\u2019re depending on\u00a0Brandon Beachy to come back healthy and on the rest of their young rotation to contribute. \u00a0Otherwise they did little this off-season other than extending a couple of guys. \u00a0 As far as\u00a0BJ Upton, what choice do they have but to run him out day after day at this point? \u00a0Same as\u00a0Dan Uggla: those two guys are getting paid a ton of money and will be given every chance to prove themselves. \u00a0Boswell agrees., 19480=11.\u00a0Brian Sabean, San Francisco Giants.\u00a0 Sabean is the longest tenured GM in the game, is unabashedly \u201cold school\u201d and is consistently mocked for his signings and moves.\u00a0 I thought his\u00a0Tim Lincecum\u00a0deal was ridiculous, I couldn\u2019t believe the amount of money they guaranteed\u00a0Hunter Pence, and more than a few people are questioning the\u00a0Michael Morse\u00a0deal.\u00a0\u00a0 San Francisco\u2019s farm system is weak and has been for years (after contributing MVPs and Cy Young winners, it should be said). \u00a0 To all these naysayers I say this: Two World Series titles in the last four years.\u00a0 The goal of every team is to win the title, and his teams have done it twice in four years.\u00a0 The Yankees have one title in the last 15\u00a0 years.\u00a0 So you have to give Sabean some credit.\u00a0 11th seems about right.\u00a0 Not too high, not too low. \u00a0He\u2019d have been much higher had his team not imploded in 2013., 237493=LA: James Loney: cost contained and home grown.\u00a0 plus no FA $$ spent until ownership divorce settled. SD: Adrian Gonzalez SF; Aubrey Huff: a FA and SF desperately needs hitters. Col: Todd Helton; not the greatest hitter anymore but signed through 2013. Ariz: Adam LaRoche who is a FA but I sense Ariz is rebuilding and not FA buyers, 90525=Now, which Nats may play for the 2013 teams? \u00a0First off, looking at the Nationals 40-man roster, we have become an amazingly heavy USA-born team (we\u2019ll get to non-40man roster players in a moment). Thanks to the Nats big board resource (originated by Brian Oliver and now maintained by \u201cSpringfieldFan\u201d), which has the country of origin for players, here\u2019s a breakdown of the home-country of our current 36 active (as of November 15th, 2012) roster players:, 182983=January 12th, 2012 at 9:30 am, 191257=Q: Baseball is set to announce their HOf inductees for 2012 today. Anyone you feel strongly about that should get in? What are your thoughts on Dale Murphy and Don Mattingly?, 226098=Matt Kemp apparently is irritated with his club\u2019s management, leading to spurrious trade rumors.\u00a0 But Kemp is even further away from free agency than Greinke, currently on a 2 year deal and then facing one more arbitration year before being cut loose by 2013., 16220=8. Frank Wren, Atlanta Braves.\u00a0 A couple years ago you would probably have Wren ranked in the middle of the pack at best.\u00a0 He clearly botched both ends of the Mark Teixeira deals, essentially turning Texas regulars Elvis Andrus, Neftali Feliz, Matt Harrison and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia into a year of Teixeira and Casey Kotchman.\u00a0 Imagine how good Atlanta would be right now if they still had the 3 core members that remain in Texas.\u00a0 That being said, you cannot argue with where the Braves have been going.\u00a0 With middle-of-the-road payrolls and an awful TV deal the Braves have a team with a lot of home-grown talent that won the NL East by 10 games last year.\u00a0 His rotation is young and home-grown (Minor, Beachy, Medlen, Teheran), his team full of home-grown talent (with Freeman, Heyward and Simmons leading the way).\u00a0 And they have the best bullpen in the game.\u00a0 On the down-side, there are questions about some of his recent signings (BJ Upton and Uggla in particular), the farm system hasn\u2019t quite come back from its 2010 rankings (thanks to so much of the talent it generated), and I\u2019m not sure anyone really likes Atlanta\u2019s 2013 off-season.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll give Wren credit for the past few years and indicate a note of caution going forward., 44370=February 26th, 2014 at 8:03 am, 60760=As for the Yankees chances in 2014 in general, check out their\u00a0current depth chart: Their rotation is set to be\u00a0Sabathia (coming off an awful year), 40-yr old\u00a0Kuroda, Tanaka,\u00a0Ivan Nova and\u00a0David Phelps. \u00a0Does that sound like a 95-win rotation? \u00a0 Here\u2019s their infield: Mark Teixeira (15 games last year), Brian Roberts (77 games last year),\u00a0Derek Jeter (17 games last year), and\u00a0Eduardo Nunez (90 games last year). \u00a0 Does that infield inspire confidence? \u00a0What makes anyone think that infield is lasting even a quarter of the season without a major injury? \u00a0Plus,\u00a0Buster Olney or Jayson Stark recently\u00a0mentioned this factoid: \u00a0\u201cNo team has ever in the history of the game had a winning season starting a shortstop as old as Jeter.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0Yes the Yankees made some significant signings (Beltran, Ellsbury, McCann). \u00a0But I don\u2019t think its enough to make up for what\u2019s going to happen to their infield. \u00a0I think years of overpaying for FAs and being unlucky in their player development has caught up with the Yankees in a big way and they\u2019ll be lucky to be a .500 team this year. \u00a0Boswell points out that PECOTA has them as 82-80. \u00a0 And then he drops a scary subtle hint saying that\u00a0Ian Desmond has already declined an $85M deal and may have his sights on becoming the next Yankees long-term shortstop. \u00a0Ouch. \u00a0Thankfully the timing doesn\u2019t quite work out; Jeter retires after this year and the Nats have Desmond locked up for two seasons., 94644=Which leaves our large contingent of American players. \u00a0A couple of writers have started postulating on these rosters (David Schoenfield\u2018s very early guess as to a potential USA roster is here, Baseball Continuum\u2019s latest\u00a0projection is here). \u00a0So using these two posts as a starting point, lets go position-by-position and give some thoughts as to who may get some consideration. \u00a0Keep in mind the WBC rosters are generally very reliever heavy, since no starter is going to be \u201callowed\u201d to pitch a complete game in March., 6851=1. John Mozeliak, St. Louis. \u00a0 What more can you say about the model franchise of baseball and its leader/architect?\u00a0\u00a0 The #1 farm system last year, a huge percentage of its players home-grown, in the playoffs three of the last four years, a win and a runner-up in that time, and all while maintaining a payroll outside the top 10 in the league.\u00a0 This team survived the FA loss of the game\u2019s best player (Albert Pujols) by returning to the playoffs the subsequent year and leading the league in wins in 2013.\u00a0 Can\u2019t ask for much more than that. \u00a0Mozeliak is my choice for the best GM in the game over two other more famous candidates in the elite category., 225227=Zach Greinke is under contract to KC through 2012, has a limited no-trade clause and will probably cost (by various accounts) at least two young MLBers plus one or more additional prospects.\u00a0 I use the Roy Halladay-to the Phillies deal as a comparison.\u00a0 Halladay still had an entire year on the contract and Philly had to give up two high end prospects plus a third good young player in Kyle Drabek. \u00a0 If Greinke was in the last year of his contract (ala Cliff Lee this year) the price would be far less (indeed, the Rangers gave up their #1 prospect Justin Smoak but the other players were lesser ranked prospects)., 57738=A: I\u2019ll take the easy way out on this one: I\u2019ll say that the rookies are most likely to benefit and the veterans are least-likely. \u00a0But that\u2019s probably not very fair because it assumes that our vets will automatically have a hard time adjusting to a new voice. \u00a0In reality,\u00a0Matt Williams\u2018 pedigree as a player is going to shut just about any veteran up; name one player on this team who has accomplished anything close to what Williams did as a player? \u00a0 I mean, we\u2019re talking about a guy with multiple All Star appearances, multiple Gold Gloves, multiple Silver Sluggers, a couple near MVP seasons, more than 200 post-season at-bats spread across 5 post-season trips, three trips to the World Series and one ring. \u00a0He also played in two specific games that are both counted among the best games of the last 50 years (Game 7 of the 1997 World Series and 2001\u2019s Game 7 of the World Series)., 2513=Well, now we\u2019re two plus years onwards from October 2011, each of those seven new GMs has had two seasons and three off-seasons to show their vision, and I think its time to revisit my rankings., 230657=Now, think about how we\u2019d possibly look 2 years from now at the beginning of 2012.\u00a0 Harper has torn through a year in the minors, Solis has made\u00a0 his mlb debut and looks like the 2nd coming of Madison Bumgarner.\u00a0 Strasburg looks great in rehab starts in Florida and in Potomac.\u00a0 Espinosa and Desmond are settled in to their roles, Zimmermann has bounced fully back from TJ surgery and looks great, and we\u2019ve added an outfield bat to augment what we had in 2009.\u00a0 That\u2019s an enticing story, a good young up and coming team that should be able to attract a serious FA starter to augment what is already here., 26103=17.\u00a0Dayton Moore, Kansas City Royals. \u00a0 Other mid-market teams (Oakland, Tampa, Pittsburgh) have shown a ton more accomplishment on the field than Kansas City; why hasn\u2019t Moore\u2019s teams done better? \u00a0He\u2019s been in his job nearly 8 seasons and the team spun its wheels for seven of them. \u00a0Signings that didn\u2019t pay off and fizzled farm system talents defined this team for years. \u00a0Finally Moore went all-in, trading the best prospect in the game (Wil Myers) for a package of pitchers to help the Royals get over the hump. \u00a0 Between 2012 and 2013 they added $21M in payroll and these players and gained 14 games in the win column; just enough for \u2026 3rd place. \u00a0 The industry entirely believes Moore was fleeced by Tampa Bay, and the trade looked so bad at the time that pundits wondered if Moore wasn\u2019t getting some pressure from above to \u201cwin more now or get canned.\u201d \u00a0But it didn\u2019t take Myers but the next season to win the rookie of the year award, and he may be a player that Kansas City fans rue for a generation. \u00a0I think Moore may not be long for the job, and with good reason; why hasn\u2019t he been able to win when guys like Huntington and Beane have?, 74498=Why am I predicting Detwiler will win the rotation spot? \u00a0Partly because of options (Detwiler has none while Roark, Ohlendorf and Jordan all do), but partly because I\u2019ve sort of come back around on him after looking more closely at his 2013 season. \u00a0He had a decent to good 2012; he posted a 118 ERA+ and even if his advanced FIP/SIERA didn\u2019t indicate he was quite that good, he was still more than a servicable 5th starter. \u00a0Then in his first seven 2013 starts he was also very good (he had a 2.53 ERA in his first 7 starts and 42 2/3 innings \u2026 he got hurt in his 8th start). \u00a0The rest of his season was a mess, with him fighting injury and ballooning his seasonal ERA from 2.53 to more than 4.00 in five more starts. \u00a0 If he comes back healthy to start 2014, why wouldn\u2019t we expect more of the same performance that he had at the start of 2013? \u00a0For these reasons, I think Detwiler breaks camp as the 5th starter., 206979=The first round draft order for 2011 goes like this, thanks to mlbtraderumors.com, 67466=A: All reports list Christian Garcia\u00a0as (finally) healthy. \u00a0But its telling that the team is already specifically pointing out that \u201che\u2019s made it further than he did last year.\u201d \u00a0It seems like his fragility is almost a running joke on the team now. \u00a0Chances of breaking into the 7-man bullpen? \u00a0Remote unless there\u2019s injuries. \u00a0But if he goes to AAA and pitches lights out, he\u2019ll be first guy back. \u00a0 If he stays healthy (four words that should be attached to every single sentence ever written about Garcia). \u00a0Boswell says that if he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s on the team. \u00a0I have a very hard time believing that; who makes way? \u00a0Not Soriano, Storen, Clippard or Stammen. \u00a0Not Blevins. \u00a0Ohlendorf? \u00a0Roark? \u00a0Roark\u2019s numbers last fall were *better* than anything Garcia did in 2012 and in 4 times the innings. \u00a0Ohlendorf isn\u2019t being paid north of $1M to screw around in upstate New York. \u00a0And, none of this takes into account the statements from Williams about liking to have two lefties in the bullpen\u2026 If it were me, I\u2019d want to see Garcia pitch at least a month straight without hurting something on his person. \u00a0, 85916=Harper makes perfect sense to represent the US in 2013 WBC. Photo GQ magazine Mar 2012, 74265=A: Ross Emery Detwiler, for the same reasons I pointed out in my 2014 Staff Projections post in late december. \u00a0 Quoting myself from that post:, 14186=7. Mike Rizzo, Washington Nationals.\u00a0 Rizzo took over for the disgraced Jim Bowden in March of 2009 and had quite a job ahead of him.\u00a0 The team on the field was on their way towards losing 100 games for the second year in a row and the farm system was dead last in the majors.\u00a0 What has Rizzo done since?\u00a0 The team improved 30 games in the win column between 2010 and 2012, the farm system was considered the best in the game just two years on from Rizzo\u2019s hiring (it should be said, thanks to two straight #1 overall picks resulting in two of the most dynamic players in the last 20 years being available to us),\u00a0and now has two drafts and two off-seasons worth of work under his belt. \u00a0He has brought a new mind-set to the draft, focusing on quick-to-the-majors college arms instead of nebulous tools-y high school players.\u00a0 He also has managed to work with the sport\u2019s most notorious agent (Scott Boras) and successfully handled the two most high-profile draftees (arguably) in the history of the game.\u00a0 He has completely re-made the Nats roster in the past two years (only 3 members of the opening day roster 2009 team are still with the franchise). \u00a0 I\u2019ve questioned his roster construction at times, feeling like he over-emphasized defenders at the expense of offense (running Michael Morse and\u00a0Josh Willingham out of town), and he obsessed over a leadoff/CF type until he got one (Denard Span, trading away our best starting pitching prospect at the time), but a 98-win season smooths over a lot of criticism. \u00a0Other pundits place Rizzo even higher than I have; 7th seems like a good spot to be until we see if this team can get back to the playoffs. \u00a0 If the Nats falter again in 2014 and don\u2019t achieve something in this \u201cwindow,\u201d Rizzo\u2019s tenure and the 2012 season may be viewed simply as an aberration instead of a well built team., 31132=22. Michael Hill, Miami Marlins. \u00a0The one huge caveat that goes with the Miami GM job is this:\u00a0Jeffrey Loria is probably the most hands on owner in the game, and you almost can\u2019t judge this GM\u2019s ability based on who is calling the shots. \u00a0The only other owner who seems to have as much pull is, ironically, ranked next. \u00a0 Miami loaded up for 2012 in their new stadium and had completely dismantled things before August. \u00a0Now they\u2019re a $50M payroll team with some superstar prospects .. but a middling farm system and questionable direction., 95425=(Note: I\u2019m still considering our Free Agents as \u201cNats players\u201d for the purposes of this analysis, since this really goes position by position from our 2012 team to find candidates)., 90018=This begs the question; do we even WANT our pitchers playing on this team? \u00a0The first two WBCs have shown pretty distinctly that our pitchers have regressed greatly after playing. \u00a0This only makes sense: the spring training routines are greatly impacted to play in this event. \u00a0We may see a ton of front-office resistance to specific guys (especially those coming off injury) playing in the 2013 event. \u00a0Which could affect the eligibility of some specific players for 2013., 88929=In 2009, the team had 5 participants:, 9098=3. Billy Beane, Oakland.\u00a0\u00a0 The league\u2019s 2nd longest tenured GM is likely to retire as its longest, since he owns a stake in the team and has re-made his approach to building teams in the last couple of years to great success.\u00a0 This ownership stake affords Beane the job security that he wouldn\u2019t have otherwise, and has afforded him the time he needed to find his next \u201cmarket inefficiency.\u201d\u00a0 After some lean years following the \u201cMoneyball\u201d period in the mid 2000s, Beane has turned the A\u2019s into a two-time defending AL West defending champion (a division with two of the most profligate spending teams in the game).\u00a0 His new team-building method seems to be around wheeling-and-dealing, and he\u2019s been good at it.\u00a0 He turned over a significant amount of his 2012 team and won even more games in 2013.\u00a0\u00a0 The ding on Beane may be his farm system; Oakland has struggled to develop players lately and some may argue that Beane\u2019s ranking should be slightly lower as a result.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say this though; being successful in the league when routinely putting out payrolls in the $55M-$60M range (where his 2012 and 2013 teams sat) by default makes you one of the best in my book. \u00a0, 192702=A: Sounds great.\u00a0 Except that this scenario really only serves the perfect world desires of the Nationals.\u00a0 In reality LaRoche is a slow starter and we may really hear the boo-birds early.\u00a0 Morse was great in 2011 but most predict a sliding back.\u00a0 Harper probably needs some MLB adjustment time.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 Boswell likes this scenario. Sure, who wouldn\u2019t?\u00a0 But it does sound a bit too convenient., 89347=The WBC seemed to energize particularly Dunn, who enjoyed playing in a post-season atmosphere for the first (and only) time in his career. \u00a0Nobody suffered any injuries, but Hanrahan in particular may have been affected by his lack of a proper spring training; he posted a 7.71 ERA for the team while losing the closer spot and was shipped to Pittsburgh. \u00a0Ironically, Rivera also experienced a huge regression of form, going from a 3.96 ERA in 2008 to a 6.10 ERA in 2009 and was eventually released., 137927=My draft strategy for 2012 is as follows:, 1319=I was listening to a baseball podcast this past week about General Managers in baseball and heard an interesting fact; it has now been more than two years since an MLB General Manager has been fired.\u00a0 Sure enough, the last GM fired\u00a0was Houston\u2019s Ed Wade in November of 2011.\u00a0 There is a GM with less service time (Rick Hahn of the White Sox), but he rose to take over the job for long time GM Kenny Williams, who was promoted to executive VP of the team. \u00a0So all in all there\u2019s been decent stability among baseball executives in the shorter term.}", "textBeforeTable": "Here is the summary of roster construction and \u201cConstruction Strategy Category\u201d that we\u2019ll talk about next.\u00a0 Note that I only count the \u201ccore players\u201d on a team for this analysis.\u00a0 The core players is defined as the 5-man starting rotation, the setup and closer, the 8 out-field players, and the DH for AL teams.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t extend this all the way to the 25-man roster, figuring that these core 15 players are the main reasons teams win and advance.\u00a0 That and huge chunks of the bullpen and the bench are either fill-in FAs or draftees and it would skew the analysis of how teams really got to the playoffs.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the summary (the table is sorted by count of Draftees): Free Agent: The player was acquired in free agency.\u00a0 This category also includes two other types of acquisitions: waiver claims and cash purchases.\u00a0 These three categories are lumped together since all three indicate that a team has acquired a player with zero outlay in terms of development or prospects.\u00a0 Examples for the Nats: Edwin Jackson, Adam LaRoche. Traded Prospects: The player was acquired by the team by virtue of trading prospects.\u00a0 This is essentially the reverse of #2.\u00a0 The Nats key example is Gio Gonzalez. Traded MLBers: The player was acquired by the team by virtue of trading an established MLB player.\u00a0 Most of the time these days, this means the player was acquired as a prospect (since most trades seem to be of the prospect-for-established player kind).\u00a0 Example", "textAfterTable": "So, what are the four construction methods I\u2019ve identified? Again borrowing from last year\u2019s version of this post, they are (with this year\u2019s examples).\u00a0 The complication this year is that some of the 10 playoff teams don\u2019t fall neatly into one specific category. Method #1: Build from within 100%: (Cincinnati, Atlanta).\u00a0\u00a0 Atlanta, amazingly, didn\u2019t use a single Free Agent among its core 15 this year.\u00a0 They made a couple of key trades to acquire a few starters, but the rest of their lineup is home-grown draftees.\u00a0 That may change next year as they try to replace Chipper Jones, Michael Bourn and possibly Brian McCann, who may leave via free agency.\u00a0 Meanwhile Cincinnati has just a couple of free agents and mostly rely on guys they\u2019ve grown as well. Method #2: Ride your developed Core and use your prospects to acquire big names: (Washington, San Francisco and Detroit to an extent): The Nats have transformed themselves over just a couple of seasons, relying less on FAs to plug holes caused by an awful farm system to having most of their core team developed at home (See the table further below to follow the transformation of our team over the past few seasons). \u00a0Those spots they couldn\u2019t depend on have been filled by trades (three guys acquired by flipping prospects for them; in addition to Gonzalez Kurt Suzuki and Tyler Clippard also count here).\u00a0 San Francisco has seen their payroll skyrocket as they extend their home-grown talent, but for the most", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
