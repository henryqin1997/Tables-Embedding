But much like Dawson, Harris is at his best when he\ufffds slashing to the basket, attacking the offensive boards, and getting out in the open court, all of which he expects to do this season. Finally. \ufffdI think we should be a team that can run, run, run and run,\ufffd Izzo said. But it\ufffds at the offensive end \ufffd and in transition \ufffd that a healthy Harris, along with a more-confident Branden Dawson, now 18 months removed from his torn ACL, where the Spartans should get the biggest boost. Izzo jokes about NBA scouts telling him Harris is \ufffdillegal\ufffd and \ufffdun-American\ufffd because he\ufffds a shooting guard that\ufffds also an elite defender. He calls his backcourt tandem of Keith Appling and Harris the \ufffdtwo best defensive guards in the country.\ufffd An ankle injury suffered in late August held him back earlier this fall, but Harris is back practicing now and says he\ufffds feeling great, from head to toe. \ufffdBut I think you\ufffdll see a different Gary this year.
