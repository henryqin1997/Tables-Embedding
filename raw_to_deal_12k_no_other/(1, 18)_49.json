Then I was stuck behind Milka, and it was the second timed lap on the tires, which is the best lap over the life of the tire. It ended up costing us our second and third timed laps. For sure, there was more in the Formula Dream/Panasonic car because even on the last lap, which was a 1:31.1, there was still some left on the table; at least two or three-tenths of a second, which would have been good enough to get us to the next group of qualifying.

We'll focus on tomorrow and see if we can get it done.\" (About qualifying): \"It was hard. I was on it. I haven't driven so hard, because I haven't had such an advantage here.
