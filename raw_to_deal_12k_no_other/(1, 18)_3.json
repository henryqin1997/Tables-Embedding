According to Cot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baseball Contracts at BaseballProspectus.com, the Yankees have contractual commitments to 14 players worth $189,475,000. That includes Kevin Youkilis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new one-year, $12 million contract and the $8.5 million they still owe A.J. Burnett., 352651=W: Projected final 2012 wins L: Projected final 2012 losses Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 954573=Hoping to avoid their first 0-4 start since 1973, the Yankees rode seven solid innings from Nova, who outpitched Baltimore counterpart Brian Matusz and washed away the remnants of an unsuccessful spring., 1358259=I don\u2019t particularly find any series previews that focus on what a team did in the preceding full season of much use.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t really matter if a team scored 5.2 runs per game and allowed 4.2 runs per game over the preceding six months.\u00a0 Rosters change, injuries happen, players come and go, talent changes, and player and team performance is often subject to fluctuations that are not predictive.\u00a0 What I want to know is how many runs will the team and roster as currently configured score and allow.\u00a0 Because of that, for these previews I\u2019ll be using projections in lieu of 2011 stats.\u00a0 Despite having my own system in CAIRO, I\u2019m going to use the Hardball Times\u2019s Oliver forecasts since I haven\u2019t had the time to re-run CAIRO for this year.\u00a0 Oliver is updated weekly during the season and includes 2011 MLEs for players who saw time in the minors.\u00a0, 557185=Since seemingly turning the corner with his start on May 6, Phil Hughes has had the occasional bad start.\u00a0 However, until his last two turns in the rotation he\u2019s been able to rebound in the following game.\u00a0 On May 28 he gave up 7 runs in 5.1 innings in Anaheim and followed that up with a complete game four-hitter where allowed just one run in Detroit.\u00a0 He gave up six runs at home against Atlanta on June 28 and followed that up with 8 shutout innings vs. Cleveland.\u00a0 Since May 6, Hughes hadn\u2019t allowed more than three runs in any two consecutive starts until his last two., 1335446=Cabral was taken in them 2010 Rule 5 draft by Tampa Bay before being returned to Boston, so he\u2019s apparently someone who\u2019s interesting as a lefty arm out of the bullpen (where he\u2019s pitched the last two years).\u00a0 His projection isn\u2019t great, but he appears to have decent stuff., 90315=The Yankees have never finished fourth or lower since baseball switched from a two-division format to a three-division format with the advent of the wild card in 1994. The last time the Yankees finished fourth, George Herbert Walker Bush was in the White House \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 1992. That capped a six-season span starting in 1987 in which the Yankees finished fourth or lower every year in the then-seven-team AL East., 1855165=Burnett\u2019s effort ended a string of 10 overall starts against the Red Sox\u2014including nine as a Yankee\u2014dating back to Sept. 19, 2008, taking advantage of a Boston club that continues to fret about their postseason chances., 556954=Saturday, August 18 Jon Lester vs. David Phelps, 1271683=DISCLAIMER: This is very limited in telling us much about how 2012 will play out for a large number of reasons., 89933=The Red Sox and Yankees, who last met on June 2 in the Bronx, are teams going in opposite directions. The Sox have the most wins in baseball at 58-39 and are in first place in the American League East. The Yankees are in fourth place at 51-44, six games back. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closer to last than first, sitting 5\u00c2\u00bd games ahead of the Blue Jays., 654043=Lineups Indians M. Brantley, CF A. Cabrera, SS J. Kipnis, 2B J. Lopez, 3B C. Santana, DH S. Duncan, LF C. Kotchman, 1B L. Marson, C A. Cunningham, RF, 674708=Saturday, June 17 Andy Pettitte (3-2, 2.81 ERA) vs. Jordan Zimmermann (3-5, 2.91 ERA), 1271214=I\u2019m releasing CAIRO 2012 v 0.3 today which mainly fixes a problem with a handful of pitchers like Alexi Ogando and Ross Ohlendorf and moves players to new teams where applicable.\u00a0 I figure it\u2019d be a good time to run some projected standings even though they are too early to be of any real value., 1852002=It was the continuation an almost surreal turn of events over the last few weeks for the Red Sox, who have gone 6-19 in September, losing nine games in the standings over that time., 30125=The Sox underperformed while imploding in 2012 and then overperformed while growing beards (and I imagine eating less chowda than normal) in 2013. What will they do in 2014?, 25571=(Jose) I\u2019d quibble with Bradley\u2019s 2013 as \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\u00a0 He actually played well at Pawtucket after being at Portland the year before.\u00a0 Expectations were unfairly raised for him with the hot spring but I think his season was exactly what you\u2019d want from a prospect of his ilk and track record.\u00a0 I think the \u201cOK bat/great glove\u201d profile is still pretty reasonable for him.\u00a0 Every time I\u2019ve seen him play the defense makes me think of Devon White, he has the same gliding style.\u00a0 Offensively I think .260 with 10-15 HR is probably reasonable (given 550 PA)., 10019=Yankees (57-42) @ Rangers (47-52) , Wednesday July 29, 2015 , 8:05 PM (98 Comments - 7/30/2015 1:21:03 pm), 1273103=Anyway, using the depth charts from the wonderful MLB Depth Charts and includng playing time from players on the 40 man roster who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily figure to be part of the the opening day 25 man rosters to account for organizational depth and playing out next season 100,000 times, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how CAIRO v0.3 sees things as of December 13, 2011.\u00a0 These were run with Aramis Ramirez as a Brewer, but I didn\u2019t remove any of the non-tendered players from yesterday from their rosters., 1271895=1) There are still a lot of roster changes coming.\u00a0 This may give us some sense of how the offseason has impacted teams to this point and it also shows us how things might look if nothing changed from now until April.\u00a0 Which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen., 936939=Tuesday, April 17, 7:05 PM ET Francisco Liriano vs. CC Sabathia, 498381=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 644723=Friday, July 6, 7:10 PM ET Hiroki Kuroda vs. Josh Beckett, 48819=W: Projected final 2014 wins L: Projected final 2014 losses RS: Projected final 2014 runs scored RA: Projected final 2014 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 644990=Saturday, July 7, 7:15 PM ET Freddy Garcia vs. Felix Doubront, 7637=Yankees (57-44) @ White Sox (49-51) , Friday July 31, 2015 , 8:10 PM (56 Comments - 8/1/2015 2:03:16 am), 937097=Wednesday, April 18, 7:05 PM ET Jason Marquis vs. Hiroki Kuroda, 567183=It turns out that those four games for the Rays in Anaheim make the gap between the two teams\u2019 schedules smaller than I thought.\u00a0 We should probably expect the Yankees to go 5-5 over the next 10 games, so hopefully the Rays won\u2019t do much better than that.\u00a0 The Yankees will play the Rays six times in September, and that has the potential to determine the outcome of the AL East, so it behooves the Yankees to maintain as much separation from them as they can., 118363=With all the disclaimers out of the way, on to the projected standings.\u00a0 These are the combined results for all five projection systems.\u00a0 The standings are rounded to the nearest win so if the total W-L doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to 2430-2430 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why., 319916=If you instead think that Gonzalez and Tillman are the guys they were in 2012 it looks like this., 1324086=UPDATE, 10:23 a.m.: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a report from Kansas City that the Royals have traded their pick, LHP Cesar Cabral out of the Red Sox system, to the Yankees., 946052=The Highlanders, commonly called the Yankees but a year away from formally taking on the name, had altered their uniforms nearly every year since their arrival from Baltimore in 1903. This season, they had another new look, sported by 23-year-old Ray Caldwell as he delivered the first pitch of the season., 1122317=If his Yankee career is over after three years, a 34-35 record, and a 4.79 ERA, then we can finally assess Burnett\u2019s place in the Yankee pantheon\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof free agent busts. Before the 2009 season, the Yankees promised Burnett $82.5 million over five years. Various reports indicate that the Pirates could pick up between $10 million and $13 million of the remaining $33 million the Yankees owe Burnett\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning the Yankees will pay Burnett roughly $70 million for a total of 3.4 Wins Above Replacement, a stat that measures a player\u2019s total value over that of a triple-A call-up, according to Baseball-Reference.com., 1012583=I\u2019ve uploaded the final pre-season 2012 CAIRO projections and projected standings.\u00a0 They can be downloaded here., 8448=Yankees (57-43) @ Rangers (48-52) , Thursday July 30, 2015 , 8:05 PM (155 Comments - 7/31/2015 9:25:01 am), 466373=Saturday, September 8, 2012 CC Sabathia, LHP (13-4, 3.42 ERA) vs. Joe Saunders, LHP (1-1, 4.63 ERA), 391531=Congratulations to the Orioles and their fans on their 2012 AL East Championship., 98915=So I think .500 is the benchmark for the rest of this month.\u00a0 If they can go 6-6 I\u2019d consider the rest of July reasonably successful.\u00a0 But if I were a betting man I think 4-8 is more likely., 108139=SS Xander Bogaerts (20) is the cream of the infield crop, showing much improved plate discipline and contact skills in his first full season of AA. The jaw-dropping power that landed him on a bunch of top ten prospects lists is starting to show up too. Bogaerts\u2019 teammate 3B/1B Michael Almanzar (22) has shown signs he\u2019s finally growing into his power swing and is mirroring Bogaerts\u2019 maturing plate approach. One step down the ladder in Hi-A, 3B Garin Cecchini (22) isn\u2019t so much kicking down the door for a promotion as he is just running straight through it, posting a 356/464/588 line (through Wednesday night\u2019s game) with more walks than strikeouts. 2B Sean Coyle (21) and 2B Mookie Betts (20) have posted strong lines thusfar in A-ball, Coyle recently cooling off after a blistering April and Betts heating up in May., 594905=Saturday, July 28, 4:05 PM ET Jon Lester vs. CC Sabathia, 572993=We\u2019re down to a mere 12 remaining games against Boston this year, with three of those slated for this weekend in the first road series at DNYS for Boston.\u00a0 How we\u2019ve gotten to four days from August with Boston making their first trip to the Bronx I don\u2019t really understand, but here we are.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll pick this up from the the last time I ran these., 342503=The Yankees\u2019 second half slide really began when they got swept in Oakland in a four game series following a home sweep of Toronto.\u00a0 Prior to that series, the Yankees had a 10 game lead in the division and were 57-34.\u00a0 Since the opener of that series on July 19 they\u2019ve gone 29-29 and lost nine games off their division lead., 649909=In other somewhat odd news, the Yankees claimed Darnell McDonald off waivers.\u00a0 This likely means we won\u2019t be seeing Brett Gardner before Labor Day. Of 2013., 7315=MLBTR: Yankees To Promote Luis Severino (24 Comments - 8/1/2015 4:24:48 pm), 323091=Buck Showalter managed the first American League wild-card team, the 1995 Yankees, losing an excruciating division series. On Friday he was here for the league\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first one-game wild card playoff as manager of the Baltimore Orioles. There was no series this time, just one chance to continue a miracle season., 504882=Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Rays on their 2012 AL East title., 465066=Thursday, September 6, 2012 David Phelps, RHP (3-4, 3.13 ERA) vs. Jason Hammel, RHP (8-6, 3.54 ERA), 674546=Friday, June 16 Phil Hughes (6-5, 4.76 ERA)\u00a0 vs. Gio Gonzalez (8-2, 2.35 ERA), 777663=We can now complete SG\u2019s trend line for Freddy: April 10: 4.2 IP, 4 R April 16: 5.2 IP, 5 R April 21: 1.2 IP, 5 R April 28: 1.2 IP, 6 R, 270079=None of what the 2012 Orioles got lucky with matters right now.\u00a0 The only thing that matters is how good the 25 man roster they will have for the ALDS is, and how it may match up against the Yankees.\u00a0 Because of that, I\u2019m going to look at projections for the Orioles and Yankees which will account for their performances this year as well as in recent prior seasons.\u00a0 This will account for the fact that some players may have over/under performed expectations and are possibly better or worse than their 2012 numbers, but more importantly it will account for the fact that the rosters and playing time distributions in a five game series are a lot different than they are in a 162 game season and simply comparing two teams\u2019 over 2012 Pythagenpat records is the height of laziness when it comes to statistical analysis.\u00a0 Well that or using FIP for pitcher WAR.\u00a0 But I digress., 21495=At the same time, Lester was an ace from 2008 to 2011, and he found that same stuff and command last year in the postseason. One thing we had noticed about Lester during his weaker outings was that he would get locked in to pounding the inner half of the zone with his fastball to RHB, and when his command wasn\u2019t good enough, he\u2019d get pounded. Lester needs to work inside with the fastball to get hitters to swing and miss on the cutter, but he seemed too stubborn to make adjustments when it wasn\u2019t working. In the postseason, Lester mixed up his repertoire and showed real improvement. Is that sustainable? Who knows. This is all by way of saying that I could totally justify a 5/110 contract extension, and I can see the case for letting him walk. If Lester wants more than five years or significantly more than $20M per season, I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s better to start working in the kids. It kind of feels like whichever choice the Sox make, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the wrong one., 1082181=If I sum up age times PA and age times batters faced divided by PA + BF for all teams using my current depth charts for 2012, here\u2019s the average age by team., 105866=\u00a0 I felt the division was Tampa\u2019s for the taking at the start of the season and I still think they are the team to be wary of.\u00a0 With the division featuring no pushovers I think the Rays\u2019 depth on the mound is a huge advantage.\u00a0 If they can stay in striking distance I think having guys like Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Alex Colome and Alex Torres give them innings as the year goes on is going to be a boost.\u00a0 I think that was a critical part of their comeback (and conversely the Sox failures) in 2011.\u00a0 I can easily see them just staying steady all year while the rest of the teams in the division have ups and downs because of that., 1605870=I\u2019m going to use the format below when I start my postseason previews.\u00a0 I\u2019m using The Hardball Times\u2019s Oliver forecasts, since I haven\u2019t had time to re-run CAIRO for 2011.\u00a0 These projections are the most up-to-date ones (updated weekly) and include 2011 MLEs, so I think they\u2019re solid.\u00a0 These were last updated on Monday., 10410=CBS Sports: Yankees have 11-run inning, end with 21 runs: By the numbers (59 Comments - 7/29/2015 6:19:55 pm), 110606=With Opening Day rapidly approaching, it\u2019s time for my 2013 MLB projected standings blowout.\u00a0 The idea behind this series of posts is to try and project how the 2013 MLB season might look given what we think we may know right now.\u00a0 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing a version of this since 2005, and you can see the results by looking at the following links., 476360=Saturday, September 1 Wei-Yin Chen, LHP (12-7, 3.78 ERA) vs. Freddy Garcia, RHP (7-5, 4.90 ERA), 937255=Thursday, April 19, 7:05 PM ET To be announced vs. Phil Hughes, 137476=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 507502=For the Dodgers, I don\u2019t think this is a good trade in terms of the value they\u2019re getting back and what it\u2019s going to cost them.\u00a0 But it solidifies them for the rest of the 2012 race and it gives their fans more evidence that the days of Scrooge McCourt are gone and not coming back., 557069=Sunday, August 19 Josh Beckett vs. Hiroki Kuroda, 28041=(MCoA) The Red Sox drafted insanely well during the early Theo Epstein years. 2003-2005 netted Jonathan Papelbon, David Murphy, Dustin Pedroia, Jacoby Ellsbury, Clay Buchholz and Jed Lowrie. The results trailed off from there, and the 2008 and 2009 drafts yielded basically the null set. Theo\u2019s final two drafts were a return to form. Anthony Ranaudo and Brandon Workman were supplemental and second round picks in 2010, while Matt Barnes and Henry Owens came in the first and supplemental rounds in 2011. On top of that, the Dodgers saw fit to hand us Allen Webster and Rubby De La Rosa in the Nick Punto trade., 329804=Baltimore seems like the weakest possible team out of all of the viable postseason teams, but that doesn\u2019t make them a bad team.\u00a0 Since August 4 they\u2019ve got a Pythagenpat winning percentage of .654 which is equivalent to a 106 win team.\u00a0 You can\u2019t completely ignore their early season performance, but you can understand that they\u2019ve changed the composition of their roster significantly enough that it shouldn\u2019t have much bearing in assessing how good they might be right now., 724676=W: Projected final 2012 wins L: Projected final 2012 losses RS: Projected final 2012 runs scored RA: Projected final 2012 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: 2012 revised projected wins minus 2012 pre-season projected wins RS+/-: 2012 revised projected runs scored minus 2012 pre-season projected runs scored (positive means they are projected to score more) RA+/-: 2012 revised projected runs allowed minus 2012 pre-season projected runs allowed (negative means they are projected to allow fewer), 8024=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees Pursuing Craig Kimbrel; Astros Interested As Well (145 Comments - 7/31/2015 7:18:11 pm), 476203=Friday, August 31 Miguel Gonzalez, RHP (5-3, 3.66 ERA) vs. Hiroki Kuroda, RHP (12-9, 2.98 ERA), 1118876=In terms of value there\u2019s not much difference there.\u00a0 The values aren\u2019t identical but they are close enough to basically be equivalent given the margin of error inherent in projections. Eyeballing the Pirates\u2019 projections, Burnett would probably be their best starter assuming Erik Bedard can\u2019t stay healthy, which is generally a safe assumption.\u00a0 If 2 WAR is close for Burnett in 2012, then we can probably assume something like 1-1.5 WAR in 2013, so he should be worth something like 3-3.5 WAR for Pittsburgh., 509239=With six games remaining against the Rays and seven against the Orioles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all 13 of those games coming during a 17-day stretch beginning Aug. 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Yankees will have every opportunity to control their own destiny., 143130=There\u2019s a new floormat in the AL West, and it\u2019s the Houston Astros.\u00a0 Can they lose 100+ games for the third year in a row?\u00a0 The projections think they can.\u00a0 Houston projects to be so bad that they have essentially balanced out the league difference between the AL and NL.\u00a0 Last year, the AL went 1150-1118 thanks to interleague play.\u00a0 If you add Houston\u2019s 55-107 to that you get a record of 1205-1225.\u00a0 Los Anaheim looks like the favorite here and project to win more games than any other team in baseball, with Texas a strong second.\u00a0 The Angels do have some concerns in their rotation, which could open the door for the Rangers.\u00a0 Oakland projects to fall back a bit from last year, but still should be in contention.\u00a0 Seattle still doesn\u2019t look particularly good, although they should score some more runs this year, which is something., 407521=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 501720=What makes it especially frustrating is that there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clear great teams in baseball.\u00a0 Texas\u2019s injuries in the rotation make them appear slightly more vulnerable than they were.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anyone fears the Tigers or White Sox much.\u00a0 The Rays can pitch, but their offense isn\u2019t the stuff of nightmares, and Baltimore seems like a classic case of overachieving.\u00a0 The whole National League is underwhelming, unless you think re-creating the 2011 Red Sox makes the Dodgers better than the 1927 Yankees., 465225=Phelps hasn\u2019t been great over his last couple of starts, including his last start against Baltimore where he walked 6 in 4.2 innings.\u00a0 Hammel was the Orioles\u2019 best starter through June 22 with a 2.61 ERA, but he lost effectiveness over his last four starts, probably at least partially due to a knee injury that ended up requiring surgery that put him on the DL on July 13.\u00a0 He\u2019s making his first start since returning from the DL and may be rusty.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hope so., 1486185=Because of that, for these previews I\u2019ll be using projections in lieu of 2011 stats.\u00a0 Despite having my own system in CAIRO, I\u2019m going to use the Hardball Times\u2019s Oliver forecasts since I haven\u2019t had the time to re-run CAIRO for this year.\u00a0 Oliver is updated weekly during the season and includes 2011 MLEs for players who saw time in the minors., 936786=Monday, April 16, 7:05 PM ET Carl Pavano vs. Freddy Garcia, 9184=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees To Place Michael Pineda On DL With Forearm Injury (40 Comments -

He\u2019s actually been no more than average for going on two seasons. He has a 101 ERA- over 2012 and 2013. Lester is better than that, based on his component stats and pre-2012 performance, but the projection systems generally peg him around 2.5 WAR. That\u2019s a nice pitcher, but it\u2019s not a guy you\u2019d give $100M to. That\u2019s maybe a 4/65 kind of pitcher, and obviously Jon Lester ain\u2019t signing for no sixty million dollars., 833688=1) Get 2012 projections.\u00a0 In this case I\u2019m using the average of the 2012 MLB projection blowout that I ran at the beginning of April. 2) Estimate revised team strength.\u00a0 For now, this is just a basic weighted average of the team\u2019s projections heading into the year and their Pythagenpat performance to this point.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making any adjustments for injuries/roster changes/etc., yet,\u00a0 although as we get deeper into the season I\u2019ll probably do that. 3) Run the rest of the 2012 MLB season through my Monte Carlo simulator and see what happens.\u00a0 This includes a variable that alters team strength in each iteration to account for things that projections can\u2019t account for., 556836=Friday, August 17 Franklin Morales vs. Phil Hughes, 20483=How many home runs do you think Pedroia will hit in 2014 now that he appears fully recovered from his thumb injury?, 612087=The second half of the Yankees\u2019 2012 MLB schedule gets kicked off with four excruciating games against Boston.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve mentioned before, 16 of the Yankees final 81 games are against Boston, which means there\u2019s a fair amount of potential volatility in both teams\u2019 chances of taking the division and/or one of the wild cards.\u00a0 The Yankees have built up a healthy 7.5 game lead on Boston, but the gap between them according to their Pythagorean records is only 1.5 games (the Yankees are at 47-34 and Boston\u2019s at 46-36).\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t matter for the games that have been played so far, but it should be part of the consideration when thinking about what both teams will do going forward., 595032=Sunday, July 29, 8:05 PM ET Felix Doubront vs. Hiroki Kuroda, 195291=I think this confirms that getting to the target of a $189M payroll in 2014 may be the Yankees #1 focus right now, and that\u2019s going to make it a bit harder to build a super team for 2013.\u00a0 Of course, you don\u2019t need a super team to win a World Series, but it helps., 1861116=Both sources said because there would be just a one-game playoff added, the second wild-card team could be installed as early as next year, but the new system will go into effect no later than 2013., 155969=12:24AM EST December 13. 2012 - NEW YORK (AP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Los Angeles Dodgers are on track to become only the second major league team with a $200 million payroll and could end the New York Yankees\u2019 streak of 14 years as baseball\u2019s biggest spender., 392956=I have to admit that I really have no idea how good the 2012 Orioles are.\u00a0 Much has been made of the fact that they\u2019ve been outscored this season, but that ignores the fact that their current roster is not the same as the roster they had earlier in the year.\u00a0 Team talent is not static, and any analysis that assumes that what the Orioles have done all season long is the best way to assess how good they are at this very moment is simplistic and lazy.\u00a0, 334871=Using these offensive numbers with the revised pitching projections for the scheduled starters(for six innings) and the average 2012 relief ERA for each team for three innings for the six remaining games gives us this., 10828=Yankees (56-42) @ Rangers (47-51) , Tuesday July 28, 2015 , 8:05 PM (119 Comments -

They can be downloaded here., 674873=Sunday, June 18 Ivan Nova (8-2, 4.64 ERA) vs. Edwin Jackson (3-3, 3.02 ERA), 271074=For the projections, I\u2019m using Oliver from the Hardball Times.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been updated as of last week and include 2012 MLEs for players that spent time in the minors so I feel they are the most complete version of forecasts available right now., 1244619=Because Marcel regresses more heavily than other projections and because it assumes every one who hasn\u2019t played in MLB projects as league average, you see a tighter spread here than you\u2019ll see in other projected standings.\u00a0 The standard deviation for team wins in my last CAIRO projections was about 9.\u00a0 In this version it\u2019s 7.1.\u00a0 That may be more realistic if you think about how little we really know about how good/bad players and teams are, even though what will actually happen in 2012 will show a much bigger spread more in line with other projected standings., 1272252=2) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to construct meaningful rosters for a lot of teams, so these projections will favor the teams that have essentially completed their 2012 rosters., 744469=Tuesday, May 8: The Undefeated James Shields (5-0, 3.05 ERA) vs. Ivan Nova (3-1, 5.58 ERA) Wednesday, May 9: Jeff Niemann (2-3, 4.05 ERA) vs. David Phelps (0-1, 3.74 ERA) Thursday, May 10: David Price (5-1, 2.35 ERA) vs. CC Sabathia (4-0, 4.15 ERA), 945670=NEW YORK\u2014In a wooden ballpark located on The Hilltop in upper Manhattan, northwest of the Polo Grounds and close to the shores of the Hudson River, the New York Highlanders were ready to open their 1912 season. Their opponents on this day, April 11, were the Boston Red Sox. They were not rivals., 833055=We\u2019re roughly about 10% of the way throught the 2012 regular season, which is a pretty small sample size to make sweeping observations about how good or bad teams are.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that what\u2019s happened to this point isn\u2019t important, because it is.\u00a0 I wanted to see what teams have seen the biggest shifts in their outlooks based on how they projected coming into the year compared what they have done since., 567709=For whatever it\u2019s worth, excluding their games against each other, the Rays probably have the tougher schedule from August 23 on.\u00a0 Their opponents have a collective estimated winning precentage of about .515 while the Yankees\u2019 opponents have one of .485.\u00a0 So the Yankees are theoretically still in a pretty good position for taking the division.\u00a0 Whether or not they\u2019ll take advantage of that is a bigger question., 113178=2) Playing time distribution in these simulations will not match actual 2013 playing time. I used the rosters and depth charts available at MLB Depth Charts plus whatever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read over the offseason as my guide to set these up as realistically as possible, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible source of error. Rosters were set up to have 35-40 or so active players per team, and to get a reasonable amount of playing time from the bench and extra pitchers, to more closely model reality. Basically, no players are set to play more than 90% of the time, starting catchers are restricted to at most about 75% of the games, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sure teams get a non-trivial amount of starts from their 6-8 starters. The healthier a team is in 2013, the more likely they will be to exceed these projections, and vice versa., 594780=Friday, July 27, 7:05 PM ET Aaron Cook vs. Phil Hughes, 114503=4) These are NOT my predictions. These are projections based on running a computer simulation hundreds of thousands of times with projection data that is inherently limited. If your favorite team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame me, blame the computers and spreadsheets that projected them. I guess you can blame me for the CAIRO results if you want, otherwise you can take heart in the 2006 Tigers projecting to win 80, the 2010 Giants projecting to go 81-81 or the 2012 Orioles projecting to win 70 games.\u00a0 These are not meant to tell you how the season is going to play out.\u00a0 I prefer to think of them more as a starting point for discussion, with a range of something like 10 wins in either direction based on how things actually end up playing out.\u00a0 You can look at them and argue about why you think some teams will be better or worse., 527350=The Sox say they still believe they will get hot, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost a lot more than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve won since the July 26 secret meetings (there also was one between ownership and Valentine). Their reality is it has to happen soon. The teams that lead for the AL wild cards are on pace to win approximately 87 games; the Sox could get there by winning about two out of every three to finish., 28671=As fun as they are, all of these prospects come with notable flaws. Owens is not a hard thrower, and he has racked up strikeouts with a fantastic changeup and a deceptive delivery which doesn\u2019t show the ball to the hitter until the last second. His control is not great. Matt Barnes has a true plus fastball that he spots well, but the rest of his repertoire is a work in progress. Allen Webster is a converted position player who is still very much learning to pitch, and this shows up in regular lapses in command. Ranaudo has an injury history as long as his limbs. Workman seems like the most consistent of all of them, but the Red Sox appear to profile him more as a reliever. (He\u2019s made the MLB roster as a reliever, and pitched well there in the stretch run last year.) De La Rosa looked like the leading light of this group based on past results, but he has not recovered anything close to acceptable command since his Tommy John surgery in 2011, and he\u2019s easily the most likely bust of the group., 323937=Maybe, but probably not. The Rangers won the last two A.L. pennants and came within a strike of their first World Series title last October. They led the West division this season from the fourth game through the 161st, but tumbled into the wild-card game the last day of the regular season. Now they are finished, victims of a long-dormant potion called Oriole Magic., 504058=On the morning of July 19, after completing a sweep of the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium the day before, the New York Yankees woke up with a 10-game lead in the American League East. Life was good., 8837=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees Acquire Dustin Ackley (30 Comments - 7/30/2015 8:17:07 pm), 49734=But if you are a Yankee fan, like I used to be, this is pretty disheartening.\u00a0 It\u2019s not surprising, and if you put the lineup and pitching staff together based on how they project in 2014 you will see they are about as far from championship caliber as any team in the American League.\u00a0 Maybe moreso considering the relative strength of their division.\u00a0, 1080522=March 11, 2011: Hardball Talk: Cliff Lee chose Philly because the Yankees are getting older.

Now, the Sox have two games\u2014and perhaps a one-game playoff on Thursday\u2014to avoid being the first team to blow a double-digit Wild Card lead since that format started in 1994., 147804=But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include technically unsigned players like Phil Hughes, Boone Logan, Joba Chamberlain, Ivan Nova and Clay Rapada, who are under the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 control but are either arbitration eligible or will have their contracts renewed for 2013. Once the Yankees come to agreements with those players, the payroll will rise, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect their seemingly ironclad plan to be under $189 million for 2014, the year that significant luxury tax incentives kick in., 165808=Since I was curious about how the big trade between Kansas City and Tampa Bay affected the AL East, I ran some projected standings based on rosters as of last night.\u00a0 As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using CAIRO v0.2 and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u2019s how the 2013 MLB season looks as of December 10., 110990=2005 2006 2007 2008 Pt 1 2008 Pt 2 2009 AL 2009 NL 2010 AL 2010 NL 2011 AL 2011 NL 2012, 597933=Sabathia will make his first start since June 24 on Tuesday night against Toronto. Out with a groin strain, he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeling well enough to pitch as long as he needs to and thinks the time off might have been more beneficial to his left arm than the groin. ... Gardner was sore a day after he had four at-bats in a three-inning simulated game and was being kept off the field Monday. The speedy outfielder has already had two setbacks in his recovery from a strained elbow that has sidelined him since April 18., 151478=I don\u2019t expect Dickey to repeat his 2012, but CAIRO still likes him a lot in 2013.\u00a0 As a Jay he projects to put up an ERA of around 3.65 over 211 innings which would be worth somewhere in the area of 4.5 - 5 wins.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the AL East now projects adding Dickey to the Jays, Stephen Drew to the Red Sox and a few other tweaks to the other teams\u2019 depth charts., 148322=If the Yankees are over the $189 million mark for 2014, their luxury tax rate would soar to 50 percent (they are currently at 40 percent). If they are below it, the rate would plummet to 17.5 percent, and that could translate into potential savings of $50 million. Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 managing general partner, has clearly stated his desire to be under the mark, which is why the Yankees have, for the most part, made only tepid advances in the free-agent market in the past two seasons., 1341897=Yeah, I\u2019m quivering in my boots here.\u00a0 Looks like the 1927 Yankees are in jeopardy once again., 88514=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 560574=I\u2019d estimate that the Yankees as presently constituted (minus CC and A-Rod) are about an 88 win team and the Rays are about an 89 win team.\u00a0 So here is how their schedules compare through August 22.}",

I figured I had a long offseason ahead of me if I was going to do everything in my power to make the Yankees look better than they are. The thing that needed to be done first was put the Yankees in the context of the rest of MLB.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been working on building my CAIRO season simulation disk and gave it a trial run last night.\u00a0 This was current through rosters as of yesterday morning.

HOUSTON\u2014The Yankees remodeled their batting order at a price tag of nearly $300 million, a spending spree deemed necessary after too many punchless evenings last season. Through the first 18 innings of this season, they\u2019re still waiting for returns on that investment. Yankees.com:\u00a0 Yanks can muster little support for Kuroda",
