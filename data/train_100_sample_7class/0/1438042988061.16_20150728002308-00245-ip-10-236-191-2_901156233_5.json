            "For some people, the sheer size of the university can be daunting, and for others it can be exciting. Because UT Austin isn't a small school, the students that absolutely love small schools will definitely not like it here. Another thing to note is that UT is smack in the middle of downtown Austin, so for the students that are seeking a more rural look, this is going to be a disappointment. But for those who love city life, Austin would be a great place. In the end, if you're unsure, stop by and visit the campus. Take a tour, and you will probably have a clearer idea of whether or not this is the right school for you or not, because in the end you want a school that makes you happy and if it doesn't, then the college experience won't be as great as it should.",
            "Well, first off, use the resources that the university offers! You pay to go to the school, so use as much as you can. There are study abroad advising, career centers, libraries, academic counseling, recreation centers, and more. I see many students who don't take advantage of the resources that they pay for, and these things can very well help you get a job in the future and also make your life a lot easier! Also, don't be afraid to ask your professors for help. Go to their office hours and whatever tutorial sessions that the teaching assistants or professors have; most of them are very, very helpful. In the end, if you're on the border-line for a certain grade, and the professor saw that you were trying by doing all the above things, you will find that most professors are very sympathetic and will sometimes give you a little bump. However, if you didn't really try in their class, of course they won't be as understanding. UT Austin is also known as a party school. College is perhaps one of the best times of your life, but take it from me that you don't want to party even one semester away because that will hurt, a lot, in the long run. There's nothing wrong with having fun! Not at all! But do things in moderation, and you will have an absolutely great time. And one of the important things is to be smart! What I mean by this is that UT Austin is a big school, and when you have a large group of people, crime is bound to happen. Don't leave your stuff unattended. If you bring your bike to school, make sure you lock it up with either a really good lock, or two locks. If you bring your car to school (I wouldn't bring any type of nice car personally, i.e. BMW, Mercedes, etc.), don't leave anything interesting lying out or else it will be broken into. It's always better to be safe than have something happen to you.",
            "I actually applied for the more expensive private universities as well to keep my options open, but in the end, one of the main reasons that I decided to choose UT Austin was because of money. I had a college savings account, but since that was based on the stock markets, well, you can imagine how much I had left. (However, if you are an out of state student, the tuition can be just as high as private universities, around three times higher than what in-state students pay for tuition) But even though my tuition was fairly low, the number of resources available to the students is incredible. The university has a ton of cool speaker events and also extremely good facilities, such as libraries and gyms. For me, UT Austin is well worth the money that I pay.",
            "I come from the DFW area, so by comparison, Austin as a city, is a lot smaller. With that being said, Austin is still a very nice city that has many great places that college students can go to. As for the school, the classmates that I have had interaction with are very friendly and helpful, though I must admit I have really only met a very small fraction of the school population (there are over 50,000 students enrolled; the school population itself is like the population of a small town!). There are cafeterias around campus, but I rarely eat at them because there are restaurants on a street that students call the Drag that take BevoBucks. If you decide to go with a meal plan, which you need in order to get into the cafeterias conveniently, then you need to know that all it really is a down payment that's used as a type of debit card, only for food. So, in my opinion, there really is no need to get a meal plan because in the end, if you don't use it all, then it's gone after the next semester. Now something that does bother me a little bit about the campus is that on the outskirts, there are quite a few homeless people. For me, coming from the suburbs of the DFW area, I have never really gotten used to seeing beggars on the street corners. By no means are they mean, it's just very disconcerting seeing them. (They usually aren't on the actual campus, but they do stay on the street corners that are fairly close, so you'll see them coming to school or walking around downtown)",
            "The University of Texas at Austin (UT) was named a Public Ivy meaning that you can get a very good education at a public university. From my experience at UT, I believe that the title is well deserved. I am currently enrolled in the Cockrell School of Engineering, and I can tell you for sure that the faculty, staff, and resources here at the school are top-notch (My basis for comparison largely comes from my experience at the University of North Texas). Of course, there are always those more general classes, also known as 'freshmen' courses, that are sometimes not always so great. Because the classes are so big for these courses, I think there is more of a disconnect between the students and teachers, but that's my opinion on it. These courses are the only reason why I have deducted a star from learning, but in the end as you get further along in your major, the professors do become a lot better."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{295707=I love the dorms. If you want to live in the dorms, apply early. Preferably as soon as the application comes out, but you can also get it done over Christmas break. There are more people who want to live in the dorms than they have room for, so don't wait until May to send in your application, you probably will not get a housing contract on campus at that point. There's a roommate match website for UT that a lot of people find helpful, but I just went in as pot luck and it's turned out great. Check out the dorm you think you want to live in before you apply. Jester is close to a lot of things, but if you're in engineering, then you'll have a hike every day to get to class. Whitis is less well known, but those living their typically form really close communities., 504687=So many organizations - over 1100 registered in the Dean of Students organization database. Great place to meet new people and become involved in your passions., 947779=There are about 1000 clubs to join on campus, there is no possible way that someone won't find something they are interested in. From club sports to Greek Life, to clubs with other people in your major., 188699=A lot of the core courses you have to take can be quite interesting. I took two non-science major science classes, chemistry and biology, and neither of them had anything to do with chemistry or biology. My biology teacher was this hippie guy who made class fun and I was done with his class by November because of the way he tests. Chemistry was basically environmental science but it was a good class. The UGS classes that all freshmen have to take can be really interesting too if you pick a good topic., 839346=I'd just like to say J2(buffet) is cheap and delicious. I can never get tired of that place. As for the fast food, you've got a Wendy's that opens until 4 in the morning and a union filled with every all the fasts in one place. May not be a home-cooked meal, but you can manage., 39548=1. Rain boots and an umbrella are necessities if you want to stay dry, it rains a good amount in Austin. 2. Don't ever be afraid to ask for help about anything, if the first person isn't of much help just ask someone else! 3. If you want to be pretty sure you get a good professor check out websites like pick-a-prof, they have honest and useful reviews from UT students 4. Get your books early, theres almost always a delay at the Co-Op. And if you're buying books from the Co-Op save your receipts!!! You can go back to the Co-Op when you're done with you're books (to sell them back) and get 10% back of what you paid for them, which is not much but it's still something! Also check into renting (westcampusbooks.com, chegg.com) your books or buying them online (amazon), even looking at used bookstores. 5. Make sure to make one or two friends in each of your classes. Knowing people can help with study groups and getting notes when you're absent. Don't be one of those people who always sends mass emails out because they are afraid to say hi to the person sitting next to them! 6. Sitting closer to the front in big lectures helps a lot. One because you can hear what the professor is saying SO MUCH better, like reminders of test dates and due dates (very important stuff here people!!!), and two because you get less distracted by all the movement from the other 249 people (maybe even more!) in your class. 7. Stay organized. Keep all your syllabi and mark down the important dates on a calendar or in an organizer/planner. 8. Keep you're map from Orientation, also make sure to read through the magazine they give you at orientation, I'm pretty sure it has Bevo on the front of it. It has some pretty useful information and tips in there. 9. If you're staying in the dorms on campus, bring a rug. Most dorms have tile floors, and it's no fun to have you're feet cold when you wake up in the morning! 10. AVOID 8 o'clock classes. Check the registrar before your registration time and write down the unique numbers to classes you want, that way you can plug them in quickly and be done. Also make sure to have backups just in case the classes you want are closed, and don't be afraid to waitlist the class you want. 11. Keep in touch with your advisor. They're there job is to help you! 12. Get familiar with the bus system. It can be really helpful on rainy days, and you can even put your bike on the front! 13. Don't hop onto the living on campus wagon right away. Check out apartments around campus and compare prices to see which would work best for you. 14. Don't forget to take study breaks and remember to have fun., 1014132=I entered the University of Texas at Austin during the fall of 2012 and so far, so great. The school is huge so if you prefer a small, tight-knit community then this may not be the place for you. However, there are plenty of ways to make it feel smaller by joining one of the many groups on campus. For the most part, people are friendly and helpful. Also, you'll never be bored in Austin., 967779=Good food and dining plan, but if you are use to eating a lot the meal plan is a bit limiting. Only 1400 Dine in dollars, comes down to about 6.08 cents a day... not enough for 2 good meals per day., 459117=I only lived in a Dorm for one year (called Duren). It was a very good experience for a first-year student, and I wouldn't have minded living there again. The dorms automatically come with about $1500 to spend on food at the UT food services., 986193=There is something for everyone. Seriously. 1000 organizations and all you need to start a new one is $10 and some friends, 385456=there are more than 1100 registered student organizations and there is always events going on from these organizations, there is hardly anything that one cannot find themselves to not get involved with!, 989601=This is a big school so make sure that's really what you want from your college experience. I love it here and I would always encourage incoming freshmen to get involved in different clubs and organizations. There is something here for everyone since we have over 1000 student run clubs/organizations., 985409=I'm 5'4 and 110 lbs and I have never felt unsafe at any point during my time here. Even at 1:30 in the morning. There are always people outside so its not eerie, 445267=the opportunities for fun are countless. i believe there are nearly 1000 clubs at ut so you are sure to find something; there's intramural sports, a large gym on campus, plenty of restaurants, bars, and clubs around the city. and of course don't forget that austin is the live music capital of the world!, 612402=Time is key to apply to UT because UT especially has deadlines that are very early compare to most schools around Texas if not the whole nation. Their deadline such as application deadline is in March and their financial aid is also in March. Those are the two most important dates you must know and you should make it your priority. Their school of business, McCombs is VERY competitive so transferring from a community college is VERY difficult, but once you got accepted to UT straight from high school, you would have a decent chance of getting it., 370911=ut has 1100 registered organizations on various subjects and interests regarding ethnicity, religions, academic interests, majors, or hobbies. if you want to start your own club/organization, even that is very easy to do. all clubs have a number of fun activities for their members, all you have to do is join., 458553=There are several UT sponsored food and dining places around campus. The downside is that the prices are pretty expensive, but if you live in a dorm then you get $1500. The food quality is high. There are also a a plethora of non-UT sponsored eateries on and very close to campus., 623758=After September 2010's shooting scare, I can safely say that UTPD is brilliant.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I think that UT is great for all kinds of students! You can find things to do and different organizations for people of all types, size, and ages! So don\u2019t be scared to apply or afraid that you won\u2019t fit in because you will! And you will always have a friend there already who is willing to lend a helping hand-me! Tips for prospective students Aside from all the tips that have already been mentioned above, I just suggest that students don\u2019t study all the time! You are in a great city and a great campus! Go out and join an organization, meet some people, and have some fun! Studying all the time is not good for your health. Sometimes, besides hanging out with friends or going to events, I like to work out to relax my body. It helps me sleep at night and it might help you! Another tip is that you might get lonely sometimes (because campus is so big) so make sure to plan dates with your friends in order to catch up! Everyone is going in their own direction and if you don\u2019t plan things, sometimes you won\u2019t get to see them at all. Bang for the buck There is a LOT of resources that are available for students on campus. If",
