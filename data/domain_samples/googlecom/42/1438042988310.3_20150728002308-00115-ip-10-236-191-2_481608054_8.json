    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0140] In a yet further embodiment of the invention the distribution of work is carried out bypassing one or more levels of the management hierarchy so that the overall process may get under way more quickly. In this case a superior manager, knowing which user groups are to be involved, arranges for the sub-plans to be directly made available to those user groups. The corresponding merging, or collation, of the results follows the normal hierarchical process described above so that data collection and selection of appropriate sub-plans are controlled by the responsible managers. [0139] Multi-Level Delegation [0138] In a further embodiment of the invention a quick delegation function is provided so that a PM or CM can forward a plan or sub-plan to a single user class, and have the results returned directly to the forwarding PM or CM, thereby bypassing the use of the organisation object. In all other aspects, the workflow remains the same. This function allows a PM or CM to study a subset of the overall forecast or plan without invoking the full planning delegation process. [0137] Quick Delegation [0136] 6. Optionally review proposals rejected by superior and re-submit if necessary. [0135] 5. Optionally review any suggested changes from superior. (Refresh) [0134] 4. Forward one or more proposals to superior as proposals.",
