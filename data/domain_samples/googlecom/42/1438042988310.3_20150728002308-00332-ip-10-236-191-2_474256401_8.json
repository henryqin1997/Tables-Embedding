It is also advantageous that because of the described architecture for the selection of the redundancy bit line BLR, only one additional signal, YNR, is necessary over and above the signals YN0-YN7 and YM0-YM7 normally necessary for the selection of the bit lines BL of the matrix, while in the previous redundancy embodiments as many distinct selection signals are necessary as there are redundancy bit lines BLR. Advantageously, the circuit combination used for the generation of the signals YM0-YM7 prevents these latter from being linked, in the case of an address corresponding to a defective cell, to the combination of the sub-set A0-A2 of the address signals ADD; it is thus possible to replace the bit line BL containing the defective cell with any of the eight bit lines BLR of the same sector, and not just with the bit line BLR of the packet 1 to which the defective bit line BL also belongs. If, in fact, a prior access and circuit combination were to be used for the generation of the signals YM0-YM7, wherein the latter would always be generated starting from the signals A0-A2,",
