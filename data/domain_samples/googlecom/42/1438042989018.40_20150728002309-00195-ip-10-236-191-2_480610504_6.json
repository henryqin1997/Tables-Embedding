    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the instant invention has been described in several embodiments, this description is not intended to limit the scope of this invention to those embodiments. Other embodiments may still be within the scope of the claims below. It is contemplated that the thermodetector of FIG. 5 could also be constructed such that instead of an LED for the indicating means, a transducer which gives an auditory or tactile signal, indicating a change from the reference temperature, could be employed. It is also contemplated that the indicator output could be used to drive a strip chart recorder or other type device for automatic data collection, or to influence the operation of another circuit. The insertion end 118 of the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 5, may be flat so that it is easily adaptable to be held under the tongue, back against the base. This device allows readings to be essentially instantaneous because the response time for the circuit is in milliseconds. A further embodiment of the instant invention can be employed using the thermodetector of FIG. 5 having three different circuits of the type disclosed in FIG. 6. Each different circuit would have its reference temperature set at a different point. For example, one circuit may be set on basal temperature during the estrogen dominated period of the cycle, a second circuit will be set 0.1\ufffd F. less than the ovulation temperature and a third set at",
