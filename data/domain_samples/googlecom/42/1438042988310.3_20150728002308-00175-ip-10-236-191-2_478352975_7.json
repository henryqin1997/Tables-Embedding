    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the graduated anvil of the subject invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment, it is apparent that changes or modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Graduations 230 are preferably accompanied by corresponding numerical indicia and are preferably disposed in 10mm intervals with the indicia decreasing in magnitude in a distal direction. As in the previous embodiment, the graduations and the indicia may be imprinted on or etched into the outer surface 228 of distal portion 224. Referring to FIG. 6, the distal portion 224 of anvil half-section 220 defines a staple forming surface 227 against which surgical fasteners are driven and formed when ejected from the distal portion 214 of cartridge half-section 210. Staple forming surface 227 includes a plurality of staple forming cups 226 disposed in parallel rows and extending substantially along the length of the distal portion 224 of anvil half-section 220. The outer surface 228 of distal portion 224 is provided with a series of graduations or markings 230 which serve to delineate the linear boundaries of staple forming surfaces 227 and permit visual observation of these boundaries from a location remote from the surgical site. Accordingly, a surgeon using surgical stapler 200 will have the capability to properly orient the apparatus to ensure that the target tissue is adequately disposed within the boundaries",
