The cutting element 141 can rotate over a wide range of speeds, for example, approximately 500-2000 rpm, and preferably in the range of 800-1200 rpm. Oscillation can be in the ultrasonic range. Saline can also be introduced into the surgical site., 28326=A fluid line is supported by the surgical instrument.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. Other applications for the use of illuminating devices 950, 950 a, and 984 include lipoma (fatty tumor removal) and liposuction. During these procedures, the illuminating device can provide visualization of the veins in the area of surgery to aid the surgeon in avoiding the veins. . FIG. 14 Attached to proximal end 997 of outer member 986 is a hub 990 having a connector 992 for introduction of fluid to line 989, a lightpost 993 for attaching fiberoptic bundle 985 to a light source (not shown), and a connector 994 for introduction of fluid to channel 918 (described above). Surgical instrument 984 is otherwise as described above with reference to , an integral surgical illuminating device 984 includes an outer cutting member 986, an inner cutting member 986, and a fiberoptic bundle 985 attached to the external surface of outer cutting member 986. A distal tip 987 of fiberoptic bundle 985 is set at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of device 984 of, e.g., about 0 to 90\ufffd, preferably about 45 to 70\ufffd, and positioned adjacent to the outer member window 988 to direct the light at a vein positioned above or beside outer member window 988. In the embodiment shown, surgical instrument 984 also includes a separate line 989 attached to the external surface of outer member 986",
