    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although described herein as associated with and interacting with a clinician, i.e., a clinician programmer, programmer 20 may be associated with patient 12, i.e., a patient programmer. Also, other users, such as technicians or other medical personnel may use programmer 20. In some embodiments, patient 12 may simply interact with programmer 20 in place of the clinician for some or all of the electrode combination identification process. In other embodiments, patient 12 may perform parts of the configuration identification process without being supervised by the clinician, e.g., away from the clinic, using a patient programmer. In addition, the invention may be useful for a wide variety of neurostimulation contexts including spinal cord stimulation, deep brain stimulation, gastric stimulation, pelvic stimulation, sacral stimulation, and others. These and other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. For example, although programmer 20 has been described herein as a hand-held computing device, programmer 20 may take the form of any type of computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, may access resources, such as memory 54, via a computer network, such as a LAN, WAN, or the World Wide Web. Further, programmer 20 may include a plurality of computing devices, which may communicate to provide the functionality ascribed to programmer 20 herein via a computer network.
