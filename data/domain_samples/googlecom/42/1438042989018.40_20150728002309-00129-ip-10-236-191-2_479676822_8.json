    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, while the preferred apparatus of the invention utilizes a female-type connector to connect to the EKG simulation signal generator, a male-type connector may be appropriate. Thus, within the scope of the appended claims, it is to be understood that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. Use of the training electrodes formed in accordance with the present invention incorporates the steps of connecting the defibrillator/monitor cable leads from the defibrillator/monitor to the electrodes, removing the protective backing on the electrodes, placing the training electrodes onto a standard CPR mannequin in a desired position, monitoring the signals generated by the signal generator 29, and discharging the defibrillator/monitor. This training sequence more realistically simulates all of the steps required in actual operation of a defibrillator/monitor, while utilizing readily available equipment. Referring to FIG. 5, a training electrode 11 is shown that is identical to the electrode illustrated in FIG. 1, with the exception that a banana-type connector 35 is used to couple electrical cable 19 to connector 17. More particularly, a male end 37 of connector 35 is attached to the arm 23 of connector 17. The male end 37, in turn, engages a female end 39 of connector",
