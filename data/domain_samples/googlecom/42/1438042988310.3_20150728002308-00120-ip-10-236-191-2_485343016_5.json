The present embodiment is therefore considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. When the valve actuator 280 is in the rotated and unlocked position of FIG. 8, the indicia 450 will be aligned with indicia 454, comprising another mark affixed to the other side of the valve housing 282. See FIG. 1. Next to the indicia 454, the word \"UNLOCKED\" is displayed. Thus, the medical attendant knows the valve 40 is ready to be manually actuated as the need arises. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the actuator 280, at flange 290, has indicia 450, comprising an eccentric mark. When the valve actuator 280 is in the locked position, the indicia 450 will be aligned with indicia 452, comprising another mark affixed to valve housing 282. See FIG. 2. Next to the indicia 452, the word \"LOCKED\" is displayed. Thus, the medical attendant knows the valve 40 may not be actuated in the described condition. On those occasions, when it is desired not to utilize the valve 40, valve 40 may be placed in the locked",
