For example, various embodiments may be combined such that gratings may be moved both by translation and/or rotation in a plane and by tilting out of the plane, and other types of actuators such as piezo-based actuators, may be employed. The invention provides a color modulator useful in many technical applications, including a source of light of a desired color or a display of information in color for use with information-processing equipment, for example. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Thus, in use of the invention, a method is employed for modulating the color of light from a source. The method includes (a) disposing a blazed grating to be illuminated by the light to be modulated and to diffract that light, (b) disposing a MEMS actuator for varying the spatial relationship between the blazed grating and an output aperture (the MEMS actuator being adapted to vary the spatial relationship in response to electrical signals), and (c) controlling the electrical signals to the MEMS actuator to direct a selected wavelength of the diffracted light of a selected diffracted order to the output aperture. In this method, the MEMS actuator may be adapted to tilt",
