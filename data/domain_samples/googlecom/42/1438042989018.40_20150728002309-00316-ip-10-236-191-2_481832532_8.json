    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0054] The bone screw is not restricted to the embodiment as polyaxial screw described here. The bone screw can in fact also be constructed as a monoaxial screw, according to which the screw head 3 and the receiver part 5 are constructed in one piece. [0053] As in the first embodiment, a further advantage is that owing to the concentric arrangement of the first and second screw or engagement elements 26, 27 only a small space is needed, which is of great advantage in an operation, as the operating field is always only limited. [0052] In order, for example, to fix a bone screw of the second embodiment, the first and the second screw or engagement element 26, 27 is brought into engagement with the head-fixing screw 12 and the rod-fixing screw 13\u2032. One hand therein grips the first handle 22, while the other hand grips the gear housing 30, which serves as second handle. By rotating the two handles in opposite directions of rotation the first and second screw or engagement elements 26, 27 are also rotated and tightened in opposite directions. It is also possible to perform the rotational movements of the first or second handle or gear housing 22, 30 differently or for example to rotate only one handle and merely to fix the other handle or the gear housing. That means the rotational movements",
