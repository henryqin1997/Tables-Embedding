    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30241=Cartridge 10 is less than about half the thickness of the well-known 3.5 inch floppy disk. As a result, conventional removable cartridge shell materials cannot be used to construct cartridge 10. Plastics, such as those used in the well-known 3.5 inch floppy disk, would either be too thick or not strong enough if manufactured with the desired thickness. To manufacture a thin cartridge, such as cartridge 10, all of the component materials must be as thin as possible while providing structural support that will withstand the rigors of everyday use. For example, cartridge shell halves 18 a and 18 b are formed from a thin sheet material preferably about 0.1854 mm thick. To provide the structural support, the shell is preferably made from a sheet metal. Preferably the metal is sheet steel, more preferably stainless steel, and most preferably series 300 stainless steel. Cartridge shell halves 18 a and 18 b are preferably cut from a sheet of steel in a stamping operation which forms the turned edge portions 118 a and 118 b, provides the cutouts such as the driving hole 218 b in the bottom cartridge shell half 18 b, post hole 218 a in the top cartridge shell half 18 a, media access openings 418 a, 418 b, and so on., 20141=This Application: is a continuation of U.S. provisional Application Ser. No. 08/968/362 filed Nov. 12 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,890., 31682=Shutter shell halves also must meet strict thickness requirements. As such, shutter shell 16 a and 16 b are formed from a thin sheet material. The sheet material is preferably a sheet metal. The sheet metal is preferably thin sheet aluminum, preferably 5052 aluminum, more preferably in a half-hard condition. The sheet aluminum is preferably about 0.1854 mm thick. Shutter shell halves are also preferably cut from a sheet of aluminum in a stamping operation which forms upstanding rim 116 a in top shutter shell half 16 a, upstanding rim 116 b in the bottom shutter shell half 16 b, and cuts driving hole 316 b in the bottom of shutter shell half 16 b, pivot hole 316 a in the top shutter shell half 16 a, and media access openings 416 a, 416 b in shutter shell halves 16 a and 16 b.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above description of preferred embodiments is not intended to impliedly limit the scope of protection of the following claims. For example, while a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention has been described wherein energy beams, such as laser beams, are used to weld the cartridge, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other welding techniques, such as resistance welding, may also be used without departing from the principles of the claimed invention. Energy beam 110 is directed at a focus angle 112 from energy source 120 toward weld site 60. Preferably, focus angle 112 is between about 30\ufffd and 40\ufffd, more preferably about 35\ufffd. Two cones, outer cone 113 and inner cone 114, are milled into fixtures 102, 104 proximate weld site 60. Outer cone 113 is milled deeper than inner cone 114 to provide enough clearance to prevent melting of fixture 100. FIG. 9 is a detailed top view of a typical weld site 60. As shown in FIG. 9, set screw 64 is located near weld site 60. Set screw 64 is adjusted to ensure that top shell half 18 a makes contact with bottom shell half 18 b at weld site 60. This is important since, if top shell half 18 a is not in abutment contact with bottom shell half 18 b at each weld site 60, a faulty weld or damage to cartridge 10 may occur",
