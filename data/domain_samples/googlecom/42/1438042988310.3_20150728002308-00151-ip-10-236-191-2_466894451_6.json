As instruments are used during surgery, they are deposited in the cleaning solution contained within the bowl after they are used. When surgery is complete, said portion is installed on the bowl portion 12 by installing the projecting portion 24 of the circumferentially seal 18 into the groove 34 defined in rim 16. At the same time, downwardly projecting portion 44 of lid portion 14 will fit over the downwardly projecting portion 46 of rim 36 of the bowl portion 12. Accordingly, substantially flat portion 64 of the lid portion 14 will rest directly upon the rim 36 of bowl portion 12. The clasp 50 can then be rotated downwardly as indicated by the arrow such that the clasp portion 52 will rotate around the downwardly projection portions 44, 46 to thereby cause the projecting portion 54 to latch against the projection of 46, thereby firmly securing the lid portion 14 upon the bowl portion 12. Additional containers 10 can then be stacked upon one another, with the bottom 48 of bowl portion 16 of successive containers resting upon the substantially flat surface 50 of lid portion 14, relative sliding movement between the containers stacked upon one another being restrained by the edge 26. The lid portion 14 is secured to bowl portion 12 by latching members generally indicated by the numeral 50.",
