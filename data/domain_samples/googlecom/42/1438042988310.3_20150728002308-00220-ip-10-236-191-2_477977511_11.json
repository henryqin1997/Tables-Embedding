L. Fox, Arch. Surg. 96, 184, 1968) rejuvenated the compound for the topical treatment of burns. The 1% w/w of this active drug, in its cream form, has been in clinical use in the U.S.A. since 1973. It is one of only two approved active drugs used as a topical antibacterial agent for adjunctive therapy in second and third degree burns., 15164=This application is a continuation of PCT/US98/09753, filed May 12, 1998, claiming the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/046,287, filed May 12, 1997, the content of which are incorporated by reference into this application., 35499=The trigger spray device for packaging the gel in Example 1 or cream or lotion in Example 2 is the TS-800 Trigger Spray manufactured by Calmar Dispensing Systems (Watchung, N.J., U.S.A.). It is designed to spray an 8 inch diameter pattern when set on the spray setting and sprayed from a distance of 8 inches. The same sprayer will spray in a 2 inch diameter pattern when set on the stream setting and sprayed from a distance of 8 inches.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations (2) in the patient/practitioner acceptance evaluations, cream B was rated superior to cream A only in ease of application, while cream A was rated superior to cream B for washability, ease of removal and patient perception of wound temperature change. (1) cream A is bioequivalent to cream B. Investigator evaluations of treatment response, infection control, equivalence, wound appearance and overall evaluation did not reveal any significant differences between the two treatments. Likewise, statistical analysis of microbial testing of wound cultures did not produce any significant differences between the treatments; and Results of this study conclude that: For laboratory overall data, patients using cream A had a statistically lower serum sulfadiazine post-treatment level (p=0.0485). A near-significant result (p=0.0524) was noted for patients using cream A at one site. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for urine silver or sulfadiazine concentrations. The results for wound bacterial count did not show any significant differences for either treatment group. At one site, cream A evaluated as having a cooler sensation than cream B at the fourth application (p=0.0170), and when all six application evaluations were averaged (p=0.0404). Near-significant results were noted for cream A in the overall data at the fourth application (p=0.0503), and when all application evaluations were averaged (p=0.0743). At one site, cream A was evaluated as more easily removed than cream B when all six removal evaluations were averaged (p=0.0089). For patient/nurse subjective evaluation,",
