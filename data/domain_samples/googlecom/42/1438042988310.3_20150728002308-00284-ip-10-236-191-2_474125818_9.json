    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62133=The selectively permeable cover should have a pore size range sufficient to prevent cells from moving into or out or the device, but large enough to allow the passage of nutrients, waste products, and therapeutic substances secreted by cells contained within the device. In one embodiment, the characteristic pore size is sufficiently small as to filter or exclude particles on a molecular scale. Such molecular weight cut off (MWCO) properties may be useful for excluding proteins, etc., produced by the immune system of a recipient from traversing the cover and adversely effecting cells encapsulated in the device. The precise MWCO range will vary depending on the membrane material, type of cells contained within the device, the size of the therapeutic cell product to be released into the surrounding environment, and the host environment, etc. Accordingly, selectively permeable covers having a MWCO of between about 10 kD to about 2000 kD may be suitable for use in the present invention. A MWCO range of between about 30 kD and 500 kD is particularly preferred in applications where it is desired to isolate the contained cells from contact with molecules of the immune system capable of recognizing or destroying the contained cells., 18460=This application is a continuation of application Ser.

It should be apparent that changes and modifications may be incorporated and embodied as part of the present invention within the scope of the claims. At two weeks, the devices were explanted from the rats and the cells encapsulated in the devices assayed for viability. Using a neutral red stain, cells in the device were determined to be viable. Devices of Example 5 were implanted in each of three nude rats as follows. Each nude rat received two devices subcutaneously, one on each side of the peritoneal cavity. Each device was loaded with about 1\ufffd105 rat insulinoma cells (RIN) cells. Example 7 Cells encapsulated in devices of Example 5 were cultured in vitro as follows. Two devices were filled with rat insulinoma cells (RIN) cells. Two other devices were filled with CGT-6 cells. The two devices containing RIN cells were cultured in RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The two devices containing the CGT-6 cells were cultured in OP-DMEM media. Each device was cultured in a T-25 tissue culture flask having a volume of about 4 ml of media. The cell containing devices were cultured for 17 days. Media was changed every day in each culture flask. At the end of the culture period, the devices were grossly",
