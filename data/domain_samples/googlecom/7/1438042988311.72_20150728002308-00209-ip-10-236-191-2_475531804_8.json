Overall control of controller 110 is provided by processor 1002 executing instructions from memory 1001 and storing and retrieving data within memory 1001. Processor 1002 is interconnected to bridge interface 1004, display 1006, mass storage 1007, and network interface 1008 via interfaces 1003. Display 1006 allows processor 1001 to display information to the user and receive user inputs. Network interface 1008 provides an interconnection to control computer 101 of FIG. 1. One skilled in the art would readily realize that conference unit 105 could be connected to any switching element of a network such as illustrated in FIG. 1.}",

These changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and without diminishing its intending advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the following claims except insofar as limited by the prior art. could be utilized. FIG. 11 . One skilled in the art could envision many environments where the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2 . However, controller 1101 would provide all control functions. In addition, controller 1101 could also be responsible for the assembly of the combined text information and storage of the audio information; or these functions could be performed by text and audio recording unit 1106. Unit 1106 in certain applications can be combined with controller 1101. Controller 1101 could provide the participant terminals with textual information and audio information resulting from the meeting and provide features such as those described with respect to FIG. 1 illustrates another embodiment of the invention that is designed to be used in a non-telecommunication environment. This embodiment is intended for use with live conferences, courtrooms, or other meetings where it is desirable to have both a text and an audio recording of the proceedings.
