The embodiments may be changed, modified and/or implemented using various types of arrangements. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize various modifications and changes that may be made to the invention without strictly following the exemplary embodiments and applications illustrated and described herein, and without departing from the scope of the invention, which is set forth in the following claims. , it can be seen that a mass storage device in the form of a modular memory card 245, such as CompactFlash\u2122, is provided on both the local control panel 94 and the remote operating panel 52. The modular memory cards 245 can be unplugged and replaced through an access point on the injector device. Using these cards 245 to store application software, calibration data, and device usage data, provides the ability to both download and retrieve the software and data from the injector using a connected computer, and to physically remove and replace the cards 245 containing data. FIG. 2 To provide enhanced flexibility, and minimize downtime in the event of software problems, the above programs and buffers may be provided on a modular memory card 245. Referring to Modular Memory This program 286 operates independently from the circuit 242. Thus, an overtorque situation could result in a shutdown generated by circuit 242, or by the",
