In this endless loop, the command conversion program 1453 is not capable of carrying out communications at all. In the mean time, the NAS-controller management program 1406 gives a notice of a forcible termination of the command conversion program 1453 to the NAS processor 1457 by using a hardware means such as a termination signal at a step 900. The notice of a forcible termination of the command conversion program 1453 causes the NAS controller 145 to enter a state in which the SAN controller 140 is not affected and data is not destroyed even if the power supply of the NAS controller 145 is cut off. Thus, a repair work such as replacement of the NAS controller 145 can be carried out.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{66709=After the NAS controller 145 is initialized, an IPL loads an activation routine of the command conversion program 1453 from a ROM mounted on the NAS controller 145. Since the command conversion program 1453 was installed in a disk drive 150, this IPL cannot load the command conversion program 1453 because the IPL cannot make an access to any disk drive 150. For this reason, the IPL loads the activation routine of the command conversion program 1453 first. The activation routine enters a state of waiting for a notice indicating completion of an initialization of the disk array 105 at a step 600., 83981=In the mean time, at a step 1115, the NAS processor 1457 is in a state of waiting for an other-system activation command processor interrupt, which is peculiar to a multi-processor system. Receiving such an interrupt, the NAS processor 1457 executes a jump to the entry point of the command conversion program 1453 at the next step 1120 to start the execution of the program., 48305=On the other hand, the NAS-controller management program 1406 has a function to activate and stop the NAS controller 145 and to refer to information on a failure in accordance with a management operation carried out on the management terminal 60. The disk-array control program 1405 and the NAS-controller management program 1406 are executed by the SAN processor 1409., 55253=The disk-array control program 1405 operates independently of the function of command conversion program 1453. Thus, even if processing carried out by the command conversion program 1453 can no longer be carried out because of a problem of the command conversion program 1453, the processing of the disk-array control program 1405 can be continued to sustain a process carried out for an I/O command received from a SAN client 30., 68052=Then, at the next step 610, the activation routine informs the NAS-controller management program 1406 that the NAS memory 1452 has been initialized. Subsequently, at the next step 615, the activation routine enters a state of waiting for a notice to be given by the NAS-controller management program 1406. Informed of the fact that the NAS memory 1452 has been initialized at the step 635, the NAS-controller management program 1406 loads the command conversion program 1453 from a disk drive 150 into the NAS memory 1452 at a step 640 by using a means such as the DMA technique. At the next step 645, the NAS-controller management program 1406 notifies the activation routine of the command conversion program 1453 that the operation to load the command conversion program 1453 has been completed., 76538=In addition, since neither an internal network nor a shared memory is required for communications between the NAS controller 145 and the SAN controller 140, the storage system 100 can be implemented at a low hardware cost. Furthermore, since the NAS controller 145 does not require a processor for executing the disk-array control program 1405, the NAS controller 145 can also be implemented at a low hardware cost as well., 53855=As described above, the disk-array control program 1405 is a program having a function for converting a logical block access command into a physical block access command. In this case, a logical block access command is an I/O command received by the storage system 100 from a SAN client 30 by way of the SAN 50 as a command issued for a block unit in a logical volume logically defined as a volume logically comprising a plurality of disks in the disk array 105 of the storage system 100. The logical block access command can also be an I/O command received from the NAS controller 145 as a result of converting a file command. On the other hand, a physical block access command is an I/O command issued to a disk included in the logical volume as a disk corresponding to the logical unit., 69003=Notified of the fact that the operation to load the command conversion program 1453 has been completed at the step 615, the activation routine of the command conversion program 1453 executes a jump to the entry point of the command conversion program 1453 at the next step 620. In this way, the execution of the command conversion program 1453 is started., 71174=If no command to stop the NAS controller 145 is received from the management terminal 60 at the step 705, on the other hand, the flow of the process goes on to a step 725 to determine whether or not a timeout of a heartbeat signal received from the command conversion program 1453 at predetermined intervals has occurred. The occurrence of such a timeout can be interpreted as detection of an abnormality of the NAS controller 145. If an abnormality has been detected, the flow of the process goes on to a step 730 at which NAS commands are discarded from the command queue. Then, at the next step 735, a NAS forcible termination process is carried out. Details of the NAS forcible termination process will also be explained later. After the execution of the NAS planned termination process or the NAS forcible termination process is completed, the flow of the process goes on to a step 712 to transit to a SAN operation mode of processing only SAN commands., 49473=The disk-array control program 1405 executed by the SAN processor 1409 has a function to convert a logical block access command received from the NAS controller 145 into a physical block access command. This conversion is identical with the process to convert a logical block access command received from a fibre-channel controller 1401 into a physical block access command as described above., 73610=After receiving the notice of completion of the planned termination at a step 805, the NAS-controller management program 1406 records the termination of the NAS controller 145 at the next step 810. Thereafter, the NAS controller 145 is not monitored anymore., 47431=A SAN processor 1409 on the SAN controller 140 is a processor for mainly interpreting and executing a disk-array control program 1405 and a NAS-controller management program 1406. The SAN processor 1409 uses a SAN memory 1407, which is connected to a SAN memory controller 1410, as a temporary storage device. The disk-array control program 1405 loaded in the SAN memory 1407 has a function to control a disk controller 1403 by decoding a logical block access command received by a fibre-channel controller 1401 and converting the logical block access command into a physical block access command. The disk-array control program 1405 takes advantage of a disk cache 1402 to increase the speed to generate a response to a logical block access command., 79787=Interfaces of the SAN/NAS controller 1000 with the LAN 40, the SAN 50, the management terminal 60 and the disk apparatus 105 are the same as the interfaces of the SAN controller 140 and the NAS controller 145. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that, in the case of the second embodiment, the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457 share a memory controller 1025 and a memory 1005. The memory 1005 is divided into a NAS-processor-use area 1010 and a SAN-processor-use area 1015., 33348=It is to be noted that aforementioned patent reference 1 is Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-162439. On the other hand, non-patent reference 1 cited above is a reference authored by Stephen Daniel with a title of \u201cConverging SAN and NAS Storage\u2014A Comparison of Unified and Gateway Solutions,\u201d Network Appliance Inc., White Paper, October 2002., 55758=Thus, a maintenance work can be carried out by stopping only the NAS function. In addition, it is also possible to provide a configuration including a plurality of processors for executing the disk-array control program 1405. By designating only some of the processors as processors for an I/O command transferred from the command conversion program 1453, the SAN performance can be sustained at at least a predetermined level even if the NAS load becomes heavier. Likewise, even if the SAN load reversely becomes heavier, the NAS performance can be sustained at at least a predetermined level., 51931=If a file command received from a NAS client 20 is a command making a request to read out data from the storage system 100, on the other hand, a logical block access command obtained as a result of a conversion of the file command in accordance with the procedure described above is transferred to the SAN communication-use area 1404. Subsequently, the disk-array control program 1405 reads out the data from a disk drive 150, storing the data in the disk cache 1402. Finally, the disk-array control program 1405 transfers the data stored in the disk cache 1402 to the file cache 1454 in accordance with the logical block access command transferred to the SAN communication-use area 1404., 51247=If a file command received from a NAS client 20 is a command making a request to write data into the storage system 100, the data is temporarily stored in a file cache 1454. Then, a logical block access command obtained as a result of a conversion of the file command in accordance with the procedure described above is transferred to the SAN communication-use area 1404. Subsequently, the disk-array control program 1405 transfers the data stored in a file cache 1454 to the disk cache 1402 in accordance with the logical block access command transferred to the SAN communication-use area 1404., 67837=Receiving the notice indicating the completion of the initialization of the disk array 105, the activation routine initializes the NAS memory 1452 at a step 605., 75070=This embodiment has a configuration in which the operation of the SAN controller 140 serving as hardware with the SAN function is not dependent on the operation of the NAS controller 145 serving as hardware with the NAS function. Thus, the operation of the SAN function can be continued in the event of a failure of the NAS function without being affected by the failure. Examples of the failure of the NAS function include a hardware failure of the NAS controller 145 and a software failure of the command conversion program 1453. In addition, a maintenance work can be carried out by carrying out a planned termination of the NAS function, which can be resumed later after the work. That is to say, the disk-array control program 1405 executed by the SAN processor 1409 mounted on the SAN controller 140 is capable of operating to accept an I/O command received from the SAN 50 as a command issued for a block unit. The disk-array control program 1405 is capable of processing such an I/O command independently of the existence of a logical block access command received from the NAS controller 145. As described earlier, the logical block access command received from the NAS controller 145 is a command obtained as a result of a conversion process of an I/O command, which is received by the NAS controller 145 as a command issued for a file unit., 80432=Executed by the NAS processor 1457, the command conversion program 1453 has a function to interpret a file command received by the LAN controller 1451 and convert the file command into a logical block access command. The command conversion program 1453 supplies the logical block access command resulting from the conversion to the SAN processor 1409. The command conversion program 1453 executed by the NAS processor 1457 supplies the resulting logical block access command to the SAN processor 1409 by way of a shared memory 1020, which is used by the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457 to exchange data with each other. The disk-array control program 1405 recognizes a logical block access command supplied by the SAN processor 1409 by polling or a processor interrupt, and converts the logical block access command into a physical block access command in the same way as the first embodiment., 83052=In this embodiment, since the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457 share the memory controller 1025, it is impossible to activate and stop only the command conversion program 1453 by using a hardware means. Thus, before the command conversion program 1453 is activated or reactivated, first of all, the NAS-controller management program 1406 clears the contents of the NAS-processor-use area 1010 to all zeros at a step 1100. Then, at the next step 1105, the NAS-controller management program 1406 copies data stored in a disk used by the command conversion program 1453 to the NAS-processor-use area 1010. Subsequently, at the next step 1110, by using an interrupt, the NAS-controller management program 1406 informs the NAS processor 1457 that the copy process has been completed., 81463=Devices provided on the SAN/NAS controller 1000 as devices other than the memory controller 1025 and the memory 1005 are not shared by the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457. To be more specific, the SAN processor 1409 exclusively uses the fibre-channel controller 1401, the disk cache 1402 and the disk controller 1403. On the other hand, the NAS processor 1457 exclusively uses the LAN controller 1451. A route in an interrupt controller embedded in the memory controller 1025 is set to apply interrupts generated by devices exclusively used by the SAN processor 1409 to the SAN processor 1409 and interrupts generated by devices exclusively used by the NAS processor 1457 to the NAS processor 1457., 52722=A logical block access command and data can be exchanged between the NAS controller 145 and the SAN controller 140 through a bus connected to the connector 160 provided on the SAN controller 140 as a connector used for mounting the NAS controller 145. In addition, the NAS controller 145 can be plugged onto and removed out off the connector 160 while the SAN controller 140 is operating. A PCI bus is a typical bus satisfying such conditions. It is also possible to provide a configuration in which a plurality of NAS controllers 145 is mounted on the SAN controller 140. In such a configuration, as many inter-processor communication controllers 1408 as the NAS controllers 145 are provided on the SAN controller 140 as components for controlling communications between the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS controllers 145. In addition, it is also possible to provide a configuration in which the inter-processor communication controller 1408 is provided on the NAS controller 145., 54726=On the other hand, the command conversion program 1453 is a program having a function for converting an I/O command received by the storage system 100 from a NAS client 20 by way of the LAN 40 as a command issued for a file unit into an I/O command referred to as the logical block access command issued for a block unit to be eventually converted by the disk-array control program 1405 into an aforementioned physical block access command as described above., 48749=A NAS processor 1457 on the NAS controller 145 is a processor for mainly interpreting and executing a command conversion program 1453. The NAS processor 1457 uses a NAS memory 1452, which is connected to a NAS memory controller 1456, as a temporary storage device. The command conversion program 1453 loaded in the NAS memory 1452 has a function to decode a file command received by a LAN controller 1451 and convert the file command into a logical block access command. The command conversion program 1453 supplies the logical block access command obtained as a result of the conversion to the SAN processor 1409., 49927=In an operation to transfer a logical block access command from the NAS processor 1457 to the SAN processor 1409, the command conversion program 1453 controls an inter-processor communication controller 1408. To put it in detail, a logical block access command is originally stored in a NAS communication-use area 1455 employed in the NAS controller 145. Controlled by the command conversion program 1453, the inter-processor communication controller 1408 typically carries out a DMA operation to transfer the logical block access command from the NAS communication-use area 1455 to a SAN communication-use area 1404. On the other hand, status indicating a result of the execution of a command is reversely transferred from the SAN communication-use area 1404 to the NAS communication-use area 1455 upon completion of the execution of the command. If the inter-processor communication controller 1408 is provided with an interrupt function for interrupting processes being carried out by the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457, completion of a transfer of a command or status can be reported to the SAN processor 1409 and the NAS processor 1457 immediately., 56399=The command conversion program 1453 and the disk-array control program 1405 for controlling the disk apparatus 105 communicate with each other through an internal bus, requiring neither internal network nor shared memory. Thus, this configuration can be implemented at a low cost., 63625=A logical block access command stored in the SAN communication-use area 1404 as a result of a command conversion process carried out by the command conversion program 1453 is transferred to a NAS-queue location pointed to by a NAS command-queue-tail pointer 510. On the other hand, a logical block access command received from the fibre-channel controller 1401 is transferred to a SAN-queue location pointed to by a SAN command-queue-tail pointer 560., 67413=In the mean time, the started disk-array control program 1405 initializes the disk array 105 at a step 625. After, the initialization of the disk array 105 is completed, the disk-array control program 1405 transmits a notice indicating the completion of the initialization of the disk array 105 to the activation routine at the next step 630.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations is not required. In the case of the second embodiment, however, the NAS-use hardware cannot be replaced while the SAN/NAS controller 1000 is operating without affecting the operation of the SAN function. FIG. 2 The second embodiment employs fewer components than the first embodiment so that the storage system 100 provided by the second embodiment can be implemented at a lower cost. The first embodiment employs two or more sets of a memory controller and its peripheral circuit. On the other hand, the second embodiment can live with only one set of a memory controller and its peripheral circuit. In addition, in the case of the second embodiment, the shared memory 1020 shared by the NAS processor 1457 and the SAN processor 1409 is used for inter-processor communications. Thus, the hardware such as the inter-processor communication controller 1408 of the configuration shown in In the mean time, at a step 1115, the NAS processor 1457 is in a state of waiting for an other-system activation command processor interrupt, which is peculiar to a multi-processor system. Receiving such an interrupt, the NAS processor 1457 executes a jump to the entry point of the command conversion program 1453 at the next step 1120 to start the execution of the program.
