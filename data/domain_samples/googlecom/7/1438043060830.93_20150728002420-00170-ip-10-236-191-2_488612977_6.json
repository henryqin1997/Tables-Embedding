    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Note that the needle is not needed to draw a dose from a container for mixing prior to injection and inserting into a second container. This virtually eliminates the possibility of contamination and loss of sterility of the needle. In cases where special formulations must be used, for example in a hospital, the container may be supplied empty and filled by the pharmacist. This takes the guesswork away from the nurse administering the dose, since the container is designed to hold a single measured dose only and is disposable. The construction shown in FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 has the additional advantage of keeping the inventories low. A common diluent can serve many combinations. Other advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art. The present invention thus provides a premeasured dose of a medication in a sterile container which also doubles as a syringe by itself or with a holder. Adrenalin, pain killers, local anesthesia, sedatives, antibiotics, serum, etc., are a few of the medicines which can be provided in premeasured doses. Since the unit is self-contained and sterilized at the point of assembly, the time consuming preparation for an injection is virtually eliminated. The proper medication and dosage is selected the sterile package is opened, and the injection is ready to be administered. The construction is fairly simple and economical. Where rapidly decomposing solutions must be used,",
