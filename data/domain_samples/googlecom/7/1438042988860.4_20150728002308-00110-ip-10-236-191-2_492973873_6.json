    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58433=In the present embodiment, the identification mark is formed by a material which generates an infrared fluorescent light when excited by the infrared ray (12202 in FIG. 24). Thus, the characteristic of the identification mark to the visible ray can be set to any desired value. In the present embodiment, the infrared fluorescent ink which exhibits a substantially transparent characteristic with respect to the visible ray is used so that the infrared fluorescent light is detected without being recognized by a user of the apparatus because the presence of the identification mark in the reproduction inhibited document sheet and the fact that the document sheet is the specific document sheet having the reproduction thereof inhibited is detected., 81938=FIG. 9 shows a process flow of the CPU control. In FIG. 9, the mode 1 for the first scan is set to the CPU in a step 1001., 84344=On the other hand, if the possibility of forgery is present in the step 1009, that is, when the fluorescent mark is detected, the measure to inhibit the forgery is taken in a step 1011. Specifically, the CPU sets FFH to the register 408 of FIG. 4B (which normally stores 00H) so that FFH is sent to the printer and the Y and Bk toners are deposited on the entire surface to prevent normal reproduction., 83918=In a step 1008, the fluorescent mark is discriminated by an algorithm to be described later. In a step 1009, a determination is made, and if a possibility of forgery is null, that is, if the fluorescent mark is not detected, the third scan and the fourth scan are conducted in a step 1010 and the image is developed by four color toners Y, M, C and Bk in a normal operation, and it is fixed in a step 1012., 83744=In a step 1007, the second scan is conducted and binarized fluorescent signal from a broken line area including the fluorescent mark of FIG. 1 is written., 86438=Then, a similarity measure is calculated by a standard pattern matching. In a step 2105, a standard pattern registered as a dictionary is read from the ROM 418 of FIG. 4B into the CPU. The standard pattern is the fluorescent pattern of the reproduction inhibited document sheet under consideration. The pattern extracted before the step 2103 may have been rotated depending on the angle of the document sheet mounted on the platen, and when it is compared with a single standard pattern, a satisfactory result may not be attained., 60958=Since the filter which blocks the wavelength of less than 700 nm is mounted on the IR sensor 210-1 as shown in FIG. 16, only the infrared fluorescent component 12203 of FIG. 24 is read. By this filter, the infrared fluorescent light can be extracted in parallel with the reading of the document sheet and the recording of the image, and an extra document sheet scan for detecting only the identification mark by the infrared fluorescent light by the pre-scan is not necessary. For a malicious user who may not place a reproduction inhibited document sheet in the pre-scan but may place it in the real scan, the reproduction is effectively inhibited in the present embodiment., 54471=A solid line characteristic curve 261 in FIG. 18 shows a spectroscopic characteristic of a conventional visible ray CCD. It exhibits a drop of sensitivity of approximately 20% for an infrared ray of 800 nm having a peak at 550 nm. The thickness of the p-layer of the R, G and B sensors having the characteristic 261 is approximately 1000 nm., 82774=In a step 1006, the mode 2 is set for the second scan. Namely, the selector 411 is set to B, the selector 413 is set to A and the selectors 415 and 416 are set to B., 85472=To this area, a process of steps 2102 et seq is executed. In a step 2102, a window process for eliminating noise is conducted., 54832=In the present embodiment, the CCD of the IR read sensor 210-1 has a p-layer which is thicker than other CCD's 210-2 to 210-4 of the R, G and B sensors on the same silicon chip so that it has a sensitivity to the infrared ray. Namely, the thickness of the p-layer of the IR sensor 210-1 is approximately 1500 nm so that it has a peak sensitivity to infrared rays having a wavelength of 700 nm to 800 nm. The spectroscopic characteristic of the IR sensor of the present embodiment is shown by 262 in FIG. 18., 84802=The pattern matching of the fluorescent mark in the step 1008 is explained in detail. Where the fluorescent mark is applied to a bill, the marks may be different between a front surface and a back surface. Accordingly, two fluorescent mark patterns are registered for the pattern matching in order to determine one type of reproduction inhibited document sheet., 57468=In FIG. 24, numeral 12201 denotes a spectroscopic characteristic which is a combination with the infrared ray block filter 208 arranged between the halogen lamp 205 and the platen glass 203. An infrared ray component 12202, near approximately 700 nm, of the spectroscopic characteristic is used as excitation light and the infrared fluorescent light having a peak at approximately 800 nm, is detected from the identification mark shown by 12203 to identify the reproduction inhibited document sheet. In the present embodiment, the halogen lamp is used as a document sheet illumination lamp which simultaneously emits at least the visible ray and the excitation light component to the infrared fluorescent light, and the filter 208 is applied thereto to prevent the wavelength component (12203 in FIG. 24) of the infrared fluorescent light (the reflected light from the document sheet) from reading the document sheet plane from the halogen lamp., 85618=It is assumed that the binary image of the area 1 is that shown by 2201 in FIG. 11 in which a small square represents one pixel, a blank pixel represents a white pixel, and a hatched pixel represents a black pixel. They are scanned by a 2\ufffd2 pixel window 2202 and the number of black pixels in the window is counted, and if the count exceeds 2, a new black pixel is defined. In this manner, the process result is reduced by a factor of 2 vertically and horizontally as shown by 2203 and a noise reduced pattern is produced. Since the number of black pixel is 1 at 2202, it is defined as a white pixel at 2204., 86328=This is done by a known method by vertically and horizontally projecting the pattern 2203., 86246=Then, a center of gravity 1 of the pattern 2203 is calculated., 82080=In a step 1002, the first scan is started. In the mode 1, the printer outputs in magenta and detects a coarse center position of the fluorescent mark area in the reproduction inhibited document sheet., 88878=As the similarity is calculated in this manner, the COR is compared with the predetermined Th in a step 2107., 31425=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/139,173, Oct. 21, 1993, now abandoned.}",
