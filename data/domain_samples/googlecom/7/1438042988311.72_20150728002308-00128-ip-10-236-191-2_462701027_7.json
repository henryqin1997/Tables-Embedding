    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated that various of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Also that various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims. The modular architecture enables a wide range of marking engines to be selectively employed in the same system. The marking engines can involve a variety of types and processing speeds. The modular architecture can provide redundancy for marking engines and paths. The modular architecture can utilize as little as a single media source on the input side, a single printer module and a single finisher on the output side. It is to be appreciated that an advantage of the system is that it can achieve very high productivity, using marking processes in elements that do not have to run at high speeds and marking/finishing processes that can continue to run while other marking engines are being serviced or replaced. Although not shown, other examples of the modular architecture can include an odd number of marking engines. For example, three marking engines can be configured such that two are aligned vertically and two are aligned horizontally, wherein one of the marking engines is common to both the vertical and horizontal alignment.
