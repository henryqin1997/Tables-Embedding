The mood-based reporting system then may present the results to a system administrator and enable the system administrator to control future content selection using the reported relative efficacy information. The reporting system may present results using different mood metrics. For example, a first report may be based on only the mood of the content while a second report may gauge the user interaction with the media player. The reporting system then may analyze the differences, and interpret the variation. The interpretation of the variation then may be used by a system administrator to plan future programming. [0093] The mood based-playlisting system may include a detailed records system for reporting and accounting. For example, the mood-based playlisting system may record the moods of the user, the mood transition between tracks, and the percentage of users that are retained for the transition. Other records may include advertising effectiveness based on the mood, and user listening habits (e.g., duration, user preferences). The records may be refined in an automated manner to develop mood trending information. The mood-based playlisting system may generate automated reports for system administrators and advertisers to improve the enjoyment, effectiveness, and/or success of the mood-based playlisting system. This may include a report indicating that a different programming sequence may result",
