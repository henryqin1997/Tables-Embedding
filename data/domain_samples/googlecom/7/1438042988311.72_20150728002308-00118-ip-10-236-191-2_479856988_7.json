Fibrin can be split up by plasmin, where a multitude of plasmin molecules can diffuse through aqueous channels in the fibrin clot to cut the connector rods that comprise the fibrin. In order to form plasmin, tPA binds to a component of the clot called fibrin and activates plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin degrades components of the clot and other proteins that promote the blood clotting.}",

While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims. The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for more completely removing an occlusion 16 by using a pharmacological agent in conjunction with an ultrasonic probe 15 to enhance an occlusion treating effect of the ultrasonic probe 15. The pharmacological agent is delivered through a plurality of fenestrations 13 of the catheter 36 and treats the occlusion 16 at the site of the occlusion 16 and continues to travel downstream of the site of the occlusion 16. The combination of the pharmacological agent and the transverse vibrations of the ultrasonic probe 15 breaks up the occlusion 16 into a particulate downstream of the site of the occlusion 16 and continues to treat the particulate and breaks up the particulate into an aggregate to a size that is easily removed from the body in conventional ways. The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for more completely removing an occlusion that is safe, simple, efficient, effective, user-friendly, reliable and cost effective. The present invention also provides a method",
