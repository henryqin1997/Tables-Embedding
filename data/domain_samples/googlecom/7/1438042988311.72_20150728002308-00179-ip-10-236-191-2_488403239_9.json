These would be used in combinations, since each can be expected to have a different Zeta potential in contact with the enabling fluid. These materials are also generally suitable for the fabrication of the other parts of rotatable element 200, as described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/427,656, herein incorporated by reference. A suitable magnetic pigment which may be incorporated into rotatable element 200 is magnetic pigment type 031182 by Wright Industries, Brooklyn, N.Y., either alone or in conjunction with other pigments known in the art, such as AKER CHEMICAL Cresyl violet blue, BAKER CHEMICAL Rhodamine 6G, DUPONT Rhodamine BI, DUPONT Spirit Blue NS, DUPONT Victoria Blue B base, ALLIED CHEMICALS losol Blue, EASTMAN Acridine orange, CALCO OIL blue N, and CALCO OIL black, DUPONT R900 titanium dioxide, FERRO 6331 black pigment, CABOT MOGUL L carbon black, and CABOT MONARCH 1000 carbon black., 76735=Lee (L. L. Lee, \u201cA Magnetic Particles Display,\u201d IEEE Trans. On Elect. Devices, Vol. ED-22, Number 9, September 1975 and L. L. Lee, \u201cMatrix Addressed Magnetic Particles Display,\u201d in 1977 Soc. For Information Display International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, Boston, April 1977) has described the addressing of a twisting rotating element display in which the rotatable elements have a magnetic dipole with magnetic fields. U.S. Pat. No. 3,036,388 by Tate, and issued in May 1962 uses a stylus consisting of a magnetic dipole to address a display consisting of magnetized particles having black and white surfaces corresponding to a given magnetic polarity. More recently, U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,398 by Nakanishi et al. and entitled \u201cMagnetic Display System\u201d describes the use of a magnetic dipole to address a display consisting of black ferromagnetic particles and white, non-magnetic particles dispersed in an oil and in turn contained in microcapsules arranged in a layer. Upon application of a magnetic dipole, the black ferromagnetic particles are pushed to the rear of the microcapsules, revealing only the white particles, or pulled to the front of the microcapsules so that mostly only the black ferromagnetic particles can be seen by an observer., 49561=For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,854 entitled \u201cTwisting Ball Panel Display\u201d issued Nov. 21, 1978, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,143,103 entitled \u201cMethod Of Making A Twisting Ball Display,\u201d issued Mar. 6, 1979, both by Sheridon, describe a rotating element sheet material that comprises bichromal rotatable elements contained in fluid-filled cavities and embedded in an elastomer medium. One segment of the bichromal rotatable elements has a larger electrical charge in contact with the fluid and in the presence of the electrical field than the other segment. Thus, for a given polarity of applied electrical field, one segment will rotate toward and be visible to an observer of the display. Applying the opposite polarity of electrical field will cause the rotatable element to rotate and present the other segment to be seen by the observer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations depict composite rotatable-elements with four aspects. However, the rotatable-elements may exhibit any number of aspects. Furthermore, the aspects associated with different sides of a prismatically shaped core may be chosen not to be distinguishable. Further still, the rotatable elements of the present invention were described as comprising aspect-transparent cladding. However, one skilled in the art should appreciate that the rotatable elements of the present invention may also be fabricated without aspect-transparent cladding. Accordingly, the rotatable elements may simply comprise, for example, a substantially cylindrical core with a suitable choice of coatings or material in order to present any number of aspects to a favorably situated observer and to exhibit the appropriate addressing polarity. Accordingly, one skilled in the art should appreciate that by a suitable construction of rotatable elements with rotatable latching components, any of the multiaspect surfaces may be oriented towards a favorably situated observer. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, but instead is defined by the appended claims in light of their full scope of equivalents. FIGS. 23-30 Methods and apparatus consistent with the present invention can be used to address rotating element sheet material with a gradient field stylus. The foregoing description of an implementation of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not exhaustive and does not limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and",
