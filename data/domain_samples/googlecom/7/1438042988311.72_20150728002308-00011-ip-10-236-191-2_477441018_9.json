The sections were incubated with primary antibody (anti-apo(a) immunosorbed on plasminogen, from Immunex, 1:1000 dilution; anti-total TGF-beta BDA47, from R&D Systems, 1:200 dilution; MBPIIIB10 anti-osteopontin antibody, from NIHDSHB, 1:200 dilution) in TBS+3% BSA. Sections were washed 3\ufffd3 min in PBS, then incubated with fluorescent-labeled second antibody for 2 h. After washing 3\ufffd3 min and mounting, bound fluorescence was quantitated by image analysis. Two markers could be examined on the same section using fluorescein and rhodamine as distinct fluorescent labels with different excitation and emission characteristics., 113802=For determination of activated plasminogen, sections were incubated for 16 h with \u03b12-AP-FITC (1 \u03bcg/ml) and washed. For determination of total plasminogen, the sections were incubated with \u03bc2-AP-FITC, as above, washed thoroughly in TBS containing 0.2% Nonidet-P40 (NP-40) and 300 mM NaCl (wash buffer), and then incubated with 1 mg/ml recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in TBS for 3 h to activate the plasminogen. The sections were washed, incubated for 16 h with \u03b12-AP-TRITC (1 \u03bcg/ml), then washed throughly in wash buffer, followed by TBS. Bound labeled \u03b12-AP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy at 400\ufffd magnification (\u03bbexc=440nm; \u03bbem=510nm for FITC label; \u03bbexc=490nm; \u03bbem=580nm for TRITC label). The low level of background autofluorescence from the acetone-fixed sections was subtracted for each section from the fluorscence of the label. There were no significant differences in the autofluorescence intensity either between sections from the same mouse aorta, or between normal litter mate aortic sections and those from transgenic apo(a) mice. Photomicrographs of bound \u03b12-AP-FITC to detect active plasmin were exposed for 10 sec, and of bound \u03b12-AP-TRITC to detect plasminogen were exposed for 1 sec (1600 ASA)., 94471=Heparins. An unfractionated, high molecular weight, anticoagulant pig mucosal heparin, fragments of heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity, and fragments of heparin with anticoagulant activity were tested. In addition, heparin coupled to agarose beads (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was examined (see also Grainger et al., Cardiovascular Res. 27:2238-47, 1993)., 52103=For TGF-beta activators or production stimulators, such as tamoxifen, several exemplary dosing regimens are contemplated, depending upon the condition being treated and the stage to which the condition has progressed. For prophylactic purposes with respect to atherosclerosis, for example, a low chronic dose sufficient to elevate in vivo TGF-beta production is contemplated. An exemplary dose of this type is about 0.1 mg/kg/day (ranging between about 0.1 and about 10 mg/kg/day). Another exemplary dose range is from about 0.01 to about 1000 micrograms/ml. Such low doses are also contemplated for use with respect to ameliorating stenosis following relatively low trauma injury or intervention, such as vein grafts or transplants or organ allografts, for example. No adverse side effects (e.g., nausea as experienced by recipients of higher dose administrations when tamoxifen has been employed in the treatment of breast cancer) are anticipated with respect to these chronic or low dosing regimens., 85940=RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells as described in Kemp et al., Biochem. J., 277: 285-288, 1991. Northern analysis was performed by electrophoresis of total cytoplasmic RNA in 1.5% agarose gels in a buffer containing 2.2M formaldehyde, 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium acetate and 0.5 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide. The integrity of the RNA was checked by visualizing the gel under UV illumination prior to transfer onto Hybond N (available from Pharmacia LKB) as specified by the manufacturer. Filters were hybridized as described in Kemp et al., Biochem. J., 277: 285-288, 1991, using a 32 P!-oligolabeled mouse TGF-betal probe corresponding to amino acids 68-228 in the precursor region of the TGF-betal polypeptide as set forth in Millan et al., Development, 111: 131-144., 83786=Assays for TGF-Beta. The TGF-beta activity present in medium conditioned on various cells was determined by DNA synthesis assay on mink lung endothelial (MvLu) cells; a modification of the assay described in Danielpour et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 138: 79-83, 1989. MvLu cells were subcultured at 1:5 dilution in DMEM+10% FCS. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with the conditioned medium to be tested in the absence or presence of the neutralizing antiserum to TGF-beta at 10 micrograms/ml. DNA synthesis during a 1 hour pulse of 3 H!-thymidine (5 microcuries/ml) was determined 23 hours after addition of the test medium. TGF-beta activity was calculated as the proportion of the inhibition of DNA synthesis which was reversed in the presence of neutralizing antibody, using a standard curve to convert the inhibition values into quantities of TGF-beta. The TGF-betal standards and conditioned media both contained 10% FCS in DMEM., 107540=The effect of heparin on proliferation of human ED and EX cultures was examined. Heparin IC86-1771, known to inhibit proliferation of rat ED VSMC by releasing a TGF-beta-like activity from serum, partially inhibited the proliferation of human EX cultures, but not ED cultures. At 100 \u03bcg/ml and at 48 h after addition, heparin inhibited the increase in cell number in EX cultures by 51\ufffd10%; at 96 h after addition, by 71\ufffd15%. In ED cultures at 96 h after addition of 100 \u03bcg/ml heparin, the increase in cell number was inhibited by 8\ufffd5%. Anti-TGF-beta antibody did not abolish the ability of heparin to inhibit the proliferation of human EX cultured VSMC. Therefore, human EX VSMC may release more TGF-beta from 20% FCS than could be neutralized by added antibody, or heparin affected TGF-beta DNA synthesis as well as TGF-beta activation at the heparin concentrations tested., 80789=Rat adventitial fibroblasts were cultured as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 283: 403-408, 1992. Briefly, the aortae were treated with collagenase (3 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37\ufffd C. The tunica adventitia was stripped away from the media. The adventitia was dispersed for 2 hours in elastase (1 mg/ml) and collagenase (3 mg/ml) dissolved in medium M199 (available from ICN/Flow). The cells were then spun out (900\ufffdg, 3 minutes), resuspended in DMEM+10% FCS and plated out at 8\ufffd104 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plastic. When the cells reached confluence (after about 10 days), they were subcultured as described for vascular smooth muscle cells. Adventitial fibroblasts were subcultured every 3 days at 1:3 dilution and used between passages 3 and 9., 53125=For prevention of restenosis following angioplasty, an example of a higher trauma injury or intervention resulting in a stronger acute proliferative stimulus to smooth muscle cells, a higher dose would be required. For example, a dosing regimen is contemplated which involves a single \"pre-loading\" dose (or multiple, smaller pre-loading doses) given before or at the time of the intervention, with a chronic smaller (follow up) dose delivered daily for two to three weeks or longer following intervention. For example, a single pre-loading dose may be administered about 24 hours prior to intervention, while multiple preloading doses may be administered daily for several days prior to intervention. Alternatively, one or more pre-loading doses may be administered about 1-4 weeks prior to intervention. These doses will be selected so as to maximize TGF-beta activator or production stimulator activity, while minimizing induction of synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. An exemplary single pre-loading dose is about 50 mg/kg (ranging between about 10 and about 1000 mg/kg), while an exemplary multiple pre-loading individual dose is about 10 mg/kg/day (ranging between about 0.01 and 10 mg/kg/day)., 19184=For example, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is widely used as the primary treatment modality in many patients with coronary artery disease. PTCA can relieve myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease by reducing lumen obstruction and improving coronary flow. The use of this surgical procedure has grown rapidly, with 39,000 procedures performed in 1983, nearly 150,000 in 1987, 200,000 in 1988, 250,000 in 1989, and over 500,000 PTCAs per year are estimated by 1994. Stenosis following PTCA remains a significant problem, with from 25% to 35% of the patients developing restenosis within 1 to 3 months. Restenosis results in significant morbidity and mortality and frequently necessitates further interventions such as repeat angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery. No surgical intervention or post-surgical treatment (to date) has proven effective in preventing restenosis., 131568=In contrast, intimal SMC derived from rats 14 days after balloon injury to the carotid artery have a greater (\u22485 fold) uptake of LDL, due to increased LDL receptor numbers (1500-2000 receptors/cell). When intimal cells or neonatal cells (displaying very similar properties) are treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta for 48 h, these cells modulate, apparently irreversibly, to the adult phenotype. This phenotypic modulation is accompanied by a down-regulation of LDL receptors (\u2248800 receptors/cell), with a reduction of LDL uptake of >80%. The presence of TGF-beta may therefore reduce lipid accumulation by SMC., 81589=DNA synthesis was assayed by 3 H!-thymidine incorporation as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 277:145-151, 1991. Vascular smooth muscle cells were subcultured, grown in DMEM+10% FCS for 24 hours, made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 48 hours and restimulated with 10% FCS at \"0\" hours. 3 H!-thymidine (5 microcuries/ml; available from Amersham International) was added 12 hours after restimulation and the cells were harvested after 24 hours. DNA synthesis by adventitial fibroblasts was determined similarly, except that the cells were made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours., 35644=Lp(a) consists of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and apo(a). Apo(a) shares approximately 80% amino acid identity with plasminogen (see MacLean et al., Nature, 330: 132, 1987). Lp(a) has been found to inhibit cell-associated plasminogen activity (see, for example, Harpel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86: 3847, 1989). Experiments conducted on human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells derived from healthy transplant donor tissue, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM)+10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 283: 403, 1992, indicated the following:, 111212=Briefly, transgenic apo(a) mice, confirmed for the presence of the apo(a) gene by Southern blotting, and normal litter mates were obtained by continued crossing of transgenic mice with C57/B16\ufffdSJL hybrids. The heart and attached aorta were dissected out, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded, and 6 \u03bcm frozen sections were prepared. The sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 90 seconds and stored at -20\ufffd C. until used. All fluorescent labeling procedures were performed at 4\ufffd C. For apo(a) immunolabeling, sections were incubated with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30 min, then with sheep anti-human Lp(a) antibody that had been adsorbed against human plasminogen diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 3% BSA. The anti-human Lp(a) antibody had no detectable cross-reactivity with mouse plasminogen. The bound primary antibody was detected using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG diluted 1:80 in TBS containing 3% BSA, and visualized by fluorescence microscopy at 400\ufffd magnification (\u03bbexc=440nm; \u03bbem=510nm); photomicrographs were taken with 5 second exposures (ASA 1600). The tissue sections were indistinguishable whether the mice were fed a normal diet (Techlad, Madison, Wis.; 4% mouse/rat chow) or a lipid-rich diet containing 1.25% cholesterol, 7.5% saturated fat as cocoa butter, 7.5% casein and 0.5% soldium cholate., 79953=Cell culture, DNA synthesis assay and cell counting. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured after enzymatic dispersion of the aortic media from 12-17 week old Wistar rats as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 277: 145-151, 1991. When the cells reached confluence (after about 6 days) the cells were released with trypsin/EDTA (available from Gibco) and diluted 1:2 in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM; available from ICN/Flow) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were then replated on tissue culture plastic (available from ICN/Flow) at approximately 1\ufffd104 cells/cm2. The cells were subcultured repeatedly in this way when confluence was attained (about every 4 days), and the cells were used between passages 6 and 12., 119340=TGF-beta. To determine whether the low plasmin concentration in the aortic wall of the apo(a) mice resulted in reduced activation of TGF-beta, immunofluorescent labels were used to quantitate active TGF-beta and total TGF-beta (active+latent). Briefly, sections prepared as described above were labeled for total TGF-beta for 2 h with 25 \u03bcg/ml of BDA47 (R&D Systems), a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta that detects isoforms 1 and 3 with equal sensitivity, but does not distinguish between latent and active TGF-beta. The sections were washed 3 times in TBS, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:50 dilutaion) conjugated with TRITC. Both antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 3% BSA. The same section was then washed 3 times in TBS and labeled for active TGF-beta with R2X (TGF-beta type II receptor extracellular domain, which recognizes the active form of isoforms 1 and 3 only) that was conjugated with FITC, as described above. Sections were incubated for 16 h, then washed 3 times in PBS. Bound label was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, as described above. Photomicrograph exposures were 5 sec (1600 ASA). To calibrate the fluorescence intensities of the two labels, a solution containing various proportions of active TGF-beta (6 ng/ml of total TGF-beta) was spotted on gelatin-polylysine-coated slides and allowed to dry at room temperature. The protein spots were labeled for total and active TGF-beta, as described for the aortic sections, and the fluorescence intensity ratios (TRITC/FITC) were determined. False color images of the proportion of TGF-beta in the active form were computed from the fluorescence ratios of the aortic sections using the calibration., 82236=Cells were prepared for counting by hemocytometer from triplicate culture dishes as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 277:145-151, 1991. Cells were also counted by direct microscopic observation of gridded culture dishes. The grids were scored into the plastic on the inner surface, so that the cells could not migrate into or out of the area being counted during the experiment. Cells in each of four squares in two separate wells were counted at each time point. All cell counting experiments were repeated on at least three separate cultures., 101763=EX Cultures. The aortic pieces were washed once with D-MEM+10% FCS, resuspended in a small volume of fresh D-MEM+10% FCS, and transferred to culture flasks or Petri dishes. The pieces were allowed to sediment onto the plastic and were evenly distributed (\u22484 pieces/cm2). Cells started to grow out from the explants after 3-7 d in culture. The aortic pieces were removed during the third week in culture, and the cells adhering to the plastic were allowed to grow to confluence for a further week. The cells were then subcultured every 4-5 days by releasing them with trypsin/EDTA and diluting them 1:2 in D-MEM+10% FCS. Subcultured cells were incubated with fresh D-MEM+20% FCS as described for ED cultures., 89856=Based upon these results, it appeared that tamoxifen exhibited effects similar to those previously described for TGF-beta (see, for example, Assoian et al., J. Cell. Biol., 109: 441-448, 1986) with respect to proliferation of subcultured vascular smooth muscle cells in the presence of serum. Tamoxifen is known to induce TGF-beta activity in cultures of breast carcinoma cell lines as described, for example, in Knabbe, et al., Cell, 48: 417-425, 1987. Consequently, experimentation was conducted to determine whether tamoxifen decreased the rate of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by inducing TGF-beta activity. When quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells were stimulated with 10% FCS in the presence of 50 micromolar tamoxifen and 10 micrograms/ml neutralizing antiserum against TGF-beta, the cells proliferated at the same rate as control cells in the presence of ethanol vehicle alone., 88753=To determine whether tamoxifen increased the duration of the cell cycle of vascular smooth muscle cells by increasing the duration of the G0 to S phase, the effect of tamoxifen on entry into DNA synthesis was analyzed. Tamoxifen at concentrations up to 50 micromolar did not significantly affect the time course or the proportion of cells entering DNA synthesis following serum stimulation of quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (DNA synthesis between 12 hours and 24 hours after stimulation was measured by 3 H!-thymidine incorporation: control at 17614+/-1714 cpm; 10 micromolar tamoxifen at 16898+/-3417 cpm; and 50 micromolar tamoxifen at 18002+/-4167 cpm). Since the duration of S phase is approximately 12 hours (unpublished data), tamoxifen does not appear to have significantly impacted the time course of entry into DNA synthesis. These results therefore imply that tamoxifen decreases the rate of proliferation of serum-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells by increasing the time taken to traverse the G2 to M phase of the cell cycle., 101153=ED Cultures. The aortic pieces were washed once with serum-free Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, then enzyme-dispersed with collagenase and elastase, as described in Example 1. The cells were plated at an initial density of 1.5\ufffd105 cells/cm2 and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 in air. The cells were subcultured every 6-7 days (at stationary phase) by releasing them with trypsin/EDTA and diluting them 1:1.5 in D-MEM+10% FCS. Subcultured ED cells were cultured with D-MEM+20% FCS 24 h after plating, and thereafter at 48 h intervals., 97905=Heparin and smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain expression. Previous studies demonstrated that primary VSMC in culture lose both the 204 kD (SM-1) and the 200 kD (SM-2) isoforms of SM-MHC, whether the VSMC are cultured in serum or in serum-free medium onto fibronectin. In primary cultures stimulated by serum, 100 \u03bcg/ml heparin substantially inhibited the loss of both SM-1 and SM-2 proteins in all cells, as assayed by direct immunoperoxidase staining or Western blotting (Cell Tissues Res. 257:1137-39, 1989; Biochem. J. 277:145-51, 1991). If the cells were plated in serum-free medium onto fibronectin, the normal loss of SM-1 and MS-2 proteins was unaffected by the presence of heparin. The effect of heparin in preventing the de-differentiation of primary VSMC in serum was completely reversed by the addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml), indicating that this heparin effect was also mediated by TGF-beta-like activity. Although heparin prevented the loss of smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain from primary VSMC in the presence of serum, it did not promote its reexpression. Moreover, heparin did not promote reexpression of SM-MHC in subcultured cells that exhibit very low levels of this protein. Thus, the effects of heparin and TGF-beta on the expression of SM-MHC in primary VSMC are similar., 18077=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/061,714, filed May 13, 1993, now abandoned., 123155=Osteopontin. Aortic sections were assayed for osteopontin, a marker of activated smooth muscle cells. Osteopontin was detected by incubating sections with monoclonal antibody MPIIIB101 (National Institute of Health Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 10 \u03bcg/ml in TBS containing 3% BSA for 16 h. The sections were washed 3 times in TBS, and bound antibody was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein (Sigma F-2012; 1:50 dilution; 2 h). Photomicrographs were obtained with 2.5 sec exposure time (ASA 1600).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While in the foregoing specification this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for purposes of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein may be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention. e. All of these noted effects should contribute to some degree to the predicted beneficial effects of TMX on atherosclerosis and its progression of clinical significance and myocardial infarction. d. TMX and TGF-beta should decrease SMC proliferation. c. TMX and TGF-beta should stimulate ECM production. b. TMX and TGF-beta should reduce or inhibit migration and lipid accumulation by SMC. a. Atherosclerosis results from at least five processes (migration; lipid accumulation; ECM formation; inflammation; proliferation). The relative contribution of each process, and of their interactions, is not clear. These data suggest the following conclusions: The data obtained with apo(a) transgenic mice are consistent with this prediction. In these mice, apo(a) is accumulated at high levels at the intimal surface of the aorta. TGF-beta activation is strongly down-regulated from >80% in control aortas to <20% in apo(a) aortas. Lipid accumulation occured at these sites in transgenic mice that were fed a lipid-rich diet and had elevated circulating LDL levels. Thus, reduced TGF-beta activity correlates with increased SMC accumulation of LDL from",
