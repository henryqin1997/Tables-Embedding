More specifically, FIG. 6A depicts PaO2, FIG. 6B depicts PaCO2, FIG. 6C depicts arterial pH, and FIG. 6D depicts base excess. As indicated in FIGS. 6A\u2013C, neither the PEGHb nor the PEGHb+pentastarch animals had significant respiratory alkalosis compared to the pentastarch animals. Moreover, neither the PEGHb nor the PEGHb+pentastarch animals developed significant acidosis, even at the end of the hemorrhage period. Acid base status was well preserved in the PEGHb and PEGHb+pentastarch animals (FIG. 6D). Again, neither of the compositions comprising \u03b1\u03b1-Hb performed as well as PEGHb+pentastarch animals or the pentastarch animals.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{292990=The animals were instrumented 24 hours prior to initiation of experiments, and all experiments were conducted in the awake state. A catheter was placed in the femoral artery and another in the femoral vein. The animal was restrained in an experimental cage. First, an exchange transfusion was performed in which about 50% of the blood of the animal was removed and replaced with a test composition; the test compositions assessed were pentastarch, HEMOLINK\ufffd and a HEMOLINK\ufffd/pentastarch mixture (50:50 by volume). A peristaltic pump was used to simultaneously withdraw blood and infuse one of the test compositions at a rate of 0.5 mL/min. The duration of the exchange was calculated to achieve exchange of 50% of the estimated total blood volume, based on 65 mL of blood per kg body weight as the standard blood volume of the rat., 265749=Several of the previous examples were directed at the use of the \u201cawake hamster\u201d model to determine i) partial oxygen pressures in arteries, veins and tissue, and ii) blood pressure in normal blood (control) with HEMOLINK\ufffd at hematocrit 0.4, and 50:50 dextran:HEMOLINK\ufffd at hematocrit 0.4. This example is directed at the determination of wall gradients using each of those compositions., 378393=An increase in dP/dt was observed in the HEMOLINK\ufffd animals after exchange transfusion compared to the controls (data not shown), indicating that the exchange by itself conferred instability on the cardiovascular system. The pentastarch/HEMOLINK\ufffd animals demonstrated little, if any, increase in dP/dt, whereas the response in the hetastarch/HEMOLINK\ufffd animals was striking, increasing abruptly after initiating the hemorrhage, reaching a peak value of nearly 2000 mm Hg/sec, and then rapidly falling as animals became severely compromised and died (data not shown)., 407547=For larger quantities of stroma-free hemoglobin: 8 units of packed cells are washed as above and hemolysis occurs in the cold, overnight. The lysate is transferred into 600 ml transfer packs (Fenwal 4B2024, Deerfield, Ill.) and spun for 6 hours at 3500\ufffdg. Approximately \u2153 of the supernatant hemoglobin solution is then removed with a plasma extractor and passed through the mixed-bed resin until the conductivity is \u02dc15 \u03bcmhos. This process requires 1 kg of resin which is most conveniently packed into three columns. The solutions are again placed into transfer packs and centrifuged for 4 hours at 3500\ufffdg. The supernatants are filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm disposable filter unit (Millipore Millistack, MSG05CHZ), and the filtrate is collected into sterile transfer packs and stored at 4 C for chromatography. Long-term storage is best achieved by freezing, in bulk, at \u221280\ufffd C., 71594=Preferred colloids of the present invention include starches like hetastarch and pentastarch. Pentastarch (hydroxyethyl starch) is the preferred colloid starch of the present invention. Pentastarch is an artificial colloid derived from a starch composed almost entirely of amylopectin. Its molar substitution is 0.45 (i.e., there are 45 hydroxyethyl groups for every 100 glucose units); hydroxyethyl groups are attached by an ether linkage primarily at C-2 of the glucose unit (and less frequently at C-3 and C-6). The polymerized glucose units of pentastarch are generally connected by 1\u20134 linkages (and less frequently by 1\u20136 linkages), while the degree of branching is approximately 1:20 (i.e., there is one branch for every 20 glucose monomer units). The weight average molecular weight of pentastarch is about 250,000 with a range of about 150,000 to 350,000. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to the \u201caverage molecular weight\u201d of a substance refers to the weight average molecular weight. Pentastarch is commercially available (e.g., DuPont Merck) as a 10% solution (i.e., 10 g/100 mL); unless otherwise indicated, reference to blood product solutions comprising pentastarch (and other non-oxygen-carrying components as well as oxygen-carrying components) is on a volume basis., 167255=This hemoglobin, initially designed as a model compound for study by the U.S. Army, has been produced by Baxter Healthcare and is being tested as a replacement for human blood in the immediate postoperative period and in selected trauma patients. Both the Army and Baxter have reported that this product produces significant elevations of blood pressure and vascular resistance, and preclinical animal studies have shown that these undesirable properties eliminate any advantage to be derived from administration of hemoglobin solution (See e.g., Hess et al., J. Appl. Physiol., 74:1769\u20131778 [1993])., 105587=Table 1 shows that DHbO2 is about 1/20th of DO2. However because the solubility of O2 in plasma is low (\u03b1=1.2074 \u03bcM/Torr), and DO2 is relatively high, when plasma hemoglobin concentration is only 3 mM (4.83 g/dl) at PO2 of 100 Torr, the product of diffusion and concentration (the numerators in equation 1) for free O2 and HbO2 are nearly equal. Thus plasma hemoglobin contributes as much O2 as dissolved O2, effectively doubling the amount of O2 available from red blood cells. These relationships are shown quantitatively in Table 2., 94310=During the development of the present invention, it was shown that unexpectedly, arterioles, particularly at the A2/A3 level consume large amounts of O2. This was determined by a technique for measuring O2 concentration in localized areas of the microcirculation (Torres and Intaglietta, Am. J. Physiol., 265: H1434\u2013H1438 [1993]). These results indicate that these arterioles are capable of prodigious metabolic activity. Innervation of these arterioles is particularly dense (Saltzman et al., Microvasc. Res., 44: 263\u2013273 [1992]), suggesting that they regulate downstream capillary blood flow. Based on these results, increasing the O2 available to these arterioles would be expected to provide a potent stimulus to engage mechanisms that regulate the delivery of O2 to capillary beds (autoregulation). Although an understanding of the exact biochemical mechanism(s) which underlie these events is not necessary in order to use the present invention, it is contemplated that they could be mediated by O2\u2014 or NO\u2014 sensitive pathways; the presence of hemoglobin, free in the plasma space, as in a \u201cblood substitute\u201d is likely to engage these mechanisms because of its capacity for facilitated diffusion., 404034=Male Sprague-Dawley rats (210\u2013350 g, Charles River Labs) were anesthetized with 250 \u03bcl of a mixture of ketamine (71 mg/ml), acepromazine (2.85 mg/ml), and xylazine (2.85 mg/ml). Polyethylene catheters (PE-50) were placed into the abdominal aorta via the femoral artery to allow rapid withdrawal of arterial blood. A second catheter was placed in the contralateral femoral artery to monitor blood pressure, and a third catheter was placed in one of the femoral veins for infusion of test materials. Catheters were tunneled subcutaneously, exteriorized through the tail, and flushed with approximately 100 \u03bcL of normal saline. Animals were allowed to recover from the procedure and remained in their cages for 24 hours before being used in experiments. One femoral artery catheter was connected, through a stopcock, to a pressure transducer (UFI model 1050, Morro, Calif.), and arterial pressure was sampled continuously at 100 Hz using a MP100WSW data collection system (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, Calif.). The data were stored in digital form for subsequent off-line analysis., 91681=Increased rates of O2 uptake and release by cell-free hemoglobin compared to red blood cells have been predicted (See e.g., Homer, Microvasc. Res., 22: 308\u201323 [1981]; Federspiel and Popel, Microvasc. Res., 32: 164\u2013189 [1986]) and shown in vitro (Page et al., In R. M. Winslow et al., (eds.), Blood Substitutes: New Challenges, Birkhauser, Boston [1996], pp. 132\u2013145). However, attempts to demonstrate augmented transport by O2 diffusion in vivo by cell-free hemoglobin have been unsuccessful (See, Biro, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., 69: 1656\u20131662 [1991]; Hogan et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., 361: 375\u2013378 [1994]; and Hogan et al., J. Appl. Physiol., 361: 2470\u20135 [1992]). Although an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary in order to make and use the present invention, during the development of the present invention, it was determined, shown, by measurements in artificial capillaries, that cell-free hemoglobin does, indeed, increase the availability of O2 to the surrounding medium., 427766=Coupling of Hb to Dx-dialdehyde is pH dependent. When coupling is performed by dissolving 100 mg Dx-dialdehyde in 1 ml of 0.6 M sodium borate buffer and mixing with 1.8 ml of 10 g/dl Hb at 6\ufffd C., many labile imine linkages are formed at pH<9.6, and the conjugates have a high molecular weight, ranging to above 100,000. At higher pH, the major product has a lower molecular weight range (70,000>MW>100,000) and likely consists of a 1:1 complex between Dx and Hb, which only slowly converts to higher molecular weight forms. When this conjugate is formed at pH 9.8 and reduced at pH 7.2 for 30 min with excess NaBH4 (2 mol per mole of initial aldehyde) dissolved in 1 mM NaOH, only the \u03b1 chain of hemoglobin is found to be modified by Dx. Coupling of Hb to Dx-dialdehyde also proceeds much more rapidly at higher pH, requiring less than 1 hour for completion at pH 10 and only 1.5 hours at pH 9.7, but 6 hours at pH 9.5 and 23 hours at pH 9.1. When prepared at pH 9.75, the oxygen P50 for Dx-Hb is 10.1 mm Hg when the conjugate is allowed to form for 1 hour prior to NaBH4 reduction, 9.5 mm Hg when allowed to form for 4 hours, and 8.1 when allowed to form for 18 hours., 388274=Human red blood cells were drawn from healthy volunteers into heparin anticoagulant, washed 3 times in 0.9% NaCl by gentle centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.1 M Bis-tris Cl buffer, pH 7.4. The hemoglobin concentration of all solutions and red cell suspensions was approximately 3 mM (heme). The methemoglobin was always less than 2\u20134% of total hemoglobin. The test solutions were equilibrated to the appropriate gas concentrations and 37\ufffd C. using a tonometer (e.g., model 2000, Instrumentation Laboratories, Lexington, Mass.). Human serum albumin (HSA) was purchased commercially., 26787=The present application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/199,269, filed Jul. 18, 2002, now abadoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/544,656, filed Apr. 5, 2000, and issued as U.S. Pat.

No. 5,814,601 on Sep. 29, 1998., 284179=Aqueous solutions of i) HEMOLINK\ufffd, ii) 50:50 HEMOLINK\ufffd:dextran molecular weight 70,000 (by volume), and iii) 100:4 HEMOLINK\ufffd:PVP molecular weight 750,000 (by volume) were prepared at a total solute concentration, in each case, of 10 g/100 mL. The compositions were tested in the \u201cawake hamster\u201d model described above. PVP is used experimentally as a plasma expander and has also been used in humans for the same purpose; its principal property is that of increasing plasma blood viscosity. The use of PVP substantially increases the viscosity of the solution, to a value estimated at about 15 centipoise (substantially equivalent to that of whole blood).}",
