No. 07/536,378, filed on Jun. 11, 1990, now abandoned., 63481=Once a circuit (trunk) has been selected, in step 1202, the following information, in addition to that otherwise associated with the call, is signaled to the next switch:, 63770=If call routing is successful, step 1203, Via Switch 122 call processing is then complete. If call routing is not successful then, in step 1204, control is returned to Originating Switch 121., 64050=Digit analysis of the Network Address number, in step 1301, in conjuction with the Service ID, CSI, and GOS is used to select, in step 1302 (using a table similar to FIG. 9), the egress facilities out of the network. The facility selection process utilized is well-known in the art and will not be further described hereinafter. However, the Service ID and the CSI may (optionally) be used to select among the egress facilities. In step 1303, the call is then routed over these facilities, via either LEC 180 or trunk 191 to the receiving location PBX 190. Again, if call routing is successfully completed, in step 1304, call processing is complete. If, however, call routing is not successful, then control is returned, in step 1306, to Originating Switch 121., 39999=Shown in FIG. 1 is an illustrative Carrier Switch Network (CSN) 100 including a plurality of toll switching system offices 121-124 interconnected by a plurality of trunks 131-136. The CSN 100 may be, illustratively, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) switch network. The toll switching offices 121-124 may be, by way of example, 4ESS digital switches available from AT&T. This well-known digital switch is described in detail in The Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 56, No. 7, Sept., 1977, and Vol. 60, No. 6, part 2, July-August, 1981, which descriptions are incorporated by reference herein. Each of the switching offices 121-124 are controlled by a processor, e.g., 125, comprising CPU, e.g., 126, and memory, e.g., 127. A program memory 128 stores a system of programs to establish and control incoming and outgoing calls using data stored in data memory 129. The program memory 128 includes the program steps outlined in the flow charts and the data memory 129 includes the data tables shown in the various figures of this specification., 62627=The NSN and COS received from Originating Switch 121 are used, in step 1201, to select a path from the Via Switch 122 toward the Terminating Switch 124. The NSN is used to select one or more groups of trunks (using a table like that shown in FIG. 10) to the Terminating Switch 124 or to a Via Switch (such as VS 122, or other switches not shown in FIG. 1) that can reach Terminating Switch 124. This patent application does not rely upon or drive this trunk selection and prioritization process. Once the candidate trunks have been selected, the COS is used to screen the trunks to select one or more that satisfy the facility requirements for the call.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, what has been described is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is contemplated that other arrangements or embodiments can be used by those skilled in the art to implement the present invention without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention. While the disclosed embodiment of the present invention describes the originating switch as the location which determines the network switch number (NSN) and service (COS) code, it should be understood that any switch or other location of the network could be sent the appropriate data to make such a determination. Thus, for example, a centralized location having a centralized database may be utilized for determining the NSN and the COS code. The disclosed network embodiment of the present invention described using both a Network Switch Number (NSN) and a Class-of-Service (COS) code to select trunks over which the call should be routed. It should be understood, however, that in accordance with the present invention, under certain circumstances, the Class of Service for a call may not be relevant and, hence, the Originating Switch may utilize only the NSN to route the call through the network. This may arise, for example, where the network has only one type of trunk, which is used for all calls routed over the network. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the NSN may be utilized to route calls through the network while",
