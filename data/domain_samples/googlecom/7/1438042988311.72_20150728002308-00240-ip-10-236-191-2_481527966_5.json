After about 150 days the filaments were hydrolysed as to 50%. This rate of hydrolysis is comparable to that of PDS filaments of similar strength and thickness. EXAMPLE IV Filaments with a regularly structurized surface and having a diameter of 0.7\ufffd10-4 m, a tensile strength of 0.65 GPa, a modulus of 8 GPa, a strength of a square knot of 0.45 GPa and an elongation at break of 19% were prepared by spinning poly(L-lactide) containing 5% by weight of polyester urethane from an 18 wt % solution in anhydrous trichlormethane. The poly(L-lactide) had a viscosity-average molecular weight of 4.0\ufffd105. The fibre was drawn at 150\ufffd C. to a draw ratio of 24. The poly(L-lactide)/polyester urethane monofilament so obtained has a highly fibrillated structure. EXAMPLE III After hot-drawing the filaments were extracted in ethanol for 4 hours. No additive was present in the fibre after extraction. The filaments obtained turned out to have a highly fibrillated structure. Filaments with a regularly structurized surface and having a diameter of 0.6\ufffd10-4 m, a tensile strength of 0.8 GPa, a modulus of 9 GPa, a strength of a square knot of 0.5 GPa and an elongation at break of 17% were prepared by spinning poly(L-lactide) which contained",
