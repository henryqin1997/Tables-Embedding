Since the finished product is flat, it can be conveniently packaged in containers and shipped to the locations of the beverage purveyors. When the final products are opened they have the shape of frustum of a cone that coincides with the conical frustum of the beverage containers. , pressure is being applied by the pressure applicator 400 to the overlapped area of the overlap flap 20 and glue flap 19 which results in securing the free ends of the blanks 10 to each other. At this location of the machine 100, there is pressure applicator 400 in the form of a belt 406 that is driven by a large driven drum 402 and extends over a freely rotating roller bar. Pressure is applied at this station and the product is now completed and ready to be packaged for shipment. FIG. 21 In , folding hold down wheel 316 and its cooperating components have guided the right panel, called the overlap flap 20, such that it has been folded along the perforated radial fold line 17 such that its free end overlies the skived area 21 of the glue flap 19 where the seam adhesive 23 was deposited. FIG. 20 In , the seam adhesive 23 has been applied to the skived area 21 of linerboard surface. At this",
