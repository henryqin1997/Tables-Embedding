The RF amplifier 2408 amplifies and passes the received signal to the cross correlator 1408., 492797=FIG. 50A shows a generalized embodiment of an impulse transmitter implemented as a coherence-multiplex transmission system. The transmitter comprises a time base 1002 that generates a periodic timing signal. The time base 1002 may comprise a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) (not shown) or a similar device (not shown) having a high timing accuracy on the order of picoseconds. The voltage control to adjust the VCO (not shown) center frequency is set at the desired center frequency used to define the transmitter's non-divided pulse repetition rate. The periodic timing signal is supplied to a code source 1006 and a code time modulator 1008., 506744=The multiplier 2410 may be a double-balanced mixer adapted to operate in the linear mode. The multiplier 2410 linearly multiplies the received transmit signal sn(t) with at least one delayed signal sn(t+\u03c4) and/or dn(t+\u03c4) received by the input coupler 1400. A product signal of the multiplier 2410 is buffered by amplifier 2414 and then integrated over time by integrator 2416. The integrator 2416 is essentially a low-pass filter of first order that is adapted to respond on a time scale similar to the width of a component of the received signal sn(t). Integrator 2416 outputs a signal to the sample-and-hold unit 2418, which holds the peak value of the signal., 509696=In an FM subcarrier embodiment, a phase-locked loop frequency demodulator is used. The characteristics of the phase-locked loop 2446 determine the bandwidth capture and other basic aspects of the received signal. The optional bandpass filter 2444 can be used in series before the phase-locked loop 2446 to narrow the spectrum of demodulation performed by the phase-locked loop 2446., 494215=The coded timing signal is supplied to a subcarrier time modulator 1016 for information modulation thereof. The coded timing signal is also coupled through a delay device 1009 to an output stage 1028. In other impulse systems, the information modulation was done by using the information itself as the modulating source. In the present invention, however, an information source 1018 supplies an information signal to a subcarrier generator and modulator 1022. The information signal can be any type of intelligence, including digital bits representing voice, data, imagery, or the like, analog signals, or complex signals. Both the coded timing signal and the subcarrier time modulator 1016 can be implemented using voltage, current, or digital sources as modulation inputs., 500797=There are several coherence-multiplex radio receiver embodiments. FIG. 51 shows a generalized block diagram of a coherence-multiplex radio receiver. Each coherence-multiplex radio receiver generally comprises a diversity decoder 1403, a cross correlator 1408, an optional subcarrier demodulator 1424, an optional low-pass filter 2449 and an optional controller (not shown), such as a microprocessor., 507828=Either a decode signal (such as decode signal dn(t+\u03c4)) or a diversity encoded (e.g., delayed) transmit signal (such as delayed signal sn(t+\u03c4)) may be used to decode the received transmit signal sn(t). According to one embodiment of the receiver, the decode signal dn(t+\u03c4) is received from the communication channel and delayed by the variable-delay device 1402 before being combined in the multiplier with the received transmit signal sn(t)., 510126=In this case, bandpass filter 2444 outputs a filtered signal to the phase-locked loop 2446. The phase-locked loop 2446 outputs an in-phase estimate signal via a further low-pass filter 2449 to the microprocessor 2406. The in-phase estimate signal provides the microprocessor 2406 with an estimate of the amplitude of the subcarrier so that the microprocessor 2406 can assess the quality of signal lock. A demodulated output signal of the phase-locked loop 2446 is filtered by low-pass filter 2448, which outputs a demodulated information signal., 498595=Multiple delayed instances of a transmitted signal may be created by transmitting the signal from multiple antennas. Replication and delay of a transmitted signal can result from a multipath propagation environment, in which case, the delay element 1011 is not needed because it is incorporated into the propagation environment. A receiver (not shown) may use multiple antennas (not shown) to create the same effect as a multipath environment., 649614=An alternative embodiment of a decode-signal generator 2402 is shown in FIG. 73D. A single switch 631 generates a pulse that is duplicated and provided with incremental delays by a delay network 630 a to 630N. The time-offset pulses are weighted in a modulator 611 with weights generated by a code source 612 in the same manner as described with respect to FIG. 73C., 102903=In 1964, John Bell showed that for certain experiments, classical hidden variable theories made different predictions from quantum mechanics. He published a theorem that quantified just how much more strongly quantum particles were correlated than would be classically expected, even if hidden variables were taken into account. This made it possible to test whether quantum mechanics could be accounted for by hidden variables. A number of experiments were performed, and the result is almost universally accepted to be in favor of quantum mechanics. Thus, hidden variables provided no easy explanation of the entangled correlations. The only kind of hidden variables not ruled out by the Bell tests would be \u201cnon-local\u201d, meaning they would be able to act instantaneously across a distance., 513361=Any type of time-domain spread-spectrum signal can be created using a superposition of weighted carrier signals, such as carriers 105. Individual pulses that are closely spaced, distantly spaced, overlapping, uniformly spaced, and/or non-uniformly spaced (i.e., variable-time offset) may be generated by combining multiple carrier signals into a superposition signal, such as the superposition signal 110A. Uniformly spaced-in-frequency carrier signals produce a periodic superposition signal. Thus, constant weights \u03b2\u2032n(k) applied to the waveform components 105 can provide a repetitive coded signal, such as a CDMA code signal. PCT Appl. No. PCT/US99/02838, which is hereby incorporated by reference, shows a CDMA signal resulting from a superposition of weighted carrier signals., 646509=FIG. 73A shows a generalized embodiment of a decode-signal generator 2402. A timer input terminal 2402 t accepts a timing signal from a time base (not shown). The timing signal provides control to a multicarrier generator 610. The timing signal may optionally control a code source 612. The multicarrier generator 610 generates a multicarrier signal that is coupled to a modulator 611 and modulated with a set of weights generated by a code source 612. The modulated multicarrier signals are combined in a combining system 613 and output to a cross correlator (not shown) via an output terminal 2402 o., 497878=FIG. 50B shows an alternative embodiment of an impulse transmitter implemented as a coherence-multiplex transmission system. Components in both FIG. 50B and FIG. 50A are similar, as indicated by identical reference numbers. The output of the subcarrier time modulator 1016 is split into multiple modulated, coded timing signals. A first split signal is coupled into the output stage 1028. A second split signal is delayed by a delay element 1011 before being coupled into the output stage 1028. Thus, the output stage 1028 uses a plurality of time-offset instances of the modulated, coded timing signal as triggers to generate electrical monocycle pulses., 509239=In this example, the subcarrier demodulator 1424, comprises a bandpass filter 2444, a phase-locked loop 2446, and a low-pass filter 2448. Additional subcarrier demodulators (not shown) may be used to separate additional modulated subcarrier signals having the same diversity characteristics of the signal sn(t) and one or more of its associated signals dn(t+\u03c4) and/or sn(t+\u03c4)., 501244=The coherence-multiplex radio receiver is a homodyne receiver with a cross correlator 1408 front end. The cross correlator 1408 coherently converts a received wideband signal (such as an electromagnetic pulse train) to a baseband signal in one stage. A multicarrier implementation of the coherence-multiplex receiver integrates multiple carrier signals to recover each bit of the transmitted information. An impulse-radio implementation of the coherence-multiplex receiver (which is a multicarrier implementation in which the carriers are time-domain pulses) integrates multiple pulses to recover each bit of the transmitted information. The receiver performs a correlating, synchronous receiving function (at the RF level) that uses a statistical sampling of many pulses to recover the transmitted information., 508351=The microprocessor 2406 may vary the delay of the delay device 1402 to optimize correlation of the received signals sn(t) and dn(t+\u03c4). The delay device 1402 may provide more than one delay in order to correlate more than two received signals. The delay(s) \u03c4 may vary in time relative to changes in the communication channel (not shown), the receiver, and/or a transmitter (not shown). The microprocessor 2406 may employ a feedback loop 2450 to track these changes and adjust the delay device 1402 accordingly. The microprocessor 2406 may control the delay of the delay device 1402 relative to a predefined code that characterizes a coded delay applied to the transmitted signals (such as the transmitted signals sn(t) and dn(t+\u03c4)) by a transmission system (not shown)., 503747=FIG. 52D shows a diversity decoder 1403 that uses a sub-space processor 1506 or some other type of multi-user detector. A diversity-parameter separator 1505 separates one or more received signals with respect to different values of at least one diversity parameter. One or more interfering signals may be present in at least one of the separated signals. The sub-space processor 1506 extracts one or more desired signals from at least one non-interfering subchannel of the at least one diversity parameter. A subchannel is any subspace of a diversity parameter obtained by a multi-user and/or multi-channel detection technique, such as interference cancellation., 648057=FIG. 73B shows an embodiment of a decode-signal generator 2402. A multicarrier generator 610 provides a plurality of different-frequency carrier signals. The multicarrier generator 610 includes a pulse generator 621 that generates a wideband signal. The wideband signal may be a continuous signal in the frequency domain or it may be comprised of a plurality of narrowband components. The pulse generator 621 may be controlled by a periodic timing signal, which causes the output spectra of the pulse generator to be a comb in the frequency domain. A plurality of different-frequency carrier signals is selected by a filter, such as a filter bank 622., 496166=The output stage 1028 uses the coded timing signal and the modulated, coded timing signal as triggers to generate electrical monocycle pulses. The electrical monocycle pulses are sent to a transmit antenna 1030 via a transmission line 1032 coupled thereto. The electrical monocycle pulses are converted into propagating electromagnetic pulses by the transmit antenna 1030. In the present embodiment, the electromagnetic pulses propagate to an impulse-radio receiver (not shown) through a communication channel (not shown), such as air in an RF embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, the emitted signals are wide-band or ultrawide-band signals. However, the emitted signals can be spectrally modified by filtering the monocycle pulses. This bandpass filtering causes each monocycle pulse to have more zero crossings in the time domain., 502652=FIG. 52A through FIG. 52E show various embodiments of a diversity decoder 1403. A simple diversity decoder 1403 is shown in FIG. 52A. An input signal is separated into N signals and provided with differential delays by a time-offset system 1501. FIG. 52B shows an embodiment of a diversity decoder 1403 in which an input signal is separated into a plurality N of frequency components by a filter bank 1502. An optional demodulator 1503 may remove information signals or encoded information signals from the frequency components. A variable delay may be applied to one or more of the components to enhance cross correlation. FIG. 52C shows a diversity decoder 1403 comprising an antenna array having a plurality of antennas 1402 a to 1402N and a spatial demultiplexer 1504. The spatial demultiplexer 1504 generates a plurality of output signals representing spatial channels. These channels may contain at least one instance of an encoded information signal and a decode signal., 47318=This application claims priority to U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 60/219,482, filed on Jul. 19, 2000, U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 60/163,141, filed on Nov. 2, 1999, and a CIP of U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 09/022,950, filed on Feb. 12, 1998, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,992., 507533=The timer (not shown) may be delayed for proper triggering of the sample-and-hold unit 2418. The timer (not shown) may be delayed to compensate for delay caused by the multiplier 2410, and the amplifier 2414, and for integrator 2416 settling time., 506288=The cross correlator 1408 can include a multiplier 2410, an amplifier 2414, an integrator 2416, and a sample-and-hold unit 2418. The sample-and-hold unit 2418 may include a timer (not shown) that generates timing signals to control sampling. The timer (not shown) may have properties (e.g., frequency, shape, width, and delay) of its timing signals controlled by the microprocessor 2406., 499065=FIG. 50C shows an embodiment of an information source 1018 and a subcarrier generator and modulator 1022. The information source 1018 is comprised of a plurality N of information signal generators 1018 a to 1018N. The subcarrier generator and modulator 1022 is comprised of a plurality N of subcarrier generator/modulator units 1022 a to 1022N. Thus, each information signal may be modulated onto a different subcarrier to facilitate separation by a receiver (not shown)., 505481=FIG. 53 shows another embodiment of a coherence-interferometry radio receiver. The receiver illustrated in FIG. 53 comprises a cross correlator 1408, a subcarrier demodulator 1424, an input coupler 1400 including an antenna 1402, a variable-delay device 1402 implemented as a diversity decoder, and a microprocessor 2406., 495051=In this case, a subcarrier is a carrier modulated with information separate from carrier modulation, which in turn modulates a carrier. The subcarrier generator and modulator 1022 generates a modulated subcarrier signal that is modulated by the information signal. Modulator 1022 supplies the modulated subcarrier signal to the subcarrier time modulator 1016. Thus, the modulated subcarrier signal is used by the subcarrier time modulator 1016 to modulate the carrier, which, in this case, is the coded timing signal. Modulation of the coded timing signal by the subcarrier time modulator 1016 generates a modulated, coded timing signal that is sent to the output stage 1028., 102479=In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen argued that the strange behavior of entanglement meant that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory, and that there must be \u2018hidden variables\u2019 not yet discovered. This produced a famous debate between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who argued that quantum mechanics was complete and that Einstein's problems arose because he tried to interpret the theory too literally., 504457=FIG. 52E shows a diversity decoder 1403 having a code generator 1507 and a timer 1508. The diversity decoder 1403 may decode a time-dependent diversity-encoded signal. For example, a transmitter (not shown) may provide time-dependent diversity encoding to one or more transmitted signals. The code generator 1507 provides a code signal that controls the diversity decoder 1403. The code signal is typically the same code or the complex conjugate of the code used to encode one or more of the transmitted signals. The timer 1508 controls the timing of the code signal to optimize decoding. The timer 1508 may be controlled by a feedback signal from a feedback network (not shown) to optimize recovery of an encoded information signal. An impulse-radio receiver (hereafter called the receiver) 1400 includes an antenna 1402 for receiving a propagated impulse radio signal. The received signal is input to a cross correlator 1408., 495788=The modulated subcarrier signal is used by the subcarrier time modulator 1016 to time shift the position of the pulses of the coded timing signal. Thus, in addition to the coded timing signal, a second signal triggers the output stage 1028 (in this case, the modulated, coded timing signal), which is a train of pulse position modulated pulses., 648770=FIG. 73C shows an alternative embodiment of a decode-signal generator 2402. A multicarrier generator 610 provides a plurality of time-domain pulsed carrier signals. The multicarrier generator 610 accepts a timing signal that is duplicated and provided with incremental delays by a delay network 630 a to 630N. The incrementally delayed timing signals trigger a plurality of pulse generators (such as switches 631 a to 631N) that produce a plurality of time-offset pulses. The pulses are weighted in a modulator 611 with weights generated by a code source 612. The weights may represent chips \u03b2m (l) of a direct-sequence spreading code since the combined signal has the time-domain characteristics of the direct-sequence code., 645264=FIG. 72 shows a correlation receiver that may be used to process CI-CDMA signals. The correlation receiver includes a channel coupler 1402 coupled to a communication channel (not shown). An amplifier 2408 may be used to amplify received signals. An adjustable time base 2404 controls the generation of a decode signal by a decode-signal generator 2402. The decode signal is correlated with the received signal in a cross correlator 1408. An embodiment of the cross correlator 1408 includes a multiplier 2410, an amplifier 2414, an integrator 2416, and a sample-and-hold module 2418. Correlated signals maybe demodulated (if necessary) in an optional demodulator 1424. A feedback loop 2450 to a microprocessor 2406 may be used to adjust system components, such as the adjustable time base 2404, decode-signal generator 2402, and/or the sample-and-hold module 2418. For example, timing of the decode signal may be adjusted to optimize cross correlation. Timing of the sample-and-hold module 2418 may be adjusted to compensate for delay resulting from the amplifier 2414 and the integrator 2416., 647210=Components of the decode-signal generator 2402 may be implemented in hardware, software, and/or firmware. For example, the function of the multicarrier generator 610 may be implemented by a microprocessor using one or more transform techniques, such as an FFT or an IFFT. The multicarrier generator 610 may be implemented as an ensemble of one or more switches and/or digital circuits. The multicarrier generator 610 may be implemented as an ensemble of carrier-signal generators., 493492=The code source 1006 comprises a storage device (not shown), such as a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), or the like, for storing orthogonal pseudo-noise (PN) codes and for outputting the PN codes as a code signal. Alternatively, maximum length shift registers (not shown) can be used to generate the PN codes. Code source 1006 monitors the periodic timing signal to permit the code signal to be synchronized to the code time modulator 1008. The code time modulator 1008 uses the code signal to modulate the periodic timing signal for channelization and smoothing of a final emitted signal. The code time modulator 1008 outputs a coded timing signal.}",
