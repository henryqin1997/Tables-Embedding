Preferably the test pattern is all 1's or all 0's, however, other data patterns could be used. When the fault mapping operation is begun, maintenance processor 7 causes a blanket pattern of 1's or 0's to be written throughout array 1. The data is then read in a detailed sequential manner to be described below. Neglecting those details for now, after one logical line (1152 bits) of the blanket pattern is transferred from array 1 to buffer 2, the line is read out from buffer 2 in units of one doubleword (72 bits) at a time into network 5 for each DWID address applied via line 19. Network 5 selects one of the 72 bits for application to gate 10 wherein the selected bit of each doubleword, in turn, is compared with a signal representing the correct value thereof as applied via line 16 from maintenance processor 7., 26757=When the chip array 1 is accessed, many of the chips (e.g., 1152 chips) are activated. One 1152 bit line of data is buffered, in terms of 16 doublewords of 72 bits each, by application to buffer 2. Each chip which supplies data to buffer 2 is accessed at the same cell location as determined by storage address register 6 under control of maintenance processor 7. Each of the buffered doublewords is made available, as 72 parallel bits, on memory bus 3 upon application of a respective double word identifier (DWID) address on line 19 from chip row counter 4 also under the control of processor 7 via line 15. This is conventional buffering practice to increase the effective bandwidth of memory array 1, composed of relatively slow-access array chips, by accessing a large number of the chips in parallel and storing the accessed data in buffer 2 for later transfer to bus 3., 26404=Referring to FIG. 1, memory chip array 1, in a typical instance, comprises an array of 2304 chips, each chip containing 64k bits (where k=1024). The array is organized in terms of 128k logical lines of 1152 bits each. Each line constitutes 16 doublewords of 72 bits each. Each chip provides only a single bit to any given doubleword., 39114=(13) combine the partial chip-status bytes according to the logic previously given to obtain 2304 chip status bytes of four bits each.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain details have been omitted such as the straight-forward techniques for programming maintenance processor 7 to carry out the described rules for forming the status bytes based upon the values of the counts resulting in the counter groups 11 and 12, such state-of-the-art details forming no part of the present invention. Alternatively, the amount of hardware required for identifying and classifying memory faults may be reduced by employing more software in the maintenance processor 7. This can be accomplished by recognizing that different types of faults that may occur in a chip produce different patterns of fault counts. FIG. 2 shows four types of common chip faults and the patterns of fault counts that they produce, in the given example, when counted by chip quadrants. The chip quadrants are identified by the dashed lines. The numerals represent the fault count found to exist in the respective quadrants. By simply counting up the total number of faults in each quadrant of each chip, one can easily identify which type of fault is present on a faulty chip. This leads to a very simple hardware implementation in which the two 16-word error counters of FIG. 1 are replaced with a single gated counter which is enabled only when one particular row of chips is activated. The maintenance processor identifies the row of interest with a line to",
