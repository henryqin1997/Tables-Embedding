Suitable electrode materials are well known in the bioelectrode art. By way of example, the electrode 18 may be a silver, silver chloride electrode of the type frequently employed in bioelectrodes. By way of further example, the electrode 18 may be a silver, silver chloride electrode of the type disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 3,834,373, issued Sept. 10, 1974, which is herewith incorporated by reference herein. That type of electrode comprises a plurality of silver particles, a plurality of silver chloride particles, and an electrically insulating, water impermeable inert organic matrix for the silver particles and silver chloride particles. These silver particles and silver chloride particles are preferably interspersed with each other in and throughout the matrix, and these interspersed silver particles and silver chloride particles are in electrical contact with each other., 30775=This is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Ser. No. 483,181, now abandoned entitled Bioelectrodes, filed June 25, 1974, by the subject inventor, and herewith incorporated by reference herein, and a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Ser. No. 492,367, now abandoned entitled Bioelectrodes, filed July 29, 1974, by the subject inventor, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Ser. No. 228,827, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,834,373, entitled Silver, Silver Chloride Electrodes, filed Feb. 24, 1972, and herewith incorporated by reference herein., 50505=The metallic electrode 18 is applied to or deposited on the inner part 19 of a snap fastener 20. Such inner part 19 extends through an aperture in the bottom portion 13 of the electrode cup 12 and is pressed into an outer fastener part 22 to form a swaged unit. In practice, the male snap fastener 20 cooperates with a corresponding female complement in order to connect the bioelectrode to suitable electronic equipment such as an electrocardiograph (ECG) or other bioelectric instruments as disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 3,834,373, issued Sept. 10, 1974 and herewith incorporated by reference herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications and variations within the spirit and scope of the subject invention will be suggested or rendered obvious to those skilled in the art by the subject extensive disclosure. It will now be recognized that the subject invention considerably advances the bioelectrode art by radically departing from the state of the art course of development and by combining various features to best advantage in several novel combinations. With respect to the aspect of the disclosed invention concerning the anchoring of the electrolyte pad 23 by the adhesive 26, it will be recognized that this anchoring not only prevents the electrode from falling out of the cup, but also renders possible the illustrated and other highly advantageous electrode designs. The adhesive 26 may be inert, thereby avoiding any detrimental interference with the operation of the electrode. In this connection, it may be noted that the disclosed electrode pad anchoring technique may, within the scope of the corresponding claims, be applied to electrode structures other than those specifically shown in the drawings. Suitable working examples of epoxy resin matrix electrodes and styrene-butadiene elastomer matrix electrodes are contained in my above mentioned issued patent which is herewith incorporated by reference herein. In similarity to the silver particles, the silver chloride particles could either be made of pure silver chloride or of silver chloride coated on an inert particle core. I have in this respect determined through calculation and",
