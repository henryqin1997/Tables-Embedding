From the constructlon above outlined it is apparent that by depressing the end 52 of the yoke the lever is effective to force the brake band 35 into frictional engagement with the roller 34 and simultaneously to force the pin 55 into the raceway in order to lock the bearings therein against movement, thereby locking the caster against swivel action., 23208=UNITED STATES PA'I'ENTS Number Name Date 1,632,435 Darnell June 14, 1927 1,671,774 McIntosh May 29, 1928 1,998,236 Herold Apr. 16, 1935 2,081,594 McIntosh May 25, 1937 2,147,064 Schultz, Jr. Feb. 14, 1939 2,262,433 Uecker et a1.
