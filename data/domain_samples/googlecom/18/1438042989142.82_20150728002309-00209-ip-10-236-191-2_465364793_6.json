    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations When the damping resistance is optimized in accordance with the embodiments shown in FIGS. 17 to 23, the sprious oscillation developed in the pulse voltage applied to the transducer due to the parasitic impedance of the driver, transducer and cable or wiring therebetween can be suppressed, and the degradation of the characteristic of the detected information in the ultrasonic wave device can be prevented by very simple means. Such means may utilize the on-resistance of the transistor element of the driver so that the design of the element is facilitated. This is particularly effective from the standpoint of freedom of design of the element and the occupied area of the element, when the driver is implemented by the integrated circuit. In the above embodiments, the configurations of the on/off control circuits such as drivers 41, 42, 411, 410, 420 and 421 and the control timing thereto are not limited to those illustrated, and the polarities of the transistors (P-channel and N-channel) and the D.C. power supply 30 may be reversed. FIG. 23 shows another embodiment. In the present embodiment, separate damping resistors 52 and 53 are inserted into the driver shown in FIG. 22. The resistors 52 and 53 are connected to drains of the transistors 410 and 420 so that damping is attained without affecting to the switching characteristic of the transistors. In the present embodiment, the damping function may be attained by the on-resistances",
