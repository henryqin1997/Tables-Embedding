    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail by reference to the preferred embodiments described above, it is understood that variations and modifications thereof may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the three operator monitoring systems previously described could be used in combination for applications not involving the operation of a vehicle. For example, the operator identity, intoxication, and drowsiness check systems could be useful for monitoring air traffic controllers or military personnel manning weapons control stations. An alternate embodiment according to the present invention would forego the separate optical device mounting scheme. In this alternate embodiment the optics packages are mounted in the housing such they can be mechanically swapped so only the optical device associated with the active monitoring function is positioned in view of the operator. Thus, only a single path need be established between an active optical device and the sensor. As before, this single path could be via free space, or via a fiber optic cable. One possible configuration of this alternate embodiment is shown in FIG. 4, wherein the optics pakages 16, 28, 30 are mounted on a rotating disc 38 which is rotated by a motor 40 under control by the processor 14. The processor 14 causes the appropriate optical device 16, 28, 30 to be rotated into the active position when its associated monitoring function is being performed. The",
