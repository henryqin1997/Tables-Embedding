    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25175=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/189,235, filed Mar. 14, 2000, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 73781=Table 4 above displays test results of 10\u2033\ufffd10\u2033 filter-pressed prototype boards comparing formulations with 7.5 wt. % volcanic ash and 5.0% perlite (Harborlite 2000 from Harborlite Corp.), a typical low density additive. Formulation L with 5.0% perlite has a 22.2% increase in moisture expansion from the control whereas Formulation K with 7.5% volcanic ash actually shows a decrease of more than about 5% in moisture expansion from the control., 25823=Fiber-reinforced cement (FRC) products such as water-resistant building sheets have been used for building since 1895. In recent history reinforcing fibers used in such products have included not only asbestos fibers, but also cellulose fibers (see Australian Patent No. 515151), metal fibers, glass fibers and other natural and synthetic fibers. Typically, the density of such building sheets is from about 1.2-1.7 g/cm3, the variation in density typically being achievable by compression and dewatering of the fiber cement slurries used in manufacture and by varying the amount of fiber used. At these densities, the cement based matrix has few voids, which results in lower water absorption which has usually been considered necessary for good durability performance of cement matrices., 158270=Table 16 compares the densities of Formulation M with 12 wt. % microspheres, Formulation O with a 9 wt. % blend of microspheres and low bulk density CSH, and the control without low density additives. The low bulk density CSH used in Formulation O is produced by James Hardie using a process with silica, lime and water that results in a low bulk density material that is substantially CSH in tobermorite form. Further details are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/058,444 filed Apr. 9, 1998, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Relative to the control, the decreases in density for Formulations M and O are not significantly different, but the total addition of low density additives with the blend (Formulation O) is 3% less than formulation M with only microspheres. For Formulations M and O, the subtle differences in wt. % of hydraulic binder and aggregate do not have an impact on density properties.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The preferred embodiments have applicability to a number of building product applications, including but not limited to building panels (interior and exterior), tile backer board (walls and floors), siding, soffit, trim, roofing, fencing and decking. The embodiments illustrated and described above are provided merely as examples of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. Various changes and modifications can be made from the embodiments presented herein by those skilled in the art without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. These materials incorporating microspheres also have improved fire resistance properties because of improved thermal dimensional stability relative to typical low density additives. Thus, the materials are stable in building fires as a building component such that the material can maintain a shield to fire without cracking and falling apart and allowing fire to spread quickly. With respect to at least the formulations and building products incorporating hollow ceramic microspheres, the materials' freeze-thaw resistance is maintained at lower density, unlike most inorganic density modified fiber cement materials. This gives these materials good durability in climates that experience frequent freezing and thawing conditions. The materials also have improved wet-dry dimensional stability and the building material's durability is improved such that building panels do not excessively shrink and crack. Also, excessive gaps between panels or planks do not open up after changes in humidity or from wet to dry seasons. In general,",
