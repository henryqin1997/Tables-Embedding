Although this invention has been described with reference to these specific embodiments, the descriptions are intended to be illustrative of the invention and are not intended to be limiting. Various modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. [0092] In experiments with a mobile robot, the visual techniques detect stoppages reliably within one second while the robot traveled forward at a rate of about 0.20 meters per second (m/sec). The mobile robot was programmed to undertake an evasive maneuver (for example, backing up 0.2 m and turning ninety degrees) upon detection of a collision, advantageously providing a fully autonomous wandering behavior with only a video camera as a sensor. [0091]FIG. 6D corresponds to a visual representation of a sloppy XOR comparison between the binary map of the image of FIG. 4A (shown in FIG. 4C) with the binary map of the image of FIG. 6A (shown in FIG. 6C). In the same manner described in connection with FIG. 5D, where the sloppy XOR comparison indicates a difference, the pixel is represented as bright. Where the sloppy XOR comparison does not indicate a difference, the pixel is represented as dark. In the example of FIG. 6D, where the robot",
