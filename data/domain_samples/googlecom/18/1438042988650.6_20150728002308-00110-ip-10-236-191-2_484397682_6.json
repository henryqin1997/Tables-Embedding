Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustrations and not limitation. FIGS. 22, 23 and 24 show another interconnect device made in accordance with the present invention. The item of FIGS. 22 and 23 is a high density interconnect device 200 for connecting a high density multichip module to a printed circuit board. The individual leads 202 (which are like leads 16) are seen on the upper surface of the device in FIG. 22. As seen in the cross-section elevation view of FIG. 24, interconnect device 200 also has a ground plane 204 (corresponding to layer 24/20A) and a first set of conductive vias 206 (corresponding to vias 22) which connect the plane 204 to selected ones of the leads 202 and a second set of vias 212 (corresponding to vias 112) which connect the power plane 214 (corresponding to layers 120/116, 110A) to selected other leads 202. One of the ends 208 of the leads 202 are unsupported (i.e., they extend from interconnect device 200 in a cantilevered manner), and these unsupported lead ends form the actual interconnects to contact points on a high density multichip module. The other ends of the leads (which extend across the equivalent of window",
