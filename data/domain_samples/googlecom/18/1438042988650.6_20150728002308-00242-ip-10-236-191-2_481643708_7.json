Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. In embodiments represented by FIG. 7, IC 700 can be any type of integrated circuit. For example, IC 700 can be a processor such as a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, a microcontroller, or the like. IC 700 can also be an integrated circuit other than a processor such as an application-specific integrated circuit, a communications device, a memory controller, or a memory device such as a dynamic random access memory device. Latch 702 is similar to latch 200 of FIG. 2 or latch 400 of FIG. 4. The operation of latch 702 is also similar to the operation of latch 200 or latch 400. In operation, FUB 704 generates the Din signal on node 708. The Din signal is a Vccl signal, which is similar to the Din signal represented by embodiments of FIGS. 2, 3, and 4. Latch 702 receives the Din signal and converts it to the Vcch Dout signal in a similar fashion as latch 200 or latch 400. The Dout signal feeds into FUB 706 for",
