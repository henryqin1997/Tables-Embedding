As previously indicated, although the illustrative embodiment utilizes an 800 toll free calling system, any suitably arranged intelligent call processing methodology may be utilized in place of or in conjunction with the calling system disclosed herein. For example, the call set-up message can be sent as an X.25 packet to agent 400's screen through an IXC packet network having an X.75 gateway to send network call record information as an X.25 message passed over a D channel of the BRI line or any public or private packet network. In another alternate embodiment, a standard telecommunications line rather than an ISDN-BRI line can be used, where caller identification may be used as a mechanism to deliver the name of the next caller. In one preferred embodiment, agent 400's supervisor is permitted, while agent 400 communicates with called party 417, to monitor the call. The supervisor, in accordance with the illustrated embodiment, dials into PBX 411 and, preferably, touch-tones an access code and the code associated with agent 400. PBX 400 creates a 3-way connection between agent 400, the called party and the supervisor, who proceeds to monitor the call in progress. In a still further embodiment, outbound application 414, or some",
