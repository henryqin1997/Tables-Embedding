    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{140921=The thiol functionalized yttrium oxide particles from step 2 (\u02dc90 mg) were suspended in 20 mL of 0.2M de-aerated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and the mixture sonicated in the dark under nitrogen for 15 min. The particles were transferred to a flask and iodoacetic acid (50 mg, 0.27 mmol) was added. The suspension was stirred magnetically at 40\ufffd2\ufffd under nitrogen for 5 hr. An additional 50 mg of iodoacetic acid was added and stirring continued overnight (14 hr). The particles were isolated by centrifuging and washed with 10 mL of water. They were then sonicated with 10 mL of 10% aqueous acetic acid for 10 min. The particles were isolated by centrifuging, washed with 10 mL of water and vacuum dried overnight. The particles were examined by transmission FTIR (KBr disk). There was a strong Si\u2014O absorption at 1100 cm\u22121., 135006=Doped yttrium oxide and yttrium oxysulfide upconverting particles were from Nanocerex (Ann Arbor, Mich.). Tetraethoxysilane was 99+% and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane was 99% both from Aldrich. 3-Mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane was 95% from Gelest and was lot #3C-2709. N-Hydroxsuccinimde, glutaric anhydride and iodoacetic acid were from Aldrich. The 5\u2032 C6 amino modified DNA was a 180-mer with a molecular weight of 55,867 and was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. In general, the 5\u2032 amino modified DNA molecule is produced by modifying the 5\u2032 end of the last sugar molecule of the DNA chain via an OH and ultimately forms an ether linkage forming [sugar]-O\u2014(CH2)6\u2014NH2. The concentration of the modified DNA was approximately 1 nM. The 5\u2032 amino linker portion of the modified DNA can range from two carbons to about 18 carbons in length. 2-Propanol was HPLC grade from Aldrich or Fisher. The ultrasonic cleaning bath was a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics., 55482=This application is a continuation-in-part of patent application Ser.

Positive and Negative controls were also prepared. Duplicates of all RT-PCR samples were prepared and analyzed., 137338=Iodoacetic acid (50 mg, 0.27 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of 0.2M aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The pH of the solution was about 8.4 (narrow range pH paper). The thiol functionalized particles (\u02dc100 mg) from step 1 were added and the mixture sonicated in the dark under nitrogen for 10 hr. An additional 50 mg of iodoacetic acid was added and sonication continued overnight. During this time the bath temperature rose to 400. The particles were isolated by centrifuging and washed with 10 mL of water. They were then sonicated with 10 mL of 10% aqueous acetic acid. The particles were isolated by centrifuging, washed with 10 mL of water and vacuum dried overnight. The particles were examined by transmission FTIR (KBr disk).
