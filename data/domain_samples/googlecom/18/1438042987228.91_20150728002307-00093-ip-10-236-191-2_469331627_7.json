In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of this invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the embodiment described herein with respect to the drawing figures is meant to be illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of invention. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the elements of the illustrated embodiment can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, although communications between an application and object, or between various objects, have been described, one of skill in the art will appreciate that such communications are often indirect, through intermediate objects or otherwise. Furthermore, while an embodiment of the invention has been described with reference to particular methods, flags, and interfaces, it is understood that other additional or alternative means may be used within the invention. Therefore, the invention as described herein contemplates all such embodiments as may come within the scope of the following claims and equivalents thereof. It can be seen that the negotiation architecture described herein allows an image data source and image data sink to negotiate and optimize the details of a subsequent image data push from the source to the sink. This allows the use of a push architecture, with the advantages that conveys, such as",
