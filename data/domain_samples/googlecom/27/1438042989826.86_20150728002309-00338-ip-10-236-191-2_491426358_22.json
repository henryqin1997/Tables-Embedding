Genet. 24: 236-244. 2000., 114089=The relative expression of functional cytosine deaminase enzyme and its conversion of [6-3H]-5-FC to [6-3H]-5-FU was evaluated for cells infected with AdCMVCD or AdCMVCD+Fab-FGF2 using a modification of the procedure described by Haberkorn et al. (38). SK-ChA-1 or BXPC-3 cells were plated at 1.5\ufffd106 cells per well in 6-well plates (Costar) and infected 24 hours later at a confluency of 80% with AdCMVLacZ, AdCMVCD, and AdCMVCD+Fab-FGF2 at various viral plaque forming units (pfu). Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested and lysed by 4 freeze-thaw cycles in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA/dithiothreitol (Sigma), pH 7.8. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The cytosolic fraction was separated, and 6-10 \u03bcg of cytosolic protein was incubated with (0.5 \u03bcCi) [6-3H]-5-FC (Sigma) at 37\ufffd C. for 6 hours. Each reaction mixture plus 5-FU and 5-FC standards were then spotted on a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.) and developed in a butanol-water chamber. Each region (5-FU and 5-FC) was visualized under UV light, and respective areas cut from the plate and placed in 5 ml EcoLume scintillation fluid (ICN, Costa Mesa, Calif.). Each region was counted for radioactivity in a Packard Tri-Carb 1900 TR liquid scintillation counter. The [3H] gate (0-18.6 keV) was utilized, with a counting efficiency of 60%. Percent conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU was calculated as activity in the 5-FU fraction compared to the total counts in the 5-FC and 5-FU fractions for each treatment condition., 247288=38. Haberkorn et al., J. Nucl. Med. 37, 87-94, 1996., 237944=CAR expression in pediatric gliomas likely dictates the clinical success of Ad-based gene therapy. A facile immunohistochemical method to determine CAR expression on histological samples is devised. Various methods are explored to detect CAR on both fresh-frozen and fixed, paraffin embedded sections of freshly excised tumors using the RmcB monoclonal antibody. RmcB binds specifically to CAR by immunoblot, immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry assays, but no data exists on either its use in immunohistochemistry or on the effects of tissue processing on the RmcB epitope of CAR. These effects are explored by processing the following cell lines into standard paraffin-embedded histological sections using HistoGel (Lab Storage Systems, Warrenton, Mo.): CHO and a CHO clone stably expressing human CAR (CHO-hCAR, AQ17) and U118MG and U118MG-hCAR, which has already been constructed and shown to express high levels of CAR by RmcB flow cytometry. Various fixatives are tested prior to HistoGel embedding and paraffin processing of these cells to optimize RmcB staining specificity and intensity. Antigen retrieval techniques, including low and high temperature microwave processing, are explored if needed. Pediatric tumor samples are screened for CAR expression as well as expression of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins using either heterodimer specific antibodies (eg. LM609 and P1F6) or, subunit specific antibodies (eg. \u03b1v-P3G8, \u03b23-AB1932, \u03b25-AB1926, Chemicon) as previously described (89). These results are useful in determining: (1) the prevalence of CAR/\u03b1v integrin expression on pediatric gliomas; (2) heterogeneity of CAR/\u03b1v integrin expression on single tumor samples; and, (3) the pattern of CAR/\u03b1v integrin expression on CNS cell types, as well as in correlating CAR/\u03b1v integrin expression with Ad gene transfer efficiency., 248106=47.

Ohwada, A., et al., Human Gene Ther. 7, 1567-1576, 1996., 215485=To test this hypothesis, 5-FC toxicity (IC50) was compared in cells infected with AdCMVCD versus AdCDUPRT. Results with human DPD-positive glioma cells, and with prostate cancer cells, demonstrated an 18-280 fold decrease in 5-FC IC50 with AdCDUPRT-infected versus AdCMVCD-infected cells at an equal multiplicity of infection (MOI 100 pfu/cell; Table 13). Potentiation of 5-FC toxicity by CDUPRT was due to UPRT, since expression of CDUPRT, but not CD, could increase the toxicity of glioma cells to 5-FU (571-1125 fold decrease in 5-FU IC50 at MOI of 100 pfu/cell; Table 14). These results demonstrate the potential of UPRT to increase CD/5-FC toxicity in vitro. Taken together, these results show that selective sensitization of tumors by direct intratumoral gene transfer of a prodrug-activating enzyme may hold promise as a means to improve the therapeutic index of standard chemotherapeutic drugs. In Table 13 mean 5-FCIC50 was obtained from 2-5 separate experiments. Cells were infected with AdCMVCD or AdCDUPRT at the indicated MOI (pfu/cell) for 1 h at 37\ufffd C. 5-FC toxicity was determined by MTS assay 5 days after drug addition., 249337=64.

Paillard, F., Human Gene Ther. 8, 1733-1736, 1997., 104749=To decrease the heterogeneity of the Fab-FGF2 conjugates, a Fab\u2032-FGF2 conjugate was generated. The ascites containing the anti-knob 1D6.14 antibody was loaded onto a protein A column in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 3.5. The purified IgG was digested with immobilized pepsin to obtain F(ab)\u20322 fragments. The digestion mixture was purified by protein A chromatography and the flow-through containing the F(ab)\u20322 was buffer exchanged by gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-200, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The purified F(ab)\u20322 fragments were mildly reduced with 2-mercaptoethylamine-HCl. The sulfhydryl group on the Fab\u2032 fragment was activated with Ellman's reagent (DTNB) at a 1:3 molar ratio for 30 min which results in Fab\u2032-TNB. Excess DTNB was removed by diafiltration using an Amicon stirred cell apparatus (Beverly, Mass.) equipped with a YM30 and then put through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter to obtain pure TNB-Fab\u2032. TNB-Fab\u2032 and FGF2 were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated for 12-16 hours at 4\ufffd C. to generate the Fab\u2032-FGF2 conjugate. The reaction mixture was purified by heparin affinity chromatography (Heparin Sepharose, FF, Uppsala, Sweden). Fractions containing Fab\u2032-FGF2 were further purified by gel filtration (Sephacryl S-100 HR, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The Fab\u2032-FGF2 was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm membrane and stored at \u221280\ufffd C. The material was determined to be greater than 95% pure by SE-HPLC. The Fab\u2032-FGF2 conjugate was analyzed using the anti-knob ELISA and shown to have very similar binding characteristics as the anti-knob Fab and Fab-FGF2. In addition, the materials, final product and intermediates were also characterized by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. All the materials migrated as expected and the final product was pure., 249864=71. Lowy, et al., Oncology (Huntingt). 13: 121-130. 1999., 248474=52. Park, et al., J.
