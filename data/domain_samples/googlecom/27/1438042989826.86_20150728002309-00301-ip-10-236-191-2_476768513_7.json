No. 10/450,238 (hereinafter \u201cSemiconductor Memory Device Patent Application\u201d). With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the Semiconductor Memory Device Patent Application discloses, among other things, semiconductor DRAM device 10 in which each memory cell 12 consists of transistor 14 having gate 16, body region 18, which is electrically floating, source region 20 and drain region 22. The body region 18 is disposed between and adjacent to source region 20 and drain region 22. Data is written into or read from a selected memory cell by applying suitable control signals to a selected word line(s) 24, a selected source line(s) 26 and/or a selected bit line(s) 28. In response, charge carriers are accumulated in or emitted and/or ejected from electrically floating body region 18 wherein the data states are defined by the amount of carriers within electrically floating body region 18. Notably, the entire contents of the Semiconductor Memory Device Patent Application, including, for example, the features, attributes, architectures, configurations, materials, techniques and advantages described and illustrated therein, are incorporated by reference herein.}",

Notably, where P-channel type transistors are employed as memory cells 12 in the memory array(s), suitable clear, write, read and inhibit voltages are well known to those skilled in the art in light of this disclosure. Accordingly, for sake of brevity, these discussions will not be repeated. While a significant portion of this description includes details (for example, clear, write, read and inhibit voltages) directed to N-channel transistors, the inventions (and embodiments thereof described herein are entirely applicable to P-channel transistors. In such embodiments, majority carriers in body region 18 are electrons and minority carriers are holes. Indeed, the memory arrays may be comprised of N-channel, P-channel and/or both types of transistors. Moreover, the circuitry that is peripheral to the memory array (for example, row and column address decoders, not illustrated herein) may include P-channel and/or N-channel type transistors, including transistors like transistor 14.",
