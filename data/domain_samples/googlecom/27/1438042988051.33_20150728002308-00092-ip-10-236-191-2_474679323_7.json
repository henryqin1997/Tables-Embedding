However, those skilled in the art will understand that changes may be made in the form of the invention covered by the claims without departing from the scope and spirit thereof, and that certain features of the invention may sometimes be used to an advantage without corresponding use of the other features. Using the present medical system, a physician may precisely cut using a pulsed 2.9 micron laser beam, may vaporize using either a 2.9 micron laser beam at a higher average power or a 1.06 micron beam, may coagulate with a 1.06 micron beam, weld with a 1.32 micron beam and guide therapeutic infrared laser radiation with a visible aiming beam. This laser radiation, which is generated by either separate lasers and/or combination lasers, may be delivered separately, simultaneously or alternately through a single fiber which can transmit from the visible through the mid-infrared range. The fiber optic delivery system may be disposable or reusable. The preferred embodiment contains a zirconium fluoride fiber, a distal focusing lens, proximal connector and a catheter housing for sterility, hermeticity and structural integrity. Gas or fluid may pass through the catheter to cool the distal tip of the fiber and be directed on to the tissue as a means of preventing ablated tissue from splattering back on the distal lens of the catheter.
