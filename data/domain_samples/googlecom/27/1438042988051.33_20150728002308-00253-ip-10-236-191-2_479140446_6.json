In several aspects of the invention, the novel concepts involve a combination of known means for effecting a desired sequence of results, particularly with respects to the generation of signals and the end results consequent to the generation of such signals. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the recitation of such signals and end results implicitly specifies the provision of such known means. It will also be repeated that a primary focus of the invention is to exploit the advantages that flow from mounting batteries on flywheels, so that the battery mass forms a significant, if not the major portion of the flywheel mass, as it performs its regenerative function of storing energy so that it can be recovered. While certain aspects of the invention go to the use of battery means comprising a plurality of voltaic cells and the specific manner in which they are mounted on the flywheels, many aspects of the invention are not so limited. Thus in these broader aspects other sources of electric energy or direct current, could well be employed, and the terms \u201cmounted on\u201d or \u201ccarried by\u201d or similar terms are to be understood as denoting that the electric energy",
