This structure, with a symmetrical gate structure, can be scaled to about half of the channel length as compared to a conventional single gate MOSFET structure. It is well known that a dual gate or double gate MOSFET device has several advantages over conventional single gate MOSFET devices. Specifically, the advantages for dual gate MOSFET devices over their single gate counterparts include: a higher transconductance, lower parasitic capacitance, and improved short-channel effects. For instance, Monte-Carlo simulation has been previously carried out on a 30 nm channel dual gate MOSFET device and has shown that the dual gate device has a very high transconductance (2300 mS/mm) and fast switching speeds (1.1 ps for nMOSFET).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in forms and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the present invention not be limited to the exact forms and details described and illustrated, but fall within the scope of the appended claims. The process flow described above, together with the listed materials represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In principle, other materials may be substituted which serve the same purpose, and other details of the process may change accordingly. It is noted however that any changes made to the above description must be capable of building the top gate inside a trench such that sidewall source/drain regions and oxide spacers are formed prior to formation of the gate. As indicated previous herein, the inventive process achieves the following advantages: (i) The inside-out geometry enable one to form a tapered body region with a thicker body under the contacts to reduce access resistance; (ii) since lithography defines the largest dimensions, the top gate length may be much smaller than the minimum lithographic feature; (iii) the bottom gate is referenced to the lithographic top gate stencil, resulting in better line width control; and (iv) allows the formation of double-gate field",
