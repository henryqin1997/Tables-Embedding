No. 08/656,257, filed on Jul. 22, 1996 now abandoned which is a 371 of PCT/DE94/01406 filed on Nov. 23, 1994., 39134=Referring now in detail to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the asphalt finisher according to the invention with two mixture buckets M1 and M2, which are manufactured by modifying known construction systems for asphalt finishers. The finisher is extended by a frame extension RV of 1400 mm. A conveyor belt F1 is provided for the lower asphalt layer. In addition, the basic unit is raised by 450 mm and an additional conveyor F2 is installed for the top asphalt layer. The asphaltic material is distributed with the aid of two spreader screws VS1, VS2. A screed plate A or stripper is attached to the finisher for correct production of the thickness of the first asphalt course AS1. A second asphalt course AS2 is also provided. After the first mixture type, the second mixture type is laid immediately and both layers are compacted together. A hydraulic pulling system HZ is provided for changing the weight of strut H. A tamping beam VD precompacts the two asphalt layers.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, while only a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is obvious that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Direct loading from trucks into the receiving buckets M1 and M2 may cause knocking against the finisher and lead to uneven spots in the asphalt layer pavement. Therefore, it is possible to feed two receiving buckets M1 and M2 with a self-driving vehicle SF equipped with the conveyor belt FE. A drive wheel or chassis R is provided on receiving buckets M1 and M2. In addition, support wheels SR are disposed on receiving buckets M1 and M2. The asphalt so supplied is transported in this connection alternately into the self-driving vehicle from truck 1 or truck 2, and the receiving containers M1 and M2 are subsequently loaded via the conveyor belt FE. FIGS. 10 and 11 show receiving containers M1 and M2 which are created by separating and enlarging the receiving container of a conventional finisher and are additionally stabilized laterally by the support wheels SR. The receiving containers M1 and M2 are directly loaded by means of trucks supplying the asphalt from the stationary mixing plant. The asphalt for the lower layer AS1 is supplied by a truck 1, and the asphalt for the top layer AS2 with a second truck 2, and the receiving buckets M1 and",
