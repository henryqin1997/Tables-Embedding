With regard to the tentering frame dryer 1 described with the aid of FIGS. 1 to 5 it may be assumed that a large number of treatment zones (F1, F2 . . . Fn) each having two circulating air systems 5, 6 are provided. Each drum filter 10 has its own rotary drive 28, and all these rotary drives 28 and all the ejectors 19 associated with the extraction and cleaning nozzles 16 are preferably connected to a common control arrangement 38 (indicated in FIG. 1) in such a way that in each case only one drum filter rotary drive and the associated ejector are actuated at the same time and these rotary drives and the associated ejectors of all circulating air systems 5, 6 can be switched on in sequence. In practice this means that the drum filters 10 are switched on in sequence in order to clean off fluff or fibres for which they carry out one or two (optionally several) revolutions and in each case the appertaining extraction and cleaning nozzle 16 becomes effective. In this way the extraction and cleaning",
