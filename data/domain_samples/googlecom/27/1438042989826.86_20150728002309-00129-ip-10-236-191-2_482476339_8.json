Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modification and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention and with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 5, system 11 produces an attenuated fiducial replica, from a laser source that may be either annular as previously described in connection with FIG. 1 such as 15, or a circular high energy laser beam such as 71, in FIG. 2. System 11 may include a plate 72 having spaced holes such as 16 (see FIG. 5) of a selected diameter and density that cover the entire area of plate 72. Plate 72 has a flat first or front reflective surface 73 and a rear or second surface 74 similar to the embodiment previously described. System 11 includes primary reflector 75 that may have an elliptical reflecting surface 76 and a central opening 22 for reflecting laser beam energy that is transmitted through holes 16. Positioned between reflector surface 76 and rear surface 74 is",
