The Request stores two Delivery Requests, one for May 1-May 5 and another for May 6-May 7. The first Delivery Request has two Item Requests, one for 10 part100 and another for 20 part200. The second Delivery Request has one Item Request for 10 part300. This describes the requested deal., 45955=The framework of the present invention also attaches dates to important communications within the negotiation. For instance, the system can record that the seller issued a promise to deliver requested items on May 14th and that the buyer accepted this plan on June 12th. Further, problems between the manufacturing plan and the current state of the negotiation can be pinpointed. For instance, if a request has been promised for delivery by the seller and the buyer has accepted whatever modifications were made by the seller, and the manufacturing plan expects to ship the items four days after the promised date, the present invention can allow the user to be notified of an \"Accepted Plan Late\" problem. A planner can then view such problems and can try to manipulate the overall plan so as to eliminate as many of them as possible., 25024=Electronic negotiation, which is different from EDI, comprises a field of research that has been described as \"the process in which two or more parties multilaterally bargain goods or information for mutual intended gain.\" Beam, Carrie, Arie, Segev, and J. George Shanthikumar, \"Electronic Negotiation Through Internet-based Auctions,\" CITM Working Paper 96-WP-1019. One sub-field of this study has been described in Beam, Carrie, Arie Segev, and J. George Shanthikumar, \"Electronic Negotiation Through Internet-based Auctions,\" CITM Working Paper 96-WP-1019. This article describes agents that are programmed with rules and principles representing the interests of a particular business and carry out negotiation processes with a fellow software agent over \"package\" deals.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Changes can be made at any point in a negotiation, including after the negotiation is traditionally viewed as \"complete\" (Acceptance is made). After acceptance, the seller and buyer both have the ability to reopen negotiations. The seller is allowed to change the Promise to reopen negotiations. The buyer is allowed to change the Request to reopen negotiations. (The invention allows this, although some applications of the invention may not. In a manufacturing operation, machine breakages and strikes really require that promises be broken. Likewise, a supplier can rarely be rigid with their customers' requests.) When such changes occur, request-promise-acceptance problem calculations can be rerun. However, a locking mechanism can be used to prevent request and promise data from changing and instead reporting a warning if any entity attempts to change such data. As any change occurs to the data of a Request, Promise, Acceptance, Delivery Request, Delivery Promise, Delivery Acceptance, Item Request, Item Promise, or Item Acceptance, the invention reanalyzes the data and updates the identified problems. Data changes cause some problems to be eliminated and potentially others to be created. The human planner can see these updates in a character-based user interface or a graphical user",
