The exemplary embodiment first yields a two-part aggregated and netted order to buy 1000 shares of security X plus $1000 dollars worth of shares of security X., 252548=if P=9.8125 then buy 1102 shares of X;, 252689=if P=9.9375 then buy 1101 shares of X;, 218877=If the price of X were $10 per share, the brokerage would send an order to buy 1100 shares. If the price of X were to move from $10 to $11 between when the brokerage sent the order and when the market maker executed the order, this order would result in the brokerage owning too much stock. The brokerage would use 1000 shares to cover the share-based orders. The brokerage would then use the next 90.91 shares to cover the dollar-based orders. The brokerage would be left owning 9.091 shares for which it had no customer orders. This would expose the brokerage to risk that it might not wish to accept. Multiplied by thousands of orders and, potentially, thousands of shares, this risk adds up and could put millions of dollars of the brokerage's assets at risk., 252408=if P=9.6875 then buy 1104 shares of X;, 252827=if P=10.0625 then buy 1100 shares of X;, 252619=if P=9.875 then buy 1102 shares of X;, 252970=if P=10.1875 then buy 1099 shares of X;, 253222=The end result is that only one trade in the schedule of contingent trades occurs, depending upon the price at the time of execution. For example, if the price of security X is 10.3125, then the market maker purchases 1097 shares of security X on behalf of the brokerage that transmitted the schedule of orders. Alternatively, if the price of security X is 10.000, then the market maker purchases 1100 shares of security X. In all cases, at most only one extra share is purchased of each security in which the brokerage trades that day. Obviously, any succeeding trades can be used to attempt to trade the extra share., 253042=if P=10.25 then buy 1098 shares of X;, 253112=if P=10.3125 then buy 1097 shares of X;, 252899=if P=10.125 then buy 1099 shares of X;, 252479=if P=9.75 then buy 1103 shares of X;, 212971=This application is a continuation-in-part Ser. No. 09/038,158 filed on Mar. 11, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,996,539., 247677=The first part (Ns b\u2212Ns s) of Equation (1) represents the number of shares resulting from the combination (e.g., aggregation and netting) of share-based orders, which is simply the difference between the number of shares being requested in all buy orders and the number of shares being requested in all sell orders in each security. For example, if all received share-based orders for security X when aggregated total 10,000 shares to be purchased and 11,000 shares to be sold, this part (Ns b\u2212Ns s) equals \u22121000 shares, the negative sign indicating that the net result is a sell order for 1000 shares of security X., 299601=For example, assume that the brokerage receives orders from investors to buy and sell security Y, which aggregate to an order to buy 2000 shares, an aggregate order to buy $20,000 worth of shares, an aggregate order to sell 100 shares, and an aggregate order to sell $10,000 worth of shares. This order nets to an order to buy 1900 shares and $10,000 worth of shares. Assume further that the bid and ask prices are Pb=90, Pa=90.0625; yielding a mid-price of Pm=90.03125. Using the formulas above,, 229956=Value-based orders are particularly convenient when the amount of the trade is small relative to a price of the security. When implementing a diverse portfolio of investments for a small investor making small monetary investments, but on a periodic basis, it is more intuitive to the small investor to request a trade in terms of value (e.g., dollars) rather than in a number of fractional shares to be purchased (e.g., 0.01356 shares). Moreover, the actual numbers of shares being purchased is usually not particularly relevant to such an investor, but rather the relevant issue is how much the investor is trading or investing. Particularly for novice investors, specifying trades in terms of value is more intuitive than shares, the precise value of which is often difficult to determine for novice investors as it depends on the number of outstanding shares which fluctuate and the value of the issuer, which even sophisticated investors have difficulty determining.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be noted that the above method for aggregating and netting a collection of trading orders to trade instruments, such as securities, some of which are expressed in dollar amounts and some of which are expressed in share amounts, is applicable to many types of brokerages, including, but not limited to a 401(k) plan that is administered by the brokerage, a trust, an Individual Retirement Account, a Keogh Plan, a Pension Plan, a Qualified Plan, or any other account holding tradable assets or liabilities. According to one possible implementation of the above method, an apparatus for calculating the schedule of prices includes a hand-held computer, such as a palm pilot, programmed to perform the schedule of prices calculation set forth above. The brokerage provides the market maker with this hand-held computer, and transmits the information about its customers' orders and into the hand-held computer, either by Internet link or otherwise. The market maker feeds information about current prices. The hand-held computer then calculates the amount of shares the market maker should buy at current prices in accordance with one of the above methods. Apparatus for Calculating Buy Order by Market Maker One possible implementation of an apparatus for determining the schedule of orders includes a central processor coupled to a computer network, such as the Internet, that receives customer orders electronically, aggregates and nets the orders, calculates the schedule of orders",
