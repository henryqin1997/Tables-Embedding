It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. For example, a wireless controller for a multitude of energy-consuming appliances can be used in place of the controllers described herein (e.g., in place of the HVAC controllers). It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not with this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto, At block 720, an HVAC controller such as a thermostat is coupled to the wireless transceiver. A gateway is installed outside of the user premises at block 730, for example on the exterior of a home or on a local utility pole. At block 740, the wireless transceiver is bound to the gateway for establishing communications between the gateway and the HVAC controller. At block 750, the gateway is communicatively coupled with a remote utility signal source, for example simply by powering the gateway and/or by initiating a binding or other recognition-type process. HVAC equipment control is established at block 760 with the HVAC controller as a fimction of signals received from the gateway via the wireless transceiver. For instance, temperature set points controlled at block 760 can be",
