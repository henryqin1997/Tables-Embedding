These types of components can be classified according to the following four function categories: audio input, audio output, video input and video output. Components in the audio input category are sound producing devices, such as microphones, CD players, video cassette recorders, audio cassette players, television tuners, and telephone connections. Audio output components include sound receiving devices such as speakers, headphones, video cassette recorders, and audio cassette recorders. Video input components include video cameras, video cassette recorders, and television tuners. Video output components comprise such devices as monitors, television sets, and video cassette recorders, for example.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention being thus described, it would be apparent that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be apparent to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. Although the specific examples have been directed to audio and video devices, the same principles may be applied to the configuration of other groups of systematically related components of a computer. The control interface of the present invention integrates all the settings and controls for related features into a comprehensive, streamlined, consistent, and coherent user interface. The interface includes a combination of a textual display and an accurate graphical representative display so that users with little system experience may be able to access and use all of the capabilities of the components. The component-based configuration permits new components to be easily added. Similarly, individual component modules can be easily replaced, for example to correct a bug or provide updated functionality, without the need to rewrite a substantial amount of the code for the interface. The component-based architecture which permits windows to be dynamically generated results in an interface which is easy to use, powerful, flexible, and extendible. These requirements can be best implemented with a dynamic linked library. In this regard, a particular dynamic",
