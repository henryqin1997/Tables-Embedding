The user may click on an area of the empty document with the pointer, changing the cursor to an hourglass. A message is sent to the server that a click down event has occurred on an area of the empty document. The user may begin typing and each keystroke, or groups of keystrokes, are sent to the server as one or multiple messages. The server continuously enters the data into a virtual document on the virtual desktop, and perpetually rasterizes and compresses the data and transmits it back to the palm top device such that the user views the data as it is being input. The user may double-click, with the pointer, on a \u201cstart\u201d menu item, for example to open a word processing program, or on an icon. Again, the cursor is transformed into an hourglass and a message is sent to the server that a double-click event has occurred at a specific location. The virtual desktop executes the word processing program and displays a virtual, empty document and menu, including the appropriate buttons. The empty document and menu are rasterized and compressed and sent to the palm top device, as a bit map or raster image. The user may click on an area of the empty document, which changes the cursor to an hourglass and a message is sent to the server.",
