    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{125821=In the drawing, reference numeral 1101 denotes an insulating substrate. The insulating substrate 1101 has a transistor 1103 and an element 1102 containing a ferroelectric substance. Reference numeral 1111 is an opposed substrate which has an opposed electrode 1110. A liquid crystal 1109 is intervened between the insulating substrate 1101 and the opposed substrate 1111. The transistor 1103 comprises a semiconductor layer 1114, source and drain electrodes 1112, 1113, a gate insulator film 1115, and a gate electrode 1116. The element 1102 including the ferroelectric substance has a lower electrode 1104, a ferroelectric layer 1105, and an upper electrode 1106. Reference numeral 1107 denotes an insulator film, and 1108 a pixel electrode., 121841=Provision of the pixel electrode 1005 as the third electrode on the insulator layer 1004 is effective to suppress the luminance within the pixel from varying. This third electrode may be omitted, and then, it is effective to obtain the luminance change flatly within the pixel., 120810=The first electrode 1003 is patterned into a predetermined form. Here, a plurality of slits are formed in the first electrode 1003, and the ferroelectric layer 1002 is partly faced with the liquid crystal layer. Therefore, a voltage needed to control the polarized state of the ferroelectric layer 1002 can be lowered. The pattern is not limited to the slits, but may be a mesh or grid., 34651=FIG. 1 shows one example of the circuit structure of a pixel in a conventional liquid crystal display device. This circuit structure of the pixel shown in FIG. 1 is the same as a conventional transmission active matrix liquid crystal display device. When a thin film transistor 1301 is turned on by a scan signal applied to a gate line 1304, a display signal voltage applied to a data line 1305 is applied to a liquid crystal layer 1303. And, an electrical charge is applied to a storage capacitance 1302 by a storage capacitance line (Cs line) 1307. As it is known well, it is generally necessary to apply an alternating voltage to the liquid crystal layer 1303, and the display signal voltage, which becomes positive or negative with a voltage of an opposed electrode 1306 formed on an opposite substrate at the center, is applied to the signal line 1305 to drive the pixel., 123037=The insulator layer 1004 can be a high dielectric film formed of a metal oxide in addition to the silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film. And, it can also be a ferroelectric film. In such a case, its material is desired to have a high electric field different from the ferroelectric film 1002., 126694=The one shown in this drawing has three liquid crystal layers and three TFT substrates with the switching matrix. On the bottom layer which is an insulating substrate 1201, a TFT 1208, an electrode 1209 and a ferroelectric layer 1210 are formed, and a first liquid crystal layer 1205 is formed between the insulating substrate 1201 and an opposed electrode 1211 which is provided below a second substrate 1202. The second substrate 1202 is a transparent insulating substrate on which a TFT 1212, an electrode 1213 and a ferroelectric layer 1214 are formed. In addition, a second liquid crystal layer 1206 is provided between the ferroelectric layer 1214 and an opposed electrode 1215 provided below a third substrate 1203. The third substrate 1203 has the same structure as the second substrate 1202 does and has a TFT 1216, an electrode 1217 and a ferroelectric layer 1218 thereon. And, a third liquid crystal layer 1207 is formed between the ferroelectric layer 1218 and an opposed substrate 1219 provided below an opposed substrate 1204., 122138=A transistor 1007 is connected to the first electrode 1003 to supply a signal for the pixel. When a potential is given to the first electrode 1003, an electric field is generated within the ferroelectric layer 1002 toward the first electrode as indicated by lines of electric force shown on the left in the drawing, and a spontaneous polarization is aligned with its direction. In the neighborhood of the first electrode 1003, a polarization is aligned substantially in the same direction though the direction of the electric field is slightly bent. And, in the neighborhood of the first electrode 1003, namely a part of the ferroelectric layer 1002 where the first electrode 1003 is not formed, a fixed charge 1010 is generated owing to the polarization. The electric field produced by this electric charge is applied to the liquid crystal 1006 through the insulator layer 1004., 124377=Furthermore, the lower electrode, the second electrode 1001, is not restricted to the one which is fully faced with the first electrode 1003 as shown in FIG. 28. The second electrode can also be patterned in the form of a mesh and can be used to control the lines of electric force formed between the first electrode 1003 and the second electrode 1001. For example, the lines of electric force in a slant direction are positively used to control a polarization vector, and a vertical component strength can be changed spatially by the applied voltage. In this case, the insulator film 1004 may be either a ferroelectric substance or not. Thus, an area gradational effect can be given., 127956=In FIG. 30, reflective color display is obtained by entering light from above into and returning from the three-layered liquid crystal layer which includes the electrode 1209 used as a reflective electrode and the other electrodes as a transparent electrode., 106039=Then, by ion doping, ions formed of PH3 plasma were implanted to an area of 2\ufffd1016 /cm2 at 60 kV to form source and drain regions 404., 123792=When the above-described insulator layer 1004 is formed of a ferroelectric substance, the same effects as described in the beginning can be obtained. Specifically, by raising a dielectric constant of the insulator layer 1004, the liquid crystal 1006 is greatly influenced by the fixed charge 1010, and the polarization can be retained between the first electrode 1003 and the liquid crystal layer 1006, thereby enabling to drive the liquid crystal. Thus, the liquid crystal can be driven on the first electrode 1003 patterned, and an aperture ratio can be improved., 121643=As described above, the invention covers a structure in that the first electrode 1003 or the second electrode 1001 is formed of a plurality of parts having a different potential., 120488=As shown in the drawing, a second electrode 1001 is formed below a ferroelectric layer 1002, and a first electrode 1003 on the ferroelectric layer. An insulator layer 1004 is formed on the first electrode 1003, and an electric field is applied to a liquid crystal 1006 through the insulator layer 1004., 129285=FIG. 31 is a modification from the one shown in FIG. 27. The apparatus shown in FIG. 31 has a scan line 1404 for selecting a transistor 1401, and a data line 1405 for supplying a signal; to apply a voltage to a liquid crystal 1403, a potential is applied to an electrode 1407 within an element 1402 containing a ferroelectric substance. The element 1402 has the ferroelectric substance between a lower electrode 1409 and the electrode 1407. And, differences from the one shown in FIG. 27 are that a drain of the transistor 1401 is connected to the lower electrode 1409, and the electrode 1407 is connected to its neighboring scan line 1408., 130111=And, the ferroelectric capacitance in the structure shown in FIG. 26 may be replaced with the element 902 or 1402 which has the ferroelectric element intervened between the lower electrode and the electrode shown in FIG. 27 or FIG. 31. Such a structure is shown in FIG. 34 and FIG. 35., 123354=By configuring as described above, the polarized state of the ferroelectric substance can be controlled directly without through the medium of the liquid crystal. Therefore, the need for applying a voltage to the first electrode 1003 with the capacitance change of the liquid crystal taken into account can be eliminated, the voltage can be controlled more accurately, and gradation can be generated in greater number., 36247=For the AC drive of the liquid crystal display device, the drive frequency of each pixel is a frame frequency, the drive frequency of a data line is the product of a frame frequency and the number of scan lines, the drive frequency of a data line driver IC is the product of the number of all pixels on the screen and a frame frequency, and, if a division drive is performed, it is a value obtained by further dividing by a division number. For example, in a diagonally 10.4-inch color VGA (640\ufffdRGB\ufffd480 pixels) liquid crystal display device, a data line IC has power consumption of about 1 W. Therefore, an A4-size 150 dpi-equivalent high definition liquid crystal display device has the number of pixels of about 1600\ufffd1200 6.25 times greater than VGA, resulting in a disadvantage that power consumption is so high as 2 to 3 W or more. When a high power-consuming liquid crystal display device is used for any portable information-processing equipment, there are disadvantages that a battery exhausts soon and the usable duration is shortened., 128432=In this embodiment, each TFT array is configured similar to the structure shown in FIG. 22, but may be configured differently. In addition, it is also possible to enter light from below and to reflect on the side of the substrate 1204 in FIG. 30. Besides, the electrode 1209 can also be a transparent electrode to provide a so-called transmissive type so that light is entered from one side of the substrate and images are seen from the other side. The liquid crystal layer is a guest host type but can have a selective reflection mode using a cholesteric liquid crystal., 125081=Besides, by patterning the first electrode 1003 and the second electrode 1001 to form an electric field having a different direction in the ferroelectric layer, the polarization control can be given variations. The second electrode 1001 can also be designed not to be restricted to a predetermined potential. Otherwise, the second electrode 1001 may be varied into numerous forms.}",

Gradation display can be made by controlling the domains of the ferroelectric film formed in the pixel region according to the liquid crystal display device of the invention. Additionally, gradation display can be made by the liquid crystal display device of the invention without making the pixel electrode smaller. Besides, full-color display can be achieved by the liquid crystal display device of the invention by controlling the domains of the ferroelectric film formed in a pixel region without providing a liquid crystal having a good threshold property with any special drive method or a complicated device structure. And, gradation display can be made by the liquid crystal display device of the invention without deteriorating the remarkable properties such as a high-speed response and memory of the liquid crystal having sharp threshold properties. As described above, gradation display can be made by the liquid crystal display device of the invention without being restricted by the threshold property of a liquid crystal material. For example, it can be made by ion doping of the ferroelectric thin film. And, halftone can be displayed by ion doping so that an ion density (dosage) can be distributed within the pixel. And, it is also possible to adopt a method that the ferroelectric thin film is distributed to have a different",
