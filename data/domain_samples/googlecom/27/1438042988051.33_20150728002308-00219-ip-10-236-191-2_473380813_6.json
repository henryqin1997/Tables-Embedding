    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described particularly with reference to FIGS. 1 to 7 with emphasis on a system for creating applications having linkage with remote data sources on storage media such as CD-ROM which are updated automatically in a network environment, it should be understood that the figures are for illustration only and should not be taken as a limitation on the invention. In addition, it is clear that the system of the present invention has utility in many applications where automatic updating of data object is required. It is contemplated that many changes and modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as described. FIGS. 7 shows graphically how a LivePlayer update a data object with the process illustrated in FIG. 5 when it is not stored on the local cache of the LivePlayer. A data object having URL <File://livecd/file1.bmp HYBRID> 130 on a CD-ROM is read by the LivePlayer 5. It is then sent over the LSP to the LiveServer 10. Here, the LiveServer 10 translates the URL with the translation table 60 into URL <HTTP://GENSIS.ITI.GOV.SG/pub/file1.bmp>135. The LiveServer 10 then transmits the translated URL to the LivePlayer 5. The LivePlayer checks this translated URL against its local harddisk cache to determine whether this resource exists. In the example illustrated in FIG. 7, no such resource exists. The",
