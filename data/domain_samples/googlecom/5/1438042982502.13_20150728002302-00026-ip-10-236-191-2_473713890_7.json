If a high-frequency AC voltage is then applied to the AC voltage source 3, as shown in FIG. 1, a plasma is ignited in the interior and, if gas and precursor gas are also present in the space 9, in the space outside the moldings. The plasma may be a pulsed plasma or a continuous plasma. With regard to pulsed plasmas, which serve as the basis for what are known as PICVD coating processes, reference is made to DE 38 30 249 C2, the content of disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety in the present application. The container is provided with a coating on the inside and optionally also on the outside, for example an SiOx coating, a TiOx coating, an SNOx coating or an SixNy coating, preferably with a thickness in the range from 10-1000 nm, with the aid of the continuous plasma or a pulsed plasma. The coating which has been applied to the plastic molding can be used as a barrier coating, for example an oxygen barrier coating.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32836=In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the barrier coating is <1000 nm, preferably <300 nm. In addition to good barrier properties, barrier layers of this type are also highly flexible. Furthermore, with such thin layers it is in particular also possible to avoid intrinsic stresses which can cause the barrier layer to flake off. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the barrier layer has still further additional functions, for example optical or electrical functions or nonscratch or antireflection functions. In addition to providing a barrier action against gases and/or liquids, in particular against O2, CO2, H2O, water vapor, the coating may also have a barrier function against fats and greases and decomposition products thereof, in order, for example, to protect sensitive plastic substrates.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations With the apparatus according to the invention and the process according to the invention, it is possible simultaneously to produce a plastic body of any desired shape and to provide it with a coating. The advantage of a procedure of this nature is in particular the efficient production of coated moldings. The process according to the invention or the apparatus according to the invention, compared to the injection blow molding technique described in WO 99/17334, can also be used to produce complex moldings by injection molding. Furthermore, it is possible for the mold halves of the mold to be cleaned with the aid of a plasma after the moldings have been removed. Coatings which can be applied for optical elements, such as for example the lens described here by way of example, include a refractive index adjuster, an antireflection coating and/or a nonscratch coating and/or a barrier coating. Accordingly, the products can be provided with high-quality coatings and/or functional optical layers directly during production. It is not only plastics which can be used as the injection-molding material. Rather, this process can also be used for the casting and coating of glass products. For optical elements, barrier coatings can act as a water vapor barrier to protect the coating or the plastic, or as a barrier against fats and greases, for example in the case of optical elements made from COC. COC has a good",
