No., 09/615,726, titled \u201cA METHOD AND MECHANISM FOR THE CREATION, MAINTENANCE, AND COMPARISON OF SEMANTIC ABSTRACTS,\u201d filed Jul. 13, 2000, provide a framework and mechanism in a computer for providing a \u201cquantized\u201d meaning-representation. But the semantic meaning of documents is not the only factor controlling interpretation of the documents. People have emotional responses to the world around them. What one person might view with emotional detachment can cause another person to respond strongly. Even more, people can have different emotional responses to the same content, depending on their point of view. For example, given an article proposing abortion regulation, many people would vehemently oppose the regulation, while others would avidly support it. Currently, however, no mechanism exists to enable users to automate the process of identifying and responding to documents or other content to which the users have an emotional response., 36799=U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having illustrated and described the principles of our invention in a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. We claim all modifications coming within the spirit and scope of the accompanying claims. Another example of how templates can be used is illustrated in related co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No., 09/650,660, entitled \u201cPOLICY ENFORCEMENT USING THE SEMANTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF TRAFFIC,\u201d filed simultaneously herewith. The above-described embodiments of the invention can be implemented as software stored on a computer-readable medium. The program can then operated on a computer to execute the software. One use of the intentional stance impact template is for authors to try and gauge how their works will be received. An author can construct a template he expects his readers to use in reviewing the work. The author can then apply the template to the work and see how close the work comes to the template. For example, if the work discusses the medical benefits of abortion, the author can construct a template that an anti-abortion activist might use, and see how close the article comes to the template. This allows the author to estimate how others might respond to the work. The author can then further refine the work if the provoked response is not as desired.",
