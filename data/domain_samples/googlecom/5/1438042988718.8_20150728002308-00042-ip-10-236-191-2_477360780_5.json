    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21349=Using Surylyn\ufffd ionomer resins 1650 and 1800, he observed good Surlyn\ufffd/nylon adhesion in a 3 layer coextruded tube (5 mils nylon, 8 mils Surlyn\ufffd, 8 mils polyethylene). The good adhesion observed is a function of the thickness of the tube and the conditions of temperature and pressure at which it was produced. In commercial blown film and cast film lines composite barrier films, because of their cost, are made as thin as possible, especially with regard to the higher priced materials present. Composites of 4 mils or less made at maximum line speed are the rule., 21934=Our Surlyn\ufffd/nylon coextrusion experiments included Surlyn\ufffd 1650 and 1800, the two ionomers mentioned by Goehring as giving good adhesion to nylon. To a standard type 6 nylon polymer (\"Allied\" 8207) these ionomers gave 250 grams per inch and 110 grams per inch adhesion, respectively. Under the conditions of coextrusion we observed enhanced bonding to nylon over the narrow salt range of the present invention (cf. Examples) which range does not include either of these two resins employed by Goehring., 33917=The basic concepts of coextrusion are well described in the technical literature in articles such as P. J. Metz, Jr., 37 Multilayer Co-extrusion Coating\", Chapter 6, pp. 127-144; James E. Johnson, \"Co-extrusion\" Plastics Technology, Feb. 1976, pp. 45-49; and R. T. Van Ness and R. A. L. Eidman, \"Practical Coextrusion Coating\" Modern Packaging, Vol. 46, No. 8 August 1973, pp. 57-60., 37154=Sample film from each was placed in a 5% caustic solution to aid initial separation. Each day thereafter film was removed and separated if possible. Samples exhibiting high adhesion, especially ionomer \"B\" and ionomer \"I\" in combination with XPN-1132 nylon were very difficult to separate initially. After weeks of soaking in the 5% caustic solution, limited separation was possible. Film adhesion was measured in the machine and transverse direction on the separated samples. One inch wide strips were separated at 12 inches per minute using an Instron and adhesion was measured in grams per inch. Adhesion results are given in the following table., 38426=The adhesion of ionomer \"B\" to XPN-1132 exceeded the yield strength of the ionomer, thus an absolute value could not be obtained., 40713=The above ionomers were coextruded with Allied \"8207\" and \"XPN-1132 nylons under standard coextrusion conditions., 36651=The above ionomers were coextruded under standard conditions [throughput rate, 16 lbs/hr. (1:1 ionomer:nylon) and 24 lbs/hr (2:1 ionomer:nylon); melt temperature, 440\ufffd-460\ufffd F.; pressure No. 1 extruder (nylon), 250-700 psi (1.7-4.8 MPa); pressure No. 2 extruder (ionomer) 450-1500 psi (3.1-10.3 MPa) to Allied \"8207\" and Allied \"XPN-1132\" type 6 polycaproamide nylons producing 2 mil (1 mil ionomer/1 mil nylon) and 3 mil (2 mil ionomer/1 mil nylon) constructions.}",
