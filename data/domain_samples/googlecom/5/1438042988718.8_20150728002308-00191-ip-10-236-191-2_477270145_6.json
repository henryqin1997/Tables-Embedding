    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36764=Numerous approaches not directly related to the measurement of BERs have been taken to improve signal transmission quality in optical communications systems. Traditionally, the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) for an optical channel has been used to approximate or quantify the BER for that channel as a result of the known relationships between OSNR and BER. See P. C. Becker, N. A. Olsson, J. R. Simpson, \u201cErbuim-Doped Fiber Amplifiers,\u201d Academic Press, 1997, p.216. The OSNR value represents a measure of the relative strength of an optical transmission signal as compared to the background noise present in the signal. The OSNR can be typically measured by expensive hardware, such as an optical spectrum analyzer which adds additional, expensive equipment to the system, in combination with specially designed software. This hardware and software is often used within different repeater stages of the optical transmission system and is used to evaluate the overall optical signal spectrum and quantify the optical signal through a comparative analysis of the signal's spectral position and power (strength) vis-a-vis the signal's background noise. As an example, if the OSNR for a particular optical channel is measured to be below a certain, acceptable threshold value, one of the optical parameters of that optical channel, such as the optical channel power, may be adjusted until the OSNR (and thus BER) is increased.}",

Thus, while only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will be apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. , coupled to the WDM system. Finally, a fifth step 240 of the method includes adjusting an optical signal parameter within the WDM amplifier(s) based on the fed-back BER information. As a result of these steps, a signal is output from the amplifiers with substantially fewer errors or even no errors. FIG. 4 . This method includes, as an initial step 200, encoding an optical signal with one or more error correction codes using, for example, the ECC circuit in one of the transmitters. A second step, 210, of the method includes transmitting the optical signal along one of the multiple channels in the WDM system. A third step 220 of the method includes using the resident FEC module determine the number of errors in the ECC encoded signal that occurred in the channel over a period of time. A fourth step, 230, of the method includes feeding back information indicative of the bit-error rate over a feedback circuit, 80 of FIG. 4 , a method of the present invention is provided according to the additional embodiment",
