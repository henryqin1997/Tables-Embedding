    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, while the invention has been particularly shown and described above with reference to a preferred embodiment, the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. While the invention has been described above with respect to a preferred embodiment, it is apparent that in addition to the variations which have been discussed above, other variations are also possible. Thus, while it is believed preferable to compare the advertised products against the sales transactions since there will typically be a far lesser number of advertised products, particularly if such products are screened by knowledgeable personnel so that only advertised products offered a lower price are actually entered into the system, then there will be transactions during the time period. However, the invention can also be practiced by matching each transaction product against the stored advertised products. Further, while a step to determine if the geographic area for the transaction and for the advertised product are the same is not shown in FIG. 3, where advertised products for several geographic areas are stored in system 10, this step may be required. Alternatively, the rebate routine could be run separately for each geographic area. Further, while for the preferred embodiment a determination is made only at the end of the selected period, for example at the end of thirty",
