    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23640=As means for imparting a pressing force necessary for bonding the lapped portions, there is known a method in which the end portion of a member to be located on the outer side of the seam (often referred to as \"outer member\" hereinafter) is heated to increase the diameter thereof, a member to be located on the inner side of the seam (often referred to as \"inner member\" hereinafter) is fitted into the outer member through an adhesive layer, the end portion of the inner member is heated and the end portion of the inner member is thereby expanded in the end portion of the outer member to effect heat bonding through the adhesive (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. 32228/81)., 92589=An adhesive is coated on the entire circumference of the end edge of the lower member along a width of about 6 mm on the outer face side and a width of about 2 mm on the inner face side in the following manner. More specifically, in Example 12, the lower member is masked so that the end edge is exposed along a width of 6 mm on the outer face side and along a width of 2 mm on the inner face side, and nylon 12 is electrostatically coated on the lower member, and the coated portion is heated by an infrared ray heater to melt the powder and form a coating film having a thickness of about 85 \u03bcm. In Example 13, a film having a thickness of 80 \u03bcm and a width of 8 mm, which consists of a polyester B comprising as the dibasic acid component terephthalic acid and as the glycol component tetramethylene glycol and triethylene glycol at a molar ratio of 10/1, is applied to the entire circumference at the end edge of the outer face of the lower member heated in advance by high frequency induction heating so that the film protrudes from the end edge along about 2.5 mm. The protruding portion of the film is folded inward and applied to the inner face side while the end edge heated by high frequency induction heating, whereby a lower member having the end edge covered with the adhesive is formed. In Example 14, a copolyester blend consisting of a copolyester PET/I comprising as the dibasic acid component terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid at a molar ratio of 8.5/1.5 and ethylene glycol, a copolyester PBT/I comprising as the dibasic acid component terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid at a molar ratio of 6.5/3.5 and tetramethylene glycol and an ionomer (PET/I:PBT/I:ionomer blend ratio=1:7:2), which is in the form of a film having a thickness of 80 \u03bcm and a width of 8 mm, is coated in the predetermined shape in the same manner as in Example, 13. In Example 15, a powder of maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene having a particle size of about 30 \u03bcm is coated in the predetermined shape on the end edge of the lower member in the same manner as in Example 12. In Example 16, a part of the end edge of the lower member is immersed in the state inclined at about 70\ufffd from the vertical direction into a bath filled with a 30% solution of a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer comprising vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate at a ratio of 9:1 while the lower member is gently rotated. The solvent is evaporated and the resin is melted in a hot air oven to form an adhesive film of the above-mentioned shape having a thickness of about 80 \u03bcm on the end edge portion of the lower member. In Comparative Example 7, a powder having a particle size of about 25 \u03bcm, which consists of a blend comprising an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA; ethylene:vinyl acetate copolymerization ratio=8.5:1.5) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) at an EVA:HDPE blend ratio of 1:9, is coated in the predetermined shape on the end edge of the lower member in the same manner as in Example 12., 46773=In order for this thermoplastic resin to sufficiently wet the surface of a metallic material constituting the seam or a primer coated thereon even under a relatively low pressure and provide a strong and durable bonding to this surface, it is preferred that the thermoplastic resin should contain in the main or side chain thereof polar groups at a certain concentration. In the present invention, therefore, a thermoplastic resin containing in the main or side chain groups ##STR1## (hereinafter referred to as \"carbonyl groups\") at a concentration of 10 to 1400 milliequivalents (meq), preferably 12 to 1200 meq, per 100 g of the resin is used. These carbonyl groups are derived from carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid salts, carboxylic anhydrides, carboxylic acid esters, carboxylic acid amides, ketones, carbonic acid esters, urea, urethane or the like. This thermoplastic polymer can be obtained by introducing a monomer having the above-mentioned functional group into the main chain of a polymer by homopolymerization or copolymerization or by bonding this monomer to a thermoplastic resin by graft polymerization or terminal treatment. Moreover, a thermoplastic resin containing carbonyl groups at the above-mentioned concentration can be obtained by oxidizing a hydrocarbon polymer such as an olefin resin.}",
