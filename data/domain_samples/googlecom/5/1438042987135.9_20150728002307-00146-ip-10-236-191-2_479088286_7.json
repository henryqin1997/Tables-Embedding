In response to analogue air signal 1418, plug valve 1404 changes the orifice size associated with flow meter 1406 in an amount necessary to drive the error between the actual flow rate and the desired flow rate through flow meter 1406 to a minimum. In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment, a real time, closed loop PID control scheme is employed by processor 1416 to effect this function., 86915=In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, throughput may be increased by simultaneously rinsing both the upper and lower surfaces of each workpiece. Moreover, by orienting upper surface rinse fluid supply port 1202 with respect to the upper surface of the workpiece as shown in FIG. 12B, the perimeter edge of the workpiece may also be effectively rinsed. In a preferred embodiment, rinse fluid is applied to the top surface at a rate in the range of 0.1-20 liters/minute, and most preferably about 4-5 liters/minute; similarly, rinse fluid is advantageously applied to the bottom surface at a rate in the range of 0.1-10 liters/minute, and most preferably about 1.5 liters/minute., 92505=With continued reference to FIG. 17, respective button actuators 1704 may be urged upwardly and downwardly through any desired mechanism, for example pneumatically., 85134=Referring now to FIGS. 11 and 13, the workpiece is substantially centered about manifold 1010 through the interaction of respective wafer guides 1022, 1024 and respective centering pins 1018, 1020 as each workpiece is transferred from scrubber box 104 to the rinse ring along arrow 1026. Although the perimeter edge of each workpiece may gently contact wafer guides 1022, 1024 and/or one or both centering pins 1018, 1020, the mechanical contact between the flat workpiece surfaces and rinse ring body 1008 is substantially avoided., 83951=More particularly and referring now to FIGS. 10-13, each respective rinse ring assembly 1002, 1004 suitably comprises a ring body 1008 mounted to shuttle arm 1006. Ring body 1008 suitably comprises a fluid manifold 1010 communicating with respective fluid supply ports 1012A, 1012B, and 1012C. Manifold 1010 is advantageously configured with a plurality of jets 1014 disposed about a substantially horizontal surface 1016 of ring body 1008. Fluid supply ports 1012 supply fluid to the internal region of manifold 1010, such that fluid is ejected from respective jets 1014 at a substantially uniform pressure and flow about the arc defined by surface 1016., 105096=In accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention, air servo 1410 and plug valve 1404 could simply be eliminated, such that a direct actuation device may be employed to vary the orifice size of flow meter 1406. In this regard, any suitable torque motor, stepper motor, servo motor, or the like could be employed to directly control the orifice site associated with the flow meter., 60750=For a more detailed discussion of wafer cassettes and cassettes useful in the context of machine 100, see, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/671,155, entitled \"Adjustable Wafer Cassette Stand\", filed Jun. 28, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,779,203 in the name of Erich Edlinger, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated into this application by this reference., 109117=More particularly and referring to now FIG. 2, the various processing stations (e.g., wafer loading station 102, scrubber station 104) may be contained within separate subframe structures which together comprise the frame associated with machine 100. For example, a frame member 2102 associated with station 102 is shown abutting against a frame member 2104 associated with scrubber station 104. Respective frame members 2102 and 2104 may be secured to one another, for example through bolts or other fasteners, as desired. If it is desired to augment machine 100 to include an additional module, for example an additional scrubber box, an additional cassette assembly, or perhaps a module relating to entirely different functionality (e.g., planarization, lapping, or the like), respective stations 102 and 104 may be separated at the junction 2106 which defines their interface, and an additional functional module inserted therebetween. The newly inserted functional module may also include a first, second, and third tier component which respectively house the processing, maintenance, and control functionality of the additional module, as desired., 44175=Machines for cleaning wafers and disks in the electronics industry are generally well known. For example, semiconductor wafers, magnetic disks, and other workpieces often come in the form of flat, substantially planar, circular disks. In the manufacture of integrated circuits, semiconductor wafer disks are sliced from a silicon ingot and prepared for further processing. After each wafer is sliced from the ingot, it must be thoroughly cleaned, rinsed, and dried to remove debris from the surface of the wafer. Thereafter, a series of steps are performed on the wafer to build the integrated circuits on the wafer surface, including applying a layer of microelectronic structures, followed by the application of a dielectric layer. Often, the disks must be planarized upon the application of the dielectric layer. For a discussion of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) processes and apparatus, see, for example, Arai, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,099,614, issued March 1992; Karlsrud, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,196, issued March 1996; Arai, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,348, issued February 1989; Karlsrud et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,732, issued July 1994; and Karlsrud et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,199, issued March 1996., 103462=Also in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, flow meter 1406 may suitably comprise a rotory wheel flow meter/switch, for example, a model number M-10000T, M10000TM-200T, or the like available from the Malema Engineering Corporation., 85686=With particular reference to FIGS. 10B and 12A, when a workpiece is substantially centered within the rinse ring and supported by the supporting fluid ejected from jets 1014 (FIG. 13), the workpiece is said to be completely transferred from scrubber station 104 and received within the rinse station. At that point, shuttle assembly 1006 (FIG. 11) shuttles to the next position so that the other rinse ring can receive a workpiece from the scrubber station. Upon shuttling from the right position to the left position (or vice versa), rinse ring 1002 (or alternatively, rinse ring 1004) is caused to tilt downwardly as shown in FIGS. 10B and 12A, deviating from the horizontal plane by an angle in the range of 10\ufffd-50\ufffd, and most preferably about 30\ufffd. In this position, rinsing fluid is supplied to both the upper surface and bottom surface of the workpiece. More particularly and with momentary reference to FIG. 12B, a first fluid nozzle 1202 is suitably configured to discharge rinse fluid at the upper surface of the workpiece, substantially along arrow 1204. A second rinse nozzle 1206 is suitably configured to discharge rinse fluid at the bottom surface of the workpiece, substantially along arrow 1208., 106691=More particularly and with continued reference FIG. 19, tier 1902 further comprises a plurality of drawers which permit the operator to access various control functionality. In particular, a first drawer 1908 suitably houses a fluid compartment comprising fluid control valves and the like. A second drawer 1910 suitably houses a pneumatics compartment, comprising vacuum lines, pneumatic control valves and the like. A third drawer 1912 suitably comprises the control functionality relating to the electronics of the machine, including input-output ports and a distributed processor, for example one available from Berkly Process Control., 45411=After each processing step, it is often desirable to thoroughly clean, rinse, and dry the workpiece to ensure that all debris is removed from the workpiece. Thus, methods and apparatus for quickly and efficiently cleaning, rinsing, and drying wafers are needed which facilitate high workpiece throughput, while at the same time thoroughly cleaning and drying the wafers with a minimum of wafer breakage. For a discussion of existing wafer cleaning machines, see, for example, Lutz U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,828 issued on Aug. 22, 1995; Frank, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,451 issued on May 25, 1993; and Onodera, U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,645, issued on Oct. 25, 1994., 103742=With continued reference to FIG. 14, a desired flow rate through flow meter 1406 to fluid site 1408 is suitably programmed into processor 1416 prior to (or during) operation of machine 100. During operation, flow meter 1406 outputs an electrical signal 1414 indicative of the actual flow rate through flow meter 1406 to site 1408. Processor 1416 receives electrical signal 1414 and, responding thereto, adjusts the orifice size associated with flow meter 1406 as necessary to maintain the actual flow rate within a predetermined range from the desired set point flow rate., 95562=In accordance with an alternate embodiment, the spin-dry assembly is suitably accelerated from the rest position to approximately the clamping speed at a first acceleration, for example in the range of 20-1,000 rpm/sec/sec, and most preferably about 250-300 rpm/second/second. In the alternate embodiment, this original acceleration up to clamping speed suitably occurs in the range of 0.5-5 seconds, and most preferably in the range of about 1-2 seconds. Thereafter, once the workpiece is clamped by the spin assembly, the assembly accelerates from clamping speed (e.g. 500 rpm) to top speed (e.g. 4,000 rpm) at a substantially linear (but suitably higher) acceleration. For example, the spin assembly may be accelerated from 500-4,000 rpm in the range of 0.5-10 seconds and most preferably in the range of about 1-2 seconds., 89706=Each bob 1800 suitably comprises an upper body portion 1802, a lower body portion 1804, a pivot arm 1810, a wafer clamp 1806, a button 1808, and a spring seat 1812. Each bob 1800 is suitably pivotably secured within each respective slot 1610 through any convenient mechanism, for example by extending pivot bar 1810 through corresponding pivot supports (not shown) in platform 1600., 90108=During the operation of spin platform 1600, i.e., when spin platform 1600 is spinning, workpiece 122 is suitably clamped by respective bobs 1800. More particularly, a suitable spring 1608 is configured to bias bob 1800 such that wafer clamp 1806 is urged upwardly; in so doing, each wafer clamp is also urged inwardly, securely holding workpiece 122 in place as shown in FIG. 17. When it is desired to unload a dried workpiece from the spin platform and to load a new, recently rinsed workpiece on to the empty spin platform, a respective button actuator assembly 1704 associated with spin-dry assembly 110 and disposed proximate each of the bobs is configured to extend upwardly along arrow 1702 and contact the under surface of bob 1800, generally as indicated by arrow 1702. As a result, the spring force exerted by spring 1608 is counteracted, such that each wafer clamp 1806 associated with each bob is urged radially outwardly allowing workpiece 122 to drop downwardly, supported only by respective buttons 1808. In this regard, each respective button is suitably made from a soft, resilient material which will not damage the under surface of the workpiece. With the wafer clamps in this retracted position, transfer mechanism 112 retrieves the workpiece and transfers it to unload station 114. First transfer station 108 then retrieves a recently rinsed workpiece from rinse station 106 and transfers the workpiece to spin platform 1600., 102487=With continued reference to FIG. 14, an exemplary hydraulic control scheme 1400 suitably comprises a tank 1402 for holding a supply of a desired processing fluid, a flow meter 1406 having a variable orifice size, a plug valve 1404 for controlling the orifice size of flow meter 1406, and an air servo 1410 for providing an analogue air signal to plug valve 1404, and a processor 1416. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a suitable air servo may comprise a model number QB2T1300 manufactured by Proportion-Air of McCordsville, Ind. under U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,758. In a preferred embodiment, servo valve 1410 suitably comprises a single loop model having internal valves, manifold, internal pressure transducer and electronic controls configured to output an air pressure proportional to an input electrical signal. In the illustrated embodiment, electrical signal 1412 from processor 1416 suitably controls the output of servo 1410., 101902=Referring now to FIG. 14, an exemplary fluid control scheme in accordance with one aspect of the present invention is illustrated. In particular, an exemplary fluid site 1408 may comprise a rinse ring, a fluid inlet port in cleaning station 104, or a workpiece rinse supply port, for example. Through the operation of the process controller (or one of several process controllers) 1416 associated with machine 100, the volume rate of fluid flow to fluid site 1408 may be accurately controlled notwithstanding the presence of variations in the fluid supply pressure., 107882=To further facilitate the convenient maintenance, repair, and extension of machine 100, respective drawers 1908-1912 are suitably slidingly moveable with respect to the frame of machine 100, for example using ball bearing slide mechanisms functionally analogous to those used in file drawers. To facilitate the opening, closing, and removal of the drawers, the various electrical conduits associated with drawer 1912, the pneumatic conduits associated with drawer 1910, and the hydraulic conduits associated with drawer 1908 are suitably encased in respective flexible conduit tracks 1914A-D. In operation, an end 1916 of an exemplary flexible conduit 1914A is suitably attached to the rear portion 1918 of drawer 1912. Thus, as drawer 1912 is opened, flexible conduit 1916 moves along with the drawer. As conduit 1914A slides along with drawer 1912, the various electrical conduits within sleeve 1914A remain stationery and protected from damage by conduit 1914A., 82701=As each workpiece comes out of scrubbing station 104, it is received by rinsing station 106. More particularly, a preferred exemplary embodiment of rinse station 106 suitably comprises a first rinse ring 1002 and a second rinse ring 1004 each mounted to a shuttle arm 1006. In operation, shuttle arm 1006 alternately shifts back and forth from a left position (as shown in FIG. 2) to a right position (as shown in FIG. 11). As a result of the alternating left-to-right shifting operation of shuttle assembly 1006, a workpiece carried by rinse ring 1002 may assume position A (when the shuttle assembly is in the left position shown in FIG. 2) or position B (when the shuttle assembly is in the right position shown in FIG. 11); analogously, the workpiece carried by rinse ring 1004 may assume position B (when the shuttle assembly is in the left position shown in FIG. 2) or position C (when the shuttle assembly is in the right position shown in FIG. 11)., 88074=Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 2, first transfer station 108 suitably comprises a robotic arm 109 configured to retrieve a rinsed workpiece from rinse ring 1004 and transfer the workpiece to a spin-dry assembly 111. A similar robotic assembly (not shown) is disposed within transfer station 108, and configured to retrieve a rinsed workpiece from rinse ring 1002 (when rinse ring 1002 is in position A as shown in FIG. 2) and transfer the workpiece to spin-dry assembly 113. The use of dual rinse rings, transfer assemblies, and spin-dry stations in accordance with the present invention further facilitates increased workpiece throughput through machine 100., 91573=More particularly, with respective wafer clamps 1806 in their retracted, unclamped positions, first transfer station 108 places a workpiece on spin platform 1600 supported only by respective buttons 1808. In this unclamped position, spin platform 1600, driven by the drive motor (not shown) discussed below, begins spinning at relatively low rpms (e.g. in the range of 500 rpm). Once a desired clamping spin speed is achieved, respective biasing mechanisms 1704 are moved downwardly, such that each respective spring 1608 causes each bob 1800 to pivot about pivot bar 1810, such that the respective wafer clamps 1806 are urged radially inwardly, thereby clamping the workpiece. In this regard, the beveled configuration of respective clamps 1806 permit the clamps to lift the workpiece off of the buttons slightly, suitably to preclude contact between the workpiece and the buttons during the spinning operation., 92689=With momentary reference to FIG. 2, each of respective spin-dry assemblies 111, 113 are suitably enclosable within a spin-dry chamber 1820. More particularly, a first door 1822 and a second door 1824 may be suitably configured to open (e.g., by extending vertically upwardly, vertically downwardly, or in any convenient manner) to permit the robotic arm associated with first transfer station 108 to transfer a workpiece from the rinse station onto the spin-dry platform. Analogously, a second door 1824 may be configured to open to permit second transfer station 112 to transfer a dried workpiece, after spin-drying, from the spin-dry platform to unload station 114. However, during the spin-dry operation, i.e., when the recently rinsed workpiece is spun at high speed to remove water from the surfaces of the workpiece, respective doors 1822 and 1824 are advantageously closed to prevent fluid which is thrown off of or otherwise liberated from the workpiece and the spin-dry assembly from contaminating dry disks within unload station 114. In addition, door 1822 may also be maneuvered to prevent water from rinse station 106 and/or transfer station 108 from entering chamber 1820 once a workpiece has been dried., 105805=More particularly and referring to FIG. 19, in a preferred embodiment machine 100 suitably comprises a first control tier 1902, a second maintenance tier 1904, and a third process plane tier 1906. Top tier 1906 suitably corresponds to the workpiece processes described above, and advantageously comprises the various spin assemblies, rinse assemblies, scrubber box, and the like, as well as the various motors and actuators associated therewith. Maintenance tier 1904 suitably comprises a plurality of access panels (not shown for clarity) to permit convenient access to various daily and weekly maintenance items, including air filters, fluid filters, and the like. Control tier 1902 suitably houses various features relating to control functions, advantageously organized in discreet compartments each comprising functionally related hardware and related fixtures., 84626=With particular reference to FIGS. 10B, 12A and 12B, as a workpiece 122 is discharged from scrubber box 104, the plane of travel of the workpiece is substantially defined by plane 123. As best seen in FIG. 12A, plane 123 is slightly above (e.g., 5-20 mm and preferably about 10 mm) the horizontal surface defined by surface 1016 of ring body 1008. The fluid (not shown) ejected from jets 1014 supports workpiece 122 as the workpiece is transferred from the scrubber box to the rinse ring., 88939=Each spin-dry assembly in accordance with the present invention suitably comprises a spin platform 1600 configured to hold the workpiece as it is spin dried. More particularly, platform 1600 suitably comprises a flat upper surface 1602 having a plurality (e.g. 3) of slots 1610 which extend through disk shaped platform 1600. The under surface of platforms 1600 suitably comprises a hub 1606 having a cylindrical cavity 1604 for receiving a drive shaft (not shown); the drive shaft is suitably connected to a spinner motor, discussed below, for rotating support platform 1600. A bob 1800 is suitably disposed within each slot 1610 and configured to clamp a workpiece during the rotation of spin platform 1600, as described in greater detail below.}",
