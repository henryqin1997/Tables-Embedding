    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33114=An alternative approach is to produce tunable filters comprising linear resistors instead of MOSFET resistors, and a tunable array of capacitors. This is proposed by A. M. Durham, J. B. Hughes and W. Redman-White in \u201cCircuit Architectures for High Linearity Monolithic Continuous Time Filters\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems\u2014II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing, Vol. 39, No. 9, September 1992, pp. 651\u201457. According to this technique the RC time constant of the filter is measured and compared with the nominal design value. The number of active capacitors in the array, that is, the number of capacitors actually connected to the RC network of the filter amplifier, is adjusted to keep the filter circuit within a desired RC range. Due to the employment of passive resistors instead of MOSFET elements, the filter is highly linear. Moreover, the RC time constant of the filter is determined by a digital code supplied to the array that may conveniently be stored in a latch once the digital code has been established. Although the accuracy of the RC time constant is limited by the available number of switchable capacitors in the array, and, hence, by the number of bits of the digital code, a range of \ufffd5% to \ufffd10% for the corner frequency of the filter is sufficient for many low to medium frequency applications so that the filters can be tuned with a relatively low number of capacitors in the array.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Further modifications and alternative embodiments of various aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the general manner of carrying out the present invention. Although the embodiments have been described with reference to a filter circuit including an integrator it is to be understood that the embodiments described herein are also applicable to any other type of active filter circuits, such as Bessel filters, Chebeychev filters, Butterworth filters and the like. Furthermore, the time constant of the filter circuit to be tuned may be adjusted by providing an array of resistors to compensate for variations. The filter circuit may additionally include one or more inductive elements rather than only resistors and capacitors, or the resistor or the capacitors are replaced by inductors. While the embodiments contemplated may be particularly useful when the active filter circuit and the tuning circuit are incorporated in an integrated circuit, they may also be applied to a separately provided filter circuit. In this case, linear elements of the active filter circuit may be used as the tuning elements of the tuning circuit. Although the implementation of the conversion function in the decoder as a look-up table is described, in a further embodiment any other appropriate means, such as a",
