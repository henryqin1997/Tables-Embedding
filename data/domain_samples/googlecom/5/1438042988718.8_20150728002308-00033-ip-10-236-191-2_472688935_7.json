Cylindrical body 210 is configured to be positioned and received within receiving chamber 150 of engaging member 140, and is selectively coupled thereto through the use of screw 164 or another connector. Screw 164 selectively extends through aperture 152 (FIG. 4A) and into annular groove 212 (FIGS. 5A-C), thereby retaining cylindrical body 210 in a desired position within receiving chamber 150 of engaging member 140. In order to rotate holder 180 in either direction in a 360 degree range of motion, set screw 164 is loosened, and mount 16 is then rotated in the direction of arrow 54 or 55 (FIG. 1), then the set screw 164 is tightened again, thereby securing the position of holder 180 with respect to engaging member 140.}",

Cylindrical body 350 is received in mating relationship within chamber 112\u2032 and enables convenient 360 degree rotation with respect to the main body 14 selectively connected thereto. Extension member 358 extends away from cylindrical body 350 such that the longitudinal axis of extension member 358 is aligned with the longitudinal axis 372 (e.g., parallel to, or along the same axis) of cylindrical body 350. Hence, teeth 370 are oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis 372 of cylindrical body 350. Aperture 364 defines a threaded passageway 374 through which the body 342 of bolt 304 extends during assembly. Second joint member 302 thus has (i) a cylindrical body 350 at a first end of joint member 302 which adjustably couples to second main body 14; and (ii) an aperture 364 at a second end of second joint member 302 about which teeth 370 extend., 103133=As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 9A-C, first joint member 300 comprises: (i) a cylindrical body 310 having a first end 312 and a second end 314 and an annular groove 316 therebetween; (ii) an extension member 318 extending from the cylindrical body 310, the extension member 318 having a first end 320 that is coupled to the second end 314 of the cylindrical body 310 and a second end 322 having an aperture 324 therein; and (iii) a circular array of teeth 330 on the second end 322 of member 318 extending concentrically about the aperture 324 such that the aperture extends through the teeth 330 and the second end 322 of extension member 318. Cylindrical body 310 is received in mating relationship within chamber 112 and enables convenient 360 degree rotation with respect to the main body 12 selectively connected thereto. Extension member 318 extends away from cylindrical body 310 such that the longitudinal axis of extension member 318 is aligned with the longitudinal axis 332 (e.g., parallel to, or along the same axis) of cylindrical body 310. Hence, teeth 330 are oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis 332 of cylindrical body 310.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. Additional disclosure relating to the embodiments of the present invention is available in the U.S. patent applications filed on Mar. 18, 2005 and entitled \u201cAdjustable Splint for Osteosynthesis with Modular Joint,\u201d and \u201cAdjustable Splint for Osteosynthesis with Modular Components,\u201d each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Although mounts such as mounts 16, 18, and 20 are identified as possible mounts of the present invention, a variety of different mounts may be employed to connect a bone connector to a main body. Thus, a \u201cmount \u201d as referenced in this specification or the appended claims may be any material or structure that connects a bone connector to a splint main body. illustrate optional grooves of the two-part collars of the present invention. Each groove can be used for a differently shaped bone connector, such as a screw. For example, collar member 242 b features a pair of elongated ovoid grooves 580 a-b which can be used",
