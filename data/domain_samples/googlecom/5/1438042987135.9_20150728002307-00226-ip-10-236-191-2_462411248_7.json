    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6400=A pseudo-color representation of the resulting two-color fluorescence is shown in FIG. 1. Substantially all cells were located with reference to green Syto13 fluorescence, and secreted product was identified with reference to red AlexaFluor-532 fluorescence. Note that the pseudo-color image displays red and green overlap as yellow. Manual selection of cells with the desired secretion profile was easily performed using such images. Alternatively, automated image processing was used to determine a quantitative signal value for each cell based on the integrated red intensity in the annular region extending from the cell membrane to approximately 10 \u03bcm out. Four representative cells are circled and numbered in panel A, and shown magnified in the panels labeled 1 to 4. Panels 1 to 4 show the annular region within which the integrated red intensity was calculated. The signal value was 2907 for cell 1 (high secretor), 1440 for cell 2 (moderate secretor), 141 for cell 3 (low secretor), and 1.1 for cell 4 (undetectable above background; essentially zero secretion). This manual or automated locating of all cells and selected is used to locate and irradiate non-selected cells, resulting in purification of one or more selected cells.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{117782=The methods of the invention for purifying one or more selected cells involve irradiating non-selected ceils with a substantially lethal dose of radiation. The energy beam from the treatment laser is of a wavelength and energy that is useful for achieving immediate or eventual death of the targeted cell. A variety of laser-tissue interactions are known to occur, depending upon the nature of the tissue (for example, light absorbance) and parameters of the laser beam including wavelength and power density, the latter being a function of energy and time of exposure (that is, pulse duration). Photomechanical mechanisms are induced by high power densities (>1010 W/cm2) with short laser pulses (<1 ns) (Niemz, M. H., Laser-tissue interactions: Fundamentals and applications Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1996)). Photomechanical effects are mediated by breaking of molecular bonds by high-energy photons and formation of ionizing plasma without thermal damage, and are used in medical applications such as corneal and dental surgery. In contrast, photothermal effects are induced when tissue exhibits high light absorption resulting in heat generation. Light absorption by biological tissues is greatest in the infrared (IR) spectrum due to absorption by water. Absorption in the UV and visible spectrum is 5-7 orders of magnitude lower than in IR, such that photothermal effects are difficult to achieve unless mid-IR lasers (for example, Er:YAG at 2940 nm) are used. Such IR lasers are used in medical applications including laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy, but are not well-suited for microscopic applications due to poor transmission by microscope optics and inability to focus to small beam diameters. Photothermal effects can instead be achieved by adding a chromophore to increase absorption at the laser wavelength. In any case, photothermal effects are determined by the temperature achieved in the tissue and the duration of exposure (Niemz, M. H., Laser-tissue interactions: Fundamentals and applications Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1996)). Induction of necrosis due to denaturation and coagulation of proteins is first observed at 60\ufffd C., and further heating to 80\ufffd C. results in cell membrane permeabilization. Finally, photochemical effects, observed mainly in the UV spectrum where biological molecules (that is, proteins, nucleic acids, porphyrins) strongly absorb, result in various forms of tissue damage and can be used to induce apoptosis in targeted cells., 121530=Particularly useful in the methods of the invention for purifying one or more selected cells are lasers capable of delivering a dose of radiation having an energy density selected from the group of greater than 0.1 J/cm2, greater than 0.3 J/cm2, greater than 1 J/cm2, greater than 3 J/cm2, greater than 10 J/cm2, greater than 30 J/cm2, and greater than 100 J/cm2. Also useful are lasers capable of delivering a dose of radiation having an irradiance selected from the group of greater than 107 W/cm2, greater than 108 W/cm2, greater than 109 W/cm2, greater than 110 W/cm2, and greater than 1011 W/cm2; as used herein, the term irradiance means power per area, and is often expressed in units of watts per square centimeter. Further useful are lasers that deliver radiation having a wavelength selected from the group of between 200 and 400 nm, between 400 and 760 nm, and between 760 and 3000 nm., 120351=The photothermal mechanism can be implemented by addition of a non-toxic light-absorbing dye (Allura Red). A 10 ns pulsed 523 nm Nd:YLF laser (Spectra-Physics) is focused to a \u02dc5-20 \u03bcm diameter spot and then fired at each non-selected cell. Using 4 mg/ml of Allura Red, the LD50 was 9\ufffd107 W/cm2, and substantially all target cells were killed at power densities greater than or equal to 2\ufffd108 W/cm2. Photochemical cell elimination can be implemented with a 0.5 ns pulsed laser at 355 nm (JDS Uniphase) focused to a \u02dc5-20 \u03bcm diameter spot. The LD50 was 2.6\ufffd109 W/cm2, and substantially all target cells were killed at \u22671010 W/cm2, principally via induction of apoptosis over a 4-24 hour period. For photomechanical cell elimination, a short-pulsed (0.5 ns) 532 nm laser (JDS Uniphase) was focused down to \u02dc5-20 \u03bcm in diameter. The LD50 was 2.2\ufffd1010 W/cm2, and at power densities \u22678\ufffd1010 W/cm2, substantially all of the target cells were eliminated resulting in immediate cell lysis.}",

Note the significantly improved level of antibody secretion in each selected clonal line as compared to the parental cell line. FIG. 4 Every 48 hours, 1 ml of medium was transferred to a tube and flash frozen. Fresh medium was added to each well. This process was repeated for 5 cycles (that is, 10 days). At the end of the process, the aliquots were thawed, combined, and 1 ml was purified using a Protein-A column (Hi-Trap; Amersham, Piscataway, N.J.). The purified protein was then run through PD-10 de-salting columns. The final product was characterized by ELISA.
