The RAM 1004 is a storage means used as a working area or the like for the CPU 1000 and stores given contents of the information storage medium 1006 and ROM 1002, the results of computation by the CPU 1000 and so on. A structure of data having a logical configuration as a table data or the like can be configured on the RAM or information storage medium., 76236=FIG. 11C shows another game system to which the present embodiment is applied. This game system comprises a host device 1300 and terminals 1304-1 through 1304-n which are connected to the host device 1300 through a communication line 1302. In such a case, the stored information has been stored, for example, in an information storage medium 1306 which may be any one of a magnetic disc device, magnetic tape device, memory and so on, all of which can be controlled by the host device 1300. If each of the terminals 1304-1 through 1304-n is a stand-alone machine which includes a CPU, an image generating IC and a sound generating IC to generate game images and game sounds, a game program for generating game images and game sounds and so on are delivered to each of the terminals 1304-1 through 1304-n. If each of the terminals 1304-1 through 1304-n is not a stand-alone machine and cannot generate game images and game sounds, the host device 1300 generates game images and game sounds which are in turn fed to all the terminals 1304-1 through 1304-n., 70224=An arrangement of hardware which can realize the present embodiment will be described with reference to FIG. 10. The hardware comprises a CPU 1000, a ROM 1002, a RAM 1004, an information storage medium 1006, a sound generating IC 1008, an image-generating IC 1010 and I/O ports 1012, 1014, all of which are interconnected together through a system bus 1016 for transmission/reception. The image generating IC 1010 is connected to a display 1018; the sound generating IC 1008 is connected to a speaker 1020; the I/O port 1012 is connected to a control device 1022; and the I/O port 1014 is connected to a communication device 1024., 71436=The control device 1022 corresponds to a game controller or control panel and is used for inputting the results of judgment performed by a player during progress of game into the system., 72378=Since the system includes the sound generating IC 1008 and the image generating IC 1010, the sounds and images of the game can be outputted in a preferred manner. The sound generating IC 1008 is an integrated circuit for generating game sounds such as effect sounds and background music based on the information stored in the information storage medium 1006 and ROM 1002. The generated game sounds are outputted through the speaker 1020. The image generating IC 1010 is an integrated circuit for generating pixel information to be outputted toward the display 1018 based on the image information from the RAM 1004, ROM 1002, information storage medium 1006 and so on. The display 1018 may be a so-called \u201chead mount display (HMD)\u201d., 75799=FIG. 11B shows a domestic game system to which the present embodiment is applied. Players enjoy a game by operating game controllers 1202 and 1204 while viewing a game image displayed on a display 1200. In such a case, the stored information has been stored in a CD-ROM 1206, IC cards 1208, 1209 and so on which are information storage media detachably mounted in the system., 71000=The information storage medium 1006 stores mainly programs, image data used for representing objects, sound data and so on. For example, a domestic game system may include a CD-ROM, game cassette or DVD as an information storage medium for storing game programs and so on. An arcade game system may use a ROM or the like. In such a case, the information storage medium 1006 becomes the ROM 1002., 73213=The communication device 1024 sends and receives the various information utilized in the game system to and from external means. The communication device 1024 may be connected to other game system for transmitting/receiving given information depending on the game programs or for transmitting/receiving the information of game programs and the like through a communication line., 73625=Various processes described in connection with FIGS. 1-7, 9A and 9B are realized by the information storage medium 1006 which stores the programs for performing such processes as shown in the flow chart of FIG. 8 and by the CPU 1000, image generating IC 1010, sound generating IC 1008 and others which are controlled according to the programs. The processes performed by the image generating IC 1010, sound generating IC 1008 and others may be performed by CPU 1000 or an all-purpose DSP in a software manner., 74224=FIG. 11A shows an arcade game system to which the present embodiment is applied. A player enjoys a game by operating a lever 1102, buttons 1104 and so on while viewing a game image displayed on a display 1100. A system board 1106 in the system comprises a CPU, an image generating IC, a sound generating IC and so on. A memory 1108 or information storage medium on the system board 1106 stores various information, that is: information for causing the virtual camera to follow the first displayed object while changing the angle of view of the virtual camera based on the positional information of the first and second displayed objects; information for generating an image as seen from the virtual camera; information for increasing the angle of view as the distance between the first and second displayed objects decreases and for decreasing the angle of view as the distance increases; information for setting the angle of view at a fixed value if the distance between the first and second displayed objects is less than a given threshold value; information for directing the virtual camera in a direction from the first displayed object or its vicinity toward the second displayed object or its vicinity; and other information. These information will be called \u201cstored information\u201d hereinafter. The stored information includes at least one of program codes for performing the above processes, image information, sound information, object shape information, table data, list data, player information and so on.}",

FIG. 15 shows an image generated when the angle of view is fixed irrespective of the distance between the character 70 and the item 72. In such a case, the player cannot clearly know about the item 72 in the distance. FIGS. 14A and 14B show images generated when the present invention is applied to a role-playing game. In FIGS. 14A and 14B, the first displayed object is a character 70 coming on the game while the second object is an item 72 to be acquired by the character 70. When the distance between the character 70 and the item 72 is relatively short, the angle of view is relatively large as shown in FIG. 14A. If the distance is relatively long, the angle of view is relatively small as shown in FIG. 14B.
