    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{85153=In a preferred embodiment, the hybrid terminal 110 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows a user to select a list of applications that will use the terrestrial link, rather than the satellite link, for retrieving information from the Internet 128. An example of a user interface 1410 is shown in FIG. 14. The interface 1410 allows a user to select which applications will use the terrestrial link (referred to hereafter as \"terrestrial applications\"). For example, applications such as Telnet, Finger and Ping, which require fast response time but low bandwidth, may be selected to use the terrestrial link. The hybrid terminal 110 may also be configured such that these applications (and/or other applications) are routed through the terrestrial link by default., 72658=Satellite gateway 160 expects IP packets to be encapsulated first in a special satellite packet and then within an LLC-1 IEEE 802.2 link level control, type 1 packet. Satellite header 1020 identifies the downlink and contains a sequence number and the packet length. An LLC-1 header 1030 preferably is used to send the packet to satellite gateway 160, in an Ethernet LAN. Hybrid gateway 150 prepares packets for satellite gateway 160 by appending headers 1020 and 1030 to the front of an IP packet 1010., 67334=Because TCP/IP software 210 preferably is configured to talk to the Ethernet and it is desirable to receive the largest packet size possible, driver 114 configures TCP/IP so that the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the network is as large as possible, e.g., 1500 bytes. Some SLIP providers 130 have a smaller MTU, e.g., 512 bytes. To handle the disparity in size, driver 114 segments large packets received from TCP/IP software 210 into segments the size of the SLIP MTU. Once a packet is segmented, it is reassembled in hybrid gateway 150. Only the tunnelling header is copied as the header of the segments., 73181=The receiver in hybrid terminal 110 does not receive the LLC-1 header 1030. Hybrid terminal 110 identifies packets intended for it by checking a least significant byte in the satellite IP address. Thus, a six byte satellite destination address is determined by reversing an order of bytes of the satellite IP address for hybrid terminal 110 and then padding the rest of the address with zeroes., 63741=FIG. 8 is a flowchart of steps performed in a preferred embodiment by driver 114 of hybrid terminal 110. FIG. 11 is a diagram showing a preferred TCP packet format. FIG. 11 includes a sequence number field 1102, an acknowledgment (ACK) number field 1104, and a checksum field 1106. In step 810 of FIG. 8, driver 114 receives an ACK packet with sequence number N from TCP/IP software 210. The packet is queued along with other packets waiting to be sent to SLIP provider 130. In step 820 driver 114 checks to determine whether there is a \"run\" of sequential packets waiting to be sent. If so, in step 830, driver 114 deletes ACK packets for the same TCP connection that have sequence numbers in the run from the queue and sends an ACK only for the highest sequence number in the run. This action alleviates the bottleneck caused by the relatively slow modem speeds., 72027=The following paragraphs describe how packets travel from application server 140 through hybrid gateway 150 and to satellite gateway 160. The following explanation is given by way of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. As shown in step 930 of FIG. 9, hybrid gateway 150 encapsulates replies from application server 140 into a satellite packet format. FIG. 10 is a diagram showing a format of a satellite packet sent to satellite gateway 160 of FIG. 1. A satellite packet includes the data 1010 of an original IP packet and two headers 1020, 1030 added by hybrid gateway 150., 54350=1) Within hybrid terminal 110, FTP client software 230 generates a request and passes it to TCP/IP software 210. TCP/IP software 210 places the request in a TCP packet (see FIG. 11). Next, the TCP packet is placed in an IP packet, having a format shown in FIG. 3. TCP/IP software 210 places the IP packet in an Ethernet packet, as shown in FIG. 4, and passes the Ethernet packet to driver 114. This packet has a source IP address corresponding to satellite interface 120 and a destination IP address of application server 140. Ethernet is a packet switching protocol standardized by Xerox Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Digital Equipment Corporation, which is described in \"The Ethernet\" A Local Area Network Data Link Layer and Physical Layer Specification,\" September 1980, which is available from any of these three companies, and which is incorporated by reference., 77857=FIGS. 13(a) through 13(e) are flowcharts of steps performed by hybrid gateway 150 of FIG. 1 during protocol spoofing. In step 1302 of FIG. 13(a), hybrid gateway 150 receives a packet from application server 140 indicating that a new connection is being formed between application server 140 and hybrid terminal 110. In step 1304, hybrid gateway 150 sets up a queue or similar data structure in memory to save un-ACK'ed packets for the new connection. FIG. 13(b) shows corresponding steps performed by hybrid gateway 150 when the connection is closed. Hybrid gateway 150 receives a packet indicating the closure in step 1306 and deletes the queue and saved values for the connection in step 1308., 68391=In its most basic form, SLIP provider 130 delimits IP packets by inserting a control character such as hex 0\ufffdC0-SLIP between them. To insure that a data byte is not mistaken for the control character, all outgoing data is scanned for instances of the control character, which is replaced by a two character string. The SLIP protocol is described in detail in J. Romkey, \"A Nonstandard for Transmission of IP Datagrams over Serial Lines: SLIP,\" RFC 1055, June 1988, pp. 1-6., 78572=In step 1310 of FIG. 13(c), hybrid gateway 150 fails to receive an ACK for a packet number X from hybrid terminal 110 before an end of a predetermined timeout period. Hybrid gateway 150 maintains a timer for each un-ACK'ed packet. At the end of the predetermined period, hybrid gateway 150 retransmits a packet corresponding to the expired timer. In step 1312, hybrid gateway 150 resends packet number X, which it previously saved in the memory queue for this connection (see FIG. 13(d) below)., 80500=When hybrid gateway 150 inserts the ACK number in the packet, it also calculates the packet's checksum 1106., 79086=In step 1314 of FIG. 13(d), hybrid gateway 150 receives a packet from application server 140. In step 1316, hybrid gateway 150 sends the received packet to satellite gateway 160, where it is transmitted over the satellite link, and saves the packet in case it needs to be retransmitted (see FIG. 13(c)). Hybrid gateway 150 then creates an ACK packet to send to application server 140 in step 1318. The created ACK packet incorporates a format shown in FIG. 11. Hybrid gateway 150 creates an ACK number for field 1104. The ACK number is determined as follows:, 81388=In step 1328, hybrid gateway 150 forwards the received ACK packet to application server 140. Application server 140 may simply disregard the packet if it contains an ACK and no data. In another embodiment, hybrid gateway 150 simply discards a packet received from hybrid terminal 110 that contains an ACK, but no data., 85962=Each application is assigned a specific TCP/UDP (transmission control protocol/user datagram protocol) port number (designated by reference number 1412 in FIG. 14). For example, web browsing applications are assigned to port no. 80, telnet applications are assigned to port no. 23, etc. A user may select terrestrial applications by specifying the TCP/UDP port number (or another type of protocol identification number, if applicable) for the application. A user may change the list of selected terrestrial applications at any time., 80628=In step 1320 of FIG. 13(e), hybrid gateway 150 receives an ACK packet over the modem link from hybrid terminal 110. In step 1322, hybrid gateway 150 removes from the queue the packet for which the ACK was received. Because an ACK was received, the packet does not need to be re-sent. In the TCP/IP protocol, a packet containing an ACK may or may not contain data. Hybrid gateway 150 edits the received packet to replace the packet's ACK number 1104 with a \"spoofed\" ACK number in step 1326. The spoofed ACK number is determined in the same way as the ACK number in step 1318 of FIG. 13(d). When hybrid gateway 150 substitutes the spoofed ACK number 1104 in the packet, it also recalculates the packet's checksum 1106 in step 1326., 37115=This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/797,505, filed on Feb. 2, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,852,721, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08,257,670, filed Jun. 8, 1994, now abandoned., 48059=As is well-know in the art, communication over the Internet and similar TCP/IP networks is achieved through a group (suite) of protocols called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The TCP/IP protocol is described in the book \"Internetworking With TCP/IP, VOL I\" by Douglas Comer, published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1991.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with the true scope of the invention being indicated by the following claims. The second embodiment of the invention allows a user to specify that certain applications will retrieve data from the Internet over the terrestrial link, rather than over the satellite link. Generally, a user may prefer to use the terrestrial link for applications (such as Telnet) that require faster response time. The user may also select the terrestrial link to control costs associated with the satellite link or to access certain value-added services. The hybrid gateway may also automatically select certain applications such as streaming applications, to be routed over the terrestrial link. Data is routed over the terrestrial link by modifying the IP addresses of data packets in the hybrid terminal. f. Summary As described in section (e) above, the hybrid gateway 150 could automatically route selected packets over the terrestrial link by changing the destination address of the packet to the SLIP provider and recalculating the IP header and TCP/UDP checksums accordingly. Thus, the hybrid gateway modifies the packet into a terrestrial reply packet as shown in FIG. 16D. This reply packet is then sent via standard Internet routing to the SLIP provider",
