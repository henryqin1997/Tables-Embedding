Here, FIG. 7A shows a beginning portion of a combined 1023 and 1024 code. In this instance the first twelve repetitions of the 1023 length code are truncated. Accordingly, the part of the code labeled as 1023\ufffd12 is not transmitted by the transmitter. FIG. 7B shows the middle portion of the interleaved short codes and the following twelve bits of the 1024 code selected for transmission in this example. Here, one thousand repetitions of the 1023 code along with nine hundred ninety-nine repetitions of the 1024 length code are selected for transmission by the transmitter. Additionally, twelve bits or chips of the 1024 code that are interleaved with the first twelve bits of the 1023 code that are transmitted are included, as are twelve bits of the 1024 code interleaved with the last twelve bits of the 1023 code that are transmitted. FIG. 7C shows the end portion of the interleaved code that is truncated in this example. Here, the last twelve repetitions of the 1023 code are not transmitted. Accordingly, the total number of bits transmitted in the truncated code is (1023\ufffd1000)+(1024\ufffd999)+24 bits=2,046,000 bits, which at a rate of 10.23 MHz has a code period of exactly 0.2 seconds.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26356=In order to accurately make the ranging measurement and transfer timing information the GPS satellites transmit two signals using at least two PN codes, the so-called coarse acquisition (C/A) and precision (P) codes. The C/A code is 1023 bits long and repeats every millisecond with a chip rate of 1.023 MHz. The P code is much longer and repeats once per week, and is broadcast at a chip rate of 10.23 MHz, and therefore provides higher precision. Using the longer P code to make pseudorange measurements avoids ambiguities in time differences between the satellite's clock and the receiver's clock. Also, as discussed in more detail below, the longer code provides better noise tolerance than a short code., 61148=In a practical application, the codes are likely to be much longer that the small example described above. For example, a 1023-bit maximum-length code (m-sequence) might be chosen as code A; and code B could be 1024 bits long, identical to code A, but with one additional bit at the end. This produces a composite code that is 2\ufffd1023\ufffd1024=2,095,104 bits long. In an actual application, the bit rate might be 10.23 million bits per second, so that the code length is 0.2048 seconds. The entire code need not be used, and it may be convenient to use a length of exactly 0.2 seconds to more easily relate to ordinary clock time. Accordingly, the code may be truncated to exactly 2,046,000 bits, which at 10.23 MHz corresponds to a code period of 0.2 seconds. This provides an opportunity to avoid using the 2047 bits where the two component codes are nearly aligned. The arithmetic is easily adjusted to account for the number of truncated bits., 27780=The use of a short code to help acquire a longer code can be illustrated with the GPS system. In acquiring a coded signal a receiver must search for a specific portion of the code to detect its phase. To start its search a receiver must \u201cguess\u201d at certain search parameters. For example, in the case of the C/A code, there are 1023 possible starting positions for the code; and only one guess out of 1023 is correct. Usually, this is doubled. A receiver is designed to guess at half-chip intervals\u2014because it does not know when any chip starts. But even when a receiver determines the correct guess, it still cannot distinguish one millisecond instance of the code from another, and this is known as ambiguity. In the case of the P code, if the receiver knows the time to within one second (plus or minus a half-second), then there are 10,230,000 possible starting positions for the code; and only one guess out of 10,230,000 is correct. It will take about 10,000 times longer to search the longer P code by testing the possibilities, however, there will be no ambiguity when the search is completed. But if the receiver first acquires the C/A code timing, it can determine when millisecond periods of the code start, even though they look alike because the same pattern repeats every millisecond. Knowing the C/A code's phase reduces the possibilities for the P-code phases to 10,000. That is, acquiring the C/A code signal helps the P code signal acquisition go 1023 times faster., 22005=This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/164,944, entitled \u201cInterleaved Code Structure,\u201d and Ser. No. 60/164,945, entitled \u201cInterleaved Code Detection\u201d both filed Nov. 12, 1999. The disclosure of those provisional patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 53849=Summing correlations of a received signal with a 1000-bit reference code over two thousand repetitions of the 1000-bit PN code will provide the same noise tolerance as with the two million bit code, but only provides one code alignment per millisecond. Simply increasing the code length two-thousand-fold also provides the same noise tolerance, and provides one code alignment every two seconds, but would increase the cost enormously, because there are two million possible time alignments. However, using the present invention, there are two thousand possible time alignments for each code (four thousand altogether), so the combined hardware cost and time cost is reduced five-hundred-fold., 30872=Receiver 9 receives the transmitted signal via an antenna 10 that provides the received signal to a demodulator 11. The demodulator 11 is driven by a carrier oscillator 12, and produces two signals out-of-phase by 90\ufffd. Those signals are designated as in-phase (I) and quadrature(Q) signals. These two out-of-phase signals are provided to a group of parallel correlators 13. The parallel correlators can include as many, and even more, correlators as the number of phases of the code to be tested. For example, if the code length is 1023 symbols, or chips, the parallel correlators 13 can consist of 1023 correlators, one correlator for each possible phase of the code. Multiple banks of the parallel correlators 13 can be used to correlate different signals, such as in this case where one bank correlates the I-signals and another bank correlates the Q-signals. The parallel correlators 13 are also provided with PN reference codes that correspond to the PN codes generated in the transmitter. PN code generator 14 generates the reference codes. The reference codes can be delayed to correspond to the various phases to be tested. Alternatively, the input signals, here the I and Q signals, can be delayed with various delays and correlated with a single PN code to test the different phases. The PN code generator 14 is driven by a local clock oscillator 15 and timing counters 16 which can effect the different timings for the PN reference codes. The local clock oscillator also drives timing counters 16., 58042=The cost of detecting short code A is proportional to the number of possible phases, 2\ufffdn. The factor of two is included because the receiver initially does not know which bits are of code A, and which are of code B. Likewise, the cost of detecting short code B is proportional to 2\ufffd(n+1), so the total cost of detecting short codes A and B interleaved with one another is proportional to 4\ufffdn+2. This is much less than the cost of detecting the long code as a whole, which is proportional to 2\ufffdn\ufffd(n+1). For example, if n=1000, 4\ufffdn+2=4002 and 2\ufffdn\ufffd(n+1)=2,002,000. Thus, the cost of detecting the interleaved short codes, in this example, is about 500 times less expensive than detecting the longer non-interleaved code.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described preferred embodiments of an interleaved code structure, techniques and devices for generating those code structures, and techniques and devices for transmitting those codes, it is believed that other modifications, variations and changes will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings set forth herein. It is therefore to be understood that all such variations, modifications and changes are believed to fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in their ordinary and accustomed manner only, unless expressly defined differently herein, and not for purposes of limitation. Although the invention has been described in terms of two binary codes of length n and n+1, other variations fall within its scope. For example, more than two codes can be interleaved to achieve the benefits of the invention. Also, two codes that are mutually prime, other than of lengths n and n+1 can be used. Further, codes that are not mutually prime can be used, although the increased noise tolerance achieved with longer codes may not be realized to the maximum extent because the code would have a shorter than maximum period due to a common factor between the code lengths. While it is expected that binary codes will be used most often, the invention can be applied in systems with more than two transmission",
