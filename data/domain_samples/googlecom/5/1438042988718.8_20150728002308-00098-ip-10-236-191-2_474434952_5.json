(The term \"JP-A\" as used herein signifies an \"unexamined published Japanese patent application.\") Thus, in this case light scattering is caused by the presence of the cavities and pinholes are avoided. Furthermore, the use of matting agents which have a cavity inside each particle with a wall between the inside and the outside and in which the wall is porous so that the particles do not precipitate in the coating liquid has been disclosed in JP-A-62-163047. However, it is not possible to prevent the occurrence of pinholes using these methods in those cases where a matting agent of large size is used, and further improvement is very desirable., 39154=The surface resistivity of at least one of the structural layers of the photographic material of the present invention is preferably not more than 1012 \u03a9 under an atmosphere of 25% RH at 25\ufffd C., 45221=The amount of electrically conductive metal oxide or electrically conductive polymer compound which can be used in the present invention is preferably from 0.05 to 20 grams, and most desirably from 0.1 to 10 grams, per square meter of photographic material. The surface resistivity of the electrically conductive layer in the present invention in an atmosphere of 25% RH at 25\ufffd C. is not more than 1012 \u03a9, and most desirably not more than 1011 \u03a9. Good anti-static properties are obtained in this way., 63616=Either one of R1 or R2 in general formula (I) may have incorporated within it a group which is adsorbed strongly on silver halide grain surfaces. Examples of such adsorbing groups include a thiourea group, a heterocyclic thioamido group, a mercapto-heterocyclic group and a triazole group disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,385,108 and 4,459,347, JP-A-59-195233, JP-A-59-200231, JP-A-59-201045, JP-A-59-201046, JP-A-59-201047, JP-A-59-201048, JP-A-59-201049, JP-A-61-170733, JP-A-61-270744, JP-A-62-948, JP-A-63-234244 and JP-A-63-234246., 42497=Preferred examples of the electrically conductive polymer compounds which can be used in the present invention include polyvinylbenzene sulfonic acid salts, polyvinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride, the quaternary salt polymers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,108,802, 4,118,231, 4,126,467 and 4,137,217, and the polymer latexes disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,189, West German Patent Application (OLS) 2,830,767, JP-A-61-296352 and JP-A-61-62033., 72583=Inorganic or organic gelatin hardening agents can be included in the photographic emulsions or light-insensitive hydrophilic colloids of the present invention. For example, active vinyl compounds (for example, 1,3,5-triacryloylhexahydro-s-triazine, bis(vinylsulfonyl)methyl ether, N,N'-methylenebis-[\u03b2-(vinylsulfonyl)propionamide]), active halogen compounds (for example, 2,4-dichloro-6-hydroxy-s-triazine), mucohalogen acids (for example, mucochloric acid), N-carbamoylpyridinium salts (for example, (1-morpholinocarbonyl-3-pyridinio)methanesulfonate) and haloamidinium salts (for example, 1-(1-chloro -1-pyridinomethylene)pyrrolidinium 2-naphthalenesulfonate) can be used individually or in combinations for this purpose. From among these, the active vinyl compounds disclosed in JP-A-53-41220, JP-A-53-57257, JP-A-59-162546 and JP-A-60-80846, and the active halogen compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,325,287, are preferred., 81304=That is to say, superhigh contrast negative images can be obtained satisfactorily with the silver halide photographic materials of the present invention using developers of pH 10.5-12.3, and preferably of pH 11.0-12.0, which contain at least 0.15 mol/liter of sulfite ion as a preservative., 41194=These oxides have been disclosed, for example, in JP-A-56-143431, JP-A-56-120519 and JP-A-58-62647.}",

The tetrazolium salt: ##STR24## was added to this emulsion at the rate of 5\ufffd10-3 mol/mol.Ag. Moreover, ethyl acrylate latex (average particle size 0.05 \u03bcm) and 1,1'-bis(vinylsulfonyl)methane were added in such a way as to provide coated weights of 0.9 g/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively.
