    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87207=The efficacy of a fusion polypeptide of the invention to load APCs and activate T cells was tested. A penI:Ova fusion polypeptide (i.e., a fusion polypeptide containing the penI protein linked to an Ova target peptide) was employed as well as other materials. Three independent experiments were performed utilizing A20 APC and the D011 T cell myeloma cell line. D011 cells are specifically responsive to Ova loaded major histocompability complex class II (MHCII) molecules presented by A20 APCs. A20 cells were loaded with 5 \u03bcg purified penI:Ova fusion polypeptide or 5 \u03bcg synthetic Ova peptide (positive control synthesized by Mimetics, Chiron Corp.) for 1 hour. 1\ufffd105 D011 cells were added and incubated with the loaded A20 cells for 24 hours. The degree of activation of D011 cells was determined by the release of Interleukin 2 (IL-2) into the culture medium. After 24 hours of incubation supernatants were collected and analyzed in an ELISA format for IL-2 (using two anti-IL2 antibodies from Pharmacia)., 58721=1. Antigen presenting cells are contacted with a fusion polypeptide of the invention that comprises a target peptide and a penI fusion protein or a precipitation effective portion thereof. A variety of antigen presenting cells can be employed including, e.g., monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and Langerhans cells. Specifically preferred antigen presenting cells for use in such an assay include A20 cells. Other suitable antigen presenting cells are disclosed in Edwin Walker, et al., Journal of Immunology, 128(5):2164-2169 (1982), particularly e.g. the L10A.6.2, L10A/2J, K46R, 2PK3, and P388D cells., 74532=TA1 has been chemically immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip (CM5) using the amine coupling kit and the method provided by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biosensor). For this purpose TA1 was diluted to 57 \u03bcg/mL in 10 mM Na-acetate buffer pH4. After activation of the sensor chip with 30 \u03bcl of a 1:1 mixture of 11.5 mg/mL N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 75 mg/ml N-ethyl-N'-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) 5 \u03bcL of the TA1 solution was injected at a flow rate of 3 \u03bcL/min. Residual dextran binding sites were inactivated by treatment of the chip surface with 37 \u03bcL of 1M ethanolamine pH 8.5. This resulted in the immobilization of 4541 resonance units (RU) of TA1., 48482=It also has been found that penI fusion polypeptides of the invention can be isolated in high yields from a culture medium, e.g., at about 15 percent or greater of the total expressed polypeptide, and even yields of about 25 percent or greater. More specifically, the yield is often about 3 and 9 mg of polypeptide per 1011 E. coli cells. As will be appreciated by those skilled in this art, such yields are significantly higher than yields provided by prior isolation and purification methods., 89572=The results set forth in the above Table show that the Ova peptide and the peni:Ova fusion polypeptide, but none of the negative controls, stimulated D011 cells. The results set forth in the Table indicate the penI:Ova peptide is as effective as the Ova peptide itself in stimulating D011 cells. The results also indicate the penI:Ova fusion peptide is transported and processed by A20 APCs and properly presented to the D011 TCR (T cell receptor) in the context of MHCII molecules., 36847=More specifically, DNA is obtained coding for the penI protein or a precipitation effective portion thereof. One source of that DNA is Bacillus licheniformis, which is publicly available, e.g., from the American Type Culture Collection under Accession nos. 6598, 6634 and 8480. Isolation and cloning of such DNA has been described and includes molecular cloning and polymerase chain reaction. See Wittman, et al., J. Bacteriol, 170:3206-3212 (1988); and Himeno, et al., J. Bacteriol., 168:1128-1132 (1986). See also Sambrook, et al., supra, including ch. 14 thereof. The nucleotide sequence coding for penI or portion thereof, or the sequence of other components of the fusion construct of the invention such as the sequence coding for the target peptide or linking segment, also can be synthesized by known methods, e.g. the phosphate triester method. See Oligonucleotide Synthesis, IRL Press (M. J. Gait, ed., 1984). Synthetic oligonucleotides also may be prepared using commercially available automated oligonucleotide synthesizers. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the penI protein are shown in FIG. 2 of the Drawings., 80435=The HPLC monoS purified PenI:C9 muteins and wild type (wt) (identified in Examples 1 and 3 above and FIG. 3) were tested for their relative binding to the anti-C9 specific protein A purified mAb TA1 in a competitive ELISA. The assay was performed using microtiter plates that had been previously coated with PenI:C9 (wt) by a passive technique (10 \u03bcmng protein/well). Dilution of the PenI:C9 (wt) and the PenI:C9 mutein, were preincubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the mAb TA1 that was at a concentration of 271 ng/ml. The plates were washed and 100 \u03bcl/well of each sample was applied and incubated at room temperature for 1/2 hour. The wells were washed and 100 \u03bcl/well of a 1:2000 dilution of a Goat anti-mouse lgG HRP conjugate was added. The plated were incubated at room temperature for another 1/2 hour. The plates were washed again and 100 \u03bcl/well of substrate (ABTS) was added and allowed to react for 8 minutes at room temperature. Each well was quenched with 100 \u03bcl of 1% SDS stop solution. The ELISA signal was read at 405 nm using a Biotek Plate reader. The data collected was analyzed using EXCEL 4.0 software. The maximum (100%) ELISA signal was determined as the average of values seen for dilution of penI lacking C9 that was allowed to react with TA1 as described above. Inhibition of TA1 binding was compared for all PenI:C9 muteins and PenI:C9 (wt) by using the ELISA signals measured at a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM of the competing PenI:C9 fusion protein. This was the concentration at which PenI:C9 (wt) generated a 50% signal compared to the maximum signal generated in this ELISA. FIG. 5 of the Drawings shows this data expressed as percent binding to TA1 in a bar graph. The results clearly indicate that not all nine amino acid residues are required for binding. The amino terminus of the peptide DSDRAIEGR is shown to be less important to binding to TA1 relative to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. More specifically, the results indicate that the sequence RAIXGR of the peptide contributes to most of the binding of the peptide., 26278=The penI repressor protein is produced by Bacillus licheniformis and negatively controls the synthesis of the inducible enzyme penicillinase (penP). See Dubnau, et al., J. Gen. Microbiol., 41:7-21 (1965); Sheratt, et al., J. Gen. Microbiol., 76:217-230 (1973). The sequence of the penI gene, expression of that gene in E. coli and purification of the penI protein have been reported. See T. Himeno, et al., J. Bacteriol., 68:1128-1132 (1986); Wittman, et al., J. Bacteriol., 170:3206-3212 (1988)., 21704=This application is a continuation-in-part of application U.S. Ser. No. 08/235,178, filed Apr. 29, 1994, which application is incorporated herein by reference., 92204=To calculate the relative activity of PenI:Ova and Ova peptide in Experiment 1 the IL-2 level released for 6.0\ufffd10-11 moles/well of PenI:Ova (1624 pg/mI) was backfitted on the IL-2 curve for Ova alone to give 1.9\ufffd10-10 moles Ova/well. Dividing the backfit value (1.9\ufffd10-10) by the actual moles of Ova added per well (6\ufffd10-11) gives 3. Hence, PenI:Ova is three times more effective on a molar basis than Ova peptide alone in stimulating D011 cells. This experiment was repeated twice (Experiments 2 and 3) and the results indicate that in Experiment 2 and 3 PenI:Ova is 16 times and 8 times more effective on a molar basis, than Ova peptide, respectively., 68276=To express a large amount of the fusion peptide penI:C9, a 500 ml culture of strain DG116:pCC51 was grown in M9 medium (Per 1 liter volume, add 6 g of Na2 HPO4 sodium phosphate dibasic, 3 g KH2 PO4, 0.5 g NaCl and 1 g NH4 Cl and autoclave. Make the following sterile additions: 10 ml of 20% glucose, 10 ml of 0.01M CaCl2, 1 ml of 1M MgSO4 :7H2 O, 20 mg B1 (final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml), 5 g Casamino acids (Norit treated, final concentration 0.5%) and 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin) at 30\ufffd C. to an OD of 0.5-0.8. The culture was subjected to a heat shock to induce expression from the PL promoter of the plasmid by incubating it for 5-15 minutes at 42\ufffd C. The culture was then incubated with shaking at 39\ufffd C. for additional 1-2 hr. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of Lysis Buffer (LB) (per 200 ml volume add: 20 ml of 1M Tris buffer pH 8.0!, 20 ml of 2M KCl, 0.8 ml of 0.25 EDTA, 04 ml of 1M CaCl2, 1 ml of 2M MgCl2, 20 \u03bcl of 0.1M DTT, 12.5 ml of 80% glycerol and 145.28 ml of H20). The cells were then disrupted in a french press at a pressure of 1500 PSI. The french press was washed with 10 ml of SB buffer (per 500 ml add: 50 ml of 1M Tris pH 8.0!, 10 ml of 1M CaCl2, 0.5 ml of 1M DTT, 259 ml of 80% Glycerol and 189.5 mls of H2 O)+200 mM KCl. The final volume was recorded at 17 ml. A 10% solution of polyethyleneimine was slowly added to a final concentration of 0.6%. The sample was centrifuged at 4\ufffd C. at 6000 RPM in a Beckman J2-HS rotor JA-20. The supernatant was removed and saved. To extract pellet (DNA) associated protein, the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of SB buffer+600 mM KCl and was shaken at 4\ufffd C. for 1 hr. The sample was then centrifuged and the supernatant was added to the saved one. The combined supernatant was stirred in an ice bath and ammonium sulfate was slowly added to a final concentration of 35% w/v. The sample was centrifuged at 4\ufffd C. at 6000 RPM for 1 hr and the pellet kept. The pellet was redissolved in 10 ml of SB buffer+50 mM KCl, loaded into a dialysis bag and dialyzed with 2 changes of 400 mls of buffer overnight at 4\ufffd C. overnight. The precipitated material is collected by gentle centrifugation, washed with SB+50 mM KCl. The pellet is redissolved in 300 \u03bcl of 2M KCl, and add 100 \u03bcl of 10\ufffd SB buffer and slowly add 600 \u03bcl of H2 O) (final buffer concentration was SB+600 mM KCl). To evaluate the purity of the penI:C9 a 20 \u03bcl sample is resolved on a 12.5-15% SDS-PAGE., 60751=The T cells employed in the assays are incubated under conditions suitable for proliferation. For example, a DO11.10 T cell hybridoma may be suitably incubated at about 37\ufffd C. and 5% CO2 in complete culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine and 5\ufffd10-5 M 2-mercaptoethanol). Serial dilutions of a fusion polypeptide of the invention can be added to the T cell culture medium. Suitable concentrations of the fusion polypeptide added to the T cells typically will be in the range of from 10-12 to 10-6 M. T cell activation signals are provided by antigen presenting cells (APC) that have been loaded with the appropriate antigenic peptide. It is believed that use of antigen dose and APC numbers giving slightly submaximal T cell activation is preferred to detect inhibition of T cell responses with fusion polypeptide(s) of the invention. A decrease in production of IL-2 following contact with the fusion polypeptide indicates the fusion complex modulates activity of the T cells and can suppress immune response.}",
