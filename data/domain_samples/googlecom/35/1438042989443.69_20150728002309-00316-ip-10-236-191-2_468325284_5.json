    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention may not provide for variable copy sheet size, whereupon the laser is controlled, in the copy mode, to erase the border around the standard size copy sheet in use, and, in the print mode, the text data is formatted to fit within this standard size. Information as to the size of the copy sheet to be supplied to transfer station 52, if different sizes are to be supplied, is necessary in order to control the laser to implement border erase when in the copy mode. This same copy sheet size information is used in the print mode to enable the data defined image in page memory 42 to be placed within this sheet size. Thus, in the print mode, no distinction is made between the working and nonworking areas of the photoconductor. Rather, each individual scan of the laser beam, exclusive of the data defined image which is to be placed in blocks 83 shown in FIG. 5, is composed of an on-state of modulator 22 wherein the photoconductor is erased. Considering now the operation of the appparatus when it is",
