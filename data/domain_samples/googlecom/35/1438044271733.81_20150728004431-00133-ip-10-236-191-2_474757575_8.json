While it is preferred to partially rewind the ribbon after printing has been completed on an item, if desired the rewinding may be performed less frequently for example after each second or third item of a series of items. Thus a printing operation may consist of printing on a group of one or more items in succession and the partial rewinding is effected in intervals between printing on groups of items. In the embodiment described hereinbefore, the print head comprises a single line of print elements extending transversely to the direction of feeding of the item 11 and printing is effected serially as the item is moved past the print heads. However if desired the print head may comprise print elements operable at the same time to print the entire impression. With such a print head the item is fed to a printing position confronting the print head and the ribbon is drawn by the feeding of the item to the printing position. The item and ribbon are then held stationery and pressed toward the print head by an impression pad while the printing operation is effected. After the printing operation the",
