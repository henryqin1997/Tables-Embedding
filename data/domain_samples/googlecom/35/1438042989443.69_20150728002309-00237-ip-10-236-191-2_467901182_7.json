In one embodiment, the search engine 10 is written in C++, runs on the Microsoft 2000 Server operating system, preferably in parallel using suitable Intel Pentium processors. It should be clear, however, that it is not essential to the invention that this hardware and operating system be used, and other hardware and operating systems can be used such as Solaris or Linux. Preferably, we run multiple instances of the crawler 12 to increase its capacity to crawl and re-crawl enormous hypertext document collections such as pages on the Web. The crawler 12 stores the fetched pages in a Web page database 14, which includes data structures optimized for fast access of the fetched pages as explained below in connection with FIGS. 2A-2C.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for calculating ranking scores by dividing the entire hypertext pages into distinct number of groups. The page weight can be refined further by classifying pages into several distinct groups such as \u201cArt\u201d, \u201cEducation\u201d, \u201cReference\u201d, etc. Once the pages are classified, the page weights can be calculated in the same manner described above within these groups. The page weight will be more relevant for the given topic. Here n represents the number of keywords in the query. The constant parameters f0 and \u03c3 has typical values of 0.5 and 1, respectively. f i =f 0+(1\u2212f 0)e \u2212i/\u03c3 j f n 1 = j \u2211 / i f = i w In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for assigning the ranking scores for multi-keyword query. When user enters more than one keyword for query, we combine the ranking scores for each keyword to obtain the final ranking scores. We give slightly more weight to the first word and the weight gets smaller for following words until it levels",
