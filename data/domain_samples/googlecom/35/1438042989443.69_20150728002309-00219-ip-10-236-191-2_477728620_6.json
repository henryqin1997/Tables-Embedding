Staring with FIG. 4, it is first assumed that the medium 16 contains plain data with a time stamp. For instance the time stamp may be\u2014Dec. 1, 1998, 1:00 a.m.\u2014. The receiver 40 in this case receives standard G.P.S. signals from a common G.P.S. satellite 60. (In this case the producer 22 does not have to generate a separate signal). The receiver 40 incorporates a G.P.S. decoder to decode the signal from the satellite 60. When based on this signal the receiver determines that the time set by the time stamp has occurred, its output is enabled to release the data on medium 16. While a G.P.S. satellite has been described herein, it should be understood that other time signal may be used as well, such as shortwave timing signals and other.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously numerous modifications may be made to this invention without departing from its scope as defined in the appended claims. FIG. 10 illustrates a typical operation wherein the producer does not broadcast a release signal but instead, a standard timing signal is used. In this embodiment, in step 140 an internal timer is set using an external universal timing signal such as a G.P.S. system. In step 142 a request to play the program is received either by inserting the medium into the receiver, or if the program data is stored into memory, by some other control means. Next, in step 144 a check is performed to determine if the release time as indicated by the date/time stamp has been reached by comparing the same to the timing signal. If the release time has not been reached, the program is not played. If the release time has been reached, the receiver is allowed to process the data and play the program (step 146). One mode of operation for implementing the invention, and more specifically, the embodiment wherein the producer generates a release signal and broadcasts it to the receivers is shown in FIG. 9. In step 112 the release signal is broadcast by the producer. In step 114 the receivers detect the release signal and store it. In step 116 each receiver waits for the media 16 to be inserted (assuming that the program has been",
