No. 6,074,775 to Gartstein and Nebrigic, granted on Jun. 13, 2000; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,248 to Gartstein and Nebrigic, granted on Sep. 12, 2000., 64439=[0055] Preferred examples of such a hard surface cleaning composition include aqueous and non-aqueous cleaning compositions such as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,065 to Vinson, et al., issued on Nov. 23, 1999; WO 99/03512 A1 to Boucher and Kain, published on Jan. 28, 1999; WO 99/24539 A1 to Kasturi, et al., published May 20, 1999; WO 99/27058 A1 to Kasturi, et al., published Jun. 3, 1999; WO 99/27054 to Kasturi and Schafer, published on Jun. 3, 1999; WO 99/27053 to Kasturi, et al., published on Jun. 3, 1999; WO 99/27057 to Kasturi, et al., published on Jun. 3, 1999; WO 99/63034 to Vinson, et al., published on Dec. 9, 1999; WO 00/46331 to Clarke, et al., published Aug. 10, 2000; and EP Application No. 99/870275.7 by Clarke, et al., filed on Dec. 22, 1999., 38539=[0025] Preferably, the FAM useful herein has an absorbent ability of more than about 20 g H2O/g, more preferably, 40 g H2O/g by weight of FAM. Such a preferred FAM is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,345 to DesMarais, et al., issued on Nov. 9, 1993 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,893 to Dyer, et al., issued on May 4, 1999. Examples of a preferred polyurethane is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,534 to Thoen, et al., issued on Feb. 18, 1992; U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,690 to Milovanovic-Lerik, et al., issued on Dec. 6, 1988; Japanese Patent Publication No. 10-182780 to Kao Corporation, published on Jul. 7, 1998; Japanese Patent Publication No. 9-30215 to Yokohama Gum, published on Feb. 4, 1997; Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-70544 to The Dow Chemical Company, published on Mar. 23, 1993; and Japanese Patent Publication No. 10-176073 to The Bridgestone Company, published on Jun. 30, 1998., 46977=[0034] In FIG. 1, the optional pivoting portion, 38, is joined to the scrubbing surface, 28, and allows the user to easily direct the scrubbing surface, 28, to a specific portion of the item to be cleaned, and to follow the contours of the item, by changing the relative angle between the scrubbing surface and the ergonomic grip. If the dispensing chamber is located distal from the scrubbing surface, and a dispensing passage is required which passes through the pivoting portion, then a preferred arrangement to reduce blockage of the dispensing passage is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,988,920 to Kunkler and Benecke, issued on Nov. 23, 1999., 55434=[0043] An example of a highly preferred removable cartridge-type dispensing chamber is a dispensing chamber which has a seal which is either punctured or displaced upon insertion into the waterproof casing, or which has a seal which is removed prior to insertion into the interior area of the waterproof casing. Preferred seals and coupling arrangements for the interior area, the waterproof casing, and/or the dispensing chamber are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,842,504 to Schennum and Miller, issued on Dec. 1, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,842,682 to Schennum, et al., issued on Dec. 1, 1998; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/201618 to Benecke, filed on Nov. 30, 1998.}",
