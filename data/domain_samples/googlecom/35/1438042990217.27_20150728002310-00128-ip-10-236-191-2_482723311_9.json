For example, the Wallace tree structure 10 may be implemented with 3\ufffd2 CSAs (three inputs and two outputs). Furthermore, the partial products generated by the partial product generators 11'-14' need not be Booth-encoded. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, in the present invention, the \"L-fold\" layout of CSAs 15'-21' is used to keep the dimension of the multiplier along the data path 42 (Y-axis) to a minimum and to avoid unnecessary routing for the alignment of data. Accordingly, the \"L-fold\" design serves to keep the data of the proper significant (MSBs) aligned in the data path 42, while routing the data used for \"sticky bit\" calculation out of the data path 42. The result is a logical and orderly layout for a Wallace tree multiplier which reduces circuit area. The layout of the Wallace tree array 40 is designed to insure that the most significant bits of each result (intermediate or final summands) generated by the carry save adders 15'-21' is aligned to be the same height as that of the data path 42. Accordingly, in the present invention, the most",
