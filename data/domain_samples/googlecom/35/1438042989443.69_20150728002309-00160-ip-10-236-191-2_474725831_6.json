It is understood that the exemplary tunable spatial light modulator described herein and shown in the drawings represents only presently preferred embodiments of the invention. Indeed, various modifications and additions may be made to such embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the pixels need not be generally square in configuration, but rather may be of various different shapes, e.g., hexagonal, octagonal, etc. as they are formed along a given ribbon. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various different means for maintaining the desirable separation of the first and second conductive elements may be utilized. Referring now to FIG. 10, a graph of the pixel motion after the set pulse has been sent is shown. The graph illustrates the normalized spacing versus the normalized time and shows both 14 volt and 28 volt set voltages for a 50 nanosecond pulse. Numerical simulations indicate that with a suitable bias voltage applied to the whole array, individual pixels 14 can be set with a voltage pulse as short as one hundredth of the natural pixel period. This means that the array can be fully set in only a few periods. Some dissipation must be present to",
