In the communication link between the zone controllers 2420 and the stations, the zone controllers are the master stations and the nurse control stations, patient stations or staff stations are the slave stations. Whereas, in the communication link between the stations and the peripheral equipment, the stations (e.g., the patient stations) are the master stations and the peripheral equipment is the slave. The master station is in control of the data link and transmits command frames to the slave stations. The master station maintains separate sessions (i.e., communication links) with each slave station attached to the link. To illustrate and again referring to FIG. 2, if zone controller 2420 is connected to a group of patient stations (1 to n) and/or connected to a group of staff stations (1 to m), the zone controller (master) will periodically poll each patient station (slave) to retrieve message frames. The slave station responds to the commands from the master station and can send one message to the master station per poll from the master station., 180266=FIGS. 27 and 28 illustrate exemplary message frame formats and timing in an expanded form for telephone voice and data information between each station and the PBX. As shown in FIG. 27, data from the microprocessor is in a 16 bit parallel format and is framed by one start bit and seven stop bits to form the microprocessor (uP) data frame, where each uP data frame is approximately 8ms in length. Telephone voice, data and information packet including transmitter ID from microprocessor 3510, shown in FIG. 25, is then converted to a serial data bit stream via parallel-to-serial converter 4620 which then transfers the serial, signal to transmitter conditioner 4640. Transmitter conditioner 4640 amplifies and modulates the PCM signal for transmission to the PBX 2430 via the 4-pair telephone wire., 201267=FIG. 29 is a circuit block diagram of the patient control unit 3210. Patient control unit 3210 includes telephone keypad 4710, speaker 4720 and microphone 4730 which are connected to PCM CODEC 4630 in telephone circuit 4610 and provide telephone voice and data communications between the patient stations and PBX 2430. The PCM CODEX 4630 may include a DTMF decoder for decoding DTMF tones from the telephone keypad 4710., 53226=The exemplary embodiments of the automatic staff locator system of the patient care and communication system of the present invention described below, use a memory card as a personal database. As used herein, a memory card is a device approximately the same size and shape as an ordinary credit card which includes a non-volatile programmable memory. In the card used in the embodiments described below, two types of memory are used: an electronically erasable read only memory (EEROM) located internal to the card and a magnetic stripe located on the surface of the card. It is contemplated, however, that other forms of internal memory, such as a ferro-electric RAM or a CMOS memory with an integral battery, may be used. It is also contemplated that the functions described below may be implemented with other types of external memory, such as laser card technologies which either augment or replace the card memory. A more detailed description of the staff locator system and its operation is described in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 08/033,287, filed on Mar. 16, 1993 and which is incorporated herein by reference., 78546=An exemplary operational flow of CPU 2412 is shown in FIG. 6. Initially, the CPU is in a listen mode. In the listen mode the CPU continuously polls or otherwise interrogates the different components attached thereto. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, the CPU will periodically poll each shared-RAM (S-RAM) 2512 (shown in FIG. 2) of each zone controller (step 2910) in a manner described hereinbelow. If the S-RAM does not have a message frame received from a station within the zone controller grouping, CPU 2412 returns and polls the next zone controller (step 2920). Preferably, as will be described in more detail below data transmitted between the CPU 2412 and the zone controller 2420 or between the zone controller 2420 and the stations (either 2414, 2416 or 2418) are in the form of message frames which include station identity information as well as the message data relating to a particular function., 171341=In addition, the operation of selected periphery devices in the patient's room are continuously monitored and any failures are brought to the attention of the staff member at a nurse control station within the group. For example, the wiring to code blue switch 3234, the smoke alarm and/or the nurse call button 3250 on patient control unit 3210 may be monitored for damaged to the wires between such periphery devices and patient station 2416., 145064=Referring once again to FIG. 9 patient station 2416 may also be connected to staff presence switch 3254, indicator assembly 3220, code blue switch 3234 and/or emergency code switch 3232. In the configuration shown, staff presence switch 3254 is connected to patient station 2416 via data link 3256 and when properly activated provides patient station 2416 with a signal indicative of the type of staff member present in the patient's room. Once activated, a message frames (e.g., an I-frame) is transferred to the CPU and an appropriate response is returned to that particular patient station, in a manner described above., 174328=An alternative embodiment for the system configuration is shown in FIGS. 23 and 24. In this embodiment a private-branch exchange (PBX) 2430 is connected to nurse control stations 2414, patient stations 2416 and staff stations 2418 for providing staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient and/or external telephone communications for the hospital environment. The PBX 2430 also connects to a plurality of telephones throughout the facility and to or from external telephone lines of the telephone local exchange or central office. The components of a PBX for processing data and controlling the telephone operations are well known. The PBX according to the present invention includes a processor, associated memory and stored programs. The preferred PBX according to the present invention is the IDS-228, manufactured by EXECUTONE Information Systems, Inc. Each station is provided with a PBX interface which facilitates PBX telephone or voice communications therebetween. System data communications are accomplished in a manner described above utilizing zone controllers 2420 and the above described protocol., 137218=Preferably, audio controller 3614 is a 34118 audio controller manufactured by Motorola. Audio input signals from audio matrix 2510 which pass through the audio controller are directed to patient station speaker 3618 via amplifier 3622 and/or to audio output ports 3624 via amplifier 3626 and relay controller 3628. Audio signals generated by the patient station via microphone 3620 are selectively transferred through audio controller 3614 onto the audio pair as shown. Mute switch 3630 may be provided to allow a staff member to manually short out the microphone so as to prevent audio signals from being generated at the patient station. In addition, the audio circuitry for the patient station may include input audio ports 3632 which facilitate a connection between external entertainment equipment, such as a television or a radio, and audio output ports 3624 via relay switch 3628. To illustrate, audio signals from a television in the patient's room can be directed from patient station 2416 to speaker 3252 in patient control unit 3210 (shown in FIG. 9) to bring the audio from the television closer to the patient., 202904=Another alternative embodiment for the system configuration is shown in FIG. 31. In this embodiment private-branch exchange (PBX) 2430 is connected to central computer 5010, to nurse control stations 2414, patient stations 2416 and staff stations 2418 and is provided to facilitate system data communications as well as staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient and/or external telephone communications for the hospital environment., 57558=FIG. 3 illustrates the major components of system 2410 arranged in groups. As shown, CPU 2412 of the system of the present invention is configured, dimensioned and adapted to interface through zone controller systems 2413 with a predetermined number of station groups of patient stations 2416, staff stations 2418, and/or any combination thereof (e.g., the number of groups ranging between 1 and x, where \u201cx\u201d is preferably 8). Each station group includes between 1 and \u201cn\u201d stations, where \u201cn\u201d is preferably 35, and a predetermined number of station groups can be assigned to between 1 and \u201cm\u201d nurse control stations 2414, where \u201cm\u201d is preferably 8. For example, if a ward in a hospital has one hundred patient rooms (numbered from 100 to 200) which are single occupancy rooms, a staff locker room (Room 201) and a staff kitchen (Room 202), one patient station 2416 would be installed in each patient room and one staff station 2418 would be installed in the staff locker room and the staff kitchen. An exemplary array of station groupings (or the call assignment configuration) is shown in Table I below:, 199186=An exemplary personnel or patient card 5200 is shown in FIGS. 37 and 38 and operates in a manner similar to the personnel card shown and described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/924,101, filed Aug. 3, 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference. As shown, the personnel card is configured and dimensioned for insertion within the slot 5150 of the badge unit 5110, shown in FIG. 35. The front surface of the card may include a printed logo and other identification information., 151234=The system of the present invention may also be configured to monitor medical equipment being used to treat the patient (i.e., bedside equipment). Such bedside equipment may be connected to communication port 3534 (shown in FIG. 12) of patient station 2416. In instances where the serial data from the bedside equipment is not configured for RS-485 protocol, serial data converter 2520 (shown in FIG. 2) may be interconnected between serial port 3854 of patient station 2416 and the serial port of the bedside equipment. Typically, the serial port of the bedside equipment is configured to operate with RS-232 protocol, thus, serial data converter 2520 would be an RS-485 to RS-232 converter which is known in the art., 176339=According to the alternative embodiment, the receiver unit 4800 receives wireless electromagnetic transmissions, preferably infrared and frequency modulated (FM), from a portable transmitter. The transmissions from the portable transmitter include transmitter ID signals. The receiver in turn forwards an information packet including the received transmitter ID signals to the central processing unit 2412 which determines the identity and location of the transmitter. The information packet from the receiver 4800 is preferably forwarded to the central processing unit 2412 through zone controller 2420. Alternatively, the information packet is forwarded to the PBX 2430 through telephone circuit 4610. According to the alternative embodiment of the present invention, the PBX 2430 is capable of processing the information packet from the receiver 4800 to determine the identity and location of the transmitter, both independently from or as a shared resource of the central processing unit 2412. Of course, the information packet from the receiver 4800 may be forwarded to the central processing unit 2412 via the PBX 2430 or vice versa., 197858=The functions of the patient station 2416 and pillow speaker 3210 may be performed by an enhanced badge unit having components as shown in FIG. 42. The enhanced badge unit includes voice and display communication controls for communicating information previously performed by the patient station 2416 and pilloy speaker 3210. The enhanced badge unit includes all the operations previously described for the badge unit and further includes: a wireless receiver, e.g., an infrared receiver 5410 for receiving information; a card reader 5420 for reading information stored in the personnel card; a voice circuit 5430 for receiving voice signals from speaker 5440 and for translating digital signals to audio signals received from microphone 5450; a keypad 5460 for keypad entry of data; a display 5470 for displaying information such as data entered from the keypad 5460 or data received from the receiver 5410; and a membrane switch (not shown) for special designated functions such as an emergency call or sending a selected message. A more detailed description of the enhanced badge unit is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/087,394, filed Jul. 2, 1993 which is incorporated herein by reference., 181128=An exemplary embodiment of the format and timing of data transmitted from the PBX to a telephone, patient station, staff station or nurse control station is shown in FIG. 28. Return telephone voice and data information, e.g., data to notify a called party who called, is generated in the PBX and is formatted into an 8 bit PBX data frame of approximately 8 ms. in length (i.e., 1 ms/bit). Two of the eight bits are designated as auxiliary. A sync frame is then added into each bit portion of the PBX data frame and the resultant signal is conditioned for PCM transmission to a station, e.g., either nurse control station 2414, patient station 2415 and/or staff station 2418., 66486=In addition to the station groupings, the system of the present invention is configured so that each station group is assigned to a predetermined number of nurse control stations 2414. Table II below, illustrates an exemplary call assignment configuration for station groupings and their assignment to the nurse control stations 2414:, 162528=The preferred response at patient station 2416, shown in FIG. 19, to the activation of the code blue switch will be to pulse a station call and bed call placement LED indicators (not shown), which may be positioned on the front panel of patient station 2416, at a rate of 120 PPM, and to pulse a code blue indicator of the corresponding group indicator assembly 3024 via ZIA 3022 (shown in FIG. 7) at a rate of 120 PPM., 127732=FIG. 10 is a block diagram which illustrates hardware components for nurse control station 2414. Nurse control station 2414 includes main processor circuitry 3310, keyboard circuitry 3312 and display circuitry 3314. Main processor circuitry 3310 includes microprocessor 3316, such as the 16 bit model 286 microprocessor manufactured by Chips & Technology, Inc., 2 Mbytes of memory 3318 having stored programs (e.g., system and application programs) and communication interface 3320 connected to communication ports 3322., 125908=If, on the other hand, the cause of the fail safe was not from the activation of an emergency switch, then, according to this exemplary embodiment, the fail safe operation was activated by code blue switch 3234. The patient station responds to the code blue call by activating code blue indicator 3228 associated with patient station 2416 to which the code blue switch is operatively connected, and by displaying a \u201ccode blue\u201d message on patient station display 3230 (step 3140). Secondly, staff station or stations 2418 associated with the group of patient stations 2416, displays a \u201ccode blue\u201d message on station display 2422 (step 3142). Zone indicator assembly 3022 also activates the code blue indicator associated with the subject patient station group number (step 3144). Manual reset of code blue switch 3234 by the responding staff members returns the fail safe bus to the idle local mode (step 3146)., 205023=The PCM signal received at a station from PBX 2430 is then processed through a waveshaping and conditioning network 4650, shown in FIG. 25. Network 4650 converts the received signal from the PCM format to a serial digital format, recovers the synchronization clock to sync the timing via phase-locked loop 4670, and recaptures the telephone voice and data information and the system data. System Data is retrieved by the receiver waveshaping and conditioning network 4650 using an alternate mark inversion (AMI) conversion technique. The AMI conversion method changes the level of the output signal for each positive crossing of the zero line by the input signal, as shown in FIG. 32., 33563=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/572,130 filed Dec. 14, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,689,229, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/203,909 filed Feb. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,786, which is a continuation-in-part application Ser. No. 08/087,394 filed Jul. 2, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,851, which is a continuation-in-part application Ser. No. 08/033,287 filed Mar. 16, 1993, now abandon, which is a continuation-in-part application Ser. No. 07/924,101 filed Aug. 3, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,082, which is a continuation-in-part application Ser. No. 07/559,196 filed Jul. 27, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,291,399., 162995=The preferred response at staff station 2418, shown in FIG. 20, to the activation of the code blue switch will be to pulse an incoming call LED indicator which may be positioned on the front panel of staff station 2418, at a rate of 120 PPM, to display on staff station display 2422 (shown in FIG. 1) the room and bed number associated with the patient station to which code blue switch 3234 is connected and to display the \u201cCODE BLUE\u201d message; to pulse a blue indicator of the corresponding group indicator assembly 3024 via ZIA 3022, at a rate of 120 PPM; and to generate an audible tone at the rate of 120 PPM at speaker 4018 of staff station 2418 (shown in FIG. 1)., 138480=Referring again to FIG. 9, each patient station 2416 may be coupled to external peripheral equipment, such as controllers, indicators and/or switches, which provide medical instrument data and/or patient status data to staff members and which facilitate patient control of environmental facilities within the patient's room, as will be described. below. FIGS. 14a and 14 b represent an exemplary operational flow-chart of the interaction between the patient station and the bedside equipment and between the patient station and the CPU so as to facilitate communication between the bedside equipment and the CPU. Initially, the patient station monitors the inputs from the external peripheral equipment (e.g., switches) to determine if the equipment has been activated (steps 3710 and 3720). If a switch or other peripheral equipment is activated, a message frame associated with the activated switch will be stored in the memory of patient station circuitry 3510, shown in FIG. 12 (step 3722) and transferred to zone controller 2420. If, on the other hand, a switch has not been activated then the patient station will poll the bedside equipment via serial port 3534 (shown in FIG. 12) for status or message information and interpolate field parameters onto the received message (step 3724 and 3726). The message frame is then stored in patient station memory 3516 (shown in FIG. 12) and remains therein until the patient station 2416 is polled by the zone controller 2420 corresponding to the patient station (steps 3728, 3730 and 3732)., 181857=Referring again to FIG. 25, the PCM signal received at a station from PBX 2430 is processed through a waveshaper and conditioner 4650. The waveshaper and conditioner 4650 converts the received signals from the PCM format to a serial digital format, recovers the synchronization clock to sync the timing via phase-locked loop 4670, and recaptures the telephone voice and data information. Data retrieved by the receiver waveshaping and conditioning 4650 is transferred to serial-to-parallel converter 4660 which converts the data from a serial format to a parallel format for interaction with microprocessor 3512 and PCM CODEC 4630. PCM CODEC 4630 decodes the digital voice information for subsequent transmission of analog voice information to control unit 3210 for broadcast through speaker 4720, shown in FIG. 29., 54478=FIG. 1 is an illustration of the major components of the patient care and communication system according to the present invention, which includes central processor unit (CPU) 2412, nurse control stations 2414, patient stations 2416, staff stations 2418 and zone controllers 2420. Generally, the nurse control stations 2414 are installed at nurse stations located in various areas of the hospital or health care facility and provide a communication link to patients in their rooms. The patient stations 2416 are installed in patient rooms and can be configured to correspond to one patient or to multiple patients. The patient stations 2416 include patient station display 3230, speaker 3618, microphone 3620 and patient control unit 3210, all of which will be described in more detail below., 129643=Keyboard 3236 (shown in FIG. 9) includes speaker 3338, handset 3340 and microphone 3342 which facilitate audio communication between nurse control station 2414, patient stations 2416 and/or staff stations 2418, via audio controller 3344. The audio circuit portion 3410 of nurse control station 2414 will now be described with reference to FIG. 11, which illustrates the hardware configuration for the audio portion of the keyboard. As shown, audio pair 3412 from main processor 3270 of nurse control station 2414 (shown in FIG. 9) is connected to the front end of audio controller 3344. Preferably, the front end of audio controller 3344 includes a coupled 600 ohm balanced transformer 3414 which isolates the internal audio circuitry of nurse control station 2414 from the external audio circuits. Depending upon whether the audio signal is being received or transmitted, the back end of audio controller 3344 either directs the audio signal to keyboard speaker 3338 or to handset 3340, or directs the audio signal from microphone 3342 to transformer 3414., 196493=Referring to FIG. 41, an alternative embodiment of the patient room configuration of FIG. 39 is shown. In this embodiment, all devices which were connected by wires, e.g., the patient station 2416 and thermostat 5320 shown in FIG. 39, except the ceiling wireless receiver 5330, have been made wireless and portable. All functions performed by the devices within the room as shown in FIG. 39 are performed by the wireless units. The wiring installation of the system as shown in FIG. 41, simply requires the wiring installation of wireless receiver 5330 within each patient room, connecting the wireless receiver to a central computer, controller or to the PBX. Generally, previously wired devices for controlling the environment are replaced with a unit with an integral transmitter. For example, thermostat 5320 includes a wireless transmitter 5322. Thermostat 5320 measures the ambient temperature within the room and transmits the temperature data to receiver 5330 via transmitter 5322. In addition, the patient may control other environmental facilities within the room,e.g., a television, via badge 5140 as described above. As shown in FIG. 41, the thermostat 5320 and the badge 5140 are placed on a night stand within the room and proximal to the patient., 130874=Preferably, audio controller 3344 is a 34118 audio controller manufactured by Motorola. Audio input signals from main processor 3270 of nurse control station 2414, which pass through the audio controller are directed to keyboard speaker.3338 via amplifier 3416 or to handset 3340 via relay controller 3418 controlled by microcontroller 3324 (shown in FIG. 10). Audio generated by the nurse control station via microphone 3342 or handset 3340 is transferred through relay controller 3418 to audio controller 3344 and onto the audio pair as shown. The audio pair from keyboard circuitry 3312 is directed to the equipment panel via main processor circuitry 3310, as shpwn in FIG. 10., 146966=In the preferred embodiment, indicator assembly 3220 is a four lamp light fixture (e.g.,. a dome lamp) having colored lenses associated with each lamp. The fixture is secured or otherwise positioned on the wall outside the patient's room, preferably above the doorway, to allow staff members in the hallway to simply look at each indicator assembly and determine the type of staff member in a particular patient's room, if any. Alternatively, the indicator assembly may be any known type sufficient to provide staff members with an indication as to the type of staff member in a patient's room, for example, the indicator may be a LCD display which identifies the type and the name of the staff member in the patient's room in response to information provided to the system by the above described staff locator system, describes in more detail in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 07/924,101, filed Aug. 3, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/559,196, filed on Jul. 27, 1990, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein, by reference., 141945=Referring again to FIG. 9, in the preferred embodiment, patient station 2416 is connected to patient control unit 3210 via data link 3246. Patient control unit 3210 includes control buttons 3248 which facilitate patient control of the environmental facilities within the patient's room, via patient station 2416 and CPU 2412. Such environmental facilities include, for example, the television, radio, draperies and the room lighting., 34378=The present invention relates to a patient care and communication system which incorporates telephone communication therein. The system utilizes a PBX to provide staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient and/or external telephone communications. The system is also capable of performing tasks such as monitoring medical equipment in patient rooms and maintaining patient medical data; facilitating staff-to-staff or staff-to-patient visual and data communications; and tracking the location of staff members or patients to provide maximum patient care. More detailed descriptions of the staff-patient communications and the monitoring of the medical equipment is provided in application Ser. No. 08/033,287, filed Mar. 16, 1993 which is incorporated herein by reference. A more detailed description of the., system for tracking the location of personnel is provided in application Ser. No. 08/087,394, filed Jul. 2, 1993 and application Ser. No. 07/924,101, filed Aug. 3, 1992 both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 175489=FIG. 25 is a circuit block diagram of the patient station 2416 according to the alternative embodiment, which includes a telephone circuit 4610, which in turn connects to the PBX 2430. The patient station further includes a receiver unit 4800 for sensing or receiving signals transmitted from the portable badges. As shown, the patient station 2416 is a microprocessor controlled interface having similar system data communications as the patient station described above with reference to FIGS. 4, 9 and 12-14 b. Further, the telephone circuit 4610 facilitates telephone communication between a patient via patient station control unit 3210, shown in FIG. 23, and the internal and external telephone systems via PBX 2430, shown in FIG. 24., 145769=The responding frame from the CPU 2412 includes information to cause the activation of an indicator in indicator assembly 3220 which corresponds with the type of staff member in the patient's room. To illustrate, if the staff member entering the patient room is a registered nurse (RN), that person would activate switch 3258 which in turn would activate indicator 3224 of indicator assembly 3220 via patient station 2416 and CPU 2412. If the staff member entering the room is a licensed practical nurse (LPN), that person would activate switch 3260 of staff presence switch 3254, which in turn would activate indicator 3226 of indicator assembly 3220 via patient station 2416 and CPU 2412. If, on the other hand, the staff member entering the room is an aide, then that person would activate switch 3262 of staff presence switch 3254, which in turn would activate indicator 3228 of indicator assembly 3220. When the staff member leaves the patient's room, the particular staff member switch is deactivated so as to deactivate indicator assembly 3220., 75881=FIG. 2 illustrates a functional block diagram of an alternative system configuration, which includes main hospital computer 2530 configured to interface with CPU 2412 to provide staff members with additional patient information, or to transfer from CPU 2412 to the main hospital computer patient information which may be utilized for billing purposes. For example, information pertaining to the types and quantities of prescription or intravenous drugs taken by the patient and the types of treatments received by the patient (e.g., X-rays or CT-scans), as well as the physician time spent with the patient, may be transferred to the main hospital computer to provide the hospital with more accurate billing information. Preferably, main hospital computer 2530 is interfaced with CPU 2412 via hospital personal computer 2540, system personal computer 2550, RS-232/RS-484 converter 2520 and zone controller 2560. In this configuration, the integrity of the main hospital computer is maintained and the serial conversion from RS-232 protocol to RS-484 protocol is accomplished., 177589=Typically, telephone voice and data communication between each station and the PBX 2430 is in the form of message frames which are divided into fields, e.g., a data field and a control field. As an example, the data field associated with voice data to the station is approximately 64 kilobits in length and the control field is approximately 2 kilobits in length. The control field includes a sync bit for synchronizing communications between the telephone and the PBX. The preferred transmission rate for data is 19.2 kilobits per second., 73159=In the preferred embodiment, the patient care and communication system of the present invention can include four call assignment configurations. To illustrate, the call assignment configurations can be utilized to automatically (or manually) assign stations (2416 or 2418) to station groups and station groups to nurse control stations 2414 for day operation, for evening operation, for weekend operation and/or for holiday operation., 159856=Message frames usually in the form of an I-frame originated by a nurse control station, a patient station and/or a staff station are interpreted by CPU 2412 and assigned a priority level based upon the type of message frame received (i.e., the DTYPE field of the INFORMATION field contains the message type which corresponds to the priority level that will be assigned to the frame). In addition, the message associated with the TEXT field of the message frame is displayed on nurse control station display 3272 of a nurse control station 2414 in order of priority level. The priority levels are preprogrammed during the initial set-up of the system configuration, but may be altered by staff members at nurse control station 2414 via keyboard 3236 or direct select keys 3274 (shown in FIG. 9). The highest priority call will be displayed first and other calls will follow in descending order according to the priority level., 142742=FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary operational flow for the patient control unit 3210 in combination with patient station 2416. Upon activation of nurse call button 3250 of patient control unit 3210 (shown in FIG. 9), patient station 2416 receives the switch activation data via data link 3246 and buffers 3530 (shown in FIG. 12). Microprocessor 3512 then interpolates field data onto the received message to form a message frame, as described above, and stores the message frame in RAM 3518 (step 3810)., 165734=As another example, CPU 2412 of the patient care and communication system interacts with the central computer system of staff locator system 2428, shown in FIG. 4. In this configuration, the identification badges are in communication with the central computer system in a manner described in application Ser. No. 07/924,101, which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular, FIGS. 4 and 17c of that application, show the identification badge 1111, which is worn by the staff member, continually transmits the identification signal (of the staff member) and the central computer system continually monitors the identification signal to update the location of the badge (and the staff member). The location information of the staff member is transferred to CPU 2412 via data link 2726 (shown in FIG. 4) which may be any known type of communication link utilized to facilitate communication between computer systems. Therefore, when a call is directed to a nurse control station 2414 programmed to operate in the nurse follow mode, CPU 2412 will route the incoming call to a station (either 2416 or 2418) positioned nearest the detected location of the staff member. In an alternative embodiment, a staff member attending the nurse control'station may want to route incoming calls to locations of other staff members. In this embodiment, the nurse control station can be programmed in the nurse follow mode to route the incoming calls intended for nurse control station 2414, to stations where the other staff members have been detected by the staff locator system., 136313=FIG. 13 is a circuit block diagram for the audio portion 3610 of patient station 2416. As shown, audio pair 3612 from an equipment panel (e.g., audio matrix 2510 shown in FIG. 2) is connected to the front end of audio controller 3614. Preferably, the front end of audio controller 3614 includes a coupled 600 ohm balanced transformer 3616 which isolates the internal audio circuitry of patient station 2416 from the external audio circuits. Depending upon whether the audio signal is being received or transmitted, the back end of audio controller 3614 either directs the audio signal to patient station speaker 3618 or to an external audio speaker, such as speaker 3252 of patient control unit 3210, shown in FIG. 9, or directs the audio signal from microphone 3620 to transformer 3616., 55973=As will be described in more detail below, the various types of stations which are positioned at different locations within the hospital interact with the aid of the CPU 2412 to perform numerous operations to reduce the information overload currently plaguing hospital staff members. Examples of the operations involving CPU 2412 include a call priority operation which prioritizes incoming calls (or messages) to nurse control station 2414 based upon the type of message received, so that staff members respond to the highest priority calls first. For example, if the incoming message relates to a fault in a smoke alarm secured in the patient's room, that message will be given the highest priority. Another operational example is a nurse follow operation which allows staff members to selectively route incoming calls directed to a nurse control station, to selected patient stations and/or staff stations so that when the staff members attending the nurse control station are required to leave the area, incoming calls to that station can be routed to locations where appropriate staff members can respond to the call. Another operational example is a voice paging operation which allows staff members to communicate with selected patient stations 2416 and/or staff stations 2418 from the nurse control station 2414. The interaction between the stations when performing these exemplary operations or tasks, as well as other operations, is conducted via a communication link which will be described in more detail below., 155477=Referring again to FIG. 1, staff station 2418 is similar in design to patient station 2416. In the preferred embodiment, staff station 2418 may be configured, in the initial system configuration setup, to operate in a \u201cduty\u201d mode or a \u201cstaff\u201d mode. In the \u201cduty\u201d mode staff station 2418 provides patient call indications on staff station display 2422, as well as facilitating communication with nurse control station 2414. In the \u201cstaff\u201d mode staff station 2418 facilitates communication with nurse control station 2414., 78021=Communication interface 2830 and communication ports 2850 are provided to facilitate communication between CPU 2412 and zone controllers 2420 and between CPU 2412 and the external communication equipment. As noted above, the preferred communication protocol includes the RS-485 serial communication protocol. Accordingly, communication interface 2830 is configured to accommodate RS-485 communication utilizing RS-485 drivers/receivers which are known in the art., 165312=For example, if the staff member selects the nurse follow feature which routes incoming calls to patient stations where the RN switch 3258 of staff presence switch 3254 (shown in FIG. 9) has been activated, CPU 2412 will direct the incoming call to the nurse control station to any room in the group where switch 3258 of staff presence switch 3254 has been activated., 179519=Preferably, telephone voice transmissions between the PBX and the telephone are in the PCM format which may utilize the primary, secondary or both channels. As shown in FIG. 25, PCM CODEC 4630 compresses the voice information into PCM format. Transmitter conditioner 4640 amplifies and modulates each frame for transmission to the PBX 2430. The primary channel is preferably a 64 kilobits channel used to transfer control information to and from peripheral devices (e.g., the PBX), a synchronization bit for the hardware, and the voice signal. The secondary channel is also a 64 kilobit channel which is utilized to transfer EIA data and controls for serial communications, such as for RS-232 applications., 168843=Alternatively, the voice paging feature may utilize staff locator system 2428, shown in FIG. 4 to determine the location of a staff member or members so that the staff member attending nurse control station 2414 may communicate with the patient and/or staff stations nearest to each staff member or members being paged., 169234=The room monitoring feature allows staff members attending a nurse control station 2414 to activate the audio system of either a selected number of patient stations 2416 or to manually step or automatically scan through each patient station 2416 in each room associated with the station grouping, described above, in a predetermined order for a predetermined period of time so as to activate microphone 3520 of patient station 2416, enabling staff members to listen for sounds of distress or other uncharacteristic noises so as to check on the well being of a patient or patients. Preferably, the predetermined order for monitoring rooms is from the lowest room number to the highest and the predetermined period of time is approximately ten seconds. In operation, the staff member attending nurse control station 2414 configures the system for automatic room monitoring by depressing direct select keys 3274 of nurse control station display 3272 in response to menu driven prompts. Once configured for automatic monitoring, CPU 2412 sends a message frame to each patient station in the above noted order to activate microphone 3620 (shown in FIG. 13) of audio circuitry 3610, via audio controller 3614, for a period of ten seconds to allow the attending staff member to listen for distress noises and other uncharacteristic noises., 149395=An example of a station task performed by the CPU in response to the activation of a code blue switch will be described below. Initially CPU 2412 determines the message type received from zone controller 2420. Next the CPU performs whatever function is associated with the message, in this example the message relates to the code blue function. In response to the code blue function, the CPU 2412 sends to the particular patient station an I-frame which includes data to cause activation of particular peripheral equipment as well as devices within the patient station 2416, e.g., a tone code and an indicator assembly activation code. Next CPU 2412 determines which staff station or stations 2418 and which nurse control station or stations 2414 are grouped with the subject patient station 2416. Thereafter, CPU 2412 sends to each associated staff station an I-frame including message data to display \u201ccode blue\u201d on staff station display 2422 of staff station 2418. Next CPU 2412 sends a message to the ZIA 3022, shown in FIG. 7, to activate the proper indicator associated with the patient station group in a manner similar to that described above with reference ta fail safe bus 3020., 170738=The system of the present invention also provides diagnostic features which continuously monitor system components. As noted above, system faults are communicated to the nurse control station and/or to the staff station and added to the problem report. Hard and/or soft copies of the problem report may be obtained from printer 2724 and/or external computer 2722 (shown in FIG. 4) or the problem report may be displayed on nurse control station display 3272 when the \u201cproblem reports\u201d feature is selected by direct select keys 3274 shown in FIG. 9., 167443=The voice page feature allows staff members to communicate to selected patient and/or staff stations from the nurse control station. To illustrate, this feature allows a staff member to communicate to all staff members who have activated staff presence switches associated with the nurse control station (i.e., within the same group) and all staff members in areas where staff stations are located. FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary operational flow for the voice paging feature of the present invention. Initially, the staff member desiring to page all staff members within the assigned group, programs nurse control station 2414 via direct select keys 3274 (shown in FIG. 9) which activate menu driven functions (step 4410). The menu driven instructions from the nurse control station are then transferred to the CPU via zone controller 2420 in a manner described above (step 4420). The CPU analyzes the instructions, e.g., determines the identification of the patient and/or staff stations and their associated zone controllers and the CPU performs the function associated with the received message frame (step 4430, 4440 and 4450). Thereafter, the CPU causes the audio connection between each station and the nurse control station and notifies the paging staff member to begin talking (steps 4460 and 4470)., 80387=However, if a response is due, the CPU then starts the task associated with the information included in the message frame (step 2960). Upon completion of the task, CPU 2412 returns to the listen mode and begins polling the next zone controller connected thereto as described above., 153407=As another example, an intravenous (IV) pump 3284 is connected to patient station 2416 via data link 3286, which as noted above is operatively connected to nurse control station 2414, via zone controller 2420 and CPU 2412. In this example, the IV pump is periodically monitored by patient station 2416 to ensure the flow rate of the pump is appropriate. If a failure is detected, a message frame including the error message is,transferred to CPU 2412 in a manner set forth above. The CPU the initiates an appropriate alarm sequence, such as displaying a message on the monitor of nurse control station 2414, that the IV container is empty and needs to be changed. It should be noted, that numerous other types of bedside equipment may be monitored by the system of the present invention, including respirators and heart monitors., 132749=The patient station portion of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 4, 9 and 12, 13, 14A and 14B. Turning initially to FIG. 9, patient station 2416 is a microprocessor controlled interface between,CPU 2412, the patient bedside equipment and peripheral equipment. The communication link between CPU 2412 and the bedside or peripheral equipment is via the master/slave communication link described above. Examples of the patient bedside equipment include heart monitors, respirators, pulse oxymeters or I.V. pumps which include data communication ports to serially transmit data. Examples of peripheral equipment include patient control unit 3210, staff presence switch 3254, indicator assembly 3220, code blue switch 3234, emergency code switch 3232 and/or a smoke detector (not shown). Staff presence switch 3254 is preferably located by the door of the patient rooms and is provided to activate indicator 3220 and to cause patient station 2416 to send a message frame to CPU 2412 indicating the particular type of staff member who is present in the patient's room, as will be described in more detail below. In addition, patient station 2416 may be operatively connected to a side-rail communication system (not shown) installed in a side-rail of the patient's bed, as well as bed sensors which sense whether the patient is in the bed. Side-rail communication system may be connected to the audio output ports 3624, shown in FIG. 13, to facilitate audio communication at the side-rail., 72271=In this exemplary configuration, communication transmitted by any of the stations assigned to station group one (rooms 100-133, 201 and 202) will be directed to nurse control station one (NCS1) and to NCS2 so that staff members attending either nurse control station 2414 can respond to the call. Communications transmitted by any of the stations assigned to station group two (rooms 120-153, 201 and 202) will be directed to NCS1 and NCS8 so that staff members attending either nurse control station 2414 can respond to the call. Communications transmitted by any of the stations assigned to station group eight (rooms 154-187, 201 and 202) will be directed to NCS1 so that staff members attending NCS1 can respond to the call., 204729=According to an alternate embodiment, the PBX 2430 includes capabilities to process the telephone data and automatically connect the calling stations with the called stations for telephone and/or data communications independent of central processing unit 5010., 142447=Nurse call button 3250 is provided to enable the patient to call the nurse control station or stations within the group. As noted above, the communication between stations is facilitated by CPU 2412 utilizing the master/slave communication link described above., 173308=The patient care and communication system of the present invention also includes external diagnostic device 2570 connected to serial data converter 2520, as shown in FIG. 2. Preferably, external diagnostic device 2570 is a modem provided to facilitate external diagnostics of the patient care and communication system of the present invention, via converter 2520 and zone controller 2560. External diagnostic device 2570 allows a technician or other service personnel to remotely verify and update the configuration of the system in a manner similar to that performed by staff members attending a nurse control station. In addition, the external diagnostic device 2570 allows the technician or other service personnel to view the system problem report which, as noted above, includes information as to which stations or equipment are not operational., 79559=If, however, the S-RAM does have a message frame stored therein, CPU 2412 will retrieve the message frame (step 2930) and analyze the received message frame by determining what patient station, staff station or nurse. control station the message frame was received from and if the frame was received from a patient station, by organizing or obtaining any patient information associated with that particular patient station (step 2940). The DATA field within the INFORMATION field of the received message frame is then interpreted by the CPU, which determines whether a response to the associated patient station, staff station or nurse control station message frame is necessary (step 2950). If a response is not required, CPU 2412 returns to poll the next zone controller., 193757=In an alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 39 and 40, the badge unit may interface with an independent wireless electromagnetic receiver, preferably infrared receiver 5330. In one embodiment, each wireless receiver is located within the patient room and connected to a controller 5370 which responds to control data received from receiver 5330 to control the environmental facilities. In another embodiment, each wireless receiver is connected to either the central processing unit 2412 through zone controller 2420 or to the PBX 2430. In this embodiment, central processing unit 2412 or PBX 2430 will respond to the control data in a similar manner as controller 5370 and communications between the independent receiver and the central processing unit 2412 or the PBX 2430 is similar to the above described communications relating to receiver 4800, shown in FIGS. 23 and 25. As shown in FIG. 40, infrared light sensitive diode array 5340 receives infrared signals, preferably frequency modulated infrared signals, transmitted from badge units 5140 within approximately 30 feet of the receiver. Waveshaping and amplifier network 5350 conditions and amplifies the signals generated by the diode array 5340. FM receiver 5360 demodulates the control data from the carrier signal and serially transfers the received control data to controller 5370., 156073=FIG. 16 illustrates hardware configurations for the staff station circuitry 3910 installed within staff station 2418. The staff station circuitry 3910 includes microprocessor 3912, such as model 64180 manufactured by Motorola operating at a frequency of 12.888 MHz. via crystal 3914, 96 Kbytes of memory 3916 (e.g., 64 Kbytes of flash ROM and 32 Kbytes of RAM) having stored programs, e.g., system and application programs. In this exemplary configuration, the data and address buses of the microprocessor are connected to the memory, e.g., RAM 3918 and an EPROM 3920. Memory decoder 3922 is utilized to select between RAM 3918 and EPROM 3920 in response to a particular address on the address bus. The address bus is also connected to a pair of latches 3924 and 3926 which interface the microprocessor to status indicators, the fail safe bus (FSB), the audio control circuitry, and to switches and other peripheral equipment connected to the staff station, as shown. In addition, I/O decoder 3928 is utilized to select between either latch in response to a particular address on the address bus. Incoming signals from the above noted peripheral equipment are received by buffer 3930 and then transferred to the data-bus upon being enabled by I/O decoder 3928., 152014=Examples of the above described bedside equipment are shown in FIGS. 9. As shown, a heart rate monitor 3280 is connected to patient station 2416 via data link 3282, which as noted above is operatively connected to nurse control station 2414 via zone controller 2420 and CPU 2412. The patient station (acting as a master station) polls heart rate monitor 3280 (operating as a slave station) to verify that the patients heart rate falls within the proper range as determined by the monitor. The zone controller periodically polls patient station 2416, as described above for an S-frame or an I-frame message frame. Typically with respect to this example, if no fault is detected the patient station will respond to the polling of the zone controller with an S-frame indicating proper operation of heart rate monitor 3280. However, a fault detected in monitor 3280 will be stored in RAM 3518 of patient station circuitry 3510 (shown in FIG. 12) along with the appropriate field data in the form of an I-frame, and the I-frame is transferred to zone controller 2420 and CPU 2412 in a manner described above. The CPU then analyzes the I-frame and an appropriate alarm sequence is initiated to notify staff members at nurse control station 2414 of the detected fault., 150701=The CPU 2412 then sends an I-frame to each nurse control station grouped with the patient station to display the room number and identity of the patient subject to the code blue function, on the display of the nurse control station. The CPU 2412 then sends to the nurse control station an I-frame including appropriate control signals associated with the patient station message. Once the above steps are accomplished the station task is completed and the CPU 2412 returns to the listen task., 140165=Once polled, the patient station transfers the message frame to the S-RAM 2512 (shown in FIG. 2) of the zone controller until the last byte of the frame has been transferred (i.e., the F bit is set to logic 1) (steps 3734 and 3736). The zone controller then determines if the message frame, received is an S-frame or an I-frame, and if the message frame is an S-frame the zone controller acknowledges the message frame and the patient station returns to monitor the switch inputs (steps 3738 and 3740). If the received message frame is an I-frame the frame is transferred to the CPU which determines whether a response to the transmitting station is required (steps 3742, 3744 and 3746). If no response is required the CPU stores the received data and the patient station returns to monitor the switch inputs, as shown. If, however, a response is required a response message frame is sent to the zone controller and stored in the S-RAM (step 3748). The zone controller polls the patient station and if a received ready (RR) command is received in return, the response message frame is transferred to and stored in the patient station (steps 3750 and 3752)., 182776=According to the alternative embodiment, infrared sensitive photodiodes 4810 of receiver 4800 senses infrared transmissions from an infrared transmitter and converts the infrared signals to electrical signals. Waveshaper and conditioner 4820 conditions and amplifies the electrical signals and FM receiver 4830 demodulates the data for the carrier signal and serially transfers the received data to an I/0 port of microprocessor 3512. According to the alternative embodiment of the invention, the receiver 4800 is capable of receiving infrared transmissions from portable transmitters at a distance of around 30 feet or greater from the station. Microprocessor 3512 receives the serial data from the FM receiver 4830 and extracts the transmitter ID information. The extracted information is reformatted and forwarded in an information packet to the PBX 2430 or the central processing unit 2412 for further processing and location determination., 160850=Preferably, each call originated has specific audible and visual signaling based on the call priority level which are distributed to the necessary nurse control stations, zone indicator assembly, patient stations and/or staff stations via CPU 2412 and their respective zone controller. FIGS. 18-20 represent tables illustrating exemplary embodiments of call priority levels, their associated visual and tone indications which are generated at either the nurse control station, the patient station and/or the staff station. FIG. 18 illustrates the preferred visual display which appear on nurse control station display 3272 and the tones generated at speaker 3238 (shown in FIG. 9) in response to the various priority levels. For example, in response to the activation of code blue switch 3234 (shown in FIG. 9) CPU 2412 will transmit to nurse control station 2414 a message frame instructing the nurse control station to display on the nurse control station display 3272 a flashing arrow directed at a direct select key 3274 to indicate which key will enable the staff member to connect the audio of the nurse control station to the audio of the patient station and respond to the call. The arrow will flash at a rate of approximately 120 pulses per minute (PPM). In addition, the room number and bed number associated with the patient station to which the code blue switch is connected and the \u201cECODE BLUE\u201d message will be displayed on nurse control station display 3272. An audible tone at the rate of 120 PPM will also be generated at speaker 3238 of nurse control station 2414., 95123=If the slave station fails to successfully respond to the polling frame of the master station with either an S-frame or I-frame, for a predetermined number of polls, preferably 10, that particular station will be marked as disconnected and will be polled at slower rate (preferably, about every 10 sec.) until the master station receives at least one message frame from that particular slave station. When a station or other equipment connected to the system of the present invention are determined to be disconnected, the identity of the station or other equipment and the room location of the equipment are stored in a problem report which can be printed on hard or soft copy via printer 2724 and/or external computer 2722, shown in FIG. 4. Alternatively, the problem report can be displayed on nurse control station display 3272 shown in FIG. 32 upon the proper keying of direct select keys 3374 of nurse control station display 3272 pursuant to menu prompts., 203389=Central computer 5010 provides standard control of PBX 2430 such as processing telephone data received by the PBX and providing the PBX with the connection information to interconnect particular stations for voice communications. For example, if a staff member attending a nurse control station calls a patient station where another staff member is attending to a patient, central processing unit 5010 processes the telephone data, e.g., patient station identity of the called party, and provides the PBX with the necessary information to interconnect the two stations. In addition, central processing unit 5010 is utilized to process the system data to perform system functions, e.g., the call priority, nurse follow, voice paging and room monitoring functions as previously described. The system data is preferably formatted in the following protocol by microprocessor 3512:, 135806=Utilizing the preferred microprocessor 3512 (i.e., the Motorola 64180), serial communication between the zone controller 2420 and microprocessor 3512 or between the bedside equipment and microprocessor 3512, may be accomplished through either one of two asynchronous serial communication ports 3532 and 3534 which are, preferably, configured to RS-485 protocol utilizing RS-485 driver/receivers (RS-485 D/R) 3536 and 3538 as shown., 171833=FIG. 22 shows the hardware components for patient control unit 3210 which is connected to patient station 2416. Preferably, the wiring is tested by microprocessor 3512 (shown in FIG. 12) activated signals in combination with the wire test circuitry 4510. Wire test circuit 4510 includes resistor 4512 and field effect transistor (FET) 4514 which are connected between call wire 4516 and nurse call wire 4518, as shown. In this configuration, microprocessor circuitry 3510 of patient station 2416, shown in FIG. 12, periodically turns on FET 4514 via call wire 4516 therefore completing the ground path connecting call wire 4516 and nurse call wire 4518. Microprocessor 3512 then interrogates nurse call wire 4518 via buffer 3530 (shown in FIG. 12) in response to microprocessor driven instructions, so as to perform a continuity check of the nurse call feature of patient control unit 3210. Preferably, the period between each wire test is two seconds. Wire test circuit 4510 may be utilized to perform wire tests between any periphery equipment and the processor associated with the station to which the peripheral equipment is connected. In the event the continuity check fails, a failure alarm sequence is initiated to notify staff members of the wire failure and which wire in which periphery device has failed., 127007=The nurse control portion of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. FIG. 9 illustrates a system configuration in which peripheral equipment is connected to patient station 2416 and in which nurse control station 2414 includes main processor 3270, keyboard 3236 and nurse control station display 3272. Nurse control station display 3272 can be user programmed to perform functions, such as initiating a code blue operational sequence, either through keyboard 3236 or direct select keys 3274. The direct select keys 3274 allow staff members to select specific functions in response to menu driven prompts., 201777=FIG. 30 is a circuit block diagram of the nurse control station 2414 which includes PBX interface or telephone circuitry 4610 connected to microcontroller 3324, keys 3328, speaker 3338, handset 3340 and microphone 3342 to provide telephone communications between the nurse control station and the other stations and/or to provide external telephone communications. Staff stations 2418 include the same components as shown in FIG. 25 for the patient stations 2416, except in the staff stations, the speaker 4018, keypad 4019 and microphone 4020 for providing telephone communications between the staff station and the other stations and/or to provide external telephone communications are integrated within the staff station. communications between the staff stations 2418 and the PBX 2430 are same as described for the patient stations 2416 and are shown in FIGS. 26 to 28., 80702=The components of zone controller 2420 include a microcontroller, memory having stored programs (e.g., system or application programs) and a communication interface connected to communication ports. The connection of the zone controller 2420 components is the same as equivalent components of CPU 2412, as shown in FIG. 5. The zone controller 2420 also includes the shared-RAM (S-RAM) 2512, shown in FIG. 2, which is connected to the microcontroller. Preferably, the microcontroller is the 64180 microcontroller, manufactured by Motorola and the S-RAM includes 2 kilobytes of memory., 123174=If the cause of the fail safe was due to the activation of nurse call button 3250, the patient station responds by activating nurse call indicator 3222 of indicator assembly 3220 associated with that particular patient station and by displaying a \u201cnurse call\u201d message on patient station display 3230 (step 3122). Next, the staff stations 2418 (shown in FIG. 1) associated with the group of patient stations 2416 respond by displaying a \u201cnurse call\u201d message on staff station display 2422 (step 3124). Zone indicator assembly (ZIA) 3022 activates the nurse call indicator of zone indicator 3024 (e.g., indicators 1 through 8, shown in FIG. 7) associated with the particular group of patient stations (step 3126). For example, if the nurse call button is activated by a patient station associated with group 1, the nurse call indicator of the group 1 zone indicator 3024 associated with zone indicator assembly 3022 will be activated. Manual reset of the patient station by a staff member responding to the call returns the FSB and the patient stations to the idle local mode (step 3128)., 77039=FIG. 5 illustrates the hardware components of central processing unit (CPU) 2412. The CPU 2412 includes microprocessor 2810, three Mbytes of memory 2820 (2 Mbytes of flash ROM and 1 Mbyte of RAM) having stored programs (e.g., operating system and application programs), and communication interface 2830. Preferably, microprocessor 2810 is an MC68000 16-bit microprocessor manufactured by Motorola Inc. In addition to the above circuits, CPU 2412 includes watchdog circuit 2840 which receives a one shot trigger from microprocessor 2810, at a predetermined time interval, preferably 300 msec., to ensure that the microprocessor is functioning. If, however, microprocessor 2810 fails to timely trigger watchdog circuit 2840, then the watchdog circuit will initiate an automatic reset of the microprocessor, thus preventing the microprocessor from locking-up for extended periods of time., 178603=FIGS. 26-28 illustrate typical system timing and format diagrams for the communication of data frames between the stations of the present invention and the PBX 2430. As shown in FIG. 26, the data transmitted from the microprocessor or microcontroller (hereinafter identified as \u201cmicroprocessor\u201d) within each station is configured in a 16 bit parallel data word on the microprocessor data bus, which is preferably framed by one (1) start bit and seven (7) stop bits. Communications with the PBX system, on the other hand, are in a serial mode, therefore, the 16 bit parallel data word is converted to a serial data stream in the telephone circuit within each station, via parallel-to-serial-converter 4620, shown in FIG. 25. In addition, a synchronization bit (sync bit) is added into each microprocessor data frame to maintain clock alignment between the PBX and the station., 186863=Functions associated with the processor include: logical and arithmetic operations and coordination of data transfer to and from the microcontroller 4900. In the preferred embodiment, the processor also performs a fail safe function which periodically transmits a message to the central processing unit 2412 via patient station 2416 and PBX 2430. The periodic message, e.g., a fail safe code, is provided to inform the central processing unit 2412 that the badge is operational. Thus, if the message is not received from the badge unit, the central processing unit 2412 determines that either-the badge unit has malfunctioned or that the badge unit is not within the operational confines of the system of the present invention, e.g., a staff member has left the hospital environment. The identification code of the badge may be utilized as the fail safe code which is periodically transmitted., 158649=Preferably, audio controller 4014 is a 34118 audio controller manufactured by Motorola. Audio input signals from audio matrix 2510 which pass through the audio controller are directed to staff station speaker 4018 via amplifier 4022. Audio generated by the staff station via microphone 4020 is selectively transferred through audio controller 4014 onto the audio pair as shown. Mute switch 4024 may be provided to allow a staff member to manually short out the microphone so as to prevent audio'signals from being generated at the patient station., 154319=Transmitter 3290 is hardwired to the bedside equipment, e.g., heart rate monitor 3280, and is provided to enable a central computer system to determine what room or other area of the health care facility the bedside equipment is located and to transmit operation data generated by the bedside equipment, such as status data or other data associated with the operation of the equipment. In this configuration, transmitter 3290 transmits an identification signal and the operation data to an IR transceiver which is in communication with the central computer through a network server as described in application Ser. No. 07/924,101. The central computer determines which transceiver received the identification signal of the bedside equipment and transfers the location data of the equipment and the operation data to CPU 2412 via data link 2728 (shown in FIG. 4). Transmitter 3290 may be a radio frequency transmitter operating at a frequency of approximately 300 MHz, which are available from Dallas Semiconductor, Inc., 121828=An operational flow associated with the above described exemplary fail safe feature will be described with reference to FIGS. 7-9. As noted, upon failure of the CPU 2412, the stations associated with the system of the present invention operate in the local mode. In response to activation of a fail safe device (e.g., the nurse call button 3250, the code blue switch 3234 or the emergency switch 3232) the system first determines whether the cause of the fail safe was from the activation of nurse call button 3250 of patient control unit 3210 (shown in FIG. 9) (steps 3110 and 3120). Nurse call button 3250, code blue switch 3234 and/or emergency switch 3232 are connected to patient station 2416 and provide either a general indication to staff members that the patient needs assistance or an emergency indication relating to the patients immediate health condition. Nurse call button 3250 allows the patient to indicate the need for general assistance, whereas, code blue switch 3234 and emergency switch 3232 allow staff members to activate the appropriate staff response to the patient's health condition. For example, if the patient is experiencing a heart attack a staff member would activate the code blue switch., 185045=Preferably, the transmitter is enclosed in a housing which is shaped and sized like an ordinary credit card or smaller. FIGS. 34-36 illustrate the side, top and bottom-views, respectively, of the badge housing. The housing 5140, as shown, is approximately 3.8 inches in length, 2.27 inches in width and 0.39 inches in thickness. The housing 5140 includes a slot 5150 which is configured to receive personnel card 5200 shown in FIGS. 37 and 38. Badge unit 5110 also includes electrical contacts 5160 which are connected to microcontroller 4900 of badge unit 5110 as shown in FIG. 33. Contacts 5160 are provided to engage corresponding contacts 5220 on the personnel card 5200 for data communications therebetween, as will be described in more detail below. A more detailed description of the badge unit is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent application Ser. No. 08/087,394, filed Jul. 2, 1993 which is incorporated herein by reference., 143348=Once stored in memory, the nurse call data remains therein until the patient station is polled by the zone controller (step 3820). Once polled, the message frame is then transferred to the zone controller and stored in the S-RAM (step 3830). The data remains in the S-RAM until the S-RAM is polled by CPU 2412, upon which, the message frame is then transferred to the CPU (step 3840)., 55373=The staff stations 2418 are preferably installed in locations frequently occupied by other staff members in the hospital, such as staff locker rooms. Staff stations 2418 include staff station display 2422, speaker 4018 and microphone 4020, all or which will also be described in more detail below. The zone controllers 2420 include shared-RAM (S-RAM) memory 2512 (shown in FIG. 2) which is utilized as a buffer memory for data received from either CPU 2412 or from any of the above noted stations, hence the term shared-RAM., 124412=If the cause of the fail safe was not from the activation of the nurse call button, the fail safe system then determines if the fail safe was caused by the activation of emergency switch 3232 (step 3130). If fail safe operation was caused by the activation of emergency switch 3232, patient station 2416 responds by activating the emergency indicator associated with that patient station and by displaying an \u201cemergency\u201d message on patient station display 3230 (step 3132). Preferably, the emergency indicator is the same indicator as nurse call indicator 3222. However, activation of indicator 3222 in the emergency mode results in a blink light at a predetermined rate in pulses per minutes (PPM) as illustrated in the table of FIG. 19. Whereas, activation of indicator 3222 in the nurse call mode results in a steady lamp intensity. Second, staff station or stations 2418 associated with the subject patient station, displays an \u201cemergency\u201d message on staff station display 2422, shown in FIG. 1 (step 3134). Next, zone indicator assembly 3022 activates the emergency indicator of zone indicator 3024 associated with the group with which the particular patient station belongs (step 3136). Staff members responding to the emergency call, manually reset emergency switch 3232 (step 3138), thus returning the fail safe system to the idle local mode., 73634=Referring now to FIG. 4 which illustrates an alternative system configuration in which, central processing unit 2412 is connected to external communication equipment such as broadcast paging system 2720, external computer 2722, printer 2724, and/or staff locator system 2428. Broadcast paging system 2720 may be utilized by the system of the present invention to locate staff members or other personnel who are not within the hospital or other health care facility. The broadcast paging system may be any known type capable of interfacing with a computer. Preferably, broadcast paging system 2720 and CPU 2412 communicate via serial communication ports connected to each device. Staff locator system 2428 may be provided to locate staff members anywhere in the hospital or other health care facility as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 07/924,101, filed Aug. 3, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to locating staff members, staff locator system 2428 may be utilized to track or locate patients in the hospital. To utilize the staff locator system to locate patients, each patient is provided with an identification badge or bracelet which includes the components as disclosed for identification badge worn by staff members and described above. The identification badge or bracelet continually transmits the identification signal of the patient and the central computer system continually monitors the identification signal to update the location of the bracelet and the patient. The location information of the staff member or patient is transferred to CPU 2412 via data link 2726 (shown in FIG. 4) which may be any known type of communication link utilized to facilitate communication between computer systems. External computer 2722 interfaces to CPU 2412 and performs computing functions including extracting or inputting data stored or otherwise processed within CPU 2412. Printer 2724 may be utilized to extract hard copies of data stored or otherwise processed within CPU 2412 including problem reports generated by the system, as will be described in more detail below., 164599=In operation, a staff member attending nurse control station 2414 may utilize direct select keys 3274 (show in FIG. 9) in response to menu driven prompts to configure the system to operate in the nurse follow mode. In the nurse follow mode, calls which are directed to the nurse control station 2414 via CPU 2412 and corresponding zone controllers 2420 will automatically be routed to the station or stations selected by the staff members or to stations in locations where that staff member or other staff members are determined to be present by staff locator system 2428 (shown in FIG. 4 and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 07/924,101)., 192703=Badge units which are worn by patients or releasably affixed to a structure which is proximal to the patient as shown in FIG. 39, may include a patient select switch or member 4970 shown in FIG. 36 which facilitates patient control of the environmental facilities within the patient's room and the nurse call function. Preferably, the patient select switch is a normally open pushbutton switch which controls such environmental facilities or the nurse call function via transmitter 4910 of the patient station 2416 and CPU 2412 utilizing the communication techniques described above. Such environmental facilities include, for example, the television 5310, radio, draperies, thermostat 5320 or the room lighting. Selection and control of a particular environmental facility or the nurse control function is dependant upon the number and sequence of button pushes. Data transmissions between the badge unit and the patient station is similar to the infrared data transmissions described above., 157829=FIG. 17 illustrates hardware configurations for the audio portion 4010 of staff station 2418. As shown, audio pair 4012 from an equipment panel (e.g., audio matrix 2510 shown in FIG. 2) is connected to the front end of audio controller 4014. Preferably, the front end of audio controller 4014 includes a coupled 600 ohm balanced transformer 4016 which isolates the internal audio circuitry of staff station 2418 from the external audio circuits. Depending upon whether the audio signal is being received or transmitted, the back end of audio controller 4014 directs the audio signal to staff station speaker 4018 or directs the audio signal from microphone 4020 to audio matrix 2510 via audio controller 4014., 134419=FIG. 12 is a circuit block diagram for the patient station circuitry 3510 installed within patient station 2416. The patient station circuitry 3510 includes microprocessor 3512, such as model 64180 manufactured by Motorola operating at a frequency of 12.888 MHz. via crystal 3514, 96 Kbytes of memory 3516 (e.g., 64 Kbytes of flash ROM and 32 Kbytes of RAM) having stored programs, e.g., system and application programs. In this exemplary configuration, the data and address buses of the microprocessor are connected to memory, e.g., RAM 3518 and an EPROM 3520. Memory decoder 3522 is utilized to select between RAM 3518 and EPROM 3520 in response to a particular address on the address bus. The address bus is also connected to a pair of latches 3524 and 3526 which interface the microprocessor to status indicators, the fail safe bus.(FSB), the audio control circuitry, and to switches and other peripheral equipment connected to the patient station, as shown. In addition, I/O decoder 3528 is utilized to select between either latch in response to a particular address on the address bus. Incoming signals from the above noted peripheral equipment are received by buffer 3530 and then transferred to the data-bus upon being enabled by I/O decoder 3528., 128346=Preferably, communication interface 3320 and communication ports 3322,are provided to facilitate data communication between zohe controller 2420, CPU 2412 and the nurse control station 2414. As noted above, the preferred communication protocol includes the RS-485 serial communication protocol. Accordingly, communication interface 3320 is configured to accommodate RS-485 communication utilizing RS-485 drivers/receivers which are known in the art., 143780=Reception of the message frame in the CPU causes the CPU to begin the station task identified in the INFORMATION field of the I-frame (step 3850), to determine the message received from the patient station and provide an appropriate response thereto (steps 3860 and 3870). For this example, CPU 2412 is responding to the activation of nurse call button 3250 of patient control unit 3210. The initial response to the activation of the nurse control button is to return a message frame to the patient station to activate nurse call indicator 3222 of indicator assembly 3220 (shown in FIG. 9). In addition, the CPU prioritizes the message frame utilizing the transition priority data of the PATH field and then sends to the nurse control station or stations connected in the group associated with the patient station, a message frame including tone and display data identifying the patient and the associated room number (steps 3880 and 3890). At this point, the station task is completed and the CPU returns to the listen task. Manual reset of the patient station by a responding staff member deactivates indicator 3222 and clears the message from the nurse control station display., 120637=In the event of a failure within the CPU 2412, the system of the present invention also provides a fail safe feature which is activated upon detection by the nurse control stations 2414, the patient stations 2416 and/or staff stations 2418. An exemplary embodiment of the configuration for fail safe operation is shown in FIG. 7. In this configuration, fail safe bus (FSB) 3020 is connected between each patient station 2416, each corresponding staff station 2418 and zone indicator assembly 3022. If a failure occurs in the CPU 2412, each patient station 2416 and corresponding staff station 2418 will fail to receive a polling signal from their corresponding zone controllers, As a result, each station will operate in a local mode utilizing the fail safe bus. When in the local mode, activation of any of the functions which have access to the fail safe bus will cause a response at a particular patient station, the staff stations and at the zone indicator assembly connected to the group, to allow staff members in the vicinity of the station utilizing the fail safe bus to respond., 148091=Code blue switch 3234 and emergency code switch 3232 are connected to patient station 2416 via data links 3264 and 3266, respectively, as shown in FIG. 9, and are provided to allow staff members to initiate code blue or emergency responses directly from the patient's room. As noted above, code blue and/or emergency code procedures may also be initiated from nurse control station 2414. Initiation of the code blue response procedure at a patient station 2416 will result in the following occurrences. Initially the code blue data signal received from the code blue switch is stored in the patient station memory as a message frame, in a manner described above. The microprocessor 3512 (shown in FIG. 12) in the patient station 2416 then waits to be polled from the zone controller 2420 before transferring the data to the zone controller. Once polled by zone controller 2420 the message frame is transmitted to the zone controller and stored in the S-RAM 2512 until the S-RAM is polled by CPU 2412. Once the message frame is received within the CPU the message frame is prioritized and the station task associated with the data within the INFORMATION field of the message frame is initiated., 81354=A communication interface and communication ports are provided to facilitate communication between zone controller 2420, CPU 2412 and slave devices, such as patient station 2416, staff station 2418 and/or nurse control station 2414. The communication protocol may be any known serial communication protocol, such as RS-232 or RS-485. The RS-485 protocol is preferred in the embodiment according to the present invention. Accordingly,.the communication interface is configured to accommodate RS-485 communication utilizing RS-485 drivers/receivers which are known in the 1art. Each zone controller 2420 also includes a watchdog circuit which operates similarly to the watchdog circuit in CPU 2412. Thus, the watchdog circuit prevents the microcontroller from locking-up if the watchdog circuit is not polled at the predetermined time interval, preferably 300 msec., by the microcontroller.}",
