Due to this, as IC chip driving frequency increases, the chip capacitor cannot exhibit sufficient effect even if the chip capacitor is mounted on the surface of the printed circuit board. Considering this, the applicant of the present invention proposed a technique, identified as Japanese Patent Application No. 11-248311, for forming a concave portion on a core substrate so as to contain therein a chip capacitor. Techniques for embedding a capacitor in a substrate are disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Application Publication (to be referred to as \u201cPublication\u201d herein after) Nos. 6-326472, 7-263619, 10-256429, 11-45955, 11-126978, 11-312868 and the like., 354042=In the Steam test, a humidity of 100% was maintained by applying steam. In the HAST test, the chip capacitor was left at a relative humidity of 100%, an applied voltage of 1.3 V and a temperature of 121\ufffd C. for 100 hours. In the TS test, tests for leaving the capacitor at \u2212125\ufffd C. for 30 minutes and 55\ufffd C. for 30 minutes were repeated 1000 times., 46321=This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120 from U.S. Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Moreover, because of the via holes, even if the via holes are formed in the inter layer resin insulating layers and positional errors occur to the via holes, the allowance is wide. Thus, electrical connection characteristics can be ensured. With the constitution of the fourth embodiment, the via holes in the fourth embodiment are formed between the conductor circuits and the capacitors. Due to this, it is possible to maintain desired performance without delaying operation due to lack of power supply and no problems arose even if a reliability test was conducted. As a result of the above-stated reliability test, it was discovered that the printed circuit board including the chip capacitor(s) therein can attain equivalent reliability to that of the existing capacitor surface mount type. Further, as a result of the TS test, it was discovered that even if an internal stress occurs due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion among the capacitors-made of ceramic, the core substrate made of a resin and the inter layer resin insulating layers, disconnection does not occur between the electrodes of the chip capacitors and the via holes, separation does not occur between the chip capacitors and the inter layer resin insulating layers and cracks do not occur to the inter layer resin insulating layer, whereby high reliability can be attained for a long time.
