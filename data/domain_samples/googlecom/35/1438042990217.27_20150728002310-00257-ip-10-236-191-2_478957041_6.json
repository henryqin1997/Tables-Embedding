A typical microphone, now shown, adapted for use in detecting K'orotkoff sounds may be placed on the organism such as on the brachial artery of a human. As is well known, the microphone converts the sounds into electrical impulses which are applied through an amplifier 101 and a signal processor 102 to a pair of voltage comparators 103 and 104. The specific form of the signal processor 102 is not critical to the present invention but it is designed for eliminating signals which could not result from Korotkoff sounds. For example, the signal processor could be a filter which filters out low frequency signals or it may be adapted to count the zero crossovers between the maximum and minimum peaks of any given signal. For example, in one specific embodiment acceptable sounds were defined by the following criteria: (1) the sound must be between 200 .and 2,000 digital converter unitsabove the background noise; (2) the sound must be within plus or minus 42 milliseconds of a predetermined average lag time after the occurence of a QRS complex in an EKG waveform; (3) the signal resulting from the sound must have one to three zero crossings between its maximal positive and maximal negative peaks. The zero crossings could be detected by the signal processor 102 thereby eliminating any signals not having the proper number of zero crossings. As will be more fully understood below, the amplitude limits and the time window mentioned above are controlled by the apparatus of FIG. 1. For related sets of conditions, see application Ser.
