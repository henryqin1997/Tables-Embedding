At the point 114 in the program, a determination is made as to whether or not there exists a noise-sound signal exceeding a predetermined level. If the answer to this question is \"yes\", then it means that the receiver unit 70 has received the command signal transmitted from the mobile transmitter 40 and the program proceeds to the point 116 where a command is produced to display \"OK\" on the display 79 to indicate that the mobile transmitter 40 operates in order. Otherwise, the program proceeds to another determination step at the point 118. This determination is as to whether or not the timer is timed out. If the answer to this question is \"yes\", then it means that a predetermined time T1, for example, 60 seconds, has elapsed for noise sound detection and the program proceeds to the point 120. Otherwise, the program is returned to the point 114. At the point 120 in the program, a command is produced to display \"NG\" on the display 79 to indicate that the mobile transmitter 40 is subject to failure. Following this, the program proceeds to the end point 122. FIG. 5 is a flow diagram showing",
