It will be obvious that variations and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. Also, singular used in the application can also mean plural of the same ingredient unless otherwise indicated. Also, improving means increasing unless otherwise indicated. In addition to the coated particulates, the cosmetic compositions can also include one or more of the following: a chelating agent, an emollient, an emulsifier, a film former, a fragrance, a humectant, a plasticizer, a preservative, a resin, a retinoid, a skin penetration enhancer, a solvent, a stabilizer, a sunscreen, a surfactant, a thickener, a vitamin and a wax. Thus, fluorosilane coated particulates, such as pigments, fillers or a combination of pigments and fillers, of the present invention in a cosmetic composition improve wear resistance and water proofing properties of blush, powder and lip cosmetics. In a face powder, it improves the color drift over time. A moisturizer of the present invention can be prepared by dispersing particulates, such as pigments and/or fillers, coated with fluorosilane into a slurry and thereafter adding the slurry to a moisturizer formulation. The coated particulates of the present invention when added to the moisturizer vehicle causes the formation of an oil and water repellent film, which produces a moisturizer that displays reduced oil",
