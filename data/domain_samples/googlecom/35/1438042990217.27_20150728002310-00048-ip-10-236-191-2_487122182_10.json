Although one or more embodiments of the invention have been described, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that numerous modifications could be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the disclosed invention. As such, it should be understood that all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention. The written description and drawings illustrate the present invention, and are not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed. [0106] One of the benefits of the present invention is the ability to precisely control the elevation of the lens center with respect to the corneal surface. In CRT, the center of the lens may contact the central cornea, but some situations exist where one wishes to minimize or eliminate this contact. In normal rigid lenses, this control is obviated by the use of base curves that mimic the corneal surface, and thus no change arises as a result of the contact. But in some situations, it is desirable to have a different geometry on the base curve. Presbyopic lenses with multiple curves are a case in point, though other situations also exist. Being able to support a lens off of the corneal surface can make many new base curve",
