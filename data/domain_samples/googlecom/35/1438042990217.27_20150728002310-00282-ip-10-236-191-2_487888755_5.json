Although the components used during circuit interrupting and device reset operations as described above are electromechanical in nature, the present application also contemplates using electrical components, such as solid state switches and supporting circuitry, as well as other types of components capable of making and breaking electrical continuity in the conductive path. , the contacts 60, 80 of the receptacle and the contacts 36, 40 of the load are connected together and they, in turn, are connected to the line contacts 34, 38 only when the GFCI is in a no fault state. Under normal operating conditions when the line does not have a fault, current flow is from the line contacts through the GFCI to the load contacts 36, 40 and to the receptacle contacts 60, 80. FIG. 6 , movable contact 62 and fixed contact 66 are eliminated and lead 61 from receptacle contact 60 is connected at point 39 directly to lead 37 which connects contact 36 to contact 56.
