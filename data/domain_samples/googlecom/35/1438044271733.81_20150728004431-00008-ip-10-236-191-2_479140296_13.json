Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto. It should be understood that the programs, processes, and methods described herein are not related or limited to any particular type of computer apparatus, unless indicated otherwise. Various types of general purpose or specialized computer apparatus may be used with or perform operations in accordance with the teachings described herein. Since hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and other protocols used with URLs for the Internet and other computer networks typically do not provide any state information or object type checking, Remote Automation is used to provide state information and object type checking for network client object oriented applications which need to access remote object information. Since Remote Automation uses RPC, which provides data authentication, data encryption/decryption and access control, Remote Automation also provides the ability for a network client object oriented application to use a secure, two-way communications path to complete a remote object reference without building in additional security features.",
