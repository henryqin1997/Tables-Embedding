    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51723=The cyanine and related dyes offer an important advantage over existing fluorescent labeling reagents. First, cyanine and related dyes have been synthesized that absorb and emit in a region of the spectrum ranging from 400 to nearly 1100 nm. Thus reactive derivatives of these dyes can be made for assays that require simultaneous measurement of a number of labeled materials. Multicolor (or multiparameter) analysis of this sort may be desirable for the sake of simplicity, cost effectiveness, or for determining ratios of different labeled species on each particle in a complex mixture of particles (e.g., ratios of antigen markers on individual blood cells in a complex mixture by multiparameter flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy). Second, many cyanine and related dyes strongly absorb and fluoresce light. Third, many cyanine and related dyes are relatively photostable and do not rapidly bleach under the fluorescence microscope. Fourth, cyanine and related dye derivatives can be made which are simple and effective coupling reagents. Fifth, many structures and synthetic procedures are available and the class of dyes is versatile. Therefore, many structural modifications can be made to make the reagents more or less water soluble. Their charge can be changed so they will not perturb the molecule to which they are attached and so nonspecific binding can be reduced. Sixth, unlike the phycobiliproteins the cyanine type dyes are relatively small molecular weight=1,000) so they don't sterically interfere appreciably with the ability of the labeled molecule to reach its binding sight or carry out its function., 76792=To 1 mg of sheep anti-mouse-IgG antibody in 250 ul of 0.1M sodium carbonate/bicarbonate (pH 9.2) was added 10 ul of dye solution (4.42 mg/ml dimethylsulfoxide), giving a molar ratio of dye: protein of 10:1. The reaction mixture was stirred at 22 degrees C. for 2 hours, then passed over a Sephadex G-15 desalting column (2.5 ml bed volume), preconditioned with phosphate buffered saline. The dye-conjugated protein obtained from the column had an apparent ratio of about 5 dyes/protein. Other reactive cyanine dyes bearing N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, isothiocyanate, or dichlorotriazine groups were attached to antibody molecules by essentially the same procedure., 41601=This invention also relates to the luminescent (fluorescent or phosphorescent) cyanine, merocyanine, styryl and oxonol dyes themselves that can be covalently linked to biological and non-biological materials. Merocyanine, styryl and oxonol dyes are considered to be related to cyanine dyes for purposes of this invention. The new labeling reagents themselves, but more particularly when conjugated to a labeled component, can be excited by light of first defined wavelengths, e.g. by light in wavelength regions of the spectrum ranging from 450 nm to 900 nm. Background fluorescence of cells generally occurs at a lower wavelength. Therefore, the labeling reagents will distinguish over background fluorescence. Particularly of interest are the derivatives that absorb light at 633 nm since they can be excited by inexpensive, intense, stable, long-life, HeNe laser sources. Light of second defined wavelengths that is fluoresced or phosphoresced by the labeled component can then be detected. The fluoresced or phosphoresced light generally has a greater wavelength than the excitation light. The detection step can employ a luminescence microscope having a filter for absorption of scattered light of the excitation wavelength and for passing the wavelength that corresponds to the luminescence corresponding to the particular dye label used with the specimen. Such an optical microscope is described in Ser. No. 711,065, filed Mar. 12, 1985., 44008=Luminescent probes are valuable reagents for the analysis and separation of molecules and cells and for the detection and quantification of other material. A very small number of luminescent molecules can be detected under optimal circumstances. Barak and Webb visualized fewer than 50 fluorescent lipid analogs associated with the LDL reception of cells using a SIT camera, J. Cell Biol. 90:595-604 (1981). Flow cytometry can be used to detect fewer than 10,000 fluorescein molecules associated with particles or certain cells (Muirhead, Horan and Poste, Bio/Technology 3:337-356 (1985). Some specific examples of application of fluorescent probes are (1) identification and separation of subpopulations of cells in a mixture of cells by the techniques of fluorescence flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy; (2) determination of the concentration of a substance that binds to a second species (e.g., antigen-antibody reactions) in the technique of fluorescence immunoassay; (3) localization of substances in gels and other insoluble supports by the techniques of fluorescence staining. These techniques are described by Herzenberg et al., \"Cellular Immunology,\" 3rd ed., chapt 22; Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1978 (fluorescence-activated cell sorting); and by Goldman, \"Fluorescence Antibody Methods,\" Academic Press, New York, 1968 (fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence staining); and in Applications of Fluorescence in the Biomedical Sciences, ed. Taylor et al., Alan Liss Inc., 1986., 25179=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 06/854,347 filed on Apr. 18, 1986 International Application filed on now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Freshly isolated peripheral lymphocytes were treated at zero degrees for 30 minutes with mouse anti-Beta2-microglobulin (0.25 ug/10**6 cells). The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium buffer and were then treated with dye IV-labeled sheep anti-mouse-IgG antibody (lug per 10**6 cells). After a 30 minute incubation at 0 degrees C., the excess antibody was removed and the cells were again washed twice with DMEM buffer. Aliquots of the cells were fixed on slides for analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Under the microscope the stained lymphocytes on the slide were excited with light at 705-740 nm and the fluorescence at 750-805 nm was detected with a COHU red sensitive intensified television camera attached to an image digitizer and television monitor. The cells stained by this method showed fluorescence under the microscope. In a control experiment, use of the primary mouse anti-B2 -microglobulin antibody was omitted but the staining and analysis was otherwise carried out as described above. The control sample showed no fluorescence under the microscope indicating that dye IV-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody does not give significant non-specific binding to lymphocytes.
