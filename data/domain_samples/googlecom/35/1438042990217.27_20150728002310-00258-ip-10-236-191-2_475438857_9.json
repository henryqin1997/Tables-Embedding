The peak magnetic flux density (B) 30 is preferably in the range of 0.9-1.8 milliTesla (mT) (9-18 Gauss), and more preferably approximately 1.5 mT, which is reached during the positive portion of the signal as shown in the drawing. The magnetic field is substantially unipolar in that it has little or no negative portion. Such a signal may be generated with, for example, an EBI Model 2001 Bone Healing System signal generator coupled to an EBI FLX\ufffd 1-2 or 2-2 flexible treatment coil. It will be understood that \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d are relative terms. Other signals which may be suitable for particular applications are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,105,017, 4,266,533 and 4,315,503 to Ryaby et al., which patents are hereby incorporated by reference. A PEMF signal as described above is preferably applied for 2-12 hours per day, and more preferably approximately 8 hours per day as adjunctive therapy until the wound is healed.}",

The patients received the same standard of care before and after PEMF administration. FIG. 5 A study using the 72 Hz repetitive single pulse PEMF signal described above was conducted in which human patients having ulcers on the medial surface of the foot were treated for 8-10 hours per day for up to 70 days. The results are as shown in The diabetic mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, PEMF: 60% vs. control: 78%, p<0.05) and day 14 (PEMF: 21% vs. control: 55%, p<0.05). Because wild-type mice heal twice as fast as diabetics, wounds were analyzed on days 4 and 8. Accelerated closure was evident in PEMF wild-type mice at day 4 (PEMF: 15% vs. 42%, p<0.05) and day 8 (8% vs. 28%, p<0.05). In wound bed histological sections, granulation and cell",
