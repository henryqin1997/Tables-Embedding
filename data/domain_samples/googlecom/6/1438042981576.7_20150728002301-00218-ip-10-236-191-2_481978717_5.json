In this manner, a different shaft can be quickly and easily engaged with the same club head 102 and/or a different club head can be quickly and easily engaged with the same shaft 106. Optionally, without departing from the invention, a positioning ferrule and a retaining ring, as illustrated (and not numbered) in FIG. 13, may be included with this connection structure.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{118950=The axial direction change regions 1004 and 1006 in the various structures (e.g., structures 1000 and 1020) may be located at any desired positions along the shafts 1002 and/or 1022 and/or at any desired relative spacing with respect to one another without departing from this invention. In at least some example structures 1000 and/or 1020 according to this invention, at least one of the axial direction change regions 1004 and 1006 (and optionally both) will be located in the lower half of the shaft 1002 and/or 1022 nearer to the club head 102 than to the grip end. In some more specific examples, one or both of the axial direction change regions 1004 and 1006 will be located in the lower quarter of the shaft 1002 and/or 1022 nearest to the club head 102, and even in the lower 10% or 5% of the shaft 1002 and/or 1022 nearest to the club head 102. The axial direction change regions 1004 and 1006 may be separated from one another by at least \ufffd inch, at least 1 inch, at least 2 inches, or even at least 4 inches or more without departing from this invention. The bends or other axial direction change regions 1004 and 1006 may be located a sufficient distance from the end of the shaft 1002 and/or 1022 and/or from one another so as to allow free movement of the securing member 240 or other securing mechanism, if necessary. Alternatively, if desired, the securing member 240 or other securing mechanism may be sized and arranged so as to slip over one or both of the axial direction change regions 1004 and/or 1006, and/or it may be releasable from, removable from, and/or attachable to the shaft 1002 and/or 1022 or other portion of the assembly 104 in another manner., 127420=The shaft engaging member 1220 of this example releasable connection may fit over the end of the shaft 106 and may be secured thereto in any desired manner, e.g., via cements or adhesives; via welding, brazing, soldering, or other fusing techniques; via mechanical connectors; via a friction fit; etc. The securing member 1240 fits over the end of the shaft 106 and is located along the shaft 106 above the shaft engaging member 1220., 127929=Once the securing member 1240 and the shaft engaging member 1220 are engaged with the shaft 106 and the club head engaging member 1200 (optionally including the retaining element 1260) is engaged with the club head 102, the overall connection then may be assembled. This is accomplished in this example connection structure 104 by sliding the shaft engaging member 1220 into the interior chamber of the club head engaging member 1200. As the shaft engaging member 1220 slides through the club head engaging member 1200, the end of the shaft engaging member 1220 will extend into the bottom of the club head engaging member 1200. At this configuration, the rotation-inhibiting structures 1226 of the shaft engaging member 1220 will engage corresponding retaining structure 1206 of the club head engaging member 1200 to thereby prevent the shaft 106 from rotating with respect to the club head 102. The securing member 1240 then slides down the shaft 106, over the upper end of the shaft engaging member 1220, and threadingly engages the club head engaging member 1200. Other releasable mechanical connection systems are possible without departing from this invention. Also, the various steps in this example assembly procedure may be changed, combined, changed in order, etc., without departing from this invention., 124237=While any desired angle may be maintained between the first axial direction 1126 and the second axial direction 1130, in accordance with some examples of this invention, this angle will be between 0.25 degrees and 10 degrees, and in some examples between 0.5 degrees and 8 degrees, between 0.75 degrees and 6 degrees, or even between 1 degree and 4 degrees., 135961=Club heads and releasable and interchangeable connections for golf club heads and shafts in accordance with at least some examples of this invention also may have some or all of the characteristics described in U.S. Pat.
