The coin acceptor and bill validator may receive and validate currency that is stored by the currency storage apparatus. The change dispenser activates the return of coinage from the currency storage apparatus to the customer where appropriate (e.g. where a customer deposits more currency than is required for a given transaction). Such apparatus may feature Multidrop Bus (MDB) and/or Micromech peripheral capabilities, as is known in the art., 29709=(i) U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, in snack machine embodiments, a suitable machine casing may comprise the 129 SnackShop manufactured by Automatic Products International, Ltd. of Saint Paul, Minn., which stands at 72\u2033/1829 mm wide, has a width of 38\u215e\u2033/988 mm, and a depth of 35\u2033/889 mm. Other suitable snack machine casings include the A La Carte\ufffd machine from Automatic Products, and the GPL SnackVendor model #159 from Crane Merchandising Systems/Crane Co. of Stamford, Conn., 29346=(g) U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 11/426,172 filed Jun. 23, 2006, entitled \u201cPRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FOR VENDING A PLURALITY OF PRODUCTS\u201d;, 60957=Further, in some embodiments, an output device comprises a printer. In one embodiment, a printer is configured to print on card stock paper (e.g. 0.06 mm to 0.15 mm thickness), such as the EPSON EU-T400 Series Kiosk Printer. Further, a printer may be capable of thermal line printing of various alphanumeric and graphical symbols in various font sizes (e.g. ranging from 9 to 24 point) on various types of paper. Additionally, such a printer may communicate with a processor (described herein) via an RS232/IEEE 12834 and/or bi-directional parallel connection. Such a printer may further comprise a 4 KB data buffer., 29905=(j) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/877,182, filed Oct. 23, 2007, entitled \u201cPRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FOR VENDING A PLURALITY OF PRODUCTS VIA DEFINED GROUPS\u201d., 28828=(d) U.S. patent application Ser.

Step 500 may include the step of (1) updating one or more inventory records in an inventory database to reflect the vending of products (i.e. the quantity available of products sold is decreased to account for sales of units of the products), and/or (2) updating an acceptance or sales rate associated with a product or products to reflect the sale of a product or products (e.g., recording the units sold, the time of the sale and/or the date of the sale). Following the ongoing example, assuming that a customer on Jun. 25, 2003 purchased, for a $1.00 package price, one can of Diet Coke\ufffd and one package of Double-Mint\ufffd gum, then the above inventory database would be updated to reflect that five units of Diet Coke\ufffd and seventeen units of Double-Mint\ufffd gum remain in inventory and available for sale. Likewise, the actual sales rates of Diet Coke\ufffd would be updated from 1.2/day to 1.3/day; the actual sales rate of Double-Mint\ufffd gum would be updated from 2.2/day to 2.3/day. Thus, through the package promotion, Diet Coke\ufffd would have reached its ideal sales rate of 1.3/day, and the actual sales rate of Double-Mint\ufffd gum would have moved significantly closer to its ideal sales rate of 2.6/day., 29001=(e) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/426,163, filed Jun. 23, 2006, entitled \u201cPRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FOR VENDING A PLURALITY OF PRODUCTS\u201d;, 116756=The exemplary data in the above inventory database assumes that the beginning of the fill period was Jun. 15, 2003, and that the current date is Jun. 25, 2003 (i.e. 10 days into the fill period). Further, the exemplary data in the above inventory database will be referred to throughout the remaining discussion of this process to illustrate steps of the example proactive inventory grouping embodiment in which the value rating of individual products are considered. For the purpose of this ongoing example, it shall be assumed that a package offer to a customer will define two products which may be purchased together for $1.00, in which one product is included in a first (\u201cgreen\u201d) inventory group, and one product is included in a second (\u201cred\u201d) inventory group., 29518=(h) U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 10/902,347, filed Jul. 29, 2004, entitled \u201cPRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FOR VENDING A PLURALITY OF PRODUCTS VIA DEFINED GROUPS\u201d; which claims the benefit of priority of the following provisional patent applications:}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In such embodiments, a vending machine may be configured to dispense two (or more) products from a first row for a single price, while dispensing only one product from a second row for a single price. Alternatively, every row in a vending machine may be configured as a \u201cpackage offer\u201d row. A package offer row may be stocked with alternating types of products. For example, a Snickers\ufffd candy bar may be followed by a Milky Way\ufffd candy bar, which is followed by a Snickers\ufffd candy bar, and so on. Thus, purchasing from such a package offer row can allow diverse combinations of products (e.g., \u201cA2\u201d may correspond to a package offer row which provides one unit of Snickers\ufffd candy bar and one unit of Milky Way\ufffd candy bar for $1.00). In an embodiment, a vending machine may be configured dispense two (or more) products from a particular row or other particular location for a single price. Thus, a row of a vending machine may be designated as a \u201cpackage offer\u201d row, and the vending machine may be configured to consecutively dispense, from such a row, units of two (or more) products upon tender of a package price and selection of a corresponding row identifier (e.g. \u201cA1\u201d may correspond to a package offer row which provides two units of Snickers\ufffd candy bars for $1.00). Further, such \u201cpackage offer\u201d rows may be configured to prevent",
