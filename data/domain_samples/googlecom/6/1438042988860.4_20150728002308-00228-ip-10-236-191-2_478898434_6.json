    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20081=It is important for an SS receiver to perform initial acquisition of a de-spread code phase used for demodulation and hold it thereafter. In order to facilitate such synchronous acquisition, or synchronous tracking, a digital cellular system of a CDMA scheme, standardized in July 1993 in North America (TIA.IS-95), uses a scheme of adding a pilot signal to a data signal and transmitting the resultant signal from a base station to a mobile station. A plurality of different base stations use the same frequency, and the phases of the spread codes of the pilot signals used among the respective base stations are shifted from each other by several tens to several millions, of chips, thereby allowing identification of each base station. Signals transmitted from different base stations can therefore be demodulated by changing the phase of a de-spread sequence to be multiplied by a correlation demodulator in a receiver. In addition, propagation delay path, variations of received power due to Rayleigh fading caused by movement of a receiver, and soft handoff (soft handover) like simultaneous reception from different base stations, can be realized when performing RAKE synthesizing demodulation, i.e., independently performing de-spread demodulation of data signals by using different de-spread code phases, performing phase matching of the resultant outputs, weighting the outputs with predetermined weighting factors, synthesizing the outputs, and outputting the resultant data.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations According to the arrangement which has a threshold setting means for setting a threshold on the basis of a previously extracted correlation result, designed to extract a correlation result which exceeds this threshold and is larger than the preceding and succeeding output correlation results, and causes the search processing section to process the extracted correlation result, even further reductions in overall processing amount and power consumption can be attained. In addition, since the majority of the correlation results of all code phases cannot be peak values, the number of correlation results processed by the search processing section can be greatly reduced. Therefore, even in consideration of an increase in the amount of processing performed by the search processing control section, the total processing amount can be reduced, leading to a reduction in the overall power consumption of the receiver. As has been described above, according to the present invention, from correlation results sequentially output from the search correlator, a correlation result larger than the correlation results of the adjacent code phases is extracted as a peak value correlation result. A plurality of correlation results are obtained from correlation results extracted in this manner in the order of decreasing values, thereby detecting a plurality of de-spread code phases used for demodulation. With this operation, of signal components in a received signal which have arrived at different timings, signal components having large power values can be searched out.",
