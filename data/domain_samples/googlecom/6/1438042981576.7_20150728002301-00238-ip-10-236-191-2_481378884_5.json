He can now write program code 92 in such a way that the data that are to appear in the report are written into the correct fields of the format table 93 at runtime. These data are then supplied to the runtime mode 98 of the report via the data path 95 and can thus be correctly output in the report 98. , the reference characters have the following meanings. 92 is a the program code of an automation module. 93 is a format table. 94 is a data path to the configuration of the format table. 95 is a data path for data that are to be output in the report. 96 is the separation between the automation module (above) and the report (below). 97 is the development mode of the report. 98 is the runtime mode of the report. The format table 93 serves as data interface between an automation module and its corresponding report 97, 98. A report is made up of the two parts; that is, the development mode 97 and the runtime mode 98. At runtime, data are written into the individual fields of the format table 93 by the program code 92 of an automation module. The report takes data from the format table 93 and writes them",
