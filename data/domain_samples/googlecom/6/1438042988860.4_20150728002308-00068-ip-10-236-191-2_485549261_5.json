    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 10 illustrates a further embodiment, in which an adhesive bond 3 is comprised of an epoxy resin-based adhesive 4 and short carbon fibers 12 incorporated in the adhesive 4. The fiber volume fraction of the short fibers 12 is set in the same way as in the case when the above-described woven fabric 6 is used. With the inclined slits 7 made in the torque detecting element 2 as described above, when the induced voltage in a section 2a between the adjacent slits 7 in the torque detecting element 2 is measured, an electrical influence from a section 2b adjacent that section 2a can be intercepted by the inclined slit 7, thereby improving the measuring accuracy. The induced voltage varies due to a variation in permeability of the torque detecting element 2 and thus the magnitude of a tensile strain introduced into the torque detecting element 2 by the torque T of the rotating shaft 1. Thereupon, if the relationship between the permeability and the torque T has been previously examined, the magnitude of the torque can be determined by measuring the induced voltage. In measuring the torque T, an exciting coil 8 is placed substantially vertically in proximity to a central portion of the torque detecting element 2, and a pair of detecting coils 91 and 92 are placed substantially vertically in proximity to opposite sides of the torque detecting element 2.
