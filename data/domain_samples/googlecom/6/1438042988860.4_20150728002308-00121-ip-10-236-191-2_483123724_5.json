    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by As set forth above, the present invention replaces wire bonding with flip chip bonding to simplify the overall structure as well as facilitate its fabrication process, and utilizes the insulation layer provided with the electrodes for flip chip bonding to realize the large-sized heat radiation member thereby remarkably enhancing heat radiation effect. While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments and the accompanying drawings, it is not to be limited thereto but will be defined by the appended claims. It is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art can substitute, change or modify the embodiments into various forms without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. The heat radiation member 76 formed in the lower board 71 has a roughened face. Since the heat radiation member 76 of the invention has a large sectional area, there is a risk that it may escape out of the lower board 71. In order to prevent undesired escape, at least one face of the heat radiation member may be roughened horizontally. Alternatively, if the lower board is of a plurality of sheets or layers, the heat radiation member may be roughened vertically by imparting different sizes of cavity regions to the respective sheets and filling metal paste into the cavity regions. b FIG.",
