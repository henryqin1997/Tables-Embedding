The polymer solution was azeotropically dried for two hours under reflux in an oil bath, the temperature of which was maintained at 140\ufffd C. All the solvent was distilled off and the product was dried under vacuo. The dried PEG was reweighed, dissolved in 5 mL of methylene chloride and stirred under argon. An equimolar amount of glutamic acid, the N-terminal of which was protected by a benzylcarbamate functional group (Sigma) was added. Four times this amount of diisopropylcarbodiimide (Aldrich) and four times this amount of dimethylaminopyridinium toluene sulfonate (Aldrich) were added. The reaction mixture was heated slightly to dissolve the glutamic acid. The reaction was allowed to run for 24 hours at room temperature with stirring. A urea precipitate formed that was removed by filtration, and the product was precipitated by cold ether, filtered and dried under vacuum. About 1.6 g of polymer was recovered, which was purified by reprecipitation from isopropanol. TLC in a 5:5:1 ratio solution of toluene to acetic acid to water showed the absence of free glutamic acid., 146849=Example 9 was repeated at pH's of 7.2 and 8.5, reaction times of 1.5 and 3 hours, and polymer to drug ratios of 1:1. The mole-percent degree of drug attachment was determined by iodometric assay, which method measures only the active drug. As shown in Table I, the greatest degree of drug attachment was obtained with the conditions of Example 9, namely, a reaction time of 1 hour, a pH of 7.5 and a ratio of polymer to drug of 1:2., 118264=The preparation of the ionically conductive materials utilizes an organic solvent in which the polymer and the alkali metal electrolyte salt are soluble, such as acetonitrile. The ratio of polymer to electrolyte salt should be between about 2:1 and about 10:1 and preferably about 4:1. The total solution concentration (w/v%) of both compounds combined is between about 1 percent and about 25 percent, and preferably about 10 percent, depending upon the solubility of the materials. The polymer and electrolyte salt are dissolved in the solvent, which may be heated slightly to dissolve the materials. The mixture is cast into the desired form, and the solvent is removed by drying, first in air and then under vacuum. The mixture may be heated to remove the solvent., 159915=A 10 percent solution in freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran was prepared of a mixture of lithium triflat (Aldrich) and the poly(PEG-Lys-OEt), prepared according to the procedure described in Example 2, in a polymer-electrolyte ratio of 4:1 by weight. The polymer had a weight-average molecular weight of 140,000 daltons. A film was cast from the solution as described above with respect to Example 16. A sticky film was obtained that was scraped from the glass plates, dried under high vacuum, and pressed into pellets at a pressure of 0.15 ton and a temperature of 27.C. This resulted in the formation of clear pellets., 143740=In a 100 mL three-necked flask, 1.21 g (0.55 mmol) of the poly(PEG-Lys) of Example 3 was dissolved in 80 mL of water. To this solution was added 0.37 mL (5.5 mmol) of ethylene diamine (Aldrich). The pH was adjusted to 4.75 by the addition of 1 N HCl. Then 1.05 g (5.5 mmol) of solid 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl-3-ethylcarbodiimide) was added. The pH had a tendency to increase, but was maintained around 4.75 by the addition of 1 N HCl. After 30 minutes, no further increase in pH was observed. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and then made basic and extracted into methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated to a viscous syrup and precipitated with cold ether. About 0.725 g of crude poly(PEG-Lys) having ethylamine pendant functional groups was recovered, which was purified by reprecipitation with isopropanol. TLC in a 2:1 solution of ethanol to ammonia showed absence of free diamine., 25196=Attention has also focused upon the conjugation of PEG with therapeutic drugs. Gnanov et als., Macromolecules, 17, 945-52 (1984) observed that the attachment of PEG to various drugs led to prolonged pharmacological activity., 134600=The preparation of PEG-bis Succinimidyl Carbonate is disclosed in the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 340,928 by Zalipsky. In a 250 mL round-bottomed flask, 10 g (10 mmols of hydroxyl groups) of PEG 2000 (Fluka) was dissolved in 120 mL of toluene and the polymer solution was azeotropically dried for two hours under reflux using a Dean-Stark trap. The polymer solution was then cooled to 25\ufffd C. and 15 mL (29 mmol) of a 20 percent solution of phosgene in toluene (1.93 M) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25\ufffd C. overnight and then evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator (water bath temperature maintained at 40\ufffd C.). Another 100 mL of toluene was added and evaporated to remove all traces of phosgene. To the polymeric chloroformate was added 30 mL of dry toluene, 10 mL of methylene chloride, and 1.7 g (14.8 mmol) of N-hydroxy succinimide, and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The reaction flask was then cooled in an ice water bath and 1.5 g (14.9 mmol) of triethylamine was added gradually. Immediate precipitation of triethylamine hydrochloride was seen. The cooling bath was removed and the stirring continued at 25\ufffd C. for five hours. Then 10 mL of toluene was added and the reaction mixture cooled to 4\ufffd C. to maximize the triethylamine hydrochloride precipitation., 144966=The procedure of Example 7 was followed substituting 5.5 mmol of hexamethylene diamine (Aldrich) for the 5.5 mmol of the ethylene diamine. Upon purification of the product, TLC in a 2:1 ratio ethanol to ammonia solution showed absence of free diamine., 77960=The preferred activated form of the poly(alkylene oxide) is the succinimidyl carbonate prepared by reacting the terminal hydroxyl groups of the poly(alkylene oxide) with phosgene to form the chloroformate, which is then reacted with N-hydroxy succinimide to form the succinimidyl carbonate. The preparation of poly(alkylene oxide) succinimidyl carbonates is described in co-pending U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 340,928 by Zalipsky, filed Apr. 19, 1989, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto., 23241=This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/549,494, filed Jul. 6, 1990, abandoned, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto., 25440=As disclosed in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337, the conjugation of PEG begins with functionalization of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polymer prior to coupling with a ligand of biological relevance, although some ligands are capable of covalently bonding to the terminal hydroxyl groups without functionalization. The foregoing is also disclosed in Zalipsky et al., J. Macromol. Sci-Chem., A21, 839-845 (1984); and Zalipsky et al., Eur. Polym. J., 19, 1177-1183 (1983). One of the limitations of PEG is that it has only two reactive end groups available for functionalization. This is a particularly severe design limitation for PEG chains of high molecular weight which contain only a very small number of reactive groups for any given weight of polymer. To circumvent this problem, several reaction schemes have been disclosed in which PEG chains were copolymerized with a variety of difunctional co-monomers. For example, Graham et al., Makromol. Chem. Macromol. Symp., 19, 255-73 (1988) and Imai et als., Makromol. Chem. Rapid. Commun., 5, 47-51 (1984) disclose copolymers of poly(oxyethylene) dicarboxylic acids with aliphatic and aromatic amines. Block copolymers of PEG with polyesters are disclosed by Wang et als., J. Macromol Sci-Chem., A26(2&3), 505-18 (1989). Block copolymers of PEG with poly(L-proline) are disclosed by Jeon et als., J. Polym. Sci. Part A Polym. Chem., 27, 1721-30 (1989). Block copolymers of PEG with poly(gamma-benzyl L-glutamate) are disclosed by Cho et al., Makromol. Chem., 191, 981-91 (1990). In these references, the use of the PEG block copolymers as biomaterials is suggested. Polyethylene glycols, cross-linked by copolymerization with triols and diisocyanates for use in the preparation of hydrogels and hydrogel membranes are disclosed by Kimura et als., Macromolecules, 16, 1024-6 (1983), Ouchi et als., J. Macromol. Sc.-Chem., A24(9), 1011-32 (1987), and Bos et al., Acta Pharm Technol., 33(3), 120-5 (1987). The hydrogel and hydrogel membranes have been investigated as potential materials for controlled drug delivery. However, none of the above-disclosed PEG copolymers have the desirable structural feature of having multiple functional groups at regular, predetermined intervals that can be utilized for drug attachment or cross-linking reactions., 145414=In a 25 mL round-bottomed flask, 0.1523 g of cephradine (0.436 mmoles) (Sigma) was dissolved in a mixture of 4.5 mL water and 2 mL of dioxane. To this solution, 0.500 g of the activated poly(PEG-Lys) of Example 4 (0.218 mmoles) was added. This was followed by the addition of 0.055 g of NaHCO3. The solution was stirred at room temperature. The pH of the reaction was monitored and was found to remain in the narrow range from about 7.0 to 7.5. The reaction mixture was neutralized after one hour by adding a few drops at 0.1 N HCl and extracted into methylene chloride. The extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The polymer was then precipitated with cold ether. After cooling for several hours, the product was collected on a Buchner funnel, washed with cold ether and dried under vacuum overnight. The recovery was 0.355 g, or 71 percent., 149728=Acyclovir succinate is prepared by heating a solution of 0.2252 g of acyclovir (1 mmol) (Sigma), 0.200 g of succinic anhydride (2 mmoles) (Aldrich) and 0.14 mL of triethylamine in 15 mL of dry dimethylformamide at 60\ufffd C. in an oil bath for 21 hours. The solution was then cooled and the volatile constituents were evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was taken up in 8 mL of ice water and acidified to pH 2 with 2 N HCl. A white precipitate was formed that was collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with ice water and dried in vacuo over P2 O5 at 40\ufffd C. to yield 0.180 g (54 percent) of the product. The ester was then recrystallized from methanol and characterized by IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy., 136654=In a 500 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer was dissolved 1.1 g (4.4 mmol. of lysine ether ester hydrochloride salt (Fluka) and 1.7 g (21 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate in 100 mL of water. The PEG-N-hydroxy succinimide-dicarbonate of Example 1 (10 g, 4.4 meq) was dissolved in 200 mL of methylene chloride and added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred vigorously (about 1100 rpm) for two hours and then acidified to about pH 2. The two phases were separated and the organic phase was washed twice with NaCl. The organic layer was then dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The polymer was precipitated using cold ether, cooled to 4\ufffd C. and filtered to recover 6.7 g (67 percent) of the polymer., 106372=The pendent acyl hydrazine groups of the polymer react with the aldehyde and ketone to form a hydrazaone or with the carboxylic acid group of the pharmaceutically active compound to form a diacyl hydrazide linkage. Hydrazaones can be formed with aldehyde or ketone containing drugs (adriamycine, testosterone) or when aldehydes or ketones are introduced (e.g., by oxidation of carbohydrate residues of glycopeptides such as disclosed by the co-pending U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 673,696 by Zalipsky et als, filed Mar. 15, 1991, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto). The work-up and isolation of the polymer product is the same as described above with respect to the first mode of drug conjugation., 142373=In a 50 mL round-bottomed flask, 0.400 g (0.1819 mmol) of the poly(PEG-Lys) of Example 3 was dissolved in 40 mL of water. To this solution was added 0.1 mL (1.656 mmol) of ethanol amine (Aldrich). The pH was adjusted to 4.75 by the addition of 0.1 N HCl. Then 0.348 g (1.82 mmol) of solid 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl-3-ethylcarbodiimide) (Sigma) was added. The pH had a tendency to increase, but was maintained around 4.75 by the addition of 1 N HCl. After 30 minutes, no further increase in pH was observed. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and then acidified and extracted into methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated to a viscous syrup and precipitated with cold ether. About 0.318 g of crude poly(PEG-Lys) with ethanol amide pendant functional groups was recovered. The crude product was purified by reprecipitation from isopropanol, followed by washings with hexane and complete drying in vacuo. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a 4:1 ratio solution of ethanol to ammonia showed an absence of free ethanol amine., 150483=In a 10 mL round-bottomed flask, 0.287 g (0.133 mmol) of the poly(PEG-Lys) having acyl hydrazine pendant functional groups of Example 5 and 0.036 g (0.111 mmol) of the acyclovir succinate were dissolved in 5 mL of anhydrous pyridine. The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice water bath and then 0.025 g (0.121 mmol) of DCC was added. After initial cooling for about one hour, the reaction was allowed to stir for almost three days at room temperature. The dicyclohexyl urea that precipitated was removed by filtration and the product was transferred to a separatory funnel to which 10 mL of water was added and the product was extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried, concentrated and precipitated with ether. About 0.140 g of product was recovered that was purified by extraction with isopropanol. TLC in a 4:1 ratio solution of ethanol to acetic acid showed the absence of free acyclovir succinate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As will be readily appreciated, numerous variations and combinations of the features set forth above can be utilized without departing from the present invention as set forth in the claims. Such variations are not regarded as a departure of the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. The poly(PEG-Lys) membrane cross-linked by diisocyanetohexane was prepared as in Example 16, using 210 mg of the poly(PEG-Lys) of Example 5 having acyl hydrazine functional groups, dissolved in 10 mL of methylene chloride. The free base was formed with sodium bicarbonate, and the solution was then filtered. Prior to the addition of four microliters (3.9 mg) of the hexamethylene disocyanate, 0.47 g of poly(caprolactone) (Union Carbide); (mw 72,000) was added to the filtrate, which was stirred for 30 minutes to dissolve the polymer completely. The poly(PEG-Lys) was cross-linked and films were cast following the procedure described above with respect to Example 16. The resulting membrane was hydrophilic and absorbed water with an equilibrium water content of 36%, whereas film made of poly(caprolactone) alone is hydrophobic.
