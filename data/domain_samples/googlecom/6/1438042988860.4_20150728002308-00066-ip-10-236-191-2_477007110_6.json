It is intended that the patent shall cover, by suitable expression in the appended claims, whatever features of patentable novelty exist in the invention disclosed. The diatomaceous earth 50 can be used with all known seals and spacers in the same manner as adsorbents and desiccants heretofore have been used. No special handling or storage requirements are required for the diatomaceous earth 50. Although the diatomaceous earth 50 has been found to be particularly effective when incorporated in a poly- isobutylene seal, it is not limited to use with such a seal material. Up to 10-15% by weight of the diatomaceous earth 50 can be incorporated as part of the seal, although 1-3% is effective and, therefore, is preferred. In addition to mechanical adsorption, it is believed that the diatoms 52 also may selectively adsorb certain molecules of the off-gases based in whole or in part upon a charge attraction between silicon and/or oxygen atoms that makes up the SiO2 structure of the diatoms 52. It is believed that the low metal content of the diatoms 52, expecially",
