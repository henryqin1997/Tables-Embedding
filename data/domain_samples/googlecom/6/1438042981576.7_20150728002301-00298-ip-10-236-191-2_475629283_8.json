    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced, otherwise than as specifically described herein without departing from the scope of the invention. It is, therefore, to be understood that the scope of the invention be limited only by the appended. As indicated, the present container is set forth, consisting of both a base portion and a lid portion. The container has an outer edge seal, a second edge seal interior to the first seal, and a third seal running along the periphery of the rim, interior to both the first and second seals. These seals are self-reinforcing and will be formed when the lid portion of the container is received by the base. The seals are self-reinforcing in that the engagement of the first seal will urge the second and third seals and ensure the alignment of the lid. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the container may take on an oval, or circular configuration. The critical components of both the lid 1 and base 3 remain substantially identical to those described herein Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 6, it can be seen that the lids 1, and base portions 3, can be easily stacked in nested columns, lid upon lid and base upon base. The lids 1 are stackable since the locking lip",
