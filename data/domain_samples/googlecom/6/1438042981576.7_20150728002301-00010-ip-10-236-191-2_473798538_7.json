    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93197=The modem in which the present invention as preferably, but not necessarily, implemented transmits data at a rate of 19,200 bits per second. The symbol constellation 146 used by the symbol generator 122 of FIG. 2 is shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, with upper two quadrants and lower two quadrants of the complex plane of the constellation 146 being shown, respectively, in FIGS. 3A and 3B. For purposes of illustration, the transmitter 110 uses eight dimensional coded modulation for the main channel data. The average main channel baud rate is 2742.86 symbols per second with 7 bits per baud. The baud rate of the secondary channel at 2 bits per baud is 57.14 symbols per second so that the maximum capacity of the secondary channel is 114.28 bits per second. The aggregate baud rate of the transmitter 110 including primary and secondary channel is 2800 symbols per second., 120713=Turning to FIG. 11A the framing of the steady state data is illustrated. The data symbols are assembled into master frames comprising 49 frames of symbols. The first frame of each master frame is reserved for secondary channel data. This first frame carries four bauds of four phase DPSK symbols or the equivalent of 8 bits of data. Frames 2-49 are reserved for main channel (or channels) data with each frame also carrying four bauds of data. In the preferred embodiment of a 19.2k Bps modem, this equates to 28 bits per frame of main channel data at 7 bits per baud. Using a baud rate of 2800 Hz results in the desired 19.2k Bps main channel data rate and a secondary channel rate of 114.28 Bps if 2 bits per symbol are used. It should be noted that three bits per symbol could also be used to increase the secondary channel rate by 50%. Since current systems often operate at a secondary channel rate of 75 Bps, this secondary channel rate will meet the needs of most diagnostic and network management systems., 136572=The modem in which the present invention is implemented is a microprocessor based modem. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the microprocessor-based modem control and data processing circuits also typically include the usual data storage elements (e.g., ROM for program control storage and the like, and RAM for variable input/output/intermediate result data, etc.) conventionally associated signals in accordance with a stored program. In the presently preferred exemplary embodiment, these already present microprocessor CPU, ROM and RAM elements are also utilized to perform the functions of the present invention. With the present invention, the modem functions are preferably implemented in high speed digital signal processors such as Texas Instrument's TMS 32020 processors. With respect to FIG. 1, all of the transmitter modem functions therein are preferably, but not necessarily, performed by the digital signal processor. As is well-known, after filtering in block 130, a D/A converter and antialiasing filters (not shown) are used. With respect to FIG. 10, all of the receiver modem functions of FIG. 10 are preferably, but not necessarily, performed by the digital signal processor., 134582=In the preferred embodiment this invention is implemented in firmware using a digital signal processor such as the Texas Instruments TMS32020 processor, but this scheme is implementable in any other type of digital signal processor. The master frame used is 49*4 bauds long (one baud is 2800 hz in the present case), the first 4 baud subframe within this frame correspond to the secondary channel with vectors that have an average energy that is greater than the average energy of the main channel. The remaining 48*4 bauds correspond to main channel and they have a lower expected average energy. The synchronization scheme consists in a sliding window that looks at one 4 baud frame at a time for the expected secondary channel energy and once it finds a close match, it verifies by checking the corresponding subframe that comes in the next master frame. If a good match is found for the energies in that frame, then synchronization has likely been achieved for the receiver, else the sliding window is moved one baud at a time until synchronization is achieved. Since the multiport option in many multidimensional encoded high speed modems requires an 8 baud format (for a minimum port speed of 2400 bps) or a 16 baud format (for a minimum port speed of 1200 bps), by properly establishing the order of the multiport subframes within the master frame, a multiport resynchronization may also be achieved after a dropout., 106190=Turning to FIG. 9, the constellation 175 used in one embodiment for transmission of the secondary channel data is shown. This is essentially the constellation used for 2400 Bps communication as defined by C.C.I.T.T. Specification V.27 bis, VIIth Plenary Assembly, November, 1980. The preferred dibit values and phase changes are as shown in Table 4. The left most dibit value is the first in time and the right most dibit value is the last in time. The phase change is relative to the phase of the preceding secondary channel symbol. Therefore, the absolute phase of the last transmitted symbol of secondary channel data in the master frame is held in a register until the first transmitted secondary channel symbol in the next master frame so the phase change can be computed., 107902=During periods of receipt of main channel data, the complex baseband signals from the demodulator 188 are switched by the sitch 190 to a slicer 191, branch cost calculator 192, Viterbi decoder 193. The decoded signal from the Viterbi decoder 193 is passed to a main channel differential decoder 194 and then to a convolutional decoder 195 and a main channel descrambler 196 where the main channel data are decoded and descrambled to produce main channel data out. Embodiments of the slicer 191, branch cost calculator 192, and Viterbi decoder 193 are described in detail in copending U.S. Pat. application No. 004,389 to Srinivasagopalan et al on Jan. 15, 1987, which is incorporated by reference. There are a number of designs known to those skilled in the art for these components which can be used with the present incentive; however, for the purpose of background for the present invention, each of these components will be generally described hereinafter., 102372=FIG. 7 shows the convolutional encoder 118 and differential encoder 116 of FIGS. 1 and 5 in detail as used for transmission of the main channel data. The encoder 118 is a 3/4 nonsystematic convolutional encoder with constraint length 6 as described in \"Short Binary Convolutional Codes with Maximal Free Distance for Rates 2/3 and 182 \", By Erik Paaske, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, September 1974, pp 683-689. As previously described, the input bits to the encoder are xn i, where i=1 through 28 and the output are yn i, where i=0 through 28. As is well-known, the encoder adds one redundancy bit; however, in the preferred embodiment the encoder adds less than one bit per baud of redundancy into the system. Encoders with redundancies greater than one bit (and therefore redundancy of one or greater per baud) can be used with the present invention. Input bits xn 8 through xn 28 are passed through unchanged and unused to become output bits yn 8 through yn 28. Inputs xn 4 -xn 7 are used but pass through the encoder 118 without being changed., 105936=further details of an embodiment of a 19.2k BPS modem similar to that of the preferred embodiment may be found in U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 055,805 filed May 29, 1987 to Srinivasagopalan et al. which is incorporated by reference.}",
