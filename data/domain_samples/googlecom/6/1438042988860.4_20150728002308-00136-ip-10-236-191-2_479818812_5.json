Booth, Placentia, Calif., assignor to Union Oil Company of California, Los Angeles, Calif. No Drawing. Filed Aug. 21, 1968, Ser. No. 754,482 Int. Cl. C07f 15/00; C07c 45/02; B01i 11/03 US. Cl. 260-429 7 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A method for the recovery of complexes of Group VIII noble metals and biphyllic ligands from hydrocarbons or high boiling residues formed in hydrocarbonylation of olefins. The Group VIII noble metal is recovered in accordance by reduction of the high boiling fraction of a hydroformylation reaction medium to convert the aldehyde groups thereto to alcohols. This reduction is effected by treatment with conventional means, e.g., hydrogenation in the presence of heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts at a temperature from about 25 to 325 C. or by nucleophilic attack by hydride ion by treatment at mild conditions with an alkali metal aluminum hydride orborohydride. The metal complex is essentially insoluble in the resulting alcohol tar and the catalyst precipitate is recovered by conventional solid-liquid separation techniques, e.g., filtration or centrifugation., 36840=The residue is treated with the heterogeneous catalyst at temperatures from 10 to 325 C., preferably from to about 300 C. and pressures from 1 to 10,000 atmospheres, preferably from 20 to 1000, and most preferably from 50 to 750 atmospheres. The partial pressure of hydrogen during this treatment can be from 25 to about 100, preferably from about 50 to percent of the total pressure in the hydrogenation zone., 14450=The process of hydrocarbonylation wherein my invention can be applied includes that described in copending applications Ser. Nos. 518,562, now abandoned, 642,191 and 746,287. The process comprises contacting an olefin, carbon monoxide and hydrogen with a liquid reaction medium containing a homogeneous catalyst at temperatures from about 20 to about 300 C. and pressures from 1 to about 1000 atmospheres. In the first of the aforementioned applications the catalyst described is a Group VIII noble metal halide complex with carbon monoxide and a biphyllic ligand. Also included in the reaction medium is a cocatalyst comprising a polycyclic, heterocyclic, saturated amine having at least one nitrogen in a bridgehead position. In the other application aforementioned, the catalyst described is a Group VIII noble metal hydride complex with carbon monoxide and a biphyllic ligand., 48653=References Cited UNITED STATES PATENTS 7/1965 Gunter et al. 260414 10/1968 Privette et al. 260617 US. Cl. X.R., 13219=I have now found that a Group VIII noble metal can be substantially completely recovered from an organic nonpolar solvent or from a hydroformylation reaction residue where the Group VIII noble metal exists as a soluble complex with a biphyllic ligand by reduction of the carbonyl content of the tar to hydroxyl groups. The reduction can be performed with alkali metal borohydrides or aluminum hydrides at ambient conditions including temperatures from about 10 to about 325 C., preferably from 20 to 100 C., and pressures from about 1 to 1000 atmospheres, sufficient at the treatment temperature to maintain liquid phase conditions during said contacting. The reduction can also be elfected by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts such as platinum, palladium or Raney nickel supported on an inert, particulate solid at temperatures from about 10 to about 325 C., preferably from C. to about 300 C. and at the aforeindicated pressures wherein hydrogen comprises from 25 to 100 percent of the gas phase. The metal complex is precipitated from the resulting hydrogenated residue and can be separated therefrom by conventional means, e.g., filtration or centrifugation., 42912=The experiment is repeated on a reaction medium from the hydroformylation of octene-l using a rhodium hydride carbonyl tris-triphenylphosphine complex catalyst. The reaction medium is distilled under vacuum to remove 475 milliliters of distillate from 500 milliliters of the reaction medium. The residue is diluted to 60 milliliters with methanol and analyzed to determine its rhodium content to be 1433 milligrams per liter.}",
