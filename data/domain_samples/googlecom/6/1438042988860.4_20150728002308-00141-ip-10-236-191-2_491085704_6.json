The transmitting circuit 20 comprises a reference frequency oscillating circuit 21 which outputs a reference frequency signal at, for instance, 10.23 MHz, a first multiplier 22 which multiplies the frequency of the reference frequency signal output from the reference frequency oscillating circuit 21 by 154 to form an L1 carrier (1575.42 MHZ) as a first carrier, and a second multiplier 23 which multiplies the frequency of the reference frequency signal by 154 to form an L2 carrier (1227.6 MHZ) as a second carrier. The transmitting circuit 20 further comprises a clock formation circuit 24 which forms a clock signal having a predetermined period on the basis of the reference frequency signal, a code generating circuit 25 which forms two kinds of code signals called P code and C/A code on the basis of the reference frequency signal and the clock signal, and a computer 26 which outputs data on the position of the satellite which is changing from moment to moment and on the condition of tee clock on the satellite under the timing-control of the clock signal. The P code is a secret code having a high accuracy and is available only to the military and other limited users. The P code is superposed on data output from the computer 26 and is then transmitted by orthogonal modulation of both the L1 and the L2 carriers. The repetition frequency of the P code is 10.23 Mbit/s and the duration of the P code is one week. The C/A code is used for rough positioning (normal positioning) and acquisition of the P code, and is available to the public. The C/A code is superposed on data output from the computer 26 and is then transmitted by modulation of both the L1 and the L2 carriers. The repetition frequency of the C/A code is 1.023 Mbit/s and the duration of the C/A code is 1023 bits. That is, the C/A code is repeated every 1 ms. The C/A code is generated, for instance, by a Gold code generating circuit comprising a pair of ten-stage shift registers. Data to be output from the computer 26 are stored in a memory circuit (not shown) on the satellite on the basis of measurement and prediction at a control section on the ground, and are successively read out. These data are transmitted at a predetermined timing at a transmission speed of, for instance, 50 bit/s. These data include a telemeter language, an ionosphere correction parameter, a delay correction for a single-wave receiver, a date of data on a clock correction, a reference time for clock correction, a GPS system time, a date of orbit prediction, a reference time for orbital elements, a mean anomaly at a reference time for orbital elements, eccentricity, a square root of the longer diameter, a right ascension of an ascending node, inclining angle of the orbit, a perigee argument, a perturbation of an ascending node, a mean motion correction, a parameter for an inclining angle correction, a correction term for an orbital disturbance, an identification number of the satellite, a reference time for a data subframe, condition of the satellite and the like. Further, almanac data of the other satellites in the system is included in the said data to enable prediction of the period for which the receiver of the user can receive the signals from the satellites, selection of combination of the satellites in the field of view providing the best positioning accuracy, presetting of the receiving circuit in order to acquire the signals from the satellites at the earliest possible moment, and the like.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In FIG. 12, flag i is set to 1 in step S1, and flag F is set to 0 in step S2. In step S3, it is determined whether the vehicle is at a stop. Step S3 is repeated until it is determined that the vehicle is at a stop. When it is determined in step S3 that the vehicle is at a stop, GPS data on the present position of the vehicle during the stop are averaged to obtain averaged values xi and yi of X and Y for a given value of i. That is, when it is a first stop, first averaged values x1 and y1 are obtained. (steps S4 and S5) Then in step S6, it is determined whether the flag F is 0. When it is determined that the flag F is 0 in step S6, flag F is set to 1 in step S7, flag i is set to i+1 in step S8, and then the steps S3 to S5 are repeated to obtain second averaged values x2 and y2. After the second averaged values x2 and y2 are obtained, the flag F has been set to 1, and accordingly the flow process proceeds to step S10. In step S10, the traveling azimuth \u03b8 of the vehicle is calculated on the basis of formula \u03b8=tan-1 (y2 -y1)/(x2 -x1). Then in step S11, the traveling azimuth \u03b81 detected by the geomagnetism",
