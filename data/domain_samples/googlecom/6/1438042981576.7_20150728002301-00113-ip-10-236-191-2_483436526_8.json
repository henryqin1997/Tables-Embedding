    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Whereas the preferred form of the invention has been shown and described herein, it should be realized that there may be many modifications, substitutions and alterations thereto. An additional feature of the invention is the breakable or frangible tabs and stops on the outside handle assembly whereby unauthorized entry cannot be effected even though excessive force may be applied to the outside handle. In prior locksets of the type disclosed herein, it was possible to break through the stops which prevented the outside handle from operating the spindle with the result that it was possible to have forced entry. In the present invention, once the stops are broken the outside handle is totally free wheeling and there is no way that entry can be effected. A further important feature of the invention is the delay in release of the pushbutton until the handle has been moved through its predetermined arc before unlocking can take place. Of importance in the invention is the use of an axially movable locking button to effect rotation of a turn bar in a lock which is moved in a rotary manner between extended and retracted positions. The axially movable pushbutton must have its movement translated into rotary movement of the turn bar before the locking procedure can be complete. Thus axial movement of the pushbutton is translated into rotary movement of the turn bar with rotary movement of the turn bar",
