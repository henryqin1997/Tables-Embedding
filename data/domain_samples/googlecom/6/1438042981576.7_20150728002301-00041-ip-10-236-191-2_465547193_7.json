    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59999=The opto-electronic oscillator used for obtaining the measurements shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B was constructed with different E/O modulators for the modulator 12 and a diode-pumped YAG laser at a wavelength of 1320 nm to generate optical subcarriers as high as 9.2 GHz. FIG. 2A shows the RF signal 50 generated at 9.2 GHz and FIG. 2B shows the signal 52 generated at 100 MHz. In both cases, the opto-electronic oscillators are free running and no effort was made to reduce the noise of the oscillators. For comparison, a signal 54 from a HP8656A signal generator is also shown in FIG. 2B. The spectral purity of signal 52 is dramatically better than that of signal 54., 80071=There have been previous suggestions to use a delay line to stabilize an oscillator. However, effective stabilization of an optical oscillator was considered impractical. The reason is exemplified by systems like that proposed by R. Logan et al. (\"Stabilization of Oscillator Phase Using a Fiber Optic Delay-Line\", Proceedings of the 45th Annual Symposium on Frequency Control (IEEE Ultrasonic Ferroelectric and Frequency Control Society), May 29-31, Los opto-electronic Angeles, Calif., 1991). Logan proposed a fiber optic delay line to stabilize a traditional VCO. The fiber optic delay line included a laser transmitter to convert the electrical output of the VCO into an optical signal that was then transmitted through a few kilometers of fiber. The opto-electronic oscillator 10 automatically produces an optical output. The inventors recognized that this makes it ideally suited for use with the fiber delay line technique of self-stabilization. No electrical to optical signal conversion is necessary. Consequently, the device is simple, low loss, and relatively inexpensive.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other embodiments are within the following claims. An important advantage of the opto-electronic oscillator 10 is that it can be integrated on a single integrated circuit chip. All of the key components of the device, such as the laser 40, the amplifier 18, the E/O modulator 12, and the photodetector 16 can be based on GaAs technology and can be fabricated on a common substrate. Other contemplated uses of the opto-electronic oscillator include cellular telephone antenna remoting, satellite earth station antenna remoting, and as both an optical and an electrical high frequency oscillator for signal up and down conversions. A mode-locked opto-electronic oscillator can be used as both an electrical and an optical frequency comb generator, where stable frequency comb generation is critical in dense optical and electrical frequency multiplexing systems. FIG. 15 illustrates the flow of a clock recovery, synchronization and signal recovery system based on the recovery technique described above. An optical carrier 144 including high data rate information arrives from a remote location, and is split into two parts. One of these parts is injected into an opto-electronic oscillator 10 configured as a clock regenerator of FIG. 14A. The other part is delayed in an optical delay line 146 that delays the received signal long enough for the oscillator to lock. This prevents data bits from being lost from the leading edge of the data stream. After passing through the delay line 146,",
