It is, therefore, to be understood that the present claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes which fall within the true spirit of the invention. The foregoing describes a method for communicating among a plurality of programmable logic controllers which are coupled together on a common serial bus. The described method permits slave PLC devices to continue processing during time periods when a master PLC device is communicating with a another selected slave PLC device. The method of the invention assures that the length of every message is known by selected and non-selected slave PLC devices before the message is sent to the slave PLC device by the master PLC device. The described method of communication permits data transmitted from a master PLC device to a slave PLC device to be handled by a direct memory access device in the selected slave PLC so as to not burden the CPU in the selected slave PLC with the handling of the data transfer. FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing the operation of a selected slave device under the method of the invention. As seen in FIG. 5, slave devices monitor bus 400 as per block 700. Each slave device tests to see if a break code",
