No. 08/929,760, filed Sep. 15, 1997, now abandoned., 38073=In FIG. 7, r represents the chip edge margin, and s represents the inter-chip distance. The following table shows the possible maximum inter-chip distance s for the chip edge margins of 4 \u03bcm and 8 \u03bcm when the resolution of the LED module is set to 400 DPI, 600 DPI, 1200 DPI and 2400 DPI., 39907=Therefore, the present invention has an object to provide a light emitting element module on which can readily and quickly be performed a process for arranging a chip at a predetermined position and on which can be performed a process for replacing a defective chip with a new chip even when the light emitting elements are arranged in high density (for example, 400 to 2400 DPI) in each chip of the light emitting element module (for example, LED module)., 68384=On the other hand, when the chips are disposed in a linear arrangement as found in the prior art, the area of the overlap portion between the odd-numbered chip 10x and the even-numbered chip 10y is equal to 700 \u03bcm\ufffd300 \u03bcm=21000 \u03bcm2., 71397=According to the LED module 100 which constitutes a part of the LED printer head 110, the overlap area between the neighboring chips 10 is reduced, and the working space is enlarged. Accordingly, when the LED printer head 110 is constructed, a highly dense (for example, 400 to 2400 DPI) chip 10 can be readily and quickly mounted at a predetermined position. In addition, even when a defective chip occurs due to use of the LED printer head 110, the chip can be readily and quickly replaced with a new one., 79927=Accordingly, in spite of the high density arrangement of the plural light emitting elements 52 (for example, 400 to 2400 DPI), the risk of contacting a neighboring chip is reduced. The working space is enlarged, and both the process for mounting a chip at a predetermined position and the chip replacement process for replacing a defective chip with a new one can be readily and quickly performed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, in the light emitting element module as described above, the confronting second side surfaces of the adjacent chips are set to intersect the first side surfaces thereof at an angle other than 90\ufffd (not at the right angle). In addition, the light emitting element (chip edge light emitting element) which is nearest to the second side surface of each chip is set to be parallel to the second side surface. Accordingly, under the condition that the chip edge margin is fixed, the inter-chip distance is increased to a larger value as compared with the case where the second side surfaces of the adjacent chips which are confronted to each other intersect the first side surfaces thereof at a right angle. As the inter-chip distance is increased, the working space is enlarged, and the freedom of the chip mount on the board is enhanced. A chip having plural light emitting elements which are arranged in high density can be easily arranged with high precision. Accordingly, the reduction of the overlap area between the neighboring chips as described above makes it possible to reduce the probability that when a chip is mounted at a predetermined position on the board or a defective chip is replaced with a new one, the arrangement of the adjacent chips will be disturbed or the adjacent chips will be damaged. That is, the process for mounting, at a predetermined position, a chip",
