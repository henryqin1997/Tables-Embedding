Numerous extensions and modifications thereof would be apparent to the worker skilled in the art. All such extensions and modifications are to be considered to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. As described, the invention advantageously provides a production system and manufacturing equipment selecting method for the system that can be flexibly adapted to provide for small scale production of of multiple items. Also, advantageously, the invention provides for easy and reliable addition and deletion of manufacturing equipment. Moreover, failures of manufacturing equipment can be easily handled reliably and without adverse effect on the production. (3) Since the product agent inquires about the cost information of the machine agent, the product agent can collect cost information for only the required product. (2) Since the product agent collects the cost data from the machine agent, the manufacturing cost for each individual product can be readily calculated. The machine agent collects and retains the various data. (1) The machine agent calculates the cost by using relevant manufacturing equipment for the product agent, using depreciation information on the manufacturing equipment that the machine agent manages, and using the time that the product agent uses on the manufacturing equipment. The product agent corresponds to individual products on a one-to-one basis. Thus, the manufacturing cost of the individual products can be easily calculated. The eighth embodiment provides",
