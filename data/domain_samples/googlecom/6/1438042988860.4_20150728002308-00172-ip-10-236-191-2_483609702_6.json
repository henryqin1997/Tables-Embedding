Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced other than as specifically described. The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Accordingly, the method of refrigeration case control allows control of the refrigeration case even if the temperature sensors fail. The method of refrigeration case control provides control of an analog servo expansion valve for the refrigeration case. The method of refrigeration case control uses two fast fourier transforms to be self-tuning and therefore adaptive. The method of refrigeration case control allows closer temperature control of the refrigeration case within \ufffd one degree (1\ufffd). In diamond 268, if the more capacity needed flag is not set, the methodology advances to diamond 274. In diamond 274, the methodology determines whether a less capacity needed flag is set for the refrigeration system 10. If so, the methodology advances to block 276 and sets the cut-out temperature limit one degree below the cut-in temperature limit for the refrigeration case. After block 276 or if the less capacity needed flag is not set in diamond 274, the methodology advances to block 272 and returns. After block 266, the methodology",
