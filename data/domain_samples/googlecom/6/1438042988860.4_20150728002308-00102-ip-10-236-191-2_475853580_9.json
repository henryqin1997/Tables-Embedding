    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth, variations will no doubt occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In addition to the advantages of the system already described, the quick start features and range feedback features of the present invention provides even further advantages. For example in prior art terminals such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,717 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,520 a micro processor is used to determine a successful scan and to automatically terminate scanning when complete. Such methods are useful in slow speed prior art scanners which suffer from slow startup and limited range of operation. The user must try various ranges and adjust aim until the terminal tells him, usually with a beep, that scanning was finally successful then turns itself off to conserve power. With the high speed, quick start, auto ranging scanner embodiments of the present invention it is no longer necessary to employ a micro processor to terminate scanning. Since the probability of instantly reading and decoding a target is much higher with the present invention, the scanner can be activated in the portable terminal mode for about 250 milliseconds then terminated with a simple RC time out circuit during which time many successful scans will have occurred. An entire scanning system for generating a beam, focusing the beam electronically, scanning the beam, collecting",
