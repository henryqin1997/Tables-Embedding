Therefore, in accordance with the disclosure of EP 0502717 A1, the sinusoidal signal for demodulating the detector signals in the first and the second channel are in phase with the first carrier and the second carrier, respectively. This demodulation method is disadvantageously to the effect that there exists a cross-talking between the first and the second channels, and therefore no accurate evaluation of the concentration of a constituent in an object is possible., 55473=This application is a continuation-in-part application of the U.S. application Ser. No. 08/565,879, filed Dec. 1, 1995, now abandoned., 73346=As explained above, the spectra of the signal at multiples of the LED modulation overlap very likely with the spectra of the optical or electrical noise components. Any noise lines in one of the LED modulation bands will be demodulated and intrinsically folded down to the base band and contribute to poor signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). A very dangerous situation for the patient can occur in the monitoring of neonates. These are often treated with very bright UV lamps for the bilirubin photo therapy. As they produce poor signals because of a poor vascular perfusion, the amount of ambient light can cause even situations with a signal-to-noise ratio<1. A pulse oximeter is very likely to be mislead in these situations. It can derive values for pulse rate, oxygen saturation and perfusion index which are wrong because the input signals are dominated by noise instead of patient signals. EP0502717 A1discloses means and methods for evaluating the concentration of a constituent in an object by measuring the transmission of light of two wavelengths therethrough. First and second light emitters emit light at respective, first and second different wavelengths. A modulator/driver drives the light emitters with respective first and second carriers which vary as a function of time, the carriers being of the same carrier frequency having a phase difference other than 0 and other than an integer multiple of 180\ufffd. A detector receives light from the first and second light emitters after the same has passed through the object and generates a resulting detector signal carrying information relating to transmission of the object at both wavelengths. A first demodulated signal which is a sum of a component proportional to the object's transmission at the first wavelength and one or more carrier modulated components is generated by a demodulator from the detector signal in a first channel, whereas a second demodulated signal which is a sum of a component proportional to the object's transmission at the second wavelength and one or more carrier modulated components is generated by the demodulator in a second channel. The carrier modulated components of the signals are filtered out of the first and second channels by a demodulated signal filter., 76913=The present invention is based on the perception that in prior art analysis systems for measuring medical parameters, for example the system that is disclosed in EP 0502717 A1, an accurate measurement and subsequent analysis of medical parameters is impossible due to a phase shift which is introduced by the system between the electromagnetic waves which are used to irradiate a sample and the electromagnetic waves which are used for analysis. Therefore, the present invention provides methods and apparatus for measuring medical parameters of a patient by irradiation of electromagnetic waves into a sample and for measurement and subsequent analysis of the electromagnetic waves which have passed through said sample, wherein the system phase shift is compensated during the analysis of the received electromagnetic waves.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The great advantage of interference immunity of this system may also be applied to other sensoric measurements where ambient noise is an issue, not only in medical instrumentation. It is always possible where an excitation is used for stimulation. Examples are impedance measurements in bridges like pressure strain gauges or spectrometer devices with chopped sources. It is also clear that the sinusoidal demodulation can be applied in a two LED pulse oximeter without the quadrature concept, but with only the sinusoidal demodulation, if there is a different modulation frequency chosen for each LED. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the principle of sinusoidal demodulation as disclosed herein is also applicable to multi-wavelength oximetry. If a third and forth LED is used, a further LED modulation frequency has to be selected. In general, for n LEDs, n/2 modulation frequencies have to be used, just because each frequency channel can contain 2 independent information data in quadrature mode. The only condition for these different modulation frequencies is that they are offset by more than the physiological bandwidth of the blood pulse. Referring to FIG. 13, a further method to determine the system phase shift \u03c6 is described. In this measurement, the difference in the zero-crossing between the incoming signal A(t) and the LED drive signal JR (t) and JIR (t) is measured before demodulation, rather than measuring the amplitudes of the incoming signals",
