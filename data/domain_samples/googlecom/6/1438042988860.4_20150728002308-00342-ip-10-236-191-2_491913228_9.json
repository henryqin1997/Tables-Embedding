The antibodies of choice are those which react with antigens on tumor cells or on subsets of normal lymphocytes. By deletion of the tumor cells, it is possible, for example, to reduce tumor burdens in vivo [Krolick, et al., J. Exp. Med. 155, 1797 (1982)] and to remove tumor cells from bone marrow for autologous marrow transplantation [Thorpe, et al., Nature (London) 271, 752 (1978); and Krolick, et al., Nature (London) 295 604 (1982)]., 46344=The human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi, as described in Houston, L. L., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 92:319-326 (1980), was maintained in suspension culture in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 20 mM fresh glutamine, and antibiotics. Cultures were maintained at 37\ufffd C. in a humid incubator with a 95% O2 /5% CO2 atmosphere. All cultures were utilized two days following subculture., 43402=10 \u03bcl of 60 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in PBS was added to each mg of the dialyzed A or B chain. The mixtures were incubated at 25\ufffd C. for 60 minutes and the reduced chains were separated from the DTT by gel filtration at 25\ufffd C. on a Sephadex G-25 column (18\ufffd1.5 cm) in PBS pH 7.2. Antibodies were coupled as described previously in Vitetta, et al., Immunol. Rev. 62:159-183 (1982) and were mixed with the freshly reduced A or B chains at an antibody:A chain or antibody:B chain molar ratio of 5:1. The mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at 4\ufffd C. with gentle shaking and then dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4\ufffd C. The immunotoxins were concentrated to 1 mg/ml by pervaporation, dialyzed for 2-16 hours at 4\ufffd C. against PBS, and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The separation of the immunotoxin from the majority of free A chain, B chains and antibody was performed by gel filtration at 25\ufffd C. on a Sephacryl-S200 column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.2. Material with an apparent molecular weight of greater than 200,000 was pooled. Reduced and alkylated bovine alpha globulin, fraction 4 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to the pooled samples. The samples were stored 16-20 hours at 4\ufffd C. prior to affinity purification.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the compositions and methods of this invention have been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that various changes may be made in the methods and compositions disclosed without departing from the scope of the invention, which is defined by the following claims. As featured in the TABLE, when Daudi cells were treated with 0.3 \u03bcg of RaHIg-A chain/105 cells, little toxicity was observed. No concentration of RaHIg-B was toxic. However, when 0.3 ug of the RaHIg-A was mixed with various combinations of RaHIg-B, there was significant cytoxicity. It should be noted that this treatment of the Daudi cells with the mixture of immunotoxins was performed in BSS lacking galactose. As shown in the TABLE, when Daudi cells were treated with 0.5 \u03bcg of RaHIg-B, no toxicity was observed. In contrast, the RaHIg-A killed the Daudi cells in a dose-related manner. However, treatment of cells with 0.5 ug of RaHIg-B mixed with RaHIg-A was toxic to the cells, even at those concentrations at which RaHIg-A itself was no longer toxic.
