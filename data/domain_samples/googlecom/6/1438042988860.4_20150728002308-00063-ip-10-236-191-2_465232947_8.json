The scope of the present invention, however, is by no means limited by these specific examples. Numerous variations, whether explicitly given in the specification or not, such as differences in structure, dimension, and use of material, are possible. The scope of the invention is at least as broad as given by the following claims. This application is related to Glenn et al., co-filed and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/803,083 entitled \u201cBACK-SIDE WAFER SINGULATION METHOD\u201d, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, wafer support 204 is UV curable. In accordance with this embodiment, wafer support 204 is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation to polymerize wafer support 204 and render interior surface 204I nonadhesive. Accordingly, integrated circuits 112 lose the adhesive mounting to wafer support 204 thus facilitating removal of integrated circuits 112 from wafer support 204. In one embodiment, integrated circuits 112 are flipped over after being removed from wafer support 204 and placed for die attach and wirebonding. Die attach and wirebonding of integrated circuits are well known to those of skill in the art is not discussed further to avoid detracting from the principals of the invention. Advantageously, after being removed from wafer support 204, front-side surfaces 112F of integrated circuits 112, and, more generally, front-side surface 110F of wafer 110,",
