Some of these adminstration sets have enlarged measuring chambers of less volume than the bottle. The purpose of these measuring chambers is to get a more accurate measurement of smaller volumes of dispensed liquid. For instance, an administration set connected to a 1 liter (1,000 ml.) bottle might have a 100 ml. measuring chamber that is calibrated to within an accuracy of 1 ml. The reason for this arrangement is that a large 1 liter bottles does not have the volumetric accuracy of a small measuring chamber., 9056=128/214 C, 214.2, 227, 272; 73/327; 84/97; 137/559; 40/310; 222ll57-159 [56] References Cited UNlTED STATES PATENTS 3,690,312 9/1972 Leibinsohn 128/214 R X 2,303,154 11 1942 Armstrong ..73 327 2,356,267 8/1944 Pelunis 73/327 UX 3,216,419 11/1965 Scislowicz 128/214 C 3,217,709 11/1965 Schneider et a]. 128/214 C FOREIGN PATENTS OR APPLICATIONS 595,775 7/1925 France 73/327 Primary Examiner--Dalton L.

No.: 202,243, 14173=DETAILED DESCRIPTION The administration set described in this invention includes a flexible conduit 1. This conduit connects between a liquid supply bottle and a patient as will be explained in more detail in FIG. 7. Referring now to FIG. 1 the flexible conduit has an enlarged measuring chamber 2 connected in series with this flexible conduit. This enlarged chamber has calibrated inidicia 3 shown here to measure between 0 and ml. If desired, the chamber can be made longer and have a capacity of ml. This chamber 2 includes a cylindrical transparent side wall 4 connected at its upper end to a top cap 5 and at its lower end to a bottom cap 6. The top cap has an inlet 7, an additive medication puncture site 8 and a valved vent system 9. The details of the top cap and valve 9 are explained in more detail in a co-pending application entitled MEDICAL LIQUID ADMINIS- TRATION SET FOR RATE OR VOLUME DELIV- ERY, Ser.
