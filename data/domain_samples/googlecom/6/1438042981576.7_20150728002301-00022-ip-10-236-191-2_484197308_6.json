No. 10/746,280, filed Dec. 23, 2003., 69795=Delivery and deployment of braided anchor 30 is similar to the delivery and deployment of the anchors described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/746,280 filed Dec. 23, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, in one embodiment described below, during deployment braided anchor 30 is actively foreshortened by proximally retracting the distal region control wires relative to control tubes 106 to expand and lock the anchor in place. In some embodiments, foreshortening expands anchor 30 to a radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, or asymmetrical expanded shape (as further described below). The foreshortening step can include expanding a first region of the anchor to a first diameter and a second region of the anchor to a second diameter larger than the first diameter. A third region may also be expanded to a diameter larger than the first diameter. The expansion of various regions of the anchor (e.g., the distal region) can be especially useful in locating the aortic valve and centering the anchor within it. Preferably, the secured anchor does not interfere with the mitral valve or the ostias. In some embodiments, the anchor is allowed to self expand prior to the foreshortening step.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. . FIG. 14A illustrates two embodiments (side and top views) of asymmetrical anchors. The benefits of bilaterally symmetrical an asymmetrical anchors is their ability to avoid interfering with anatomical features, such as, for example the coronary ostial and/or mitral valve. Thus, in preferred embodiments, a braided anchor includes a region adapted to prevent expansion of the anchor into the mitral valve, as is illustrated in FIG. 14B illustrates one embodiment of a bilaterally symmetrical anchor. FIG. 14A illustrates one embodiment of a radially symmetrical anchor. FIG. 2B The anchors described herein can be, for example, radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, or asymmetrical. A radially symmetrical anchor is one for which symmetry exists across any diameter. A",
