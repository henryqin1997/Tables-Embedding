Note that specifying this in terms of Universal Time allays any potential problems with events from different time zones. The timestamp is read but not modified by the Tardis. It is stored as a single 64-bit quantity, and should be stored so that the Tardis using a single 64-bit instruction can compare timestamps. The Clients are responsible for ensuring the timestamp is in an appropriate format., 231107=In an edition of the Communications of the ACM \u201cIntrusion Detection Systems & Multisensor Fusion: Creating Cyberspace Situational Awareness\u201d, in Communications of the ACM 43(4), April 2000 Bass speculates on the future architecture requirements for Intrusion Detection Systems. In particular, he discusses the need for data abduction and points to the requirement for three main levels of semantic ascension., 218658=In this case, the agent would generate a Hard Fail (i.e. a \u201cdefinite no\u201d) since a contradiction is encountered. The relationship \u201ccorrupted\u201d can only be true if Rule 1 has classified Process 1234 as a \u201cnon-system daemon\u201d, but that can only happen if Port 21 is not \u201crecognised\u201d. This last fact is explicitly contradicted by the available facts., 275376=The content of this part is based on the Data Item Description (DID) DI-IPSC81435, Software Design Description (SDD), from the US Military Standard MILSTD498 [1] using MIL-STD498 Tailoring Guidebook [2] for the development project.}",
