It is understood that such detail is solely for that purpose, and variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. The apparatus, operation and method of the present invention is defined by the following claims. In contrast, high ratings (where subjects reported liking a script more) covaried mainly with activation near the border of areas 18 and 19. This region is part of the secondary visual cortex and is involved in processing the images generated during visual mental imagery. When a scenario is thought of as pleasant, it invites subjects to engage their imagery systems to a greater degree, and the resulting visual images are more vivid and detailed. Two points in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were correlated to low valence ratings of the scripts. This region has been hypothesized to play a role in the \"withdrawal\" response. Thus, when confronted with an unappealing stimulus, such as a dirty, intimidating dealership, or the memory of this experience, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becomes active and perhaps facilitates withdrawal from that situation. Each of the three experimental scripts described a different car dealership in a way that was easy to visualize. The negative or stereotypical script describes a dirty, unorganized, socially intrusive, inconvenient environment, typical",
