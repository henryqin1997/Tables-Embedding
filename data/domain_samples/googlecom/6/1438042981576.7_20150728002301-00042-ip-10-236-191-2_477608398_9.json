    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{68449=Many polyolefins are available for fiber production, for example polyethylenes such as Dow Chemical's PE XU 61800.41 linear low density polyethylene (\u201cLLDPE\u201d) and 25355 and 12350 high density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d) are such suitable polymers. Fiber-forming polypropylenes include Exxon Chemical Company's Escorene7 PD 3445 polypropylene and Montell Chemical Co.'s PF-304 and PF-015. Many other conventional polyolefins are commercially available and include polybutylenes and others., 111299=Spray drying is commonly used for encapsulating food and flavors. To prepare a material for spray drying, the carrier material is dissolved in an aqueous solution. The core ingredient is added to this solution and mixed thoroughly. A typical load of carrier to core material is 4:1, although much higher or lower loads can be used. The mixture is homogenized, and then fed into a spray dryer where it is atomized and released into a stream of hot air. The water is evaporated, leaving a dried particle comprising the core material trapped within the carrier matrix., 86233=where \u201cG\u201d is selected from the group consisting of poly(oxyethylene)-alpha,omega-diol, poly(oxypropylene)-alpha,omega-diol, poly(oxytetramethylene)-alpha,omega-diol and \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are positive integers including 2, 4 and 6, \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d are positive integers including 1\u201320. Such materials generally have an elongation at break of from about 600 percent to 750 percent when measured in accordance with ASTM D-638 and a melt point of from about 350\ufffd F. to about 400\ufffd F. (176 to 205\ufffd C.) when measured in accordance with ASTM D-2117., 38401=The relative humidity within the oven is not specifically controlled. Under predetermined set conditions of 100\ufffd F. (32\ufffd C.) and ambient relative humidity, the WVTR for the \u201cCELGARD\u201d 2500 control has been defined to be 5000 grams per square meter for 24 hours. Accordingly, the control sample was run with each test and the preliminary test values were corrected to set conditions using the following equation: WVTR=(test WVTR/control WVTR)\ufffd(5000 g/m2/24 hrs.)., 36539=A measure of the breathability of a fabric is the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) which, for sample materials, is calculated essentially in accordance with ASTM Standard E96-80 with minor variations in test procedure as set forth hereinbelow. Circular samples measuring three inches in diameter are cut from each of the test materials, and tested along with a control, which is a piece of \u201cCELGARD\u201d 2500 sheet from Celanese Separation Products of Charlotte, N.C. \u201cCELGARD\u201d 2500 sheet is a microporous polypropylene sheet. Three samples are prepared for each material. The test dish is a No. 60-1 Vapometer pan distributed by Thwing-Albert Instrument Company of Philadelphia, Pa. 100 milliliters of water is poured into each Vapometer pan and individual samples of the test materials and control material are placed across the open tops of the individual pans. Screw-on flanges are tightened to form a seal along the edges of the pan, leaving the associated test material or control material exposed to the ambient atmosphere over a 6.5 cm diameter circle having an exposed area of approximately 33.17 square centimeters. The pans are placed in a forced air oven at 100\ufffd F. (32\ufffd C.) for one hour to equilibrate. The oven is a constant temperature oven with external air circulating through it to prevent water vapor accumulation inside. A suitable forced air oven is, for example, a Blue M Power-O-Matic 600 oven distributed by Blue M Electric Company of Blue Island, Ill. Upon completion of the equilibration, the pans are removed from the oven, weighed and immediately returned to the oven. After 24 hours, the pans are removed from the oven and weighed again. The preliminary test water vapor transmission rate values are calculated as follows: Test WVTR=(grams weight loss over 24 hours)\ufffd(315.5 g/m2/24 hours)., 41022=As used herein, the term \u201cfilament\u201d refers to a generally continuous strand that has a large ratio of length to diameter, such as, for example, a ratio of 1000 or more., 68964=Examples of polyamides and their methods of synthesis may be found in \u201cPolymer Resins\u201d by Don E. Floyd (Library of Congress Catalog No. 66-20811, Reinhold Publishing, New York, 1966). Particularly commercially useful polyamides are nylon-6, nylon 6,6, nylon-11 and nylon-12. These polyamides are available from a number of sources such as Emser Industries of Sumter, S.C. (Grilon7 & Grilamid7 nylons), Atochem Inc. Polymers Division of Glen Rock, N.J. (Rilsan7 nylons), Nyltech of Manchester, N.H. (grade 2169, Nylon 6), and Custom Resins of Henderson, Ky. (Nylene 401-D), among others., 30430=U.S. Ser. No. 60/195,517, filed on Apr. 6, 2000; U.S. Ser. No. 60/195,071, filed on Apr. 6, 2000; U.S. Ser. No. 60/194,929, filed on Apr. 6, 2000; U.S. Ser. No. 60/195,072, filed on Apr. 6, 2000; U.S. Ser. No. 60/194,930, filed on Apr. 6, 2000; and U.S. Ser. No. 60/257,137, filed on Dec. 20, 2000., 35068=As used herein, the term \u201cbiconstituent fibers\u201d refers to fibers which have been formed from at least two polymers extruded from the same extruder as a blend. Biconstituent fibers do not have the various polymer components arranged in relatively constantly positioned distinct zones across the cross-sectional area of the fiber and the various polymers are usually not continuous along the entire length of the fiber, instead usually forming fibrils or protofibrils which start and end at random. Biconstituent fibers are sometimes referred to as multiconstituent fibers. Fibers of this general type are discussed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,108,827 and 5,294,482 to Gessner. Biconstituent fibers are also discussed in the textbook Polymer Blends and Composites by John A. Manson and Leslie H. Sperling, copyright 1976 by Plenum Press., a division of Plenum Publishing Corporation of New York, IBSN 0-306-30831-2, at pages 273 through 277., 114754=The stretch-bonded laminate sheet, on the other hand, included threads of an elastic material sandwiched between two polypropylene spunbond layers. The elastic material used was KRATON G2740 S-EB-S block copolymer available from the Shell Oil Company. The stretch-bonded laminate sheet had a basis weight of 2.5 osy. An imprinted, magnesium bond plate was used to bond the stretch-bonded laminate sheet to the coform base sheet., 81052=Polymers composed of an elastomeric A-B-A-B tetrablock copolymer may also be used in the practice of this invention. Such polymers are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,613 to Taylor et al. In such polymers, A is a thermoplastic polymer block and B is an isoprene monomer unit hydrogenated to substantially a poly(ethylene-propylene) monomer unit. An example of such a tetrablock copolymer is a styrene-poly(ethylene-propylene)-styrene-poly(ethylene-propylene) or SEPSEP elastomeric block copolymer available from the Shell chemical Company of Houston, Tex. under the trade designation KRATON7 G-1657., 103768=The first section 20 is an elastic laminate. For instance, the first section 20 can be a stretch-bonded laminate sheet. The stretch-bonded laminate sheet can include elastic threads made from an elastomeric material sandwiched between two polypropylene spunbond layers. The elastic threads can be, for instance, made from a styrene-ethylene butuylene-styrene copolymer, such as KRATON G2740 available from the Shell Chemical Company. The stretch-bonded laminate can have a basis weight of from about 1.0 osy to about 5 osy, particularly from about 1.5 osy to about 2.5 osy, and more particularly from about 2.0 osy to about 3.0 osy.}",

Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained therein. The ability of an appendage sleeve of the present invention to protect an abrasion was demonstrated. An elastomeric, meltblown polyetherester (DEMIQUE7) base sheet was first chemically bonded (using hot melt adhesive, applied in the shape of a finger) to the coform base sheet described in Example 1. The polyetherester polymer was obtained from DSM Engineering Plastics. The meltblown polyetherester web had a basis weight of about 2 osy. Excess material was then trimmed away from the edges of the sleeve, which was then used to bandage an abrasion on a finger.
