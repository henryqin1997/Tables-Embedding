    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44148=The 2:1 block can be any value above the atrial (A--A) interval value. In the presently most preferred embodiment we have chosen 30 beats per minute (bpm). The atrial interval is one of those values kept by the pacemaker and updated on a regular basis. In our devices we call this the MAI or mean atrial interval, although it is not actually a \"mean\" value, rather it represents the value determined by our pacemakers to be the true atrial interval value. This MAI value is used to determine if a tachyarrhythmia or flutter is occurring in the atrium, and to follow the intrinsic rate, among other things Thus if the 30 bpm we have chosen is added to the MAI of, say, 100 bpm, and the current A--A interval indicates that the intrinsic rate is greater than or equal to 130 bpm, our pacemaker determines that a tachy condition is occurring. In other words, the 2:1 block point has been reached or exceeded., 46826=If temp 2:1 is not less than Target 2:1, the new value for PVARP is set at the Target 2:1 minus the current operating SAV interval rate value. In this case the program can then exit and wait for the next ventricular event., 45674=It should be noted that Current 2:1 block is the operating SAV+operating PVARP. (Operating\" means the values could be set by some other feature--Adaptive AV, HOCM AV, Rate Adaptive AV, etc.), 21548=Other relevant thinking in this area includes at least, an article on different beneficial AV intervals for sensed and paced atrial events for DDD pacing, (Alt, et al., J. of Electrophysiology, Vol.1 No.3, 1987, pp250-56), A patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,222) on automatic adjustment to AV and escape intervals issued to Thacker, and one (U.S. Pat. No. 4,108,148) issued to Cannon, which called for automatically adjusting the AV interval using a p wave triggered monostable multivibrator., 47068=On the other hand if the answer to the question of 206 is yes, another determination must be made, that is, is the current PVARP value less than the patient's retrograde conduction time? (this is a number either set by the pacemaker manufacturer or the physician). If yes, the PVARP value is increased to be at least as long as that retrograde conduction time (step 209) and the SAV value is set to the value of the Target 2:1 minus this PVARP value. The next step 211 is a way for this algorithm to function with the algorithm of FIGS. 3 and 4 above. In other words, if we have gone down this step 209 branch, this ventricular beat should be ignored by the adaptive AV search. The simplest way to accomplish this is to add a flag bit to the data kept for this beat by the AV search algorithms, this flag being set by this Automatic PVARP algorithm. Other methods and structures will come readily to mind for the reader of ordinary skill without exceeding the ambit of this invention., 46594=In step 206 the algorithm decides whether the temporary 2:1 is less than the target 2:1 established in step 205. The temporary 2:1 was either the initial value or the one set the last time through this algorithm., 23679=FIG. 7 is a graph of heart rate vs time showing the 2:1 block point vis-a-vis atrial rate., 26490=An antenna 52 is connected to Input/Output Circuit 30 for purposes of uplink/downlink telemetry through a radio frequency (RF) Transmitter/Receiver Circuit (RF TX/RX) 54. Telemetering both analog and digital data between antenna 52 and an external device, such as an external programmer (not shown), is accomplished in the preferred embodiment by means as substantially described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,127,404, issued on Jul. 7, 1992, entitled \"Telemetry Format for Implantable Medical Device\", incorporated herein by reference. A reed switch 51 is connected to Input/Output Circuit 30 to enable patient follow-up via disabling the sense amplifier 146 and enabling telemetry and programming functions, as is known in the art., 42872=To explain in other terms, it should first be recognized that an upper rate is often set to help the patient avoid an ischemic condition which would occur if the intrinsic rate were to be followed. This can occur because of a diseased condition in the patient's heart, or in other words, because the heart is incapable of operating at the rates the body wants it to. Generally, the physician will set the upper rate to something he feels the patient's heart can handle. Since the atrial rate may go beyond that, the Wenkebaching that occasionally drops a ventricular pace is a hemodynamicly reasonable compromise to the heart's assumed diminished capability and the body's intrinsic demand. However, the condition of atrial tachycardia or flutter is not something that should be allowed to develop either, and the pacemaker will assume that a tachy condition has developed when the atrial rate to the ventricular rate is approaching 2:1., 41439=The PVARP has two main purposes in the pacemaker. First it protects from retrograde atrial events being sensed by the pacemaker and starting AV rhythms inappropriately. Otherwise the resulting rhythm will be a \"Circus movement or \"Endless loop\" tachycardia. If the PVARP length is longer than the patient's VA conduction time this rhythm cannot occur. Secondly the PVARP controls the range of rates the patient can synchronize to. Add in the AV period to the PVARP yields the Total Atrial Refractory Period (TARP) When the atrial rate exceeds this value every other atrial event will be tracked to the Ventricle, producing a 2:1 block. It is preferred to have a smaller TARP than the programmed upper tracking rate interval. This would provide a period of Wenckebach operation where the pacemaker remains synchronous to the atrial events but never paces faster than the upper tracking rate. This results in a dropped beat about every 4th beat or so because of lengthening AV intervals. However where the AV interval is manipulated as described above, TARP size becomes dynamic, changing every time SAV (or the AV interval) is shortened. Other operations could also cause the SAV to shorten, such as HOCM pacing therapy etc. In any event, if the TARP is lengthened too far, such that it is greater than or equal to the upper rate interval, the above described Wenckebaching operation will not occur., 49390=The target 2:1 block point would be 90+30 bpm=120 bpm, or 500 ms. Subtracting the SAV of 150 ms from this value gives PVARP of 350 ms, well above the minimum. So Current TARP=Target TARP right away., 48277=Going back to step 208, if a no decision was taken, the PVARP value is set to the Target 2:1 minus the SAV value in step 214, then if this is less than the patient's retrograde conduction time, again the step 209 branch is taken. Otherwise the program can exit here., 45530=This gives us a 2:1 point bounded by 100 bpm and Upper rate+35 bpm, and allows it to move up with increasing intrinsic rate., 48563=Thus, PVARP is set equal to the difference between the current SAV and the target 2:1 block point. Normally, then, Current TARP=Target TARP. Also, PVARP cannot be set shorter than MINIMUM PVARP. So, Current TARP could be greater than Target PVARP. If that happens, we want to shorten the AV interval so that Current TARP=Target TARP. We can also shorten the SAV down to a defined minimum in this attempt., 45889=In FIG. 6, the automatic PVARP algorithm 200 starts with the occurrence of an AV sequential ventricular event(step 201). The Current 2:1 block point is set(Step 202) equal to the sum of the temp SAV value and the temp PVARP values. In other words the program is initialized with the current values. The next step 203 sets the Target 2:1 equal to the true atrial interval (current MAI or MA\"R\" for Rate). In the following two steps the sorting to find the correct 2:1 value to use is done. The step 204 value picks the maximum between the value from step 203 and 100 bpm. Then step 205 picks the minimum from between that and the upper tracking rate plus the offset of 35 bpm., 43829=This automatic PVARP is designed to determine what the appropriate 2:1 block point is for a current atrial rate, and allows the pacemaker to be responsive to intrinsic need. It is designed to accommodate changing AV interval size which may be occurring for other reasons (HOCM therapy, for example)., 45208=The value \"Target 2:1 block\" is established by the following rules:, 48987=This gives us a picture like that of FIG. 7, in which the intrinsic atrial rate as expressed in the MAI is shown in dark squares, and the 2:1 block point is shown in open squares., 32255=Referring now to FIG. 3, the first step is to enable the algorithm in step 11, assuming or determining initial values for the AV intervals. Running the pacemaker on these values in step 12, the pacemaker collects data or runs for a number of AV event sequences until the decision at step 13 is satisfied. (To satisfy step 13, no event cycles that end in a safety pace are counted. A \"Safety Pace\" is a pacing pulse that is triggered by a ventricular sense which occurs within a set period, in preferred embodiments, 110 ms of an atrial pace. The pacemaker thus delivers a ventricular safety pace at 110 ms AV interval. In the event the ventricular sense was crosstalk, that is, sensing of the atrial pace energy in the ventricle, this provides pacing support in the ventricle. If it was a true ventricular event (R-wave), the ventricular pace will be close enough to the R-wave to land in cardiac refractory tissue and not capture the heart. The algorithm will not count safety paces so as to ignore the ventricular senses that trigger safety paces since we don't know if they were really R-waves. The algorithm will also ignore all data from heartbeats during which the AV interval was shortened to preserve a high 2:1 block point. In other words, those beats that cause the automatic PVARP algorithm to set the SAV shorter because the PVARP is longer than the patient's retrograde conduction time are ignored. This is described with reference to FIG. 6 below, step 211.), 18035=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/536,602 filed on 29th Sep. 1995 now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Many variations on the inventive concepts taught herein can be easily imagined, by for example shifting the values (like 30 bpm) a few beats in either direction. Nevertheless, these are believed to be within the scope of this invention which is only limited as set forth in the following claims. Again the Target 2:1=120 bpm, or 500 ms. Subtracting the SAV would give a PVARP of 300 ms, which is shorter than the minimum allowed. So PVARP can only go down to 350. Current TARP=550, different from the Target TARP of 500 ms. this will require the SAV to shorten by 50 ms or down to the minimum allowed) so Target=Current. the final values would be SAV=150, PVARP=350. Minimum PVARP=350 ms. SAV=200 ms, MAI=90 bpm The target 2:1 block point would be 90+30 bpm=120 bpm, or 500 ms. Subtracting the SAV of 150 ms from this value gives PVARP of 350 ms, well above the minimum. So Current TARP=Target TARP right away. Minimum PVARP=200 ms SAV=150 ms MAI=90 bpm Some example numbers which will go through the algorithm described in FIG. 6 follow: This gives us a picture like that of FIG. 7, in which the intrinsic atrial rate as expressed in the MAI is shown in dark squares, and the 2:1 block point is shown in open squares. Thus, PVARP is set equal to the difference between the current SAV and the target 2:1 block",
