The WAS 930 can be configured to operate with any operating system. However, one commercial embodiment runs a hardened version of Linux 2.4.18. The operating system running on the WAS appliance can be hardened in the following ways:, 142193=Upon receiving a null code for the passcode, the WAS 1030 provides a large (usually 12 digit) code for the challenge code to the network client 1050 over a computer network 1016. The network client 1050, in turn, displays the challenge code to the user 1010., 133479=The cryptographic signature or device profile for each wireless device 922 is stored within the WAS 930 and associated with a domain 950 and user 922. In the case of encrypted mode (recommended since the wireless network 912 is untrusted), the cryptographic signature is a 1024 bit-equivalent general device key as generated in the registration. This strong, asymmetric encryption key is generated on the device 922 and serves to identify a valid device 922 within the security domain and to provide payload security during the reception of passcodes. The device 922 also receives, stores and utilizes the public key of the WAS 930, which is provided by the server 930 during the registration process. Once these keys are exchanged and the device-domain PIN established, the wireless device 922 becomes a registered or trusted device., 143193=The user 1010 then returns to the process associated with the network client 1050, such as web page login or terminal server login, and enters the resulting message as an answer to the challenge., 142519=The user 1010 runs a client application on the wireless device 1022 in offline mode and enters the challenge code into the device 1022. The device 1022 assembles the following message: [general device key|PIN for domain|challenge code] (separators are shown for readability) and encrypts it with a secondary general server key used only for offline verification. This key pair is specific to the wireless client 1022 and the security domain. The encrypted payload is hashed with SHA1 producing a 20 byte string of ASCII characters. The string is base62 encoded and displayed to the user 1010., 121855=RADIUS is a standard TCP/IP based service for authorization and access control. The RADIUS protocol is detailed within the Internet Engineering Taskforce RFC 2865 with additional information provided by RFC's 2866 to 2869. The RADIUS protocol can be less secure than proprietary protocols since it utilizes a MAC encoding of the packets within the protocol exchange. Consequently, it is normally utilized on trusted networks, e.g., corporate Intranets, or to support standard VPN and dial-in clients. RADIUS is supported by Microsoft's RAS, Cisco's routing and firewall software as well as by most of the terminal and PPP device makers. The WAS 930 can support fully RADIUS authentication and less fully RADIUS accounting and proxy features., 141659=When the WAS 1030 can not be reached by a wireless device 1022, the offline verification process can be instituted by the network client 1050. Based on the user's action, the network client can request a challenge code from the WAS 1030, rather than requesting a passcode verification. This action can be taken in response to the user 1010, not providing any response to a passcode input field over a computer network 1014 from a computing device 1026., 143435=The challenge answer is provided by the network client 1050 to the WAS 1030 over an encrypted (or in the case of RADIUS encoded and through CHAP) connection 1016. The WAS 1030 decrypts the message with the server local key for offline verification, repeats the message creation above and compares the SHA1 hash. The result of the challenge verification is returned to the network client 1050. Based upon the result, the network 1050 can grant or deny access., 134423=When the application is started for the first time, the application automatically generates a key pair: a local device key and a general device key. These keys are used for the decryption of the payload from the WAS 930 and identification of the device 922. The keys are asymmetric, and the strength of the key pair is approximately equivalent to RSA1024 bits. The time for the key generation process averages 14 seconds., 128678=Before a wireless device 922 can communicate with the WAS 930, the device 922 is first registered within the WAS 930 and associated with a security domain. In this commercial embodiment, each supported security domain requires approximately 1200 bytes of storage on the wireless device 922. There are two main methods for registering a device 922:}",
