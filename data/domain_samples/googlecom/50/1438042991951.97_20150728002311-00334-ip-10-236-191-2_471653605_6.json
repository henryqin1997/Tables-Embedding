    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In summary, there has been disclosed a unique watthour meter socket adapter which contains components designed for a simple and expedient manufacturing of the watthour meter socket adapter with fewer fasteners than used in previously devised socket adapters. This contributes to a faster and less expensive manufacturing process which reduces the overall cost of the watthour meter socket adapter. The unique jaw contact structure of the present invention provides a staggered, bilateral push-on insertion force which significantly reduces the maximum push-on insertion force required to fully insert a blade terminal into the jaw contact. This bilateral jaw contact arrangement may be applied to conventional jaw blade contacts as well as conventional folded over jaw contacts. As in the preceding embodiment, the width of the laterally aligned pairs of legs can be varied to provide any desired insertion force at each step. For example, the width of the second and fourth legs 320 and 324 can be wider to more evenly balance the force provided by the other leg pair. In this embodiment, the second legs 320 and 324 identically constructed as the legs 320 and 324, shown in FIGS. 19 and 20. The first legs 318' and 322' have a reduced height as compared to the second legs 320 and 324 caused by beginning the folding over of the inward extending portions of each of the legs 318' and 322' at a shorter distance from the",
