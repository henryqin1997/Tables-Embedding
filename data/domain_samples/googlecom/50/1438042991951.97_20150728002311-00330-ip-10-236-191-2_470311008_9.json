At the present time, printed circuit boards usually have six different conductor track planes lying one above the other in which the conductor tracks are arranged. The course of the conductor tracks is configured according to a suitable raw card of the above standard. The conductor tracks are not illustrated in the figures since their specific course is not essential with regard to the present invention. furthermore shows two register chips 9, with which the memory addresses in the memory chips 4 are amplified synchronously. FIG. 2 A wide variety of methods are known according to which the error correction chip, namely memory module, 4 b can operate. An example that shall be mentioned here is the ECC method (error correcting code), in which a check bit is added to eight bits of data to be communicated. Data that is transported to the semiconductor memory modules 4 a always contain check data. The error correction chip, namely memory module, 4 b checks the correctness of the data before the data are passed on. The clock synchronization chip 6 (PLL; phase locked loop) ensures that, after a few clock cycles of the clock signal that is output from the electronic unit 3 via the contact",
