No. 672,595, for \"Thin-Film Storage Disk\", filed Nov. 15, 1984, now abandoned, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 706,737, for \"Sputtering System Baffle and Method\", filed Feb. 28, 1985 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,179., 51513=The opertional characteristics of the magnetic medium produced in accordance with the invention will be considered. FIG. 9 shows the M-H curve for an exemplary disk, designated 0611-1-1RFB, having an approximately 1500 \u212b chromium orienting layer and an approximately 570 \u212b film composed of 75% cobalt, 18% nickel, and 7% chromium. Magnetic field values H are expressed in Oersteds; Hc and Hs values are determined directly from the M-H plot (each H-axis line marking in FIG. 4 represents 2\ufffd102 Oersteds). Remanence values are expressed as Mr.t values were calculated by driving Mr, determined from the M-H plot (each M-axis line marking in FIG. 4 represents 4\ufffd10-3 EMU) by the examined area of the medium, expressed in cm2., 21705=The pallet is first moved into an upstream deposition region underlying an upstream portion of the first target, during which the substrate is shielded to limit deposition of sputtered material substantially to (a) substrate regions which directly underlie the target and (b) target side regions which are substantially symmetrical with respect to the center-line path of travel of the substrate. The deposition of sputtered material in the upstream deposition region is effective to produce a coalesced crystal layer, at least about 200 \u212b thick, whose crystal orientation directions are substantially isotropic. The target is then moved into a downstream deposition region underlying a downstream portion of the first target, where sputtering takes place under conditions which substantially preserve the crystal isotropy of the coalesced crystal layer, and which produce a final chromium underlayer thickness of between about 1000 and 4000 \u212b., 60643=As seen above, the disk of the invention combines high coercivity and high remanence, giving excellent signal and information storage characteristics. According to one aspect of the invention, coercivity in the disk is increased substantially by the selected alloy composition used in forming the magnetic film, as will now be discussed. To assess the effect of the alloy composition on disk coercivity, disks having magnetic thin films composed of either cobalt/chromium (88/12 weight percent), cobalt/nickel (80/20 weight percent), or cobalt/nickel/chromium (75/18/7 weight percent) were prepared, substantially according to the production method described above. Briefly, the disks were each formed with a chromium orienting layer, sputtered to a thickness of about 1500 \u212b, and a magnetic recording film, sputtered to a thickness of about 400-500 \u212b. Mr.t and intrinsic coercivity values for each disk were measured from M-H hysteresis-loop curves, as detailed above. Mr.t values were about 4.0\ufffd10-3 EMU/cm2 for all three alloys. The coercivity values obtained were: cobalt/chromium, 500 Oersteds; cobalt/nickel, 650 Oersteds; and cobalt/nickel/chromium, 950 Oersteds. As can be appreciated, the alloy composition used in forming the disk of the invention increased coercivity nearly twofold over that obtainable with binary cobalt/chromium used commonly in the prior art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to particular and preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the invention. FIG. 11 shows the results of testing by a disk media manufacturer (not the manufacturer of the present invention), to compare amplitude/resolution characteristics of a number of commercially available 51/4\" media, including the disk produced in accordance with the present invention. The six disk manufacturers are identified by number, with media numbers 2, 5, and 6 (produced according to the present invention) being the same as in Table IV. The data measures inner diameter resolution at a given frequency as a function of outer diameter amplitude. The target plot shows a calculated theoretical maximum, and is normalized to provide an inner diameter resolution value of 100 at an outer diameter amplitude value of 100. The actual test data are plotted in relation to the target values. All of the media show the expected inverse relationship between amplitude and resolution. Of the six media tested, including three media not shown in Table IV, the disk formed according to the present invention (#6) most closely attained theoretical maximum performance values. As seen, the disk of the present invention (made by Vendor 6) has higher resolution characteristics, particularly at the inner diameter, a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and a sharper pulse width signal than any of the other commercial",
