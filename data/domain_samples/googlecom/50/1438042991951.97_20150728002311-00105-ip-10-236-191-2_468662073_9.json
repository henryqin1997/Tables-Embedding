    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although certain embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated herein, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that a number of modifications and substitutions can be made to the blow molding system disclosed and described herein without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In this case of molding large parts with a modulus of elasticity greater than 1,000,000 PSI, it may be desirable to use engineering resins instead of polyolefins. Such engineering resins may include polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a PC/ABS blend, polyethylene terephthalates (PET), polybutylene terephthalates (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), or the like. Generally, these materials in an unreinforced state have a modulus of elasticity of about 300,000 PSI\u2013350,000 PSI. At these higher loadings of nanoparticles (8\u201315% by volume), impact resistance will be decreased, but to a much lower extent than the addition of the conventional 25\u201340% by volume of glass fibers. Use of the plastic melt 20 as described above enables the blow molding apparatus disclosed herein to manufacture large parts that can be provided with impact resistance characteristics that were not previously attainable. For example, the blow molding system of the present invention is able to manufacture large parts having a modulus of elasticity of greater than 1,000,000 PSI by use of the plastic melt reinforced with loadings of 8\u201315% by volume of nanoparticles, with at",
