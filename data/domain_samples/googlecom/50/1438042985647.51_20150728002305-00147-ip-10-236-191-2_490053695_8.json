    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above embodiments are only illustrative of the principles of this invention and are not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. One skilled in the art should recognize that resources could include all types of resources such as software applications, hardware devices, computing machines, and etc. In particular, it is contemplated that functional implementation of the invention described herein may be implemented equivalently in hardware, software, firmware, and/or other available functional components or building blocks. Accordingly, various modifications, adaptations, and combinations of various features of the described embodiments can be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. If user requests to end the application, an application terminator ends the application and access allocation remaining on the sub-token(s) is returned to the system database and/or directory service 9400. If user continues to run the application, the token monitor initiates application via an application initiator 9200 until a sub-token expires. When a sub-token expires, the token monitor renews the sub-token 9500. If renewal is successful, a sub-token is created and sent to the token monitor 9100 and the fulfillment process reiterates 9000. If renewal is not successful, the token monitor ends the application 9600 via the application terminator. Additionally, the token monitor comprises a criteria evaluator (e.g. a timer, a counter, a calendar, a heat sensor, and etc.) that determines the expiration of",
