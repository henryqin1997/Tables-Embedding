    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39925=And for another example, in a multipolar reactor of 15 liters serviceable volume, using permanent magnets of baryum ferrite and an excitation at 2.45 GHz, with a simple 15 cm-long antenna, it was possible to obtain a pressure of 10-1 Pa, an argon plasma of electron density n=3\ufffd1010 cm3 with an injected microwave power of 100 watts. In this case, the electronic temperature is around 18,000 K (1.6 electronvolt). With three antennas distributed over the surface, the density obtained is close to 1011 cm3.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The case illustrated in FIGS. 1, 4 and 5 is that of the production of plasma and of its confinement in one closed multipolar structure. In certain applications, for which the confinement and plasma uniformity requirements are not so strict, it is possible to use an excitation device according to the invention, for example associated to a bar and antenna, such as illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3a and 3b, just for generating the plasma. The different magnets may also be placed on a nonclosed structure where the sole requirements are linked to the introduction of the plasma and not to its confinement. In this case, requirements as to the position of the magnets are not so strict and for example, a non-alternation of the magnetic poles is tolerated. Such a device is well adapted to the creation of large-sized sources of plasma, such as for example plasma tunnels, and to the production of ions. Another fact to be noted is that the structure of the device according to the invention permits different applications. In the absence of plasma, the microwave power introduced in the reactor can permit a very efficient degassing of the inside of the enclosure 10, helping in particular the elimination of any traces of steam, which are a particular problem with fluorinated plasmas and chlorinated plasmas. In the case where co-axial cables are used, the transport of microwave energy is inexpensive and easily",
