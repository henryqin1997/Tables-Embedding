As a result, 340 g of polyethylene having a MI valve of 0.070 g/10 min. and a FR valve of 95 was obtained. The polymerization activity K was 2210., 57795=The ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the hydrocarbonisoluble solid catalytic component is in the range of 0.1-100, preferably 0.2-20 as expressed by an atomic ratio of Al/(V+Ti+Hf) or Al/(V+Ti+Hf+Zr) when a zirconium compound is additionally used., 59324=Presence of hydrogen in a polymerization reaction zone is very effective in controlling the molecular weight of polymer, ensuring a polymer with a desired molecular weight. The amount of hydrogen to be present in the zone depends on the polymerization conditions or the molecular weight of a required olefin polymer and should be controlled accordingly. As described hereinbefore, the molecular weight controlling effect by hydrogen is especially noticeable when a solid catalytic component prepared from titanium, vanadium, hafnium and organoaluminum bromide compounds is used. In this case, for example, in order to produce a polymer having a melt index of 0.3-0.05 at a polymerization temperature of 90\ufffd C., it is sufficient to add hydrogen in an amount of about 50-150 mole % of ethylene., 62548=Then, 500 ml of n-hexane was placed in an 1 l autoclave, into which 20 mg of the solid catalytic component and 0.8 m mols of triisobutylaluminum were charged. The mixture was heated to 85\ufffd C. and then incorporated with hydrogen up to a pressure of 14 kg/cm2. Thereafter, ethylene was fed for polymerization at a total pressure of 20 kg/cm2 and, after one hour of the feed, ethanol was charged under pressure to stop the polymerization. As a result, 121 g of polyethylene was obtained and its polymerization activity K was 1010 and MI was 0.0015 g/10 min., 61042=In examples, the polymerization activity K of catalyst was expressed as follows: K=(g.polymer)/(g.catalyst)(hr.) (kg/cm2 of pressure of olefin). The melt index was measured at 190\ufffd C. under a load of 2.16 kg based on the method prescribed in ASTM.D.1238.57T and expressed in terms of MI. The flow ratio (hereinlater abbreviated as FR) as a measure for molecular weight distribution is a value showing a shear stress dependency of a melt viscosity and was expressed by a ratio (MI 106 /MI 105) of melt indexes measured at shear stresses of 106 dyne/cm2 and 105 dyne/cm2, respectively, on the basis of the method in ASTM.D.1238.57T. It is generally accepted that the greater the FR, the wider is a molecular weight distribution, and vice versa. The density \u03c1 was measured according to the method prescribed in ASTM D-1505., 83220=As a result, 325 g of a polymer having MI=0.080 g/10 min. and FR=100 was obtained. The polymerization activity K was found to be K=2110., 23636=Heretofore it is well known to polymerize \u03b1-olefins such as ethylene by the use of so-called Ziegler catalysts composed of transition metal compounds and organoaluminum compounds. For instance, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 49-11269, there has been proposed a catalytic system which comprises an eutectic crystal material obtained by reducing a mixture or reaction product of a titanium tetrahalide and a vanadium oxyalkoxide with an organoaluminum compound, and an organoaluminum compound. This catalyst system has very great advantages in production of polymer that it exhibits very high catalytic activity and that polymers obtained by the use of the catalytic system are narrow in distribution of particle size and high in bulk density.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As was seen from the foregoing, the process of the invention has particular utility in the production of polyolefins, particularly polyethylene, for extrusion or blow molding. Industrial Utility Example 39 was repeated except that a feed of hydrogen was 4.9 kg/cm2 and an amount of butene-1 was 100 g. The average molar ratio of butene-1 to ethylene in the gas phase was 1.6 mol %. As a result, 4,100 g of ethylene-butene-1 copolymer was obtained and its polymerization activity was 1,840. The polymer was found to have a MI value of 0.07 g/10 min., a FR value of 69 and a density of 0.955 g/cc. As a result of the test for extrusion moldability, an amount of extrusion molding was found to be 15 g/rpm.hr. and no abnormal flow phenomenon was recognized. (2) Polymerization Example 39 was repeated using 10 m mols of the zirconium compound, 10 m mols of the hafnium compound and 240 m mols of ethylaluminum dibromide thereby preparing a solid catalytic component. It was found that x/r=4.7, (Zr+Hf)/Ti=1.0, and (Ti+Zr+Hf)/V=2.0. (1) Preparation of Solid Catalytic Component EXAMPLE 41 Example 39 was repeated except that a feed of hydrogen was 5.9 kg/cm2 and an amount of butene-1 was 85 g. The average molar ratio of butene-1 to ethylene in the gas phase was 1.9 mol %. As a result, 3,300 g of ethylene-butene-1 copolymer was",
