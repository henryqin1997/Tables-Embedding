In this connection, decoding may be programmed in accordance with specifications containing decoding algorithms, which are published by the Automatic Identification Manufacturers Association (called \"AIM\"). There are specification documents for each symbology. For example, for code I2 of 5, the specification is contained in a document entitled \"USS-I2 of 5\". For code 39, the document is identified as USS-39. These documents were available in 1986., 15421=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/283,923, filed Aug. 1, 1994, now abandoned which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/059,796, filed May 10, 1993 now abandoned., 23802=The microcomputer has a COMPORT which is an I/O port and may have an arrangement of pins in accordance with the RS-232 protocol. These pins are nine in number. They are connected to lines on a cable or communications linked to the scanner via a security circuit 26. The scanner may include a digitizer 28, which provides the data representing signals in the form of pulses of varying width corresponding to the width of the bars of the code. Such a bar code scanner and the digitizing circuit used may be of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,597 issued Apr. 6, 1993 to J. M. Eastman, et al.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that there has been provided an improved system for handling and processing data representing symbols which are read by a scanner, which enables a microcomputer, of the type which is generally available, to be used as a platform for decoding, reformatting, displaying and otherwise characterizing the symbol. Variations and modifications in the herein described system, within the scope of the invention, will undoubtedly suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the foregoing description should be taken as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. If the quiet zone is detected (indicated at B, as it was indicated at A in the routine) the bar count and the bar width data bytes, which are recorded in the memory space of the computer, are presented for decoding. In other words, the bar widths, which are now translated into bytes, are decoded in accordance with the applicable decoding algorithm. These algorithms involve detection of the symbology and comparison of various combinations of the bytes with data representing characters (letters or numerals) which the bars of the code represent, and are along the lines set forth in the AIM and/or UPC specifications. In the 11th process, the end of the current bar is detected. If the bar end has not been detected as yet, the 12th process, which is similar to the 7th process, is carried out. In the case",
