A conventional precoat using TEOS is typically deposited at, for example, between about 1500 and 2200 angstroms/min. The thin precoat is typically applied for about 10 to 60 seconds, providing a precoat having a thickness ranging from about 0.025 \u03bcm to 0.22 \u03bcm for TEOS deposition., 33995=The deposition rates for the undercoat are relatively high and may be, for example, between about 2700 and 5000 angstroms/min, or higher. The actual range of deposition rates will typically depend on the material being used for the deposition. The deposition rate of the precoat (and the oxide layer on wafer 100) is less than for an undercoat made using the same material and may be, for example, between about 1500 and 3000 angstroms/min., 30839=The thickness of the deposited material is typically at a minimum for wafers processed immediately after the chamber has been cleaned. The CVD oxide layer deposited on the first wafer in each of the series graphed in FIG. 1 had a thickness ranging from 2460 nm to 2480 nm. The oxide layer thickness increased nonlinearly through the series of wafer until the oxide layer formed on the final wafer in each series had a thickness ranging from 2520 nm to 2540 nm. The difference in oxide layer thickness for these two series ranged from about 5% to 80 nm, which is about 2 to 30 of the total thickness., 34455=By way of example, a process for forming a TEOS silicon dioxide layer using TEOS and O2 and the above-described techniques will be illustrated. After cleaning the chamber, an undercoating of TEOS-generated silicon dioxide is applied to the chamber. The deposition rate for an undercoat using TEOS may be, for example, between about 2700 and 3700 angstroms/min. The undercoat is typically applied to a thickness of at least 1.5 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the undercoat thickness is at least about 1.8 \u03bcm and, in others, at least about 2.0 \u03bcm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As noted above, the present invention is applicable to the fabrication of a number of different devices which contain a layer formed by CVD. Accordingly, the present invention should not be considered limited to the particular examples described above, but rather should be understood to cover all aspects of the invention as fairly set out in the attached claims. Various modifications, equivalent processes, as well as numerous structures to which the present invention may be applicable will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art to which the present invention is directed upon review of the present specification. The claims are intended to cover such modifications and devices. The temperature ramp and the undercoat may both be used simultaneously to enhance the uniformity of the thickness of the deposition layer on the wafer. A combination of temperature ramp and undercoat may also save processing time, as a thinner undercoat may be used; the non-uniformity introduced by the thinner undercoat being compensated by the temperature ramp. The temperature ramp may, instead, be a series of steps, as depicted in FIG. 52. The steps may, for example, occur when each wafer is placed into the chamber or when each wafer is removed from the chamber. One example of a stepped temperature ramp is a ramp between 395\ufffd C. and 400\ufffd C. with 0.5\ufffd C. increases in temperature for each of the first ten wafers. The size",
