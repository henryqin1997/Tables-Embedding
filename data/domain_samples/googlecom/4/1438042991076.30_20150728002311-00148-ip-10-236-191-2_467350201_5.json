    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing has outlined, rather broadly, preferred and alternative features of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention as stated herein. Moreover, those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing or modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form. From the above, it is apparent that the present invention provides a method of roughing a metallic surface. The method includes the steps of positioning a pressurized grit source a predetermined distance from and at an angle substantially perpendicular to the metallic surface of the object that is to be roughened and projecting grit, which has a grit size ranging from twenty-five to forty-seven, from the pressurized grit source against the metallic surface at a velocity sufficient to form an indentation on the metallic surface that has a depth of at least about 160 micro inches. The first, second and third graphs 410, 420, 430 illustrate that over a pressure range, from 70 psi to 90 psi, used to propel the grit onto a metallic surface, the resulting surface roughness of the metallic surface is greater than 190",
