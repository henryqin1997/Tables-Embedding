Whatever the particular function of the distal element may be, the joint assembly holds the functional element with its major axis aligned with the major axis of the catheter body 12 for convenient steering to the tissue site. The joint assembly then pivots the functional element in response to an external force to orient its major axis generally parallel to the plane of the tissue site without bending the catheter body 12. The inventions are also applicable for supporting any functional element at the distal end of the catheter body 12. For example, instead of supporting a microwave antenna 18, the joint assembly can support other active elements or electrodes for tissue ablation using RF, laser, and the like. The joint assembly can also support passive monitoring elements, like one or more mapping electrodes, MAP elements, or ultrasound electrodes. The inventions provide a steerable microwave antenna assembly that maximizes the propagation of radiation heating patterns for deep lesion formation. It should be appreciated that other microwave antenna structures (for example, an omnidirectional whip antenna) can be similarly attached to a pivot assembly at the end of a catheter to achieve the benefits of the invention. In FIG. 11, the shaft 80 of the ball 78 is retained within a partial slot 82. The partial slot 82 allows pivotal movement of the ball",
