    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35825=SVMR sensors exhibit the desired level of magnetoresistance (deltaR/R between the parallel and antiparallel alignments of the magnetizations of the pinned and free layers) at very small thicknesses. Thus, to achieve very high density recording the MR read gap between the two MR shields must be very thin, typically below 2000 \u212b. This places constraints upon the electrical continuity of the gap material, which must electrically isolate the SVMR sensor from one or both of the MR shields., 29251=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/497,324 filed on Jun. 30, 1995, now abandoned., 39553=FIG. 8 is a graph of the magnetoresistance versus applied magnetic field of a SVMR sensor using an NiO-based laminated AP-pinned structure (NiO/Co/Ru/Co) over a field excursion of 1000 Oe showing that the exchange field is 600 Oe, substantially larger than in conventional SVMR sensors., 58140=While in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the laminated AP-pinned layer 70 comprises two ferromagnetic films 72, 74 separated by a single APC film 73, the laminated AP-pinned layer 70 may comprise a multiple number of ferromagnetic films separated by APC films. Depending on the materials selected for the ferromagnetic films 72, 74 and APC film 73 in the laminated AP-pinned layer 70, there is a preferred APC film thickness at which the ferromagnetic films 72, 74 become strongly antiferromagnetically coupled. For the case of the preferred Co/Ru combination, the thickness of the Ru AF coupling film can be selected to be between 2-8 \u212b. The oscillatory coupling relationship for selected material combinations is described in detail by Parkin et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 64, p. 2034 (1990). While the laminated AP-pinned layer in the SVMR sensor has been shown with the preferred materials of Co and Ru as the ferromagnetic and APC films, respectively, other ferromagnetic materials (such as Co, Fe, Ni, and their alloys, such as Ni--Fe, Ni--Co, and Fe--Co) with other APC films (such as chromium (Cr), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), Cu, and their alloys) are possible. For each such material combination, the oscillatory exchange coupling relationship would have to be determined, if not already known, so that the thickness of the APC film is selected to assure antiferromagnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic films., 39859=FIG. 9 is a graph of the magnetoresistance versus applied magnetic field of a SVMR sensor using a NiO-based single layer pinned structure (NiO/Co) over a field excursion of 1200 Oe showing a low exchange field of about 100 Oe., 56182=FIG. 8 shows the magnetoresistance of the NiO-based laminated AP-pinned SVMR sensor with the same structure as described for FIG. 6 over a field excursion of \ufffd1000 Oe. With a layer of 420 \u212b NiO as the AF layer the exchange anisotropy energy was approximately 0.02 erg/cm2, so that exchange field Hex of about 600 Oe was obtained, as shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 8 shows that even at such high fields, this SVMR sensor's response is dominated by reversible rotation of the laminated AP-pinned layer, so that the magnetoresistance is unchanged when the film is subjected to such high fields. Thus, the SVMR sensor with the NiO-based laminated AP-pinned layer greatly exceeds the level of desired stability against high fields. In contrast to this response, FIG. 9 shows that this criterion is clearly violated if the NiO AF layer is used with a conventional single-layer pinned layer. The SVMR sensor whose MR response is shown in FIG. 9 had a single 35 Angstrom Co layer as the pinned layer pinned by a 420 \u212b NiO AF layer. FIG. 9 shows that the exchange field is only about 120 Oe and that the pinned layer begins to rotate within an applied field of only about 200 Oe.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit, scope, and teaching of the invention. Accordingly, the disclosed invention is to be considered merely as illustrative and limited in scope only as specified in the appended claims. In addition to NiO and (Fe50 Mn50)Cr3 as the AF layers for use with the laminated AP-pinned layer in SVMR sensors, another material that would otherwise be unusable as an AF material in SVMR sensors, but that will provide the necessary corrosion resistance and sufficient exchange anisotropy is (Ni1-x Cox)O, where x is between approximately 0 and 0.5. FIG. 11 shows the magnetoresistance versus applied field for the SVMR sensor embodiment shown in FIG. 10, as compared to other SVMR sensors, but wherein the corrosion resistant AF layer is an alloy of Fe--Mn and chromium (Cr), e.g., (Fe50 Mn20)97 Cr3, instead of NiO. Curve A in FIG. 11 is for a SVMR sensor with a conventional single layer pinned layer using Fe50 Mn50 as the antiferromagnet and shows an exchange field of about 220 Oe. Curve B is for a SVMR sensor with a conventional pinned layer using (Fe50 Mn50)97 Cr3 as the antiferromagnet and shows an exchange field of about 160 Oe. While (Fe50 Mn50)97 Cr3",
