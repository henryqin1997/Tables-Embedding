FIG. 8 shows container 120 after removal of bag 54 with its fine particle contents. To reduce the storage size, sleeve 122 can be pleated and compressed after removal of the sleeve's contents. FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a semi-bulk container 120 with bag 54 placed therein during shipping container 120 protects the bag against puncture and also provides for a fixed form that can be stacked. A suitable reusable container is sold by Shuert Industries, Inc. of Sterling Heights, Mich. The reusable container can also take the form of a plastic crate having a structural framework similar to the design of a typical milk crate. Reusable containers 120 are shown in FIG. 7 to include sleeve portion 122 which is preferably formed of plastic/fiberboard composition such as a wet strength kraft liner board with PBC film exterior. The sleeve is attached at its top to cap 124 which is preferably formed of a molded high density polyethylene resin and includes suitable locking devices [not shown] for attachment of the top 124 to sleeve 122. Pallet base 126 is lockingly fixed to sleeve 122 at the bottom of container 120. Top 124 is",
