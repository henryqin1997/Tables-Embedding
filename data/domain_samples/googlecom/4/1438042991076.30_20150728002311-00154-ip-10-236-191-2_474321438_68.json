It should be noted that in the above examples for the send and publish operations, the \u201cBody\u201d attribute is used to specify the content of the JMS Text message that is sent. In cases where the body of the message is not important, this attribute may be ignored since it is not a required attribute of the operation element. In one embodiment, the default value for the message body of a JMS text message is a JAVA string of 1024 bytes in size containing the letter \u201ca\u201d., 28822=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/442,780, filed Jan. 27, 2003, and is incorporated herein by reference., 29545=This application is related to U.S. Utility patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to the practitioner skilled in the art. Particularly, it will be evident that additional JMS markup language (JMSML) operations can be developed in accordance with the specifications described herein. The JMSML methodology and language may also be used with application servers in addition to the WebLogic Server. It will also be evident that other types of command-line environment, interfaces, and Integrated Design Environment (IDE) can be devised to allow a software developer to design, test, and implement JMSML-based applications. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments and with various modifications that are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the following claims and their equivalence. In some embodiments, the present invention includes a computer program product which is a storage medium (media) having instructions stored thereon/in which can be used to program a computer to perform any of the processes of the present invention.
