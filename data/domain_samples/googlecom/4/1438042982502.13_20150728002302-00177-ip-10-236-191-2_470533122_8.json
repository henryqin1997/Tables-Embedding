The microcomputer then determines whether the gain factor is to be modified or additionally modified in accordance with the subtracted grey level. This is similar to the modification described in relation to the first example. If such a modification is required, a look-up table is addressed using the subtracted grey level and a grey level factor is selected. This factor may, for example, be defined in a similar manner to that shown in FIG. 4. The selected gain factor, possibly after modification by a coefficient, is then multiplied by the grey level factor. Each of the coefficients will typically be in the range 0-1 but coefficients greater than 1.0 or less than zero are also feasible. Firstly, the gain factor may be modified in accordance with the colour of the maximum equivalent colour component. Since there are six possible equivalent colour components C, Y, M, R, G and V, six coefficients are empirically determined and stored in a look-up table. The microcomputer then determines whether modification by a coefficient is required and if it is determines the colour of the larger equivalent colour component and selects the corresponding coefficient. The previously selected gain factor is then multiplied by this coefficient. A typical coefficient has",
