    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description of the preferred embodiment. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such alterations and modifications insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or equivalents thereof. In operation, as in the earlier described embodiment, a patient is placed on the table top 18. The guard assembly 50 prevents the patient from placing their fingers around the end of the table top assembly 18 and into clearance space 34. Instead, the patient will grasp the guard plate 51. The patient's fingers will extend into space 56 and will not interfere with table base 16 during longitudinal motion of table top assembly 18. The preferred dimensions of guard plate 51, clamp plate 52 and bottom plate 53 are shown in FIGS. 7, 8, and 9. When the fasteners 54 are tightened down, the guard plate 51 is forced to conform to the angled shape of bottom plate 53 causing guard plate 51 to extend above the surface and beyond the end of table top 18. This angular extension of guard plate 51 defines an area or space, shown at 66 which is remote to clearance space 34. The guard assembly 50 is fixedly mounted on the surface of the metal frame 30 at at",
