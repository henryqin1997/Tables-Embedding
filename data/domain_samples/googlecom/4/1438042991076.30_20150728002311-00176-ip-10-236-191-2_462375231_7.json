No. 11/191,464, filed Jul. 27, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes., 50903=Using hydrogen as the implanted species into the silicon wafer as an example, the implantation process is performed using a specific set of conditions. Implantation dose ranges from about 1015 to about 1018 atoms/cm2, and preferably the dose is greater than about 1016 atoms/cm2. Implantation energy ranges from about 1 KeV to about 1 MeV, and is generally about 50 KeV. Implantation temperature ranges from about 20 to about 600 Degrees Celsius, and is preferably less than about 400 Degrees Celsius to prevent a possibility of a substantial quantity of hydrogen ions from diffusing out of the implanted silicon wafer and annealing the implanted damage and stress. The hydrogen ions can be selectively introduced into the silicon wafer to the selected depth at an accuracy of about +/\u22120.03 to +/\u22120.05 microns. Of course, the type of ion used and process conditions depend upon the application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention which is defined by the appended claims. . As shown, the initial cleaving process removed a thickness of material from each of the donor substrate regions provided on the transfer substrate. The remaining donor substrate regions may be subjected to a surface smoothing process, oxidized and implanted again to form another cleave region within each of the donor substrate regions. The donor substrate regions, which now include the plurality of cleave regions, are subjected to a bonding process to another handle substrate and a cleaving process to form a tiled handle substrate including a plurality of donor substrate portions. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives. FIG. 7 Additional processes may include a \u201creuse\u201d process according to a specific embodiment, as illustrated by Next, the present method performs other processes on portions of the donor substrate regions, which have been attached to the handle substrate. The method forms one or more devices on one or more portions of the donor substrate portions spatially disposed overlying the handle substrate surface regions. Such devices can include integrated semiconductor devices, photonic and/or optoelectronic devices (e.g., light valves), piezoelectronic devices, microelectromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d), nano-technology",
