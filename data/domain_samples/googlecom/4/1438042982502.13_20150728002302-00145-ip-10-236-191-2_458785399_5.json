The Bippus patent discloses an anti-kickback device for mounting on table saws or radial arm saws that prevents the saw from throwing the board being cut back into the operator doing the feeding., 28626=U.S. Pat. No. 2,984,268 to Vuichard, issued May 16, 1961 discloses a manually actuated saw brake in combination with a radial arm saw. The brake specifically operates to quickly halt the rotation of the cutting element after deenergization of the cutting element motor. The patent does not relate to inadvertent acceleration of the saw in the direction of the user., 27864=Various patents have issued with regard to safety brakes for saws. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,434,174 to Morgan, issued Jan. 6, 1948 discloses a safety brake for a bandsaw blade. The brake automatically stops and firmly holds the blade in the event that it should break or become too loose. The U.S. Pat. No. 2,500,321 to Petersen, issued Mar. 14, 1950 discloses an automatic hydraulic brake for bandsaws for instantly stopping relative motion between the tool and the work support of the machine tool upon stopping of the drive motor or breakage of the tool. Neither of these patents relate to the problems encountered in radial arm saws nor the specific problem of a radial arm saw inadvertently accelerating in the direction of the user., 26510=Various types of radial arm saw guards have been developed. U.S. Pat. No. 2,522,789 to Johnson, issued Sept. 19, 1950 discloses a radial arm mounting for power driven saws providing no guard. U.S. Pat. No. 3,884,101 to Silkin, issued May 20, 1975 discloses a radial arm saw guard for the exposed lower portion of the blade of the saw. U.S. Pat. No. 4,043,237 to Pyle, issued Aug. 23, 1977 discloses a transparent awareness guard in the form of a flat plate form attached to a conventional upper saw guard of a radial arm saw. U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,571 to Batson, issued Dec. 4, 1979 discloses a guard mechanism for a radial saw comprising a guard pivotally mounted to a housing for covering a front portion of the blade. U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,288 to Olsen et al, issued Jan. 20, 1987 discloses a saw apparatus including a safety device comprising means for gripping, positioning and clamping a workpiece relative to a workpiece support structure and a second normally biased off switch connected in series with a first normally biased off switch requiring both hands of an operator to be holding onto normally off switches to actuate the saw mechanism. None of the aforementioned patents provides any means for breaking the movement of a radial arm saw if the saw moves towards the user at a speed greater than a predetermined safe speed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims wherein reference numerals are merely for convenience and are not to be in any way limiting, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. All four embodiments of the present invention are useful in preventing the above described kickback in a radial arm saw. The invention can be further used as a safety device in combination with any machine, tool, or device where excessive velocity of movement is not safe or desired and should be stopped. More specifically, the pinion gear 44\"' has an axis of rotation defined by the axle 84'. The centrifugally driven locking member 82' includes at least one latch member 82' connected to the pinion gear 44\"' for pivoting movement radially towards the axis of rotation 84' and a biasing spring 86' for biasing the latch member 82' away from the axis of rotation 84'. The latch member 82' includes a weighted end portion 94 for reacting to centrifugal force applied to the latch member 82' to overcome the biasing force of",
