RFID system 88 operates within a frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as 13.56 MHz, with an allowable frequency variance of +/\u22127 kHz, which is often used for Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) applications. However, other frequencies may be used for RFID applications, and the invention is not so limited. For example, some RFID systems in large storage areas such as a warehouse may use an RFID system that operates at approximately 900 MHz. , the distance between the files or documents and, more particularly, the RFID tags associated with those articles generally cannot be fixed to a minimum distance. In accordance with the techniques described herein, the RFID tags of system 88 dynamically and automatically vary their resonant frequency to aid communication to an interrogation device, such as a smart storage area. As a result, tag-to-tag coupling may occur, yet the RFID tags may achieve increased ability to reliably communicate with the RFID interrogation devices of system 88. FIG. 7 In an environment as illustrated in In some embodiments, storage areas 90 may be \u201csmart storage areas.\u201d The term \u201csmart storage area\u201d is used generally to refer to a storage area for a document or other item that is equipped with RFID interrogation capability to aid in tracking",
