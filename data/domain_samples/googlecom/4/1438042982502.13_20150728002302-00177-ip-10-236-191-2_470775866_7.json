Today, many modems can transmit voice and fax as well as data. Modems are currently implemented in a variety of ways. For example, a host based \u201ccontrollerless\u201d modem typically includes a codec on a peripheral board, but the modem controller code is executed by a host processor. A native signal processing modem typically implements a signal processing component on the host system itself to generate modem signals. Peripheral modems processor in conjunction with a modem microcontroller, and a strictly digital signal processor oriented approach. All of these approaches, however, provide for code that is either executed by the host processor, the microcontroller on the modem itself, or the digital signal processing code to implement the modem functionality. These approaches necessarily enhance the flexibility of modems, especially when this code is implemented in a flash ROM. This is because the modem can be reconfigured to adapt it to new implementations of communication protocols and to add other features that may be desirable in the modem., 27248=This is a continuation of U.S. Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details. While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention are illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various changes in the size, shape, materials, components, circuit elements, wiring connections and contacts, as well as in the details of the illustrated circuitry and construction and method of operation may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Also, although the present modem has been disclosed as being implemented with an analog line modem, the examples given could similarly be used on BRI ISDN, PRI ISDN, or other digital transports as well. Although the disclosed embodiment is principally directed to software modem, such as controllerless modem implemented on a host system or a digital signal processor, the techniques according to the invention could be similarly implemented employing a modem driver in conjunction with a standard hardware modem that supports telephony features. For example, the modem driver capable of",
