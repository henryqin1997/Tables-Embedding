Additionally, the spiral thread 17 is arranged at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the normal to the longitudinal axis 33 of the auger 16. The angle \u03b8 is at least 12\ufffd. Accordingly, because of the coarse pitch P of the spiral thread 17 the sides 34 of the thread which act against the paste material being dispensed are substantially increased, as compared to the lengths of the sides of the prior art augers which have substantially finer threads, so that the auger 16 is able to dispense a high viscosity material onto the seal edge 12 of the funnel 13. Accordingly, the novel pitch P of the auger 16 is also effective in allowing the apparatus 10 to dispense high viscosity materials uniformly around the loop seal edge 11. A sensor 31 is affixed to the apparatus 10 by an appropriate mounting bracket 32. The sensor 31 can be a light sensor, or an acoustical sensor, both of which are well known in the art, and is used to sense the beginning of the bead 11 as the bead approaches completion around the looped seal edge 12. The signal from the sensor 31 is used to cause the actuation of",
