    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{144121=The external subsystem 378 may also include a controller area network (CAN) found in at least some vehicles and which includes a bus along which a number of vehicle elements communicate for supplying information concerning such elements. The CAN is operatively connected to each of a plurality of vehicle devices that transmit, receive, or both transmit and receive desired data. For example, the vehicle devices include transducers or other physical devices that detect and provide information useful to applications software for processing to obtain information that is then transmitted for storing in memory for later transmission, or even for immediate transmission without processing, upon receipt of the proper request or command. Other available networks could be utilized, instead of CAN, such as Arcnet, which has a protocol similar to CAN. Where the external subsystem 378 includes one of a plurality of vehicle busses, the hardware supplied for interconnecting the external subsystem to the interface module 106, such as the daughter board 380, may include provisions for signaling to the interface module microprocessor 328 the format of the output required by the particular external subsystem 378. For example, the daughter board 380 may comprise cabling, and the presence or absence of a resistor between two signal paths may be used to indicate to the microprocessor 328 the proper voltage at which signals are to be transferred to and from the external subsystem 378. For further information regarding obtaining information or data from vehicle devices, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,732,074, filed on Jan. 16, 1996 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The external subsystem 378 may also comprise an analog/digital converter (ADC), a standard serial bus, a universal serial bus (USB), an RS232 connection, a user datagram packet/Internet protocol stack, as well as one or more other custom proprietary devices.}",
