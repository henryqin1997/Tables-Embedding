Briefly, following lysis, 50 \u03bcl of probe mix (containing DNA biotinylated probe) was added to each well. The plate was sealed and incubated at 65\ufffd C. for 1.5 hours for hybridization to occur. After hybridization, samples were transferred to a strepavidin-coated microplate, and 25 \u03bcL of anti-hybrid antibody was added to each well. The plate was agitated at 1100 RPM, for 1 hour, at room temperature. Wells were washed 6\ufffd times with 65\ufffd C. wash buffer, followed by one wash using distilled water. 100 \u03bcl of a chemiluminescent substrate was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The plate was then read in the DML 2000 luminometer. The data was then expressed as signal-to-noise. Using a calibration curve, the chemiluminescent signal generated by each specimen was converted into mRNA copies per cell., 34877=Agents able to inhibit degradation of RNA, DNA and/or protein are well-known in the art. They can work by either inhibiting enzymes or sequestering metal ions or both. Nuclease or protease inhibitors such as RNasin or pepstatin or chelating agents can be used according to this invention. Preferred agents to inhibit degradation of RNA, DNA and/or protein are chelating agents. Chelating agents are well-known in the art (see, for example, Data For Biochemical Research, Third Ed., Rex M. C. Dawson et al., Oxford University Press 1986, at chapter 17) and are known to both attenuate metal ion-induced and enzymatic degradation of biopolymers. Non-limiting examples of chelating agents for use in this invention include murexide, chromotropic acid, 1-(1-hydroxy-2-napththylazo-2-hydroxy-5-nitronaphthalene-4-sulphonic acid, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), o-phenanthroline, thiourea and the like. A preferred chelating agent is EDTA., 16922=This application claims the benefit of priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/082,167, filed Apr. 17, 1998; Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/070,486, filed Jan. 5, 1998; and Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/069,426, filed Dec. 12, 1997., 34016=The cross-linking agents of this invention comprise about 1% to about 25% of the UCM formulation. Preferably, the cross-linking agents comprise about 1% to about 15% or from about 1% to about 10%. Most preferably, the cross-linking agent comprises about 1% to about 5% of the UCM formulation. Cross-linking agents (also known as fixatives) are well-known in the art (see, for example, Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 25th Edition, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore Md. 1990 at page 592) and their use in the UCM formulation is now readily apparent to those of skill in the art in light of the present invention. Non-limiting examples of the cross-linking agents for use in the UCM formulation include aldehydes such formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and the like. A preferred cross-linking agent is glutaraldehyde-bisulfite.}",
