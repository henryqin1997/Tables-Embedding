The shape of the passageway 60 may also be varied from that shown in FIG. 10. FIG. 11 illustrates a third embodiment of a passageway 60\u2033 which includes a longitudinal wide hole 601\u2033 and a lateral narrow hole 602\u2033 communicating with the longitudinal wide hole 601\u2033. The engagement plates 52 of the contact 5 are engaged within the lateral narrow hole 602\u2033 and the torsion beam 51 of the contact 5 is rotatably received in the longitudinal wide hole 601\u2033. The shape of the passageway 60 may be varied from that shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 10 illustrates a second embodiment of a passageway 60\u2032 which includes a longitudinal wide hole 601\u2032 and a lateral narrow hole 602\u2032 substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal wide hole 601\u2032. Similar to previous embodiment, the engagement plates 52 of each contact 5 is retained in the lateral narrow hole 602\u2032 and the spring arms 53 are deformable in the longitudinal wide hole 601\u2032.
