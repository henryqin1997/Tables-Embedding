First, a ring oscillator of 1001 stages comprising a plurality of the transistors of each sample was constituted, and the propagation delay time was measured. From the result, those with a yield of 90% or more were rated as \u229a, and those with above several % as x., 34905=Here, a base electrode 1120 comprising a polysilicon doped with boron (B) and an emitter electrode comprising polysilicon doped with arsenic (As) are constituted proximate to each other. However, because the electrode is constituted of a polysilicon and the contact portion between the electrode and the base wiring 1122 must be at a position apart from the base region 1114, there are technical tasks to be solved to avoid difficulty in providing an increase of base resistance and overall finer formation., 35453=In this Figure, 1111 is a semiconductor substrate, 1112 an n+ collector embodding layer, 1113 an n\u2212 collector layer, 1114 a P base layer, 1115 a P+ base layer, 1116 an n+ emitter layer, 1117 an n+ collector layer, 1118 an n+ layer, 1119 a polysilicon collector electrode, 1120 a polysilicon base electrode, 1121 a polysilicon emitter electrode, 1122 an Al base wiring, 1123 an Al collector wiring, 1130 a field insulation film, and 1131, 1132, 1133 are insulation films., 43736=As described above, according to the electrode structure of the present invention, the main electrode-control electrode inter-electrode distance can be made smaller as about some 100 to some 1000 \u212b as contrasted with that of the prior art which was said to be about 1 to several \u03bcm without lowering the yield of adjoining semiconductor devices., 30155=This application is a continuation of application Ser.

As to high speed performance, all of samples 1 to 5 could not obtain preferable results due to the influences by parasitic capacity, parasitic resistance between the base and emitter. As to adaptability to large current driving, the experiment of flowing a current set at a current density of 105 \u212b/cm2 at the contact portion was conducted, and those without wire breaking after 1000 hours observed were rated as \u229a, and those with wire breaking after 500 hours observed as x.
