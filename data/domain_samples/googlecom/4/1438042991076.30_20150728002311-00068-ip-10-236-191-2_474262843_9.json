    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32231=Filaments of poly(ethylene terephthalate) of mixed dpf (approximately 40% by weight being of 6.0 dpf, 60% by weight being of 9.4 dpf) were melt-spun at 282\ufffd C. from polymer containing 0.40 mole percent tetraethyl orthosilicate (as described in Mead, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,335,211) and having a relative viscosity of 10.1 (determined from a solution of 80 mg of polymer in 10 ml of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent at 25\ufffd C.). The polymer was extruded at a rate of 90 lbs./hr. per position from 44 positions in all. 17 positions, with 9 positions on one side of machine and 8 positions on the other, produced the low denier (6.0) filaments. 27 positions, with 13 positions on one side and 14 positions on the other, produced the heavy denier (9.4) filaments. The orifice shape for each of the spinneret capillaries was three diamonds joined together to give filaments of scalloped-oval cross-section as described by Gorrafa U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,488. The smaller filaments were spun from a spinneret containing 711 capillaries while larger filaments were spun from a spinneret containing 450 capillaries. All these filaments were spun at a withdrawal speed of 1600 ypm and quenched using radially-directed air from a profiled quench system, as described in Anderson, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,582. The spun tow was collected in a can and consisted of a mixture of lower and higher denier filaments, thus being according to the invention. The total denier of the tow was approximately 187,096, and the total number of filaments was 24,237. The as-spun filament properties are indicated in Table 1A. Average stress-strain curves of single filaments (taken from the tow) are shown in FIG. 5 for lower and higher dpf filaments., 25187=The cross-sections of the polyester filament used according to my invention should not be round but generally oval in shape with grooves that run along the length of the filaments. Typical of such a cross-section is a scalloped-oval cross-section such as was disclosed by Gorrafa in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,488, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Tows of such filaments are described and illustrated in the Examples hereinafter, and a magnified (1000\ufffd) photograph of both types of filament is shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying Drawings. FIG. 2 shows a scalloped-oval cross-section at even greater magnification (3000\ufffd). The term \"oval\" is generic including elongated shapes that are not round, but have an \"aspect ratio\" (ratio of length to width of cross-section) that is more than 1, preferably more than about 1/0.7 (corresponding to a major axis length A:minor axis length B as disclosed by Gorrafa of 1.4); and preferably less than about 1/0.35 (corresponding to Gorrafa's preference of up to about 2.4), at least so far as concerns scalloped-oval. Provision of grooves (indentations or channels) is also important as disclosed by Gorrafa and related art, and in my copending patent application DP-6365, No. 08/497,499, filed simultaneously herewith on Jun. 30, 1995, the disclosure of which is also hereby expressly included herein by reference, and which has somewhat different preferences for aspect ratio, as disclosed therein. FIG. 3 shows such a cross-section of a preferred hexachannel polyester filament at 1000\ufffd magnification., 40437=In Example I, a mixed dpf tow of filaments of scalloped-oval cross-section was spun having 60% of higher dpf filaments and 40% of lower dpf. This Example III was carried out using essentially the same procedure, except that the proportions were 50/50 (again by weight), by appropriately adjusting the numbers of ends (spinning positions) which spun (extruded) lower and higher dpf filaments and, where necessary, the number of capillaries per end (spinning position). Thus, for the 50/50 blend, an equal number of spinnerets (22 each) of 450 capillaries per end and 1054 capillaries per end were used at throughputs of 90 lbs./hr./end. For 100% of a given fiber, only one spinneret type was used on the spin machine. These tows and their slivers demonstrated good downstream processing characteristics. Data is tabulated in Table 3., 46226=In Table 4, data are summarized for fibers spun essentially as described for Table 3, but for filaments prepared by a procedure essentially as described in Example II, and wherein the relative proportions and denier were varied. Thus, for the 60/40 blend, 29 spinnerets of 711 capillaries/end and 19 spinnerets with 1054 capillaries/end were used at throughputs of 70 lbs. per hour per end. These tows and their slivers demonstrated good downstream processing characteristics., 30649=The average stress-strain curves are obtained as follows as an average of 10 individual filaments of each type taken from the tow bundle. Ten samples of each of the higher and of the lower denier filaments are separated from the tow bundle using a magnifying glass (LUXO Illuminated Magnifier). The denier (per filament, dpf) of each sample filament is measured on a VIBROSCOPE (HP Model 201C Audio Oscillator). The sample filaments are then mounted one at a time on an INSTRON (Model 1122 or 1123) and the stress-strain behavior is measured. Ten breaks are recorded for each filament type, and the averages of the 10 samples are recorded for each filament type., 61393=Filaments of 11.4 dpf were prepared similarly, except that the polymer was extruded at a rate of 59.8 lbs./hr. from 243 capillaries at a single position and wound on a bobbin to give a total bundle denier of 2771., 46788=Filaments of poly(ethylene terephthalate) of 3.2 dpf were melt-spun essentially as described in Example 2, but were extruded at a rate of 72.8 lbs./hr. from a single position from a spinneret containing 1054 capillaries and wound on a bobbin to give a total filament bundle denier of 3445., 37530=Filaments of similar scalloped-oval cross-section were spun in approximately equal amounts (by weight) of lower denier (3.1 dpf) and higher denier (7.2 dpf), but otherwise essentially similarly to the procedure described in Example I at a rate of 70 lbs./hr. per position from a 48-position spin machine. Twenty-four positions, with 12 positions on each side of the machine, produced lower denier filaments. Similarly, 24 positions, with 12 positions on each side of the machine, produced higher denier filaments. The smaller filaments were spun from spinnerets containing 1054 capillaries while the larger filaments were spun from spinneret containing 450 capillaries. The total denier of the spun tow collected in a can was approximately 156,178. As-spun properties are indicated in Table 2A. Average stress-strain curves (as for Example I) are shown in FIG. 6.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The Examples have demonstrated how filament tows of the invention may be prepared and processed, including their sliver processing, and subsequent processing into yarns, fabrics and garments. Aesthetics of the final downstream articles is very important, and all textile processing is performed with that end in view. A conventional finish was applied as in Example I. The effective/nominal denier was 3.1 dpf, about 33% by weight being 4.9 dpf, 34% of 3.1 dpf and 33% of 1.2 dpf. Accordingly, this Example shows the invention is not limited to tows containing only two different dpfs, but more than two may be included in such tows, and their corresponding slivers and downstream products.

This tow was drawn, crimped, and relaxed as described in Example V to give a final tow size of approximately 50,000 denier of an intimate blend containing light-, medium-, and heavy-denier filaments.
