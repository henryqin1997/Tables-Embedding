The pressure observed did not appreciably differ from 22 inches of water for flow rates ranging from about 200 CFM to about 1200 CFM. These results are satisfactory. The observed electric current varied in the range of about 38 amps at the 200 CFM flow rate to about 95 amps at the higher flow rates. The battery voltages observed were close to the nominal 48 volts under all test conditions, ranging from a high of about 51 volts at low flow rate to about 47 volts at higher flow rates. The motor efficiency was consistently in the 90 to 95 percent range, as computed from the electrical power supplied by the battery and the estimated torque power delivered by the motor. The motor parameters were not graphed.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{123251=In one mode of operation (which we shall term \u201cmode one\u201d), the storage battery 220 alone is used to provide power to the motor 210 by way of inverter 260. In a second mode of operation (which we shall term \u201cmode two\u201d), the storage battery 220 and the AC power source 240 are both connected to the motor 210 to provide power thereto. The AC power source 1240 is connected to the motor by way of a two-pole switch 243. The two pole switch 243 is controlled by the control circuit 250 via a bi-directional control and data line 252. In some embodiments, phase and frequency sensing hardware and/or software and control circuitry are provided to permit the synchronization of the phase and frequency of the AC power source and the output of the inverter 260 so that the power from the two sources adds and does not destructively interfere when operated in \u201cmode two.\u201d In one embodiment, the inverter 260 comprises phase and frequency sensing hardware, and is configured to adjust its output to conform to the phase and frequency of the AC power source 240., 89185=As mentioned hereinabove, in some situations, an area of interest that requires treatment with a subsurface aeration system according to the invention does not have a suitable power source available in its immediate vicinity. Alternating current (AC) motors that are suitable for operating a typical subsurface aeration system are often of a size in the 3 to 5 horsepower range, which require about 30 to 45 amps at 110 volts for their operation. However, the typical utility 110 volt power line used for irrigation satellites or for general purposes such as lighting, provides only about 10-15 amps, which is typically insufficient for operating subsurface aeration systems. As an example, on an older golf course, or in areas that are sufficiently remote from a high voltage power source, such as a 220 (or higher) volt supply, it is commonly the case that the available 110 volt AC power source when operating alone has insufficient capacity to drive a motor of suitable size to operate the air pump satisfactorily for the proper operation of the subsurface aeration system. According to principles of the invention, the subsurface aeration system in some embodiments is powered by a storage battery having sufficient capacity (e.g., high enough amp-hour rating and high enough discharge rate) to operate a DC motor that runs the air pump or blower of the system satisfactorily. In a preferred embodiment, the storage battery is a deep discharge battery. Those of ordinary skill will recognize that individual storage batteries having sufficient voltage and current capacity, as well as series and parallel combinations of storage batteries, can be used in practicing the invention. For example, such as 6 volt, 12 volt batteries (e.g., automotive batteries), 24 volt batteries (e.g., marine batteries), and other batteries of any convenient voltage can be employed in the systems according to principles of the invention. As an example, if a 48 volt system is desired, it is possible to connect eight (8) batteries of the 6 volt type in series, or one could use a different arrangement, such as 4 batteries of the 12 volt type in series. In one embodiment, eight 6 volt deep cycle batteries, such as U.S. Battery model 2200, available from U.S. Battery Manufacturing Co., 1895 Tobacco Road, Augusta, Ga. 30906, are used to provide a 48 volt compound storage battery. As is well understood by application of Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, to increase the current capacity, if needed, one could build a compound battery system by connecting two or more \u201cstrings\u201d of series-connected batteries in parallel, wherein each series \u201cstring\u201d comprises batteries having a total voltage value that is substantially equal to every other \u201cstring\u201d in the compound battery system. In view of the forthcoming change of automotive battery technology to batteries operating in the range of 36-42 volts, one can expect that batteries operating at those voltages will be come more economical, and can be foreseen as being applicable to the inventions described herein. In another preferred embodiment, the storage battery (or a plurality of storage batteries) provides a working voltage of 48 volts., 47923=This application claims priority to and the benefit of co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

Those of ordinary skill will recognize that many functions of electrical and electronic apparatus can be implemented in hardware (for example, hard-wired logic), in software (for example, logic encoded in a program operating on a general purpose processor), and in firmware (for example, logic encoded in a non-volatile memory that is invoked for operation on a processor as required). The present invention contemplates the substitution of one implementation of hardware, firmware and software for another implementation of the equivalent functionality using a different one of hardware, firmware and software. To the extent that an implementation can be represented mathematically by a transfer function, that is, a specified response is generated at an output terminal for a specific excitation applied to an input terminal of a \u201cblack box\u201d exhibiting the transfer function, any implementation of the transfer function, including any combination of hardware, firmware and software implementations of portions or segments of the transfer function, is contemplated herein.
