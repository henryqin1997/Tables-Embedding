Msg is the concatenation of the 32-bit Group ID and the 32 bit Counter value, which results in a 64-bit number. The Series is a 64-bit number. The microcontroller employs the algorithm in the encryption portion of the software to calculate this Series. However, what is actually transmitted for the data portion of the signal is:, 61186=PCT publications WO96/10880, WO94/17498, WO93/21720 and WO93/11619, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference describe an electronic device which transmits coded information to a microphone of a telephone using a DTMF-like encoding scheme. A WWW page addressed \u201chttp://www.encotone.com/html/tech_def.html\u201d, suggests using such a device to transmit audible DTMF-like tones to a personal computer using the computer's sound card., 154509=In this embodiment, the PLL 402 is an XR215, XR2211, LMC568, or the like. The PLL 402 demodulates the audio signal as known to those ordinarily skilled in the art. The output of the PLL 402 can be a digital square wave of the decoded FSK signal. Alternatively, the output can be an analog voltage whose level is correlated to the input signal frequency. The microprocessor unit 403 accepts either of these forms of signals for further processing., 307413=Typically, each TV station is affiliated with one of the major networks\u2014NBC, CBS, ABC, PBS, Fox, or WB. By being affiliated with one of the networks, the local TV stations can broadcast network programming during prime time (usually 8 PM to 11:00 PM), late night (11:30 PM to 1:30 AM), daytime (e.g., soap operas), and certain other designated time periods (e.g., weekend sporting events). In addition, these local TV stations can broadcast locally produced programming such as local news, local sporting events (e.g., high school or local college), and local events (e.g., downtown Christmas parade). Finally, these local TV stations can broadcast syndicated programming at various desired time slots. These syndicated programs can be reruns of popular TV shows (e.g., MASH, Cheers, Star Trek), currently produced game shows (e.g., Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune), or the lengthy infomercials, among others., 431847=Once authenticated, the user is free to shop, purchase, and otherwise browse on the web. For e-wallet applications, the smart e-wallet application facilitates the form filling function in finalizing sales transactions. Smart e-wallet applications are provided above in the smart e-wallet system section. For other applications, the authentication process merely allows a user to access and other wise complete the sales transaction after pressing the TX switch on the electronic card. For example, once a user has shopped and selected an item to purchase from a website, the website delivers a purchase form to fill out. The user does so. However, instead of the credit card number, the user is asked to take out his electronic card and press the button. The user does so. When both the user's PC and the remote authentication server has authenticated the card transmission, the website will either return a web page that states \u201cThank you for your order. Your order number is 1234ABC\u201d where the return confirmation message from the authentication server also finalized the sales (by emulating the \u201csubmit\u201d button on the web page). Alternatively, a message is displayed indicating that the authentication process has been successful. The user then proceeds to submit the form manually and complete the sales transaction in the conventional manner.}",

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. With respect to power, a conventional small-sized battery such as Varta LPF-25 is used. In some other embodiments, electronic card power is obtained from the PC via the Hall effect. The electronic card merely has an antenna with which to pick up signals for processing. , the electronic card employs a loop antenna 390 instead of an acoustic transducer to pick up the magnetic field. Because the received the magnetic field induces a current in the loop antenna, a current-to-voltage converter 391 is provided. The remainder of the components are similar to that for decoding acoustic signals. In particular, the gain and bandpass filter 392 filters the signal for further processing. An AGC block 394 is provided for SNR improvement. The final processed signal is provided to the microprocessor unit 393 for data processing.
