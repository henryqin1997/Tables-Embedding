[0049] The detector can be a station in the wireless local area network. Additionally, the detector can be mobile, portable, stationary, and the like. For instance, the detector can be a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, and the like. In addition, the detector can be used by a user as a diagnostic tool, by an administrator as an administrative tool, and the like. [0048] As described above, the detector can scan the available channels in the WLAN. Alternatively, specific channels can be selected to be scanned. Although the detector scans the channels, it passively receives the transmissions, meaning that it does not broadcast signals on the WLAN. This has the advantage that additional bandwidth on the WLAN is not consumed. [0047] If no transmissions are detected after scanning all of the channels, then the station is rebooted. As described above, a station can be configured to cycle repeatedly through the channels in an attempt to obtain service. However, a station can also be configured to only attempt one cycle and to stop after the last channel has been attempted. When the station is rebooted, it",
