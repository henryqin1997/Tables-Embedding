    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The protection sought is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, which are given by way of example only, but instead is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims as properly interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. Note that the assignee of the present invention currently offers directory assistance services. The addition of GPS type data and user tracking adds an additional and novel feature to these services. In the prior art, users would inquire about directory listings based solely on the location of the listing. The method and apparatus of the invention adds the user's location to the search criteria. A user can search for directory listings, either by name, number, subject, etc., within a specified radius of the user's present location. For example, a user in a new city on business accesses the MCIW\u2122 web directory listing service via a device 112, and requests a search of restaurants within a half-mile radius of his or her present location. Another aspect of the invention provides a method and apparatus to search for telephony directory listings that are located near a person's present location. The data device 112 registers its identity with a locator service 136. The data device 112 continually registers its location, e.g., using the GPS receiver 16, to the locator service 136. When the user wishes to locate a directory listing,",
