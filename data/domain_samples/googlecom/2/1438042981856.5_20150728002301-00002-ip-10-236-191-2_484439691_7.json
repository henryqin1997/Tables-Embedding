FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B are views that explain the principle of the invention, wherein FIG. 2A is an exemplary view showing an OFF (dark) state of a reflection liquid display, and FIG. 2B is an exemplary view showing an ON (bright) state of the reflection liquid crystal display. Also, in the present embodiment, a description is given of a case where a reflection plate and a quarter-wavelength plate are disposed outside the liquid crystal cell. Incident light 1007 passes through a polarization plate 1001, a quarter-wavelength plate 1002, and a liquid crystal layer 1003 in order, and in a dark state, the light passes through a color filtering layer 1010 and is absorbed in an optical absorbing body 1011. Also, in a bright state, the light is reflected by the color filtering layer 1010 and is caused to radiate in the reverse route of the above.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21346=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 09/938,661, filed on Aug. 27, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,822,712, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 81643=In addition, a method for producing a reflection liquid crystal display according to the invention carries out control of a pre-tilt angle based on the division profile, using an optical orientation method in advance on substrates, whereby the control of the initial orientation can be made remarkably secure. Thereby, by virtue of a synergetic effect of an oblique electric field and a pre-tilt angle, the division orientation can be further remarkably effectively achieved than either of the processes. For example, a substance having a functional group by which orientation of liquid crystal can be controlled by polarization such as a cinnamic group, or a macromolecule in which a photosensitive group is polymerized by irradiation of polarized light as described in the AM-LCD 1996/IDW 1996 Digest of Technical Papers, Page 337 is used as an orientation film, and polarized light is irradiated from a diagonal direction via a mask at respective parts so that a pre-tilt angle is given in a direction along the division profile. In this case, since the number of times of operation for optical orientation is increased if the number of sides of a polygon is large, a polygon from an octagon to a triangle is preferable., 23281=Conventionally, such types are widely used in reflection liquid crystal displays, in which a polarization plate is used as in a supertwisted nematic type (STN type) or twisted nematic type (TN type) that has been widely used in transmission type liquid crystal displays. In the case of reflection type, only a single polarization plate is used, differing from the transmission type. However, since it is necessary to switch reflection light, such a type is common, which is a so called single polarization plate used along with a quarter-wavelength plate as described in, for example, T. Sonehara et al., Japan Display 1989, Page 192 (1989).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations By a method that is similar to that of Example 1, a reflection layer besides acting as a color filter consisting of a cholesteric material layer, and a three-prime-color cholesteric material layer were formed inside the liquid crystal cell. Example 10 is different from Example 9 in that a three-prime-color cholesteric material layer is formed inside the liquid crystal cell. That is, the three-prime-color cholesteric material layer was prepared on a glass substrate of the opposite substrate by a method that is similar to that of Example 1. After an overcoat layer was coated, ITO was formed. The glass substrate was used as the opposite substrate. As in Example 1, where a liquid crystal panel was prepared, and the field-of-view angle characteristics of the panel that had been thus obtained were measured, excellent field-of-view angle characteristics, in which no change in color tint is provided as in the case of Example 1 and the area of high contrast is remarkably wide could be obtained. Also, where the field-of-view angle characteristics were measured with the scattering sheet removed, a normal picture image could be recognized in only a narrow field-of-view angle as in the case of Example 1. Further, the brightness was almost the same as that of prior art liquid crystal display elements. Example 10 Then, the field-of-view angle characteristics were measured. The results, which are the same as those of Example",
