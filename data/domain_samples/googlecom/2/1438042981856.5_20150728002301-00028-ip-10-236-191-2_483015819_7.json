    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62076=An 80:20/isooctyl acrylate (IOA): octyl acrylamide (OAA) composition was prepared by adding 1920.0 grams of IOA, 480.0 grams of OAA, 6.0 grams of Irgacure\u2122 651 (2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone available from Ciba-Geigy, Chicago, Ill.), and 7.2 grams of Ebecryl\ufffd P36 (an acrylated 30 derivative of benzophenone, available from UCB Radcure Inc., Smyrna, Ga.) to a 3.8 liter (1 gal) glass jar. The jar was then capped and put on a roller mill having two rubber rollers, one of which was motor driven at about 60 rpm, for about 2 hours to dissolve the Irgacure\u2122 651, Ebecryl\ufffd P36, and OAA in the IOA monomer. A clear homogenous solution was obtained., 63811=This syrup was coated onto biaxially oriented polypropylene film (BOPP) (available under the trade designation A/NS from AEP, Proponite Division, North Andover, Mass.) having a thickness of 30 mm (0.0012 in) which had been corona treated no more than 24 hours prior to coating. A 30.5 cm (12 in) wide knife-over-bed coating station was employed. The gap setting was 51 \u03bcm (0.002 in) greater than the BOPP film thickness, and the coating speed was 2.13 meters/min (7.0 ft/min). The coated film was passed through an irradiation chamber where it was exposed (from the adhesive side) to low intensity light at a wavelength of emission between 300 and 400 nm for a period of about 260 seconds to give a total calculated dose of about 1100 mJ/cm2. The coated film was then exposed (from the adhesive side) to a medium pressure mercury lamp for 6 seconds to provide a total target dose of 400 mJ/cm2. The dose values are reported in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) units. The pressure sensitive adhesive tape obtained was applied to oak and cherry wood veneers and tested for initial adhesion and removability as described in the above test procedures. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below., 48735=The monomer mixture may be polymerized by various techniques, with photoinitiated bulk polymerization being preferred. The adhesive composition may also be thermally polymerized. An initiator is preferably added to aid in polymerization of the monomers. The type of initiator used depends on the polymerization process. Photoinitiators that are useful for polymerizing the acrylate monomers include benzoin ethers such as 2-methyl-2-hydroxylpropiophenone, aromatic sulfonyl chlorides such as 2-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride, and photoactive oxides such as 1-phenyl-1, 1-propanedione-2-(o-ethoxycarbonyl)oxime. Examples of commercially available photoinitiators include Irgacure 651 (available from Ciba-Geigy, Chicago, Ill.), Darocure 1173 (Ciba-Geigy), and Lucerin TPO (available from BASF). Photoinitiators are typically added in amounts ranging from about 0.01 to about 5.0% by weight. Examples of suitable thermal initiators include azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) and peroxides., 60274=The test specimens were then exposed to either a cold press or hot press cycle to simulate lamination conditions used in the furniture industry. The cold press cycle conditions consisted of 2268 kilograms (5000 pounds force) force at room temperature for a period of 45 minutes. The hot press cycle conditions consisted of 2268 kilograms (5000 pounds force) force at about 127\ufffd C. (260\ufffd F.) for a period of 1 minute and 45 seconds. When a cold press cycle was employed, between 2 and 4 test specimens were placed in the press at a time. One test specimen was placed in the press during the hot press cycle., 62745=About 800 grams of this monomer solution was poured into a 0.95 liter (one quart) glass jar fitted with a cap having an opening for a nitrogen gas source. The opening was slightly larger than the gas source to permit a steady flow of gas. The monomer solution was purged with dry nitrogen for about 60 minutes. While maintaining an inert atmosphere, the jar was then gently swirled and irradiated using two 15 Watt fluorescent lamps (Model F15T8-BLB, available from General Electric, Schenectady, N.Y.) positioned parallel to, and 2.54 cm (1 in) apart from, each other. The jar was held about 15.2 cm (6 in) from the lamps, and irradiated for about 30 seconds to provide a coatable syrup having a viscosity (Brookfield) of about 2500 to 3000 centipoise. The nitrogen source and cap were then removed and the jar left open to the air for about ten minutes. Another 2.4 gm of Ebecryl\ufffd P36 was added to the syrup and the jar capped and placed on a roller mill, as described above, for 24 hours to dissolve the P36 and provide a clear coatable syrup.}",
