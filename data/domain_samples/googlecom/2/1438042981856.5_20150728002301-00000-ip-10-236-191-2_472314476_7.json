We consider the first basic block in the method to be the main entry point. Additionally, we consider the starting block for each finally statement to represent an entry point. And further, we consider the starting block for each exception handler to represent an entry point. Exception handlers are identified in the method's code attribute, in the field named exception-- table. The relevant data structures are described in \"The Java Virtual Machine Specification\", written by T im Lindholm and Frank Yellin, published in 1996., 335286=1111: We use code 218 to represent dup2-- \ufffd2-- 1111. This instruction duplicates the top two entries on the pointer stack, shifts the top four entries on the pointer stack up two positions, and inserts the duplicated pointer values into the newly vacated pointer slots., 247933=When a new thread is created, the system allocates a C stack, a PERC non-pointer stack, and a PFRC pointer stack. The size of the C stack is determined as a run-time option (specified on the command line if the virtual machine is running in a traditional desktop computing environment). The size of the PERC pointer and non-pointer stacks is specified by compile-time macro definitions, defined to equal 1024 words per stack., 334994=1101: We use code 219 to represent dup2-- \ufffd2-- 1101. This instruction represents the combination of dup-- 0 and dup-- \ufffd2-- 11., 100844=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/034,072, filed Dec. 21, 1996., 103998=Within Sun, development of Java began in April of 1991. Initially, Java was intended to be an implementation language for personal digital assistants. Subsequently, the development effort was retargeted to the needs of set-top boxes, CD-ROM software, and ultimately the World-Wide Web. Most of Java's recent media attention has focused on its use as a medium for portable distribution of software over the Internet. However, both within and outside of Sun, it is well understood that Java is much more than simply a language for adding animations to Web pages. In many embedded real-time applications, for example, the Java byte codes might be represented in system ROMs or might even be pre-translated into native machine code., 146043=PERC, like Java, supports four distinct forms of method invocation. These are known as (1) virtual, (2) special (non-virtual), (3) static, and (4) interface. With virtual and special method invocations, there is an implicit (not seen by the Java programmer) \"this\" argument passed to the called method. The \"this\" argument refers to the object on which the called method will operate. The distinctions between these different method invocations are described in \"The Java Virtual Machine Specification\", by Lindholm and Yellin, 1996, Addison-Wesley., 146695=The PERC implementation represents every PERC object with a data structure patterned after the templates provided in FIG. 15, FIG. 16, and FIG. 24. In all of these structures, the second field is a pointer to a MethodTable data structure (see FIG. 23). The PERC execution environment maintains one MethodTable data structure for each defined object type. All instantiated objects of this type point to this shared single copy. The jit-- interfaces array field of the MethodTable structure has one entry for each virtual method supported by objects of this type. The mapping from method name and signature to index position is defined by the class loader, as described in \"The Java Virtual Machine Specification\", by Lindholm and Yellin, 1996, Addison-Wesley. To execute the JIT version of a PERC method using a virtual method lookup, branch to the code represented by jit-- interfaces[method-- index]. Normally, the JIT version of the byte code will only be invoked directly from within another JIT-compiled method. If a native or untranslated byte-code method desires to invoke another method using virtual method lookup, the search for the target method generally proceeds differently. First, we find the target object's MethodTable data structure (as above) and then follow the methods pointer to obtain an array of pointers to Method objects. Within the Method object, we consult the access-- flags field to determine if the target method is represented by native code (ACC-- NATIVE) or JIT translation of byte code (ACC-- JIT). If neither of these flags is set, the method is assumed to be implemented by byte codes. See FIG. 49, FIG. 45, and FIG. 46., 301847=Byte code verification is performed in two passes. In the first pass, we divide the program into basic blocks and build a data structure that identifies how control flows between basic blocks. A basic block is a straight-line sequence of instructions that does not include any branches into or out. The result of performing this first pass is known as a control-flow graph. The process of creating the control-flow graph is straightforward, and has been described in numerous references. See, for example, \"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\", written by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman, published in 1988., 106985=PERC has much to offer developers of embedded real-time systems. High-level abstractions and availability of reusable software components shorten the time-to-market for innovative products. Its virtual machine execution model eliminates the need for complicated cross-compiler development systems, multiple platform version maintenance, and extensive rewriting and retesting each time the software is ported to a new host processor. It is important to recognize that the embedded computing market is quite large. Industry observers have predicted that by the year 2010, there will be ten times as many software programmers writing embedded systems applications as there will be working on software for general purpose computers.}",

To obtain improved performance for dynamic execution of the ROMizer and JIT tools, the byte-code verifier, transformer, and JIT optimizer can be preloaded through the ROMizer program. During pre-load, the ROMizer optionally applies the JIT optimizer to the code. 2. The code used in the implementation of JIT compilation within the ROMizer tool is exactly the same code that is used to support JIT compilation of newly loaded byte-code functionality as byte-codes are loaded on the fly. 1. The code used in the implementation of the ROMizer tool to read in a Java class file, verify the validity of the byte code, and transform the byte code into the PERC instruction set is the exact same code that is used by the PERC implementation to support dynamic (on-the-fly) loading of new byte-code functionality into the PERC virtual machine. An important consideration in the architecture of a large software system such as the PFERC virtual machine is the need to minimize the effort required to implement and maintain the various capabilities of the system. There are several innovations represented in the design of our ROMizer tool: 6. If there are multiple constant strings, the ROMizer tool searches for common strings and eliminates redundancy by making multiple string objects refer to the same substring data. All string data is represented by a single array of character object. 5. The machine code that results from JIT compilation is",
