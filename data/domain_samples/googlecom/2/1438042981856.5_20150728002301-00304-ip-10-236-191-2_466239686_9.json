    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73320=The analysis of the semisolid product by gas chromatograph indicated the presence of dicyanamide by-product in amount of about 5%. IR spectrum of solid material indicated the presence of carbamate functions (about 10-15%) at 1740 cm-1 and 3300 cm-1., 51057=The relative amounts of the reactants may vary widely, and will generally depend on the degree of cyanation desired. In general, the higher the desired degree of cyanation, the higher the equivalent ratio of cyanogen halide to ammonium salt of the phenolic resin; and the lower the desired degree of cyanation, the lower the equivalent ratio of the halide to the salt. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the equivalent ratio of the ammonium salt of the resin to the cyanogen halide is from about 1:1 to about 1:1.25 and in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention is from about 1:10 to about 1:25. In the most preferred embodiments of the invention, the equivalent ratio of the ammonium salt of the phenolic resin to the cyanogen halide is from about 1:1.03 to about 1:1.07, with an equivalent ratio of from about 1:1.05 being the mole ratio of choice. The above equivalent ratios are designed to provide levels of cyanation of greater than about 80 mole percent with the uncyanated sites being --OH, preferably with substantially 100% cyanation. Equivalent ratios of less than about 1:1 may be employed if a lesser degree of cyanation is desired., 30587=Resole resins are made with an alkaline catalyst and a molar excess of formaldehyde. Novolak or novolac resins are prepared with an acid catalyst and less than one mol of formaldehyde per mol of phenol. The initial reaction involved in the preparation of resolated novolacs is carried out with an acid catalyst and less than a 1:1 mol ratio of formaldehyde to phenol. After formation of the novolac, the pH is adjusted so that the reaction mixture is basic and additional formaldehyde is added. Resoles and resolated novolaks are inherently thermosetting and require no curing agent for advancement. Novolacs, by comparison, are thermoplastic and require the addition of a curing agent, the most common being either hexamethylene-tetramine or a resole. The stages of molecular weight advancement are characterized by liquid or solid phenolic polymer which is soluble in certain organic solvents and is fusible; solid resin which is insoluble but swelled by organic solvents and, although softened by heat, exhibits essentially no flow; and an insoluble, infusible product which is not swelled by solvents nor softened by heat, i.e., the system is in a highly cross-linked state., 74970=To a 2 liter beaker was added 100 g of novolac (380 number average molecular weight) and 500 ml methylketone. A yellow solution was observed in 10 minutes. The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C., and 113 g of cyanogen bromide was added. A 99.8 g sample of triethylamine was added to the novolac-cyanogen bromide solution. The rate of addition was controlled to provide a temperature of from -5\ufffd C. to -10\ufffd C. After the triethylamine addition, a heterogeneous reaction mixture was observed. The triethyl ammonium bromide salt by-product was filtered from the reaction mixture, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The product obtained was insoluble in organic solvents and a gel was observed. The IR spectrum indicate formation of carbamate at 1740 cm-1 and 3300 cm-1. The GC analysis of reaction filtrate indicate the presence of about 5-7% dicyanamide., 28755=The early investigation of the reaction of phenol and formaldehyde began with the work of von Baeyer and others in the early 1870's as an extension of phenol based dye chemistry. The initial experiments result in soluble, amorphous products whose properties elicited little interest. Insoluble, cross-linked products also were reported in the late 1880's, but these products also were not perceived as useful materials. In 1888, the first patent for a phenolic-resin product intended for use as a hard-rubber substitute was granted. The first commercial product was introduced as a shellac substitute by the Louis Bluner Company in the early 1900's. Process patents were issued in 1894 and 1895 for ortho- and para-methylolphenol, respectively., 68728=A mixture of 20.4 g of finely powdered novolac (670 number average molecular weight by GPC) was placed into 125 g of methylene chloride to form a slurry. To the slurry 22.2 g of triethylamine was added gradually over a period of 20 minutes. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 minutes, then at -30\ufffd C. for another 40 minutes to form a clear solution of trialkyl ammonium salt of the novolac. To 125 g of methylene chloride was added 24.8 g of cyanogen bromide under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution containing the trialkyl ammonium salt of novolac was added to the cyanogen bromide solution over a period of 30 min. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at -15\ufffd C. to -10\ufffd C. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 minutes. The product was isolated by filtration through silica gel to remove the trialkyl ammonium salt. The filtrate was purified by water extraction until the pH of medium was neutral (pH 6.5-70). The first extraction was done at low temperature (-10\ufffd C.) with 3-5% sodium chloride solution. Subsequent extractions were performed at room temperature. The cyanated phenolic resin remained in the methylene chloride solution. The solution was dried over MgSO4. GLC analysis shows only 0.46% of diethylcyanamide. FTIR analysis shows cyanate peak at 2230 cm-1 and no peaks which correspond to triazine or carbamate. Gel time of the product at 150\ufffd C. is 25 minutes and no smoke was generated during gel time measurements., 49080=The amount of tertiary amine reacted with the phenolic resin is an amount sufficient to form the desired ammonium salt. In general, the amount of amine reactant is at least equivalent to or substantially equivalent to the amount of the phenolic resin or an excess of the amine react is used. An equivalent amount of the amine is an amount which is sufficient to react with all or substantially all of the hydroxy substituents of the phenolic resin. The upper limit to the amount of amine reactant is not critical and is dependent primarily on economic factors and the difficulty of removing excess amine during purification of the reaction product. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, an amount of amine is such that the ratio of equivalents of phenolic resin to equivalents of tertiary amine is from about 1:1 to about 1:1.5 and in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention the ratio is from about 1:1 to about 1:1.2. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments of the invention in which the amount of amine is such that the ratio of equivalents of phenolic resin to equivalents of tertiary amine is from about 1:1.02 to about 1:1.07, with an equivalent ratio of about 1:1.05 being the equivalent ratio of choice., 35121=Cyanato group containing phenolic resins have been described in Delano et al., Synthesis of Improved Phenolic Resins, Acurex Corp/Aerotherm, Acurex Vinyl Report 79-25/AS, Sep. 4, 1979 prepared for NASA Lewis Research Center, Contract No. Nas3-21368, and is available through the United States Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service., 44588=The molecular weight of the phenolic resin may vary widely. The preferred molecular weight of the phenolic resin for use in the process of this invention is a number average molecular weight in the range of from about 300 to about 1700, more preferably from about 500 to about 1500 and most preferably from about 700 to about 1000. The molecular weight distribution and number average molecular weight of the phenolic resin can be determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran as a solvent., 78654=A series of experiments were carried out for the purpose of evaluating the thermal characteristics of certain embodiments of this invention whose preparation is described in Example I and to compare same to the thermal characteristics of the materials of Comparative Examples A, B, C, D, and E and to the thermal characteristics of a base phenolic resin. The thermal characteristics were chosen for comparative purposes because these characteristics impact significantly on the use of these materials in high temperature applications. In these experiments, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in an argon atmosphere to determine the weight loss of a sample as a function of temperature and the % char at 1000\ufffd C. These experiments were carried out using a Dupont-1090 thermogravimeter at a heating rate of 10\ufffd C./min. The typical size sample was 30-40 mg. The results of these experiments are set forth in the following Table I., 29519=Key innovations in early phenolic-resin manufacture included control of the molecular structure and the use of heat and pressure to achieve desirable physical properties in filled compositions. Studies in the use of acidic or basic catalysts and of changes in the molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol resulted in the definition of two classes of polymeric materials which are referred to as Bakelite resins. Caustic-catalyzed products, which are prepared with greater than a 1:1 mol ratio of formaldehyde to phenol, can be used to form cross-linked, insoluble, and infusible compositions in a controlled fashion. With less than a 1:1 mol ratio of formaldehyde to phenol, the resultant products remain soluble; furthermore, acid catalysis yields permanently stable compositions, whereas base-catalyzed materials can be advanced in molecular weight and viscosity. Possibly of greatest importance to early commercialization, however, was the reduction to practice of the use of heat and pressure to produce essentially void-free molding compositions., 76622=In 210 ml of acetone was dissolved 72 g (0.6 mole as (--OH) of the m-cresol novolac. The resulting solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. To the cooled solution was added 70 g (0.661 mole) of cyanogen bromide followed by dropwise addition of 64 g (0.632 mole) of triethylamine. After completion of the reaction, the triethylamine hydrobromide salt was removed. The resulting reaction mixture was added to vigorously stirred water. A semi-solid product obtained which was dried 40\ufffd C. in a vacuum oven to 18 hrs. to obtain a solid powder having a melting point of 72\ufffd C.-78\ufffd C. IR spectrum revealed a strong absorption at 2250 cm-1 which indicated formation of cyanate (about 80-85%), The spectrum also indicate 5 mole % carbamate formation and 10-15 mole % of unreacted hydroxyl groups., 35496=A recent reference, Heat Resistance Polymers by Critchley et al., pp. 406-408, Plenum Press, New York, 1986, has described phenolic triazine resins prepared from phenolic novolac or meta-cresol novolac which have essentially the same chemical structures as described in the above referenced patents.}",
