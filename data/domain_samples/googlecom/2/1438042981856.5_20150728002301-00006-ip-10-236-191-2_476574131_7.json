Tenth, this invention provides the ability for a third-party database to be identified by the computer system, wherein the user is notified that they have accessed the correct third-party database. Ninth, this invention enables primary users to both register and govern the electronic transmissions of subordinated users. Eighth, this invention enables a user to enter and update their customized data in a centralized database. Seventh, this invention provides enhanced security by maintaining authenticating data and carrying out the identity verification operations at a point in the system that is operationally isolated from the user requesting access, thereby preventing the user from acquiring copies of the authenticating data or from tampering with the verification process. Sixth, this invention provides a user-customized \u201cportal\u201d or gateway to the Internet including their desired bookmarks, their personalized search engine and their customized web page directory. Fifth, the invention provides a tokenless system for ensuring that users have the portability and mobility to gain immediate access to their electronic transmissions via any network-connected interface, regardless of the resident capabilities of the computing device the user",
