Again, looking up at the fragments produced, we see that the target sequence contains a 01110 subsequence, and W is a 0. Thus, our sequence to this point is 101001110. We know that the last 5-mer must be either 11100 or 11101. Looking above, we see that it is 11100 and that must be the last of our sequence. Thus, we have determined that our sequence must have been 1010011100., 239189=Conversion of the positional data into sequence specificity will provide the set of subsequences whose analysis by overlap segments, may be performed, as described above. Analysis is provided by the methodology described above, or using, e.g., software available from the Genetic Engineering Center, P.O. Box 794, 11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia (Yugoslav group). See, also, Macevicz, PCT publication no. WO 90/04652, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 95763=The hybridization conditions between probe and target should be selected such that the specific recognition interaction, i.e., hybridization, of the two molecules is both sufficiently specific and sufficiently stable. See, e.g., Hames and Higgins (1985) Nucleic Acid Hybridisation: A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Oxford. These conditions will be dependent both on the specific sequence and often on the guanine and cytosine (GC) content of the complementary hybrid strands. The conditions may often be selected to be universally equally stable independent of the specific sequences involved. This typically will make use of a reagent such as an alkylammonium buffer. See, Wood et al. (1985) \"Base Composition-independent Hybridization in Tetramethylammonium Chloride: A Method for Oligonucleotide Screening of Highly Complex Gene Libraries,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:1585-1588; and Krupov et al. (1989) \"An Oligonucleotide Hybridization Approach to DNA Sequencing,\" FEBS Letters, 256:118-122; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. An alkylammonium buffer tends to minimize differences in hybridization rate and stability due to GC content. By virtue of the fact that sequences then hybridize with approximately equal affinity and stability, there is relatively little bias in strength or kinetics of binding for particular sequences. Temperature and salt conditions along with other buffer parameters should be selected such that the kinetics of renaturation should be essentially independent of the specific target subsequence or oligonucleotide probe involved. In order to ensure this, the hybridization reactions will usually be performed in a single incubation of all the substrate matrices together exposed to the identical same target probe solution under the same conditions., 55648=1010011100., 58296=In this example, not only do we know that the sequence contains 10100, but we also know that it contains the second five character sequence, 01001. By virtue of knowing that the sequence contains 10100, we can look specifically to determine whether the sequence contains a subsequence of five characters which contains the four leftmost digits plus a next digit to the left. For example, we would look for a sequence of X1010, but we find that there is none. Thus, we know that the 10100 must be at the left end of the 10-mer. We would also look to see whether the sequence contains the rightmost four digits plus a next digit to the right, e.g., 0100X. We find that the sequence also contains the sequence 01001, and that X is a 1. Thus, we know at least that our target sequence has an overlap of 0100 and has the left terminal sequence 101001., 57408=Any sequence which contains the first five digit sequence, 10100, already narrows the number of possible sequences (e.g., from 1024 possible sequences) which contain it to less than about 192 possible sequences., 104029=The antigen or collection is presented to an appropriate immune system, e.g., to a whole animal as in a standard immunization protocol, or to a collection of immune cells or equivalent. In particular, see Ward et al. (1989) Nature 341:544-546; and Huse et al. (1989) Science 246:1275-1281, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 211410=As indicated above, polymers may be used to encode important information on source and batch and supplier. This is described in greater detail, e.g., \"Applications of PCR to industrial problems,\" (1990) in Chemical and Engineering News 68:145, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In fact, the synthetic method can be applied to the storage of enormous amounts of information. Small substrates may encode enormous amounts of information, and its recovery will make use of the inherent replication capacity. For example, on regions of 10 \u03bcm\ufffd10 \u03bcm, 1 cm2 has 106 regions. In theory, the entire human genome could be attached in 1000 nucleotide segments on a 3 cm2 surface. Genomes of endangered species may be stored on these substrates., 177226=The base composition of the specific oligonucleotides involved in hybridization affects the temperature of melting, and the stability of hybridization as discussed in the above references. However, the bias of GC rich sequences to hybridize faster and retain stability at higher temperatures can be compensated for by the inclusion in the hybridization incubation or wash steps of various buffers. Sample buffers which accomplish this result include the triethly and trimethyl ammonium buffers. See, e.g., Wood et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:1585-1588, and Khrapko, K. et al. (1989) FEBS Letters 256:118-122., 162339=A matrix pattern of new reagents may be targeted to each specific oligonucleotide position by attaching a complementary oligonucleotide to which the substrate bound form is complementary. For instance, a number of regions may have homogeneous oligonucleotides synthesized at various locations. Oligonucleotide sequences complementary to each of these can be individually generated and linked to a particular specific reagents. Often these specific reagents will be antibodies. As each of these is specific for finding its complementary oligonucleotide, each of the specific reagents will bind through the oligonucleotide to the appropriate matrix position. A single step having a combination of different specific reagents being attached specifically to a particular oligonucleotide will thereby bind to its complement at the defined matrix position. The oligonucleotides will typically then be covalently attached, using, e.g., an acridine dye, for photocrosslinking. Psoralen is a commonly used acridine dye for photocrosslinking purposes, see, e.g., Song et al. (1979) Photochem. Photobiol. 29:1177-1197; Cimino et al. (1985) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 54:1151-1193; Parsons (1980) Photochem. Photobiol. 32:813-821; and Dattagupta et al. (1985) U.S. Pat. No. 4,542,102, and (1987) U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,326; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. This method allows a single attachment manipulation to attach all of the specific reagents to the matrix at defined positions and results in the specific reagents being homogeneously located at defined positions. In many embodiments, the specific reagents will be antibodies., 76719=For other polymer targets, the specific reagents will often be polypeptides. These polypeptides may be protein binding domains from enzymes or other proteins which display specificity for binding. Usually an antibody molecule may be used, and monoclonal antibodies may be particularly desired. Classical methods may be applied for preparing antibodies, see, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press, N.Y.; and Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d Ed.) Academic Press, San Diego. Other suitable techniques for in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to the antigens or selection of libraries of antibody binding sites are described, e.g., in Huse et al. (1989) Science 246:1275-1281; and Ward et al. (1989) Nature 341:544-546, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Unusual antibody production methods are also described, e.g., in Hendricks et al. (1989) BioTechnology 7:1271-1274; and Hiatt et al. (1989) Nature 342:76-78, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Other molecules which may exhibit specific binding interaction may be useful for attachment to a VLSIPS substrate by various methods, including the caged biotin methods, see, e.g., Ser. No. 07/435,316, now abandoned, and Barrett et al. (1993) U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,743., 240579=Any unreacted aminopropyl silane on the surface, i.e., those amino groups which have not had the NVOC-GABA attached, are now capped with acetyl groups (to prevent further reaction) by exposure to a 1:3 mixture of acetic anhydride in pyridine for 1 hour. Other materials which may perform this residual capping function include trifluoroacetic anhydride, formicacetic anhydride, or other reactive acylating agents. Finally, the slides are washed again with DMF, methylene chloride, and ethanol., 217366=Relevant applications whose techniques are incorporated herein by reference are Pirrung, et al., Ser. No. 07/362,901, filed Jun. 7, 1989, now abandoned; Pirrung et al. (1992) U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; Barrett, et al., Ser. No. 07/435,316 filed Nov. 13, 1989, now abandoned; Barrett, et al. (1993) U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,743; and commonly assigned and simultaneously filed applications Ser. No. 07/624,120, now abandoned, and Ser. No. 07/626,730., 61800=The number of possible sequences of a given length increases very quickly with the length of that sequence. Thus, a 10-mer of zeros and ones has 1024 possibilities, a 12-mer has 4096. A 20-mer has over a million possibilities, and a 30-mer has over a billion. However, a given 30-mer has, at most, 26 different internal 5-mer sequences. Thus, a 30 character target sequence having over a million possible sequences can be substantially defined by only 26 different 5-mers. It will be recognized that the probe oligonucleotides will preferably, but need not necessarily, be of identical length, and that the probe sequences need not necessarily be contiguous in that the overlapping subsequences need not differ by only a single subunit. Moreover, each position of the matrix pattern need not be homogeneous, but may actually contain a plurality of probes of known sequence. In addition, although all of the possible subsequence specifications would be preferred, a less than full set of sequences specifications could be used. In particular, although a substantial fraction will preferably be at least about 70%, it may be less than that. About 20% would be preferred, more preferably at least about 30% would be desired. Higher percentages would be especially preferred., 172759=The present invention may also be used for mapping sequences within a larger segment. This may be performed by at least two methods, particularly in reference to nucleic acids. Often, enormous segments of DNA are subcloned into a large plurality of subsequences. Ordering these subsequences may be important in determining the overlaps of sequences upon nucleotide determinations. Mapping may be performed by immobilizing particularly large segments onto a matrix using the VLSIPS\u2122 Technology. Alternatively, sequences may be ordered by virtue of subsequences shared by overlapping segments. See, e.g., Craig et al. (1990) Nuc. Acids Res. 18:2653-2660; Michiels et al. (1987) CABIOS 3:203-210; and Olson et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:7826-7830., 192473=The data analysis can be performed by a computer using an appropriate program. See, e.g., Drmanac, R. et al. (1989) Genomics 4:114-128; and a commercially available analysis program available from the Genetic Engineering Center, P.O. Box 794, 11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Although the specific manipulations necessary to reassemble the target sequence from fragments may take many forms, one embodiment uses a sorting program to sort all of the subsequences using a defined hierarchy. The hierarchy need not necessarily correspond to any physical hierarchy, but provides a means to determine, in order, which subfragments have actually been found in the target sequence. In this manner, overlaps can be checked and found directly rather than having to search throughout the entire set after each selection process. For example, where the oligonucleotide probes are 10-mers, the first 9 positions can be sorted. A particular subsequence can be selected as in the examples, to determine where the process starts. As analogous to the theoretical example provided above, the sorting procedure provides the ability to immediately find the position of the subsequence which contains the first 9 positions and can compare whether there exists more than 1 subsequence during the first 9 positions. In fact, the computer can easily generate all of the possible target sequences which contain given combination of subsequences. Typically there will be only one, but in various situations, there will be more., 55679=A VLSIPS\u2122 Technology substrate could be constructed, as discussed elsewhere, which would have reagents attached in a defined matrix pattern which specifically recognize each of the possible five digit sequences of ones and zeros. The number of possible five digit subsequences is 25 =32. The number of possible different sequences 10 digits long is 210 =1,024. The five contiguous digit subsequences within a ten digit sequence number six, i.e., positioned at digits 1-5, 2-6, 3-7, 4-8, 5-9, and 6-10. It will be noted that the specific order of the digits in the sequence is important and that the order is directional, e.g., running left to right versus right to left. The first five digit sequence contained in the target sequence is 10100. The second is 01001, the third is 10011, the fourth is 00111, the fifth is 01110, and the sixth is 11100., 43211=The technology provided by the present invention has very broad applications. Although described specifically for polynucleotide sequences, similar sequencing, fingerprinting, mapping, and screening procedures can be applied to polypeptide, carbohydrate, or other polymers. In particular, the present invention may be used to completely sequence a given target sequence to subunit resolution. This may be for de novo sequencing, or may be used in conjunction with a second sequencing procedure to provide independent verification. See, e.g., (1988) Science 242:1245. For example, a large polynucleotide sequence defined by either the Maxam and Gilbert technique or by the Sanger technique may be verified by using the present invention., 236695=The substrate and probes are incubated under appropriate conditions for a sufficient period of time to allow hybridization to completion. The time is measured to determine when the probe-target hybridizations have reached completion. A salt buffer which minimizes GC bias is preferred, incorporating, e.g., buffer, such as tetramethyl ammonium or tetraethyl ammonium ion at between about 2.4 and 3.0M. See Wood, et al. (1985) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 82:1585-1588. This time is typically at least about 30 min, and may be as long as about 1-5 days. Typically very long matches will hybridize more quickly, very short matches will hybridize less quickly, depending upon relative target and probe concentrations. The hybridization will be performed under conditions where the reagents are stable for that time duration., 276876=Genetic fingerprinting has been utilized in comparing different related species in Southern hybridization blots. Genetic fingerprinting has also been used in forensic studies, see, e.g., Morris et al. (1989) J. Forensic Science 34:1311-1317, and references cited therein. As described above, an individual may be identified genetically by a sufficiently large number of probes. The likelihood that another individual would have an identical pattern over a sufficiently large number of probes may be statistically negligible. However, it is often quite important that a large number of probes be used where the statistical probability of matching is desired to be particularly low. In fact, the probes will optimally be selected for having high heterogeneity among the population. In addition, the fingerprint method may make use of the pattern of homologies indicated by a series of more and more stringent washes. Then, each position has both a sequence specificity and a homology measurement, the combination of which greatly increases the number of dimensions and the statistical likelihood of a perfect pattern match with another genetic individual., 45001=In addition, the present invention provides means for mapping analysis of a target sequence or sequences. Mapping will usually involve the sequential ordering of a plurality of various sequences, or may involve the localization of a particular sequence within a plurality of sequences. This may be achieved by immobilizing particular large segments onto the matrix and probing with a shorter sequence to determine which of the large sequences contain that smaller sequence. Alternatively, relatively shorter probes of known or random sequence may be immobilized to the matrix and a map of various different target sequences may be determined from overlaps. Principles of such an approach are described in some detail by Evans et al. (1989) \"Physical Mapping of Complex Genomes by Cosmid Multiplex Analysis,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5030-5034; Michiels et al. (1987) \"Molecular Approaches to Genome Analysis: A Strategy for the Construction of Ordered Overlap Clone Libraries,\" CABIOS 3:203-210; Olsen et al. (1986) \"Random-Clone Strategy for Genomic Restriction Mapping in Yeast,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:7826-7830; Craig, et al. (1990) \"Ordering of Cosmid Clones Covering the Herpes Simplex Virus Type I (HSV-I) Genome: A Test Case for Fingerprinting by Hybridization,\" Nuc. Acids Res. 18:2653-2660; and Coulson, et al. (1986) \"Toward a Physical Map of the Genome of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:7821-7825; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 13390=This is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/670,118, filed Jun. 25, 1996, which is a divisional application of Ser. No. 08/168,904, filed Dec. 15, 1993, now abandoned, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/624,114, filed Dec. 6, 1990, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part application of commonly assigned patent applications Pirrung et al., Ser. No. 07/352,901, filed Jun. 7, 1989, now abandoned; and Pirrung et al., Ser. No. 07/492,462, filed Mar. 7, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 64669=Alternatively, with a four character universe, the binary system can be looked at in pairs of digits. The pairs would be 00, 01, 10, and 11. In this manner, the earlier used sequence 1010011100 is looked at as 10, 10, 01, 11, 00. Then the first character of two digits is selected from the possible universe of the four representations 00, 01, 10, and 11. Then a probe would be in an even number of digits, e.g., not five digits, but, three pairs of digits or six digits. A similar comparison is performed and the possible overlaps determined. The 3-pair subsequences are:, 257568=According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the methods provide for attaching to the surface a caged binding member which, in its caged form, has a relatively low affinity for other potentially binding species, such as receptors and specific binding substances. Such techniques are more fully described in copending application Ser. No. 404,920, filed Sep. 8, 1989, and incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. See also Ser. No. 07/435,316, now abandoned, and Barrett et al. (1993) U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,743, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 53528=The principle of the hybridization sequencing procedure is based, in part, upon the ability to determine overlaps of short segments. The VLSIPS technology provides the ability to generate reagents which will saturate the possible short subsequence recognition possibilities. The principle is most easily illustrated by using a binary sequence, such as a sequence of zeros and ones. Once having illustrated the application to a binary alphabet, the principle may easily be understood to encompass three letter, four letter, five or more letter, even 20 letter alphabets. A theoretical treatment of analysis of subsequence information to reconstruction of a target sequence is provided, e.e., in Lysov, Yu., et al. (1988) Doklady Akademi. Nauk. SSR 303:1508-1511; Khrapko K., et al. (1989) FEBS Letters 256:118-122; Pevzner, P. (1989) J. of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics 7:63-69; and Drmanac, R. et al. (1989) Genomics 4:114-128; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 129568=In an alternative method, a plurality of subsequences can be attached to a substrate. Various short probes may be applied to determine which segments may contain particular overlaps. The theoretical basis and a description of this mapping procedure is contained in, e.g., Evans et al. 1989 \"Physical Mapping of Complex Genomes by Cosmid Multiplex Analysis,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5030-5034, and other references cited above in the Section labeled \"Overall Description.\" Using this approach, the details of the mapping embodiment are very similar to those used in the fingerprinting embodiment., 63510=Using the first means, the overlap comparisons are performed with a four letter alphabet rather than a two letter alphabet. Then, in contrast to the binary system with 10 positions where 210 =1024 possible sequences, in a 4-character alphabet with 10 positions, there will actually be 410 =1,048,576 possible sequences. Thus, the complexity of a four character sequence has a much larger number of possible sequences compared to a two character sequence. Note, however, that there are still only 6 different internal 5-mers. For simplicity, we shall examine a 5 character string with 3 character subsequences. Instead of only 1 and 0, the characters may be designated, e.g., A, C, G, and T. Let us take the sequence GGCTA. The 3-mer subsequences are:, 92866=Once a particular label has been selected, appropriate labeling protocols will be applied, as described below for specific embodiments. Standard labeling protocols for nucleic acids are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al.; Kambara, H. et al. (1988) BioTechnology 6:816-821; Smith, L. et al. (1985) Nuc. Acids Res. 13:2399-2412; for polypeptides, see, e.g., Allen G. (1989) Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides, Elsevier, N.Y., especially chapter 5, and Greenstein and Winitz (1961) Chemistry of the Amino Acids, Wiley and Sons, N.Y. Carbohydrate labeling is described, e.g., in Chaplin and Kennedy (1986) Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Oxford. Labeling of other polymers will be performed by methods applicable to them as recognized by a person having ordinary skill in manipulating the corresponding polymer., 83852=At a size of about 30 microns by 30 microns, one million regions would take about 11 centimeters square or a single wafer of about 4 centimeters y 4 centimeters. Thus the present technology provides for making a single matrix of that size having all one million plus possible oligonucleotides. Region size is sufficiently small to correspond to densities of at least about 5 regions/cm2, 20 regions/cm2, 50 regions/cm2, 100 regions/cm2, and greater, including 300 regions/cm2, 1000 regions/cm2, 3K regions/cm2, 10K regions/cm2, 30K regions/cm2, 100K regions/cm2, 300K regions/cm2 or more, even in excess of one million regions/cm2., 226060=Any unreacted aminopropyl silane on the surface, i.e., those amino groups which have not had the NVOC-nucleotide attached, are now capped with acetyl groups (to prevent further reaction) by exposure to a 1:3 mixture of acetic anhydride in pyridine for 1 hour. Other materials which may perform this residual capping function include trifluoroacetic anhydride, formicacetic anhydride, or other reactive acylating agents. Finally, the slides are washed again with DMF, methylene chloride, and ethanol., 169492=In addition, fingerprinting may be used to identify an individual source of biological sample. See, e.g., Lander, E. (1989) Nature, 339:501-505, and references therein. For example, a DNA fingerprint may be used to determine whether a genetic sample arose from another individual. This would be particularly useful in various sorts of forensic tests to determine, e.g., paternity or sources of blood samples. Significant detail on the particulars of genetic fingerprinting for identification purposes are described in, e.g., Morris et al. (1989) \"Biostatistical evolution of evidence from continuous allele frequency distribution DNA probes in reference to disputed paternity of identity,\" J. Forensic Science 34:1311-1317; and Neufeld et al. (1990) Scientific American 262:46-53; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 282642=In this way, short probes may be used to determine the mapping of long targets or long targets may be used to map the position of shorter probes. See, e.g., Craig et al. 1990 Nuc. Acids Res. 18:2653-2660., 235203=Hybridization conditions are described in detail, e.g., in Hames and Higgins (1985) Nucleic Acid Hybridisation: A Practical Approach; and the considerations for selecting particular conditions are described, e.g., in Wetmur and Davidson, (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 31:349-370, and Wood et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:1585-1588. As described above, conditions are desired which can distinguish matching along the entire length of the probe from where there is one or more mismatched bases. The length of incubation and conditions will be similar, in many respects, to the hybridization conditions used in Southern blot transfers. Typically, the GC bias may be minimized by the introduction of appropriate concentrations of the alkylammonium buffers, as described above., 57639=This 192 is derived from the observation that with the subsequence 10100 at the far left of the sequence, in positions 1-5, there are only 32 possible sequences. Likewise, for that particular subsequence in positions 2-6, 3-7, 4-8, 5-9, and 6-10. So, to sum up all of the sequences that could contain 10100, there are 32 for each position and 6 positions for a total of about 192 possible sequences. However, some of these 10 digit sequences will have been counted twice. Thus, by virtue of containing the 10100 subsequence, the number of possible 10-mer sequences has been decreased from 1024 sequences to less than about 192 sequences., 167987=In addition, the availability of substrates having the entire repertoire of possible sequences of a defined length opens up the possibility of sequencing by hybridization. This sequence may be de novo determination of an unknown sequence, particularly of nucleic acid, verification of a sequence determined by another method, or an investigation of changes in a previously sequenced gene, locating and identifying specific changes. For example, often Maxam and Gilbert sequencing techniques are applied to sequences which have been determined by Sanger and Coulson. Each of those sequencing technologies have problems with resolving particular types of sequences. Sequencing by hybridization may serve as a third and independent method for verifying other sequencing techniques. See, e.g., (1988) Science 242:1245., 212221=Fingerprinting may also be used for genetic tracing or for identifying individuals for forensic science purposes. See, e.g., Morris, J. et al. (1989) \"Biostatistical Evaluation of Evidence From Continuous Allele Frequency Distribution DNA Probes in Reference to Disputed Paternity and Identity,\" J. Forensic Science 34:1311-1317, and references provided therein; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 222414=After 8 min the plate was then rinsed with acetonitrile, then oxidized with I2 /H2 O/THF/lutidine for 1 min washed and dried. The slide was then exposed to a 1:3 mixture of acetic anhydride:pyridine for 1 h, then washed and dried. The substrate was then photolyzed in dioxane at 362 nm at 14 mW/cm2 for 10 min using a 500 \u03bcm checkerboard mask, dried, and then treated with a mixture of the following:}",

The present invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. The present inventions provide greatly improved methods and apparatus for synthesis of polymers on substrates. It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. By way of example, the invention has been described primarily with reference to the use of photoremovable protective groups, but it will be readily recognized by those of skill in the art that sources of radiation other than light could also be used. For example, in some embodiments it may be desirable to use protective groups which are sensitive to electron beam irradiation, x-ray irradiation, in combination with electron beam lithograph, or x-ray lithography techniques. Alternatively, the group could be removed by exposure to an electric current. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the above description, but should instead be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the",
