A clutch 34 in accordance with the present invention represents a significant improvement relative to conventional clutches. The inventive clutch is able to transfer an object 12 between multiple rotational bodies 14, 16 in either direction in response to torque provided by a single motor 30. As a result, a single motor 30 can be used in assemblies such as assembly 10, eliminating the need for multiple motors and reducing the cost and space requirements for such systems. Clutch 34 is also advantageous because the operation of the clutch is automatic and does not require external power. In particular, engagement and disengagement of the outer races 48, 50 of clutch 34 occurs without the need for an operator to manually shift the clutch 34. Further, the clutch operates without the need for electrical or fluid actuation enabling its use in applications where external power may be unavailable (e.g., window screen system during adverse weather conditions). , the operation of clutch 30 and assembly 10 will be described. Object 12 may be rolled upon rotational body 16. In order to transfer at least a portion of object 12 to",
