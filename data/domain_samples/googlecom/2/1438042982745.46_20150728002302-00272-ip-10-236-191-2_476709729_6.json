    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{46113=FIG. 7 shows the structure of FIG. 6 (from an xy perspective) after patterning of the x-direction thickness of the memory cell material. FIG. 7 shows two memory cells 145A and 145B patterned from memory cell region 135A (see FIG. 5). The patterning may be accomplished using conventional techniques for etching, in this example, refractory metal silicide and silicon material to the exclusion of masking material 180 (e.g., Si3N4). The definition of the x-direction thickness involves, in one embodiment, an etch to conductive material 150 of the memory line stack to define memory cells 145A and 145B of memory cell region 135A. In the case of an etch, the etch proceeds through the memory line stack to, in this example, a portion of conductor or signal line material 150. A timed etch may be utilized to stop an etch at this point. Following the patterning, N-type dopant is introduced at the base of each trench 190 to form pockets 200 having a dopant concentration on the order of about 1018-1020 atoms/cm3 (e.g., N+ region) between memory cells 145A and 145B. Pockets 200 serve, in one sense, to maintain continuity of a row line. Dielectric material 210 of, for example, silicon dioxide material is then introduced over the structure to a thickness on the order of 100 \u212b to 50,000 \u212b., 43206=FIG. 3 shows the structure of FIG. 2 after a further fabrication operation in memory cell regions 135A and 135B. In one embodiment, memory cell regions 135A and 135B are introduced as strips with the x-direction dimension greater than the z-direction dimension. Overlying epitaxial portion 120 of substrate 100 is first conductor or signal line material 140. In one example, first conductor or signal line material 140 is N-type doped polysilicon formed by the introduction of, for example, phosphorous or arsenic to a concentration on the order of about 1018-1019 atoms/cm3 (e.g., N+ silicon). In this example, first conductor or signal line material 140 serves as an address line, a row line (e.g., row line 20 of FIG. 1). Overlying first conductor or signal line material 140 is an isolation device (e.g., isolation device 25 of FIG. 1). In one example, the isolation device is a PN diode formed of N-type silicon portion 150 (dopant concentration on the order of about 1017-1018 atoms/cm3) and P-type silicon portion 160 (dopant concentration on the order of about 1019-1020 atoms/cm3). Although a PN diode is shown, it is to be appreciated that other isolation structures are similarly suitable. Such devices include, but are not limited to, MOS devices., 48978=In the example where electrode material 230 is semiconductor material such as polycrystalline silicon, following the introduction of electrode material 230, a dopant is introduced into the polycrystalline silicon to, in one aspect, lower the resistance of the material. In the example shown, a suitable dopant is a P-typed dopant such as boron introduced to a concentration on the order of about 1019-1020 atoms/cm3. In one embodiment, the dopant is introduced at an angle such that electrode material 230A along a side wall of trench 220 is primarily exposed to the dopant while electrode material 230B is exposed to little or no dopant. In this manner, the resistance of electrode material 230A may be reduced below the resistance of electrode material 230B. In the case of polycrystalline silicon, in one example, electrode material 230B is substantially intrinsic silicon. FIG. 9 shows dopant introduction 235, such as an implantation, at angle, \u03b1, of approximately 60\ufffd from horizontal to introduce a dopant (e.g., P-typed dopant) into electrode material 230A to the significant exclusion of electrode material 230B. Such an angle implantation may be carried out according to techniques known to those skilled in the art., 58403=As described above, electrode material 270 will be substantially adjacent to a volume of memory material. Electrode material 270 may be selected also for its surface chemical composition in promoting adhesion of a subsequently introduced volume of memory material. Si3N4, for example, shows good adhesion properties for a volume of chalcogenide memory material. In some cases, electrode material 270 may not provide sufficiently suitable ohmic contact between the electrode and the volume memory material for a desired application. In such cases, modifying material may be introduced into the electrode at a depth below the exposed surface of the electrode. In the example described, an electrode of polycrystalline silicon may have polycrystalline silicon at the exposed surface (referring to FIG. 11) and modifying material 270 at a depth below the exposed surface but not throughout or adjacent for the exposed surface (e.g., 200-1000 \u212b below the exposed surface). In one example, a second introduction (e.g., deposition) may also be employed to follow the introduction of electrode material 270 and locate polycrystalline silicon adjacent the exposed surface of the electrode., 41526=FIGS. 2-13 illustrate the fabrication of representative memory element 15 of FIG. 1. FIG. 2 shows a portion of substrate 100 that is, for example, a semiconductor substrate. In this example, a P-type dopant such as boron is introduced in portion 110. In one example, a suitable concentration of P-type dopant is on the order of above 5\ufffd1019\u22121\ufffd1020 atoms per cubic centimeters (atoms/cm3) rendering portion 110 of substrate 100 representatively P++. Overlying portion 110 of substrate 100, in this example, is portion 120 of P-type epitaxial silicon. In one example, the dopant concentration is on the order of about 1016-1017 atoms/cm3. The introduction and formation of P-type epitaxial silicon portion 120 and P++ silicon portion 110 may follow techniques known to those of skill in the art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. In the preceding example, the volume of memory material 30 was heated to a high temperature to amorphisize the material and reset the memory element (e.g., program 0). Heating the volume of memory material to a lower crystallization temperature crystallizes the material and sets the memory element (e.g., program 1). It is to be appreciated that the association of reset and set with amorphous and crystalline material, respectively, is a convention and that at least an opposite convention may be adopted. It is also to be appreciated from this example that the volume of memory material 30 need not be partially set or reset by varying the current flow and duration through the volume of memory material. FIGS. 16 and 17 compare the resistance attributable to the resistivity of an electrode for a phase change memory element such as memory element 15. FIG. 16 shows the current versus voltage for a doped polycrystalline silicon electrode without an introduced modifying species. FIG. 17 shows the current versus voltage for a polycrystalline silicon electrode with an introduced modifying species, specifically",
