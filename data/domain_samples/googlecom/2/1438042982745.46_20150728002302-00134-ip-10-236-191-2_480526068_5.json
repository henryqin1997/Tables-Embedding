    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18416=The process for making such meltblown webs is well known in the art and is used extensively for manufacturing a wide variety of commercial nonwoven products. Representative examples of the meltblowing process are described in U.S. Pat. No. Patent No. 3,978,185 to Buntin et al. dated Aug. 31, 1976; U.S. Pat. No. Patent No. 4,298,649 to Meitner dated Nov. 3, 1981; and U.S. Pat. No. Patent No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al. dated July 11, 1978, all herein incorporated by reference. For purposes of meltblowing, it is preferred that the apparent viscosity of the polymer as it leaves the die tip be about 500 poise or less, most preferably from about 150 to about 300 poise. Higher apparent viscosities provide lower throughputs which are generally unsatisfactory for commercial operation. Increased throughputs can be achieved by lowering the apparent viscosity, which can be lowered either by lowering the molecular weight of the polymer or by raising the temperature of the polymer. It will be appreciated, however, that other meltblowing processes will produce webs suitable for purposes of this invention. The meltblown web can be combined or laminated to other supporting webs, such as spunbonded webs, in order to impart strength or other attributes to the product., 11070=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 189,888, filed on May 3, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,755., 20383=The size of the meltblown web can be from about 200 to about 2000 square centimeters, preferably from about 600 to about 1,000 square centimeters, and most preferably about 800 square centimeters. The minimum size of the web is limited by the amount of liquid detergent the web can absorb and hold. The maximum size is determined by consumer acceptance, convenience and packaging considerations. It is preferred that the meltblown web be pattern bonded to maintain integrity during use. Pattern bonding is commonly performed during convert of meltblown webs by hot embossing or ultrasonic bonding of the newly formed web. The product of this invention can be dispensed in sheet form or from perforated rolls. In addition, the single sheets can be perforated to be torn in half for half loads of laundry.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated that the foregoing discussion, given for purposes of illustration, is not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention. After drying, the dried web passes around a tension control roll 36, a pull roll 37, a slitter roll 38, a Mount Hope roll 39, and a rewind drive roll 40. The web is thereby wound onto the rewind roll 41 for subsequent converting and packaging operations. The treated web then passes through a dryer 35, preferably an air flotation dryer, which preferably removes substantially all (up to about 95 percent) of the available moisture, which includes alcohol and water. More typically the moisture removal will be on the order of about 80 percent. The product leaving the dryer contains concentrated liquid detergent having a gel-like consistency, yet the web has an acceptable feel. After leaving the slotted bar applicator, the saturated web 31 passes through a controlled nip between nip rolls 32 and 33 which serves to enhance the even distribution of the solution throughout the web. FIG. 2, shows a supply roll 21 of the powder-treated meltblown web, which contains certain powdered detergent ingredients as described in connection with FIG. 1, to be saturated with the balance of the liquid detergent ingredients. Preferably the web has been thermally pattern-bonded to provide sufficient integrity to withstand a wash and dry cycle without disintegrating. The web 22 is passed through a",
