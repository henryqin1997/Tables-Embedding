    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5941=FIG. 5 shows a photomicrograph of a colony of alkaline phosphatase positive cells derived in culture from an approximately 10.5 week old human embryonic testis. Following dissociation, testis cells were seeded into wells of a 24-well plate containing irradiated feeder cells (Sl4 h220) and growth factors 10 ng/ml bFGF, 60 ng/ml soluble SCF and 10 ng/ml LIF). After 5 days the cells were subcultured at a dilution of 1:4 into wells containing a feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryo fibroblasts with the same cocktail of growth factors. After 10 days the cultures were fixed and stained for alkaline phosphatase activity. The colony shown here (one of many) closely resembles colonies of alkaline phosphatase positive cells derived from primordial germ cells of the mouse embryo (see FIG. 2C). In particular, the human cells associate into tightly packed clusters (see arrow in FIG. 5C). FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C are different magnifications of the same colony. The shadow in FIG. 5A is the edge of the well in which the cells were growing.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18518=Since pluripotential embryonic stem cells (ES) can give rise to virtually any mature cell type they are of great value for uses such as creating genetically manipulated animals. However, according to the published scientific literature, it has previously been possible only to obtain ES cells from mice. These murine ES cells were obtained from cultures of early blastocysts. Attempts at isolating ES cells from other animals apparently have failed. One patent publication, Evans et al., published Apr. 5, 1990 under PCT Publication WO 90/03432, claims that pluripotential ES cells can be obtained from ungulate blastocysts in vitro. The application claims that these cells are expected to be epithelial and to have a very different morphology to mouse ES cells because ungulate embryos normally form an \u201cembryonic disc\u201d. This appears to be the basis of the allegation that the cells which they grow out of pig and cow blastocysts and which have a more epithelial morphology than mouse ES cells are, in fact, ES cells. However, mouse embryos also develop an epithelial layer of pluripotential embryonic ectoderm or epiblast cells. This layer is called an \u201cegg-cylinder\u201d rather than an \u201cembryonic disc\u201d. Therefore, there is apparently no strong embryological reason why the ungulate ES cells should have a different morphology to mouse ES cells. In addition, the evidence presented in the Evans appliction for the differentiation of the cow and pig putative ES cell lines into differentiated cell types in monolayer culture, in embryoid bodies and in tumors, is not convincing. Therefore, there is a great need to produce and maintain ES cells from a variety of different animals., 15286=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/217,921, filed Mar. 25, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,926 which status is allowed, and which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 07/958,562, filed Oct. 8, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,357., 46620=PGC cultures on Sl4-m220 feeder cells on a chamber slide (Nunc) were washed twice with PBS containing 2% calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide and then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody SSEA-1 (1:100 dilution) on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 mins with FITC-conjugated Fab\u2032 fragment of goat anti mouse IgG (H+L) (Cappell, 1:5 dilution). After washing in PBS, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before staining for AP., 56698=Cultures are initiated as described above by dissecting C57BL/6 8.5 days p.c. embryos free of extraembryonic tissues. Fragments comprising the posterior third of the embryo (from the base of the allantois to the first sornite) are then pooled, rinsed with Dulbecco's Ca++.Mg++ free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mM EDTA (GIBCO) and gentle pipetting. This single cell suspension is then plated in 0.1% gelatin coated 24 well dishes (Corning) with irradiated Sl/Sl4 m220 cells as feeder layers at a concentration of approximately 0.5 embryo equivalents per well. The cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Specialty Media, Lavallette, N.J.) supplemented with 0.01 mM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO), 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), 15% fetal bovine serum (selected batches, Hyclone) and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For these primary cultures, the medium is additionally supplemented with soluble recombinant rat SF at 60 ng/ml, bFGF at 20 ng/ml (GIBCO), and LIF at 20 ng/ml. After 6 days some of the cultures are stained for alkaline phosphatase (AP) as described above in order to assess the survival and proliferation of PGCs. After 10 days, parallel cultures are dissociated into single cells and plated onto mouse embryo fibroblast (mef) feeder layers with LIF (ESGRO, GIBCO 1000 U/ml). These cultures are monitored for the appearance of colonies of EG cells. Individual EG colonies are isolated with a micropipette and lines established. EG cultures are then maintained in the same manner as ES cell lines with irradiated mefs as feeder cells and LIF (Smith et al., 1988 and Williams et al., 1988).}",
