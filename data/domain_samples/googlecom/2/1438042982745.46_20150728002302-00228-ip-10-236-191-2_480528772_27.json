A flame was generated with the hydrogen/oxygen ratio of five and with the length of 35 cm. The direction of the flame was set to be essentially horizontal (the angle of flame and ground was approximately 0-20 degrees). The diameter of the burner outlet was 40 mm (\u201cKSA-40,\u201d Koushinrikagaku Seikow Co., Tokyo, Japan). A water curtain and a water bath were set at 90 cm from the burner and under the flame, respectively. The sample fired (83-140 mesh) was fed from the bottom of the flame through a pipe (15 mm in diameter and 300 mm length). The sample was molten in the flame to form spherical droplets and quenched in the water curtain and water bath. This process showed steady state at least for three hours. The resultant beads were heat-treated at 1100\ufffd C. for 5 minutes after drying. The beads obtained were clear and had a Vickers hardness of 1390 kg/mm2. The sample showed ZrO2 phase in X-ray diffraction analysis., 131242=The flame was generated with the hydrogen/oxygen ratio of five, with a length of 35 cm. The direction of flame was set to be horizontal (the angle of flame and ground was approximately 0-20 degrees).

The sample showed ZrO2 phase in X-ray diffraction analysis., 130486=Silica powder (\u201cSNOW MARK SP-3,\u201d Kinseimatech) 1155 g, zirconium oxide powder (\u201cEP,\u201d Daiichikigenso Co.) 2000 g, aluminum oxide powder (\u201cAES-12,\u201d Sumitomo Chem. Co) 2600 g, magnesium oxide powder (#200, Tateho Maag Co. Hyogo, Japan) 320 g, and dispersant (\u201cPOISE 532A,\u201d Kao Corp.) were mixed with 8000 g of water. The mixture was mixed for 20 hours and dried. The dried powder was ground and put into glass container. The container was rotated for 15 minutes for agglomeration. The agglomerated powder with 83-140 mesh particles (106-180 micron in diameter) was obtained by sieving., 23067=Glass beads containing 42-52% by weight silica, 10-23% by weight alumina, 1-8% by weight zirconia, and 10-25% by weight calcia are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 53-102325., 23977=Glass beads containing 35-55% by weight silica, 15-35% by weight alumina, 2-12% by weight titania, 6% by weight or less zirconia, 0.5-10% by weight boron oxide, and 0-20% by weight calcia are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-41852., 136946=The resultant beads were approximately 100% yield as clear beads. Furthermore, the beads showed 1100 kg/mm2 of Vickers hardness after heat treatment at 1100\ufffd C. for 5 minutes., 156816=Examples 46-49 and 55 were formulated in larger batch sizes (1 kg) for bead formation. Powders were hand mixed with a spoon for 5 minutes, then combined with 1500-2000 ml water and added to a 1 gallon ball mill. Samples were milled for 24 hours, dried in glass pans, and melted at 1500\ufffd C. for 60 minutes in platinum crucibles. Glass melts were poured into a high velocity natural gas burner flame and particles were collected in a screened hopper., 70517=The procedure described in the above-mentioned Example 2 was repeated. In the present example, however, heating of the bead precursor in order to form the transparent beads was performed at 1,000\ufffd C. instead of 950\ufffd C. The Vickers hardness of the transparent beads obtained in the present example was, 1,009 kg/mm2. Furthermore, the electric oven made by Advantec Toyo Co., Tokyo, Japan (ICS-1600, Type KS-1600) was used for heating the bead precursor because it is suitable for heating to high temperatures of 1,000\ufffd C. or higher., 22868=Glass fibers containing 45-65% by weight silica, 0-5% by weight alumina, and 0-24% by weight zirconia are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 53-22513., 66665=In addition, the content ratio of each oxide contained in the transparent beads was analyzed using an energy dispersing X-ray spectroscopic analyzer (combining a scanning electron-microscope (JSM-820, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a spectroscopic analyzer (860-500J, Oxford Inst. Co., England)). The respective content ratios of the oxides were 26% by weight of silica, 39% by weight of alumina, 30% by weight of zirconia and 5% by weight of zinc oxide. Moreover, the transparent beads of the present example were found to be amorphous from the results of X-ray diffraction analysis (RINT-1200-X Type, X-ray compatible type, Rigaku denki Co., Tokyo, Japan)., 136643=Glass beads were prepared by following Example 39. In this example, the compositions of the starting materials were silica 1150 g, zirconium oxide powder 2000 g, aluminum oxide powder 2600 g, and calcium carbonate powder (\u201c3N-A,\u201d karusito Co) 650 g. The firing condition was 1350\ufffd C., 36072=Transparent fused beads according to the present invention exhibit generally high hardness levels, generally high crush strengths, and high durability. For example, the Vickers hardness of the transparent beads is preferably at least about 700 kg/mm2, more preferably at least about 900 kg/mm2, even more preferably at least about 1,000 kg/mm2, and most preferably at least about 1300 kg/mm2. Although there is no particular limit on the upper limit of hardness, the hardness is typically no greater than about 2,000 kg/mm2., 122307=Glass beads were prepared by following Example 29. In this example, the composition of the starting material was silica (Wako) 1150 g, zirconium oxide powder (Wako) 2000 g, aluminum oxide powder (Wako) 2600 g, and calcium carbonate powder (\u201c3N-A,\u201d Ca;seed Co., Japan) 650 g. The firing temperature was 1350\ufffd C. The resultant beads had a Vickers hardness of 1100 kg/mm2 after heat treatment at 1100\ufffd C. for 5 minutes., 120274=Silica powder (\u201cSNOW MARK SP-3,\u201d Kinseimatech) 1155 g, zirconium oxide powder (\u201cEP,\u201d Daiichikigenso Co.) 2000 g, aluminum oxide powder (\u201cAES-12,\u201d Simitomo Chem. Co.) 2600 g, magnesium oxide powder (#200, Tateho Mag Co., Japan) 320 g, and dispersant (\u201cPOISE\u201d 532A, Kao Corp., Japan) were mixed with 8000 g of water. The mixture was mixed for 20 hours and dried. The dried powder was ground and put into glass container. The container was rotated for 15 minutes for agglomeration. The agglomerated powder with 83-140 mesh particles (106-180 micron in diameter) was obtained by sieving., 125798=The sintered sample was held at one end and melted at the other end with the flame of an acetylene-oxygen burner. Glass beads were formed by dropping the melt into water. The resultant beads were heat-treated at 1100\ufffd C. for 5 minutes after drying. The beads obtained were clear and had a Vickens hardness of 1390 kg mm2. The sample showed ZrO2 phase in X-ray diffraction analysis., 36671=The crush strength values of the beads of the invention can be determined according to the test procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,772,511. Using this procedure, the beads demonstrate a crush strength of preferably at least about 100,000 psi (690 MPa), more preferably at least about 140,000 psi (960 MPa), and most preferably at least about 180,000 psi (1240 MPa).}",

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made to the above described embodiments of the invention without departing from the essential nature thereof. The invention is intended to encompass all such modifications within the scope of the appended claims. Example 56 was formed into retroreflective beads by flame treating presintered particles. A powder batch was prepared as previously described. The powder was hand-packed into a shallow alumina boat and sintered at 1250\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. The sintered batch was ground with mortar and pestle, and sized by sieving into 37-120 micron and 120-250 micron fractions. The sintered particles were fed into the flame of a hydrogen/oxygen glass blowing torch at a rate of about 0.5 g per minute. The particles were carried by the torch against a steel backplate equipped with a sprinkler bar to provide a water covered surface. Examples 46-49 and 55 were formulated in larger batch sizes (1 kg) for bead formation. Powders were hand mixed with a spoon for 5 minutes, then combined with 1500-2000 ml water and added to a 1 gallon ball mill. Samples were milled for 24 hours, dried in glass pans, and melted at 1500\ufffd C. for 60 minutes in platinum crucibles. Glass melts were poured into a high velocity",
