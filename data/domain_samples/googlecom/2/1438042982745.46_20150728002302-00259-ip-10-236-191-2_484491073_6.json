No. 3,994,771, issued Nov. 30, 1976 to Morgan, Jr. et al. extends the concept of layered paper to through air drying., 20165=U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,324, issued Feb. 11, 1992 to Awofeso et al. discloses a two-ply, two-layer paper towel having two outer layers and two inner layers. The two outer layers comprise blends of Kraft softwood and Kraft hardwood. The two inner layers comprise high bulking fibers or chemi-thermomechanical pulp., 37351=It will be apparent that the paper 20 according to the present invention may either be through air dried or conventionally dried with press felts. If the paper 20 is through air dried, it may be made on clothing woven on a Jacquard loom, as disclosed, for example, in European patent application 0 677 612 A2, published Oct. 18, 1995 in the names of Wendt et al. Furthermore, the paper 20 according to the present invention may be creped as is known in the art or may be uncreped. Also, the paper 20 may be micro-contracted as, illustrated in the aforementioned application published in the names of Wendt et al., or need not be micro-contracted., 19769=European Patent Application 0 531 112 A1, published Mar. 10, 1993, in the name of Jujo discloses a three layer toilet paper. The intermediate layer is about one hundred percent wood pulp. The outer layers comprise wood and rayon pulps mixed in a weight ratio of 40-80:60-20. This arrangement is said to provide a strong, absorbent toilet paper which is also water dispersible., 24883=One or more of the layers may comprise cellulosic fibers, so that the paper 20 is a macroscopically monoplanar cellulosic fibrous structure. Cellulosic fibers and cellulosic fibrous structures are fully described and defined in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,691, issued Aug. 22, 1995 to Phan et al., the disclosures of which patent is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, one or more layers may comprise synthetic fibers, as also described in the aforementioned '691 patent issued to Phan et al., 29521=To further increase the soft tactile sensation of the outer layers, chemical softeners may be added to the paper 20 during papermaking. Suitable chemical softeners may be added according to the teachings of commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,217,576, issued Jun. 8, 1993 to Phan and 5,262,007, issued Nov. 16, 1993 to Phan et al., the disclosures of which patents are incorporated herein by reference. Redibond 5320, available from the National Starch and Chemical Corporation of Bridgewater, N.J. may be used in the outer layer 24O to provide additional chemical bonding in the hardwood of the outer layer 24O and thereby reduce lint in the resulting paper 20., 34205=Suitable cross-linked cellulosic fibers may be made according to commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,183,707, issued Feb. 2, 1993 to Herron et al. and 5,190,563, issued Mar. 2, 1993 to Herron et al., which patents are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the curled fibers may not be cross-linked. Curled fibers which are not cross-linked may be made by flash drying, dry fiberizing, and wet high consistency curling. Suitable methods for preparing curled fibers are described in European Patent Publication GB 2 279 372 A, filed Jun. 23, 1994 by Farrington, Jr., et al., which publication is incorporated herein by reference., 15719=Tissue paper needs to have properties which meet three primary criteria in order to be consumer acceptable: bulk which encompasses the inversely related properties of caliper and density, strength and softness. Typically softness and strength have been optimized by layering the fibers comprising the paper. Bulk is obtained in other manners, such as molding a wet embryonic web into a photopolymer belt, according to commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,859, issued Jan. 20, 1987 to Trokhan, the disclosure of which patent is incorporated herein by reference., 24179=Suitable processes for layering according to the present invention are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,994,771, issued Nov. 30, 1976 to Morgan, Jr. et al.; 4,225,382, issued Sep. 30, 1980 to Kearney et al.; and 4,300,981, issued Nov. 17, 1981 to Carstens, the disclosures of which patents are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of showing suitable layering processes., 18731=U.S. Pat. No. 2,881,669, issued Apr. 14, 1959 to Thomas et al. discloses paper having three layers. The three layers comprise a central layer of short fibers and two outer layers of long fibers. This arrangement is said to improve strength and provide reduced ply separation. Papers subject to ply separation, i.e. having layers which shear during creping, are said to be disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,001, issued Aug. 28, 1979 to Dunning et al. Dunning et al. discloses a three layered paper having a central layer of weakly bonded fibers between two outer layers of strongly bonded fibers. Ply separable paper is also disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,225,382 issued Sep. 30, 1980 to Kearney et al. Kearney et al. teaches a three layered structure having two layers of well bonded fibers separated by an interior layer of short fibers.}",

Also, the paper 20 may be micro-contracted as, illustrated in the aforementioned application published in the names of Wendt et al., or need not be micro-contracted. Alternatively, a paper 20 may be made having only one outer layer 24O with relatively short fibers, and intermediate layers 24IN as set forth above. Such a paper 20 may be combined with another such paper 20 in a laminate to form a two ply paper 20 having both outwardly facing surfaces comprise relatively short papermaking fibers which impart softness to the user. In an alternative embodiment, a four layer paper 20 may be provided. The four layer structure can have two outer layers 24O of relatively short fibers, such as eucalyptus. Such a paper 20 may",
