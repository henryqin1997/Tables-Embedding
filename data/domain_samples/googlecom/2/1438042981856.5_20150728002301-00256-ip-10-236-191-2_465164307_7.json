In order to properly recover data from the primary volume at a previous point in time, an image of the primary volume is loaded onto a location on the network, each location having a separate identification known as a logical unit number (LUN). This image of the primary volume can be built by using a method to recover data by accessing a previously stored snapshot, as disclosed in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/772,017, filed Feb. 4, 2004, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, many modifications and variations could be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. The above description serves to illustrate and not limit the particular invention in any way. Automated searches can be performed in a similar fashion, such that the system could automatically find a certain file or content. For example, if a virus struck and corrupted the system, it is difficult to navigate many volumes by time. This is because the virus could have been there already for a long time. Executable files don't change over time, except when a virus strikes, so the system could be queried to find the point in time when the executable changed. Another useful query would be to see a list of different versions of the same file, including size and attributes. From the list, the user can immediately determine the time when the file was updated, for example, during an all-night work session, because it will include the greatest number of changes. The method 400 provides a three-dimensional front end for browsing a file system. The range selected by the user (either by discrete snapshots or by a time window) defines the bounds of the objects that can be browsed. If a particular object exists in multiple snapshots, that object will appear in the list",
