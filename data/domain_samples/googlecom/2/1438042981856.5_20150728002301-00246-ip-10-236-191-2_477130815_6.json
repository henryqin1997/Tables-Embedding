The processor is coupled to thirteen address lines comprising address bus 14, as well as to eight bi-directional data lines comprising data bus 16. The BUSRQ and WAIT control inputs of the processor are tied through resistor R7 to a five volt source and are therefore held inactive. A variety of other control and interrupt lines are tied to other devices as will be detailed below. The address bus 14 and data bus 16 are coupled to read-only memory Z3. Additionally, read line L1 couples processor Z2 to read-only memory Z3. Z3 is a Type 2716 EPROM in this embodiment which stores 2048 bytes. Therefore, eleven bits of the address bus are coupled to Z3., 51459=TL2150-P, 3.4 V: M2, 44120=Z17 generates speech by interpretation of sequential phonetic information stored in read-only memories Z18 and Z19. These memories are preferably Type 52164 memories which hold 8,192 by eight bits. Information is provided from read-only memories Z18 and Z19 to Z17 through speech data bus B2, and Z17 demands specific data of memories Z18 and Z19 by way of speech address bus B1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description has disclosed what is believed presently to be a preferred form of the present invention, and has been intended as an illustration of the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, other embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims. If the line supply voltage falls below a predetermined minimum level, operational amplifier Z22 interrupts processor Z2 through line Z32. Processor Z2 then writes data to input/output interface Z16 which activates line L6 forcing a shutdown. Line L23 is activated which forces random access memories Z4 and Z5 to a micropowerhold status as described above. Thus, data will be preserved until system 10 is again started. When power is again restored to the line voltage supply, operational amplifier Z24 and counter Z23 provide a reset signal to processor Z2 through line L22 after a delay which allows all components of system 10 to warm up. System 10 may also request the user to identify himself through a code number or password. For purposes of billing based on amount of use, the number of occasions and total length of time in which system 10 was used by each authorized user may be recorded in random access memories Z4 and Z5. The system may also break contact with unauthorized users. Further, the system 10 may provide a synthetic voice summary of stored usage",
