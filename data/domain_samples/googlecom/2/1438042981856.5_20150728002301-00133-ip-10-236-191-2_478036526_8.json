For example, using the same 500 yard zero chart found in FIG. 5, if the shooter wishes to hit a target at 1100 yards, she estimates two or three secondary horizontal cross-hairs which should bracket the correct secondary horizontal cross-hair to use as an aiming point. The shooter guesses the correct cross-hair is between the cross-hair identified as 6 and the cross-hair identified as 8. She then performs the same calculation:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{208034=The system next requests the user to input information regarding wind-speed in miles per hour, meters per second, kilometers per hour, or knots per hour. Once this information has been input, the system requests the user to input wind direction (the clock position from the line of fire). Thus, if the wind is perpendicular to the line of fire and traveling from the shooter's right to the shooter's left, the wind direction would be \u201c3\u201d for the 3 o'clock position. If traveling in the opposite direction, the wind direction would be \u201c9\u201d for the 9 o'clock position. In a further embodiment, wind direction data is input by a system based on a 360 degree circle, with the number of degrees increasing in a clockwise direction around the shooter. For example, if the wind is perpendicular to the line of fire and traveling from the shooter's right to the shooter's left, the wind direction would be 90 degrees. Wind speed and direction is used by the system to calculate the appropriate adjustment to the aiming point at any effective range (that is, the number of vertical cross-hairs from the primary vertical cross-hair the aiming point will be offset into to wind so that the bullet will hit the target when it travels downrange)., 262694=As a further example, suppose that the shooter observes a moose in the distance, eating vegetables from a garden near a house. From a comparison with a door in the house, the shooter estimates the size of the moose to be 6 feet at the shoulder. Upon viewing this target in the reticle, the shooter aligns the horizontal arm 34 of the rangefinder with the ground level upon which the moose is standing, and the vertical arm 32 of the rangefinder with the moose's shoulder. The shooter determines that the moose's shoulder touches the cross-hair marked 5. The range can then be calculated as follows: Range=72/5\ufffd100=1440 yards, 174045=Next, the shooter can select the size of the bullseye (or target area) to be hit using a reticle of the present invention. For example, a selected bullseye could be 6 inches in diameter, 10 inches in diameter, 12 inches, 36 inches, 48 inches etc. A hit anywhere in the bullseye counts as a direct hit. For the purposes of this example, a 12 inch bullseye from a range of point blank to 1000 yards and a 36 inch bullseye from 1100 yards to 1650 yards were used., 221246=For very long range shooting (e.g., from 1000 to 3000 yards or more), it may be desirable to modify the targeting program to compensate for Coriolis effect and spin drift. The Coriolis effect is caused by the rotation of the earth. The Coriolis effect is an inertial force described by the 19th-century French engineer-mathematician Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis in 1835. Coriolis showed that, if the ordinary Newtonian laws of motion of bodies are to be used in a rotating frame of reference, an inertial force\u2014acting to the right of the direction of body motion for counterclockwise rotation of the reference frame or to the left for clockwise rotation\u2014must be included in the equations of motion. The effect of the Coriolis force is an apparent deflection of the path of an object that moves within a rotating coordinate system. The object does not actually deviate from its path, but it appears to do so because of the motion of the coordinate system. While the effect of the earth's movement while a bullet is in flight is negligible for short and medium range shots, for longer range shots the Coriolis effect may cause the shooter to miss. To compensate for Coriolis Effect, the targeting program of the present invention ca, for example, be modified to additionally pose queries regarding the hemisphere in which the shooter is located (Northern or Southern), the latitude of the firearm, the longitude of the firearm, or the direction of fire in degrees clockwise from true North. The latitude of the gun and hemisphere can, for example, be determined manually using a topographic map of the area in which the shooter is located, or automatically using a GPS device. With these inputs, and the range to target, the offset required by the Coriolis effect is factored in by the ballistics program when determining the aiming point for hitting the target., 57850=This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. application Ser.

No. 6,516,699, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entireties., 263675=As windage problems downrange, particularly over long ranges, may not be accurately predicted, even with the help of a PDA-based targeting system such as that described above, the experienced shooter can always use the reticle of the present invention to correct after a shot is observed to drift. As noted above, the secondary vertical cross-hairs may be, for example, evenly spaced at 1 Mil (which equals 3.6\u2033 at 100 yards), which provides a scale for adjusting a second shot towards the target. In a further embodiment, the reticle of the present invention uses a grid calibrated at 100 USMC Mils. For example, a 50 cal. bullet is fired at a target 1500 yards away. The intersection between the primary vertical cross-hair and the secondary horizontal cross-hair identified by number 11 is the selected aiming point. The bullet was observed to drift approximately two secondary vertical cross-hairs to the right of center. To correct for this drift, the shooter need only shift the aiming point to the intersection between the second vertical cross-hair to the right of the primary vertical cross-hair and the horizontal cross-hair identified by number 11, effectively moving the barrel of the weapon left the appropriate distance to compensate for windage. Likewise, if the bullet passes the target too high or too low, the shooter can use the secondary horizontal markings to adjust for range. For example, if the bullet is observed to pass two secondary horizontal markings above the selected aiming point when it passes the target, the shooter can quickly adjust by shifting his aiming point up two secondary horizontal cross-hairs, thus depressing the barrel of the firearm., 233974=Previous efforts to integrate a firearm, a target acquisition device and a ballistics calculator system have met with failure. For example, as described in the article \u201cThe Long Range Rifle System That Never Was\u201d, published in Tactical Shooter, February, 2000, pages 28-33, Jim Schatz describes Heckler & Koch's efforts to construct the Weitreichendes Scharfschutzengewehr 2000 (WSG2000), a weapon easy to shoot, user friendly, and providing a computerized sighting system that could reduce the potential for aiming errors due to the effects of range and weather, thereby increasing the probability of hitting long range targets with a single round at distances beyond 2000 meters, more than 1\ufffd miles away. Although full-scale prototypes were assembled at great cost, the project \u201cdied on the drawing table.\u201d Schatz concludes: \u201cAs recently 1990, and even today (i.e., February, 2000), a sighting system does not yet exist that can do all that was required of the WSG-2000 sighting system, in a small, portable and cost effective package for a \u201cman portable\u201d sniper rifle.\u201d (Tactical Shooter, February, 2000, page 32)., 87953=In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a method for shooting a target comprising a target acquisition device comprising a housing, a means for mounting the housing in a fixed, predetermined position relative to a firearm, an objective lens mounted in one end of said housing, and an ocular lens mounted in the opposite end of said housing; a reticle comprising a plurality of primary cross-hairs separated by predetermined distances, a plurality of secondary cross-hairs at predetermined distances along said plurality of primary cross-hairs, and a plurality of lead markings indicating rate of movement of the target along at least one said cross-hair; a ballistics calculator system for computing targeting information to hit a target comprising a processor comprising a ballistics computer program embodied in a computer-readable medium for analyzing information needed to accurately aim a firearm at a target using a target acquisition device with a reticle, with the program using information regarding one or more of external conditions, the firearm being used, the projectile being used, the target acquisition device and reticle being used, the shooter, the relation of the shooter wherein said target can be greater than 1000 yards from the shooter, and the ballistics drag model and retardation coefficient being used, and selecting an aiming point on the target acquisition device that accounts for the relation of the shooter to the target, and using the targeting information displayed by the ballistics calculator system to aim the firearm so as to hit the target. In a preferred embodiment, the target is hit by holding the aiming point on the target. In a further embodiment the ballistics calculator system projects a reticle specific for information regarding one or more of the firearm being used, the projectile being used, and the target acquisition device being used., 255419=Once the reticle has been calibrated as described above, it can be used in the field to acquire and hit targets of all sizes at long ranges. While the preferred range for the preferred embodiment is at least 500 yards to 2500 yards (assuming the firearm/ammunition combination selected are capable of accurately hitting a target at these ranges), a target acquisition device of the present invention can be used to hit targets very accurately at shorter ranges, for example 25 to 100 yards, as well as longer ranges, limited only by the capacity of the firearm and the eyesight of the shooter., 171046=For example, suppose the weapon to be used is a .50 caliber Bolt Action Rifle, Model M-93 with a 30 inch barrel built by Harris Gunworks in Phoenix, Ariz. The cartridge selected is .50 Cal Browning Machine Gun cartridge, each of which is constructed from a brass case (made by Winchester), primer (CCI #35); powder (218 grains ACC #8700 by Accurate Arms Powder), and bullet (750 grain AMAX Match bullet by Hornady, ballistic coefficient 0.750). Any conventional computer based ballistics program can then be used to determine bullet drop for this weapon/ammunition combination, such as, for example, the program written by W. R. Frenchu entitled \u201cBallistic V.4.0\u201d which was copyrighted 1988 and is based upon Ingalls' table, or \u201cBallistic Explorer for Windows,\u201d sold by Oehler Research of Austin, Tex., and range values for secondary horizontal cross-hairs and cross-wind offset values for secondary vertical cross-hairs calculated manually., 78378=In one embodiment, the reticle markings are assigned range and distance values, for example, automatically by using a computing device containing a ballistics calculator program which receives information regarding external field conditions (for example, date, time, temperature, relative humidity, target image resolution, barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, hemisphere, latitude, longitude, altitude), firearm information (for example, rate and direction of barrel twist, internal barrel diameter, internal barrel caliber, and barrel length), projectile information (for example, projectile weight, projectile diameter, projectile caliber, projectile cross-sectional density, one or more projectile ballistic coefficients (as used herein, \u201cballistic coefficient\u201d is as exemplified by William Davis, American Rifleman, March, 1989, incorporated herein by reference), projectile configuration, propellant type, propellant amount, propellant potential force, primer, and muzzle velocity of the cartridge), target acquisition device and reticle information (for example, type of reticle, power of magnification, first, second or fixed plane of function, distance between the target acquisition device and the barrel, the positional relation between the target acquisition device and the barrel, the range at which the telescopic gunsight was zeroed using a specific firearm and cartridge), information regarding the shooter (for example, the shooter's visual acuity, visual idiosyncrasies, heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, muscle activity, brain wave activity, and number and positional coordinates of spotters assisting the shooter), and the relation between the shooter and target (for example, the distance between the shooter and target, the speed and direction of movement of the target relative to the shooter, or shooter relative to the target (e.g., where the shooter is in a moving vehicle), and direction from true North), and the angle of the rifle barrel with respect to a line drawn perpendicularly to the force of gravity)., 281971=In additional embodiments, the ring-equipped reticle gives the shooter the ability to rapidly acquire and engage targets at very close distances to plus or minus 300 yards. When a target is spotted, and time is of the essence, the central ring that encases all or part of the reticle gives the shooter the ability to quickly discriminate the object to be targeted. When speed is an essential factor, the reticle of the present invention gives the shooter a safety factor equated in time. Whether beast or man, she who sees first wins. The ring-equipped reticle of the present invention allows the shooter to strike the target first, thereby dramatically increasing her or his odds of survival. In some embodiments, for extended range targets up to 1000 yards and beyond, the shooter uses the targeting grid of the present invention contained wholly or partially within all or part of the ring., 302514=In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a method for shooting a target comprising a target acquisition device comprising a housing, a means for mounting the housing in a fixed, predetermined position relative to a firearm, an objective lens mounted in one end of said housing, and an ocular lens mounted in the opposite end of said housing; a reticle comprising a plurality of primary cross-hairs separated by predetermined distances, a plurality of secondary cross-hairs at predetermined distances along said plurality of primary cross-hairs, and a plurality of lead markings indicating rate of movement of the target along at least one said cross-hair; a ballistics calculator system for computing targeting information to hit a target comprising a processor comprising a ballistics computer program for analyzing information needed to accurately aim a firearm at a target using a target acquisition device with a reticle, with the program using information regarding one or more of external conditions, the firearm being used, the projectile being used, the target acquisition device and reticle being used, the shooter, the relation of the shooter and the target, wherein the target can be greater than 1000 yards from the shooter, the ballistics drag model and retardation coefficient being used (for example, G1, G2, G5, G6, G7, G8, GS (Round ball), GL, RA, Ingalls, and custom drag models based upon the actual bullet being used), and selecting an aiming point on the target acquisition device that accounts for the relation of the shooter to the target, and using the targeting information displayed by the ballistics calculator system to aim the firearm so as to hit the target. In some embodiments of the present invention, the ballistics calculator enables the user to match projectile shape to standard or custom drag models. In some embodiments, the user selects an exterior ballistic calculation method from a menu, including, for example, the Siacci analytical method of solution, numerical integration solutions using the drag models developed by Maievski, Ingalls, the Gavr\ufffds Commission, and the British 1909 Commission, point-mass numerical integration using standard reference projectiles, point-mass numerical integration using Robert L. McCoy's McDrag algorithm, modified point-mass models, the drag models developed by the United States Army Ballistics Research Laboratory (USABRL), and 6-Degrees-Of-Freedom (6DOF) models. In other embodiments, the ballistics calculator of the present invention calculates the ballistics coefficient for a projectile that may or may not be different from the standard sea-level ballistics coefficient. The ballistics calculator of the present invention is able, as an option, to convert the ballistic coefficient to custom drag models and ballistics coefficients for any drag model using velocity or bullet dimension. In further embodiments, the ballistics calculator of the present invention calculates vertical and horizontal cant error at zero range for the entire projectile path. In some embodiments, for high elevation firing, the user selects, for example, one coefficient of drag for a range of less than or equal to, for example, 1000 yards, a second coefficient of drag/ballistic coefficient for 1000 to 1500 yards, a third for greater than 1500 yards, and an optional fourth coefficient of drag for use at very high altitudes. In a preferred embodiment, the target is hit by holding the aiming point on the target.}",
