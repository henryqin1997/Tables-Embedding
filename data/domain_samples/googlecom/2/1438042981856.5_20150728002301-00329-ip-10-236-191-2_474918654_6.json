Though the embodiment of FIG. 2 utilizes various gates made of CMOS transistors, the circuitry can be realized by other logic gates, such as TTL. Provided that number of data is 26 bits, when N=3, the addition time is 16 stages of logic gate, and when N=5, the addition time is 18 stages of logic gate. In order to minimize the size of hard ware, the number N is preferably large, and accordingly for number of data of 24-32 bits, it is preferable to select N=4 as done in the embodiment of FIG. 2. When the number of bits of the first block adder P1 is N bits, then the preferable number of bits for the second, third, fourth and fifth block adders, P2, P3, P4 and P5 become respectively N, N+1, N+2 and N+3; and for further longer data, the dispositions of the number of bits of respective block-adders may be disposed in the same way. In practical examples, for instance, of 24-bit data adding and 32-bit data adding, the parallel binary adder comprising 16 stages of gate logic and 18 stages of gate logic, respectively,",
