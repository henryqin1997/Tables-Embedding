The first byte of each specifier indicates the addressing mode for that specifier. This byte is usually broken in halves, with one half specifying the addressing mode and the other half specifying a register to be used for addressing. The instructions preferably have a variable length, and various types of specifiers can be used with the same opcode, as disclosed in Strecker et al., U.S Pat. No. 4,241,397 issued Dec. 23, 1980.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the above, a branch prediction unit for a pipelined computer has been disclosed that predicts and pre-processes multiple branch instructions simultaneously to reduce the frequency of stalls due to incorrect branch predictions. The prediction is made at the earliest possible time and is made based upon the most reliable information available about the past history of execution in the computer or execution of similar computer programs. A branch history cache is used storing previously computed target addresses, but the cache need not be flushed during a change in the computer program because the cache also stores associated displacement information which is compared with the actual displacement information for the branch instruction being predicted to verify that the target address in the cache is correct. To minimize the size of the cache, only new \"branch taken\" entries are written into the cache. Control logic is also disclosed for making branch predictions as soon as possible regardless of the order in which a branch instruction is decoded, its target address is computed, and its branch decision is made. The branch prediction unit is simplified by partitioning the control logic into marker logic which records branch predictions and decisions and microcode which responds to the sequence of instruction decoding, target address computation, and branch decision. In addition, a branch resolution logic in the execution unit further reduces the frequency and length of stalls by making the",
