Consequently, no jitter occurs, or any jitter that may occur can be minimized. The present invention is described above with reference to embodiments applied to the unidirectional strobe scheme shown in FIG. 7. Nevertheless, the present invention is also applicable to any configuration using a signal line for transmitting the sync signal in one direction. The foregoing description concerns a case in which the duty factor of the clock is 50% and the data can be output and retrieved at the leading edge and the trailing edge of the clock. In the case where the duty factor of the clock is displaced from 50%, however, a 180\ufffd DLL circuit is required for the controller and the memory, respectively. Even in such a case, it is not necessary to generate a signal one fourth of the clock period out of phase. The 180\ufffd DLL circuit can be realized by two stages of the delay circuit in the 90\ufffd DLL circuit 51 and",
