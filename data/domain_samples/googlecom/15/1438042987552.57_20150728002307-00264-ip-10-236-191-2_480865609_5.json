    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While only a particular embodiment of the invention has been disclosed herein, it will be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art that numerous changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention. Still another significant advantage of the system is its flexibility. Each group of machines can be added to or subtracted from without disturbing the operation of the overall system, and additional local microcomputers and associated groups of machines and machine microcomputers can be added to the system relatively easily. Furthermore, if for some reason there is a reduction in the need for the total plant capacity, one or more of the local branches of the system can be simply turned off, and the front end microcomputer 50, central data processor 18 and the remaining local branches will continue to function in the intended manner. Another advantage of the distributed microcomputer system as disclosed herein is its ability to transmit data between the widely spaced machines, paging display boards, maintenance crib and central control room using easily installed twisted pair conductors. This ability to communicate data in a serial fashion between each of the data concentration points of the system, is a highly important practical advantage, particularly where the system is retrofitted in an existing industrial plant where in many cases it is uneconomical, and sometimes impossible, to string additional large multiwire cabling to and from the",
