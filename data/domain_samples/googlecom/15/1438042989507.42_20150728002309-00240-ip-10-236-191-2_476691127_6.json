This first concentration implant will be used to ultimately form lightly doped drain regions 42 in p-well 12 and p-implanted third portion 24 within n-well 14. Conductive material layer 32 masks, without use of photoresist, second portion 22 and covered areas of third portion 24 from implantation of n-type dopant material during this first concentration doping. Use of layer 32 in such manner eliminates an otherwise required additional masking step. Such first concentration doping would also effectively provide a doped region of n-material within fourth portion 26, area 40 of portion 24, and source and drain areas 36, 38 in first portion 20 of p-well 12., 42653=Insulating oxide spacers 132 are then formed on the opposed exposed edges of gate 122 within second portion 92 to cover portions of regions 130 formed therein. Such a step will also form insulating oxide layers 133 on the exposed outer edges of conductive material 102 overlying base implant 100. Exposed source and drain areas 124, 126 respectively, as well as exposed area 128, are then doped with n-type dopant material to a selected third concentration which is greater than the second concentration (for example 1E1020 cm-3). This forms a source implant 134 and a drain implant 136 within second portion 92, and more fully concentrates base contact implant regions 137 within p-implant 100 within third portion 94., 33322=Our U.S. application Ser. No. 427,639, filed on Oct. 27, 1989, and entitled \"Split-Polysilicon Process\" is hereby incorporated by reference., 36627=Exposed areas would then be again doped with n-type dopant material to a selected concentration which is greater than the first concentration to form a source implant 46 and drain implant 48 in first portion 20 of p-well 12. An example second concentration of the n-type dopant material would be 1E1020 cm-3. The second concentration doping step would also form a second concentration n-type emitter implant region 50 in p-implanted third portion 24, and a second concentration n-type collector contact region implant 52 in fourth portion 26. During such second concentration doping step, conductive material layer 32 masks (without use of photoresist) second portion 22 and covered areas of third portion 24 from implantation of n-type dopant material., 42244=Exposed areas 124, 126 and 128 are then doped with n-type dopant material to a selected second concentration (for example 1E1017 cm-3). This second concentration doping will ultimately form lightly doped drain regions 130 in areas 124, 126 respectively, in second region 92. It also begins formation of base contact implant regions 137 within base implant region 100., 47069=Second areas 166 are then doped through with p-type material to form base contact implant regions 172. An example concentration would be 1E1020 cm-3., 38067=Exposed areas are then doped with p-type dopant material to a selected third concentration (for example 1E1020 cm-3) to form a source implant 64 and a drain implant 66 in second portion 22, and also to form third concentration base contact implant regions 68 within p-implanted base region 30., 41047=The exposed areas are doped with p-type dopant material to a selected first concentration (such as for example 1E1020 cm-3) to form a source implant 112 and drain implant 114 in first portion 90 of n-well 82. The first concentration doping also provides an emitter implant 116 within n-base implant 100 of third portion 94, and a collector contact implant region 118 in fourth portion 96. During such doping, layer 102 masks (without photoresist) the covered areas., 45312=Collector contact area 156 and first area 154 are doped with n-type dopant material to a selected first concentration (for example 5E1017 cm-3). This will be used to ultimately form lightly doped drain regions 160 in p-type base 150. Simultaneously, doping of the first concentration occurs within collector contact area 156 to begin formation of a collector contact implant 157. During such doping, conductive material layer 152 masks, without use of photoresist, other covered areas of transistor base implant region 150. Insulating oxide spacers 162 are then formed on exposed edges 158 overlying base implant 150, as well as the exposed edges of conductive material 152 which open to define collector contact area 156., 40178=A layer of photoresist 98 is applied and selectively patterned as indicated to expose third portion 94. Third portion 94 is thereafter doped to provide an n-type base implant 100 within p-well 84. An example concentration would be 1E1018 cm-3., 46076=Thereafter, collector contact area 156 and area 154 are doped with n-type material to a selected second concentration which is greater than the first concentration (for example 1E1020 cm-3). This forms an emitter implant region 164, as well as completes definition of LDD regions 160 and collector contact implant 157. Again during this second concentration dopant step, conductive material layer 152 masks, without photoresist, the other covered areas of base implant region 150.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means and construction herein disclosed comprise a preferred form of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, one of the first or second edges 158, 168 respectively is provided with an insulating oxide spacer, while the other is not. Conductive material layer 152 in this manner is used to provide a temporary masking function which nevertheless remains permanently atop the bipolar transistor within the finished wafer. Second areas 166 are then doped through with p-type material to form base contact implant regions 172. An example concentration would be 1E1020 cm-3. Referring next to FIG. 10, a photoresist layer 170 is applied and photoexposed atop layer 152, and then layer 152 further etched, to expose second areas 166 of base implant region 150, and to form gates of MOS transistors elsewhere in the integrated circuits being formed on the wafer (not shown). Such patterning defines a pair of second conductive material edges 168 atop base",
