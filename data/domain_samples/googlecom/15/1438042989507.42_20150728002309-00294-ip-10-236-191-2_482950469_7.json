Cell Biol. (1994) 126(5):1311-1318) and has been used to maintain expression of the cartilage phenotype of chondrocytes placed in culture (Solursh (1991) J. Cell Biochem. 45:258-260)., 38231=Cartilage is a hyperhydrated structure with water comprising 70% to 80% of its weight. The remaining 20% to 30% comprises type II collagen and proteoglycan. The collagen usually accounts for 70% of the dry weight of cartilage (in \u201cPathology\u201d (1988) Eds. Rubin & Farber, J. B. Lippincott Company, Pa. pp. 1369-1371). Proteoglycans are composed of a central protein core from which long chains of polysaccharides extend. These polysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, include: chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Cartilage has a characteristic structural organization consisting of chondrogenic cells dispersed within an endogenously produced and secreted extracellular matrix. The cavities in the matrix which contain the chondrocytes are called cartilage lacunae. Unlike bone, cartilage is neither innervated nor penetrated by either the vascular or lymphatic systems (Clemente (1984) in \u201cGray's Anatomy, 30. sup.th Edit,\u201d Lea & Febiger)., 73396=In addition, it is contemplated that ascorbate may be added to the chondrogenic cells in the pre-shaped well to enhance or stimulate the production of cartilage specific proteoglycans and collagen. Preferred concentrations of ascorbate range from about 1 to about 1000 \u03bcg/ml., 64528=Heretofore, it has been observed that chondrogenic cells proliferatively expanded in an anchorage-dependent manner usually differentiate and lose their ability to secrete cartilage-specific type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycan. (Mayne et al. (1984) Exp. Cell. Res. 151(1): 171-82; Mayne et al. (1976) PNAS 73(5): 1674-8; Okayama et al. (1976) PNAS 73(9):3224-8; Pacifici et al. (1981) J. Biol Chem. 256(2): 1029-37; Pacifici et al. (1980) Cancer Res. 40(7): 2461-4; Pacifici et al. (1977) Cell 4:891-9; von der Mark et al. (1977) Nature 267(5611):531-2; West et al. (1979) Cell 17(3):491-501; Oegama et al. (1981)J. Biol. Chem. 256(2):1015-22; Benya et al. (1982) Cell 30(1):215-24)., 50128=Any medium capable of supporting stromal cells in tissue culture may be used. Media formulations that will support the growth of fibroblasts include, but are not limited to, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), alpha modified Minimal Essential Medium (\u03b1MEM), and Roswell Park Memorial Institute Media 1640 (RPMI Media 1640) and the like. Typically, 0 to 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) or 1-20% horse serum will be added to the above media in order to support the growth of stromal cells and/or chondrocytes. However, a defined medium could be used if the necessary growth factors, cytokines, and hormones in FBS for stromal cells and chondrocytes are identified and provided at appropriate concentrations in the growth medium. Media useful in the methods of the invention may contain one or more compounds of interest, including, but not limited to antibiotics mitogenic or differentiative compounds for stromal cells. The cells will be grown at temperatures between 31\ufffd C. to 37\ufffd C. in a humidified incubator. The carbon dioxide content will be maintained between 2% to 10% and the oxygen content between 1% and 22%. Cells will remain in this environment for periods of up to 4 weeks., 58442=Any compound may be tested for its ability to affect the differentiation of adipose tissue derived stromal cells into chondrocytes. Appropriate vehicles compatible with the compound to be tested are known to those skilled in the art and may be found in the current edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1995, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.) the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 55801=The transduction of viral vectors carrying regulatory genes into the stromal cells can be performed with viral vectors (adenovirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, or other vector) purified by cesium chloride banding or other method at a multiplicity of infection (viral units:cell) of between 10:1 to 2000:1. Cells will be exposed to the virus in serum free or serum-containing medium in the absence or presence of a cationic detergent such as polyethyleneimine or Lipofectamine\u2122 for a period of 1 hour to 24 hours (Byk T. et al. (1998) Human Gene Therapy 9:2493-2502; Sommer B. et al. (1999) Calcif. Tissue Int. 64:45-49)., 32080=This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/149,850, filed Aug. 19, 1999., 44414=The present invention also provides a method for differentiating adipose tissue derived stromal cells into chondrocytice cells by pelleting stromal cells in medium such as DMEM or alpha-MEM or RPMI 1640 and supplementing the medium with (1) a chondroinductive agent that can activate any cellular transduction pathway leading to the mature chondrocyte phenotype; (2) an antibiotic; (3) a nutrient supplement such as fetal bovine serum or horse serum; (4) ascorbate or related vitamin C analogue; and (5) a glucocorticoid or another chemical agent capable of activating the cellular glucocorticoid receptor., 35410=The adult bone marrow microenvironment is a potential source for these hypothetical mesodermal stem cells. Cells isolated from adult marrow are referred to by a variety of names, including stromal cells, stromal stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), mesenchymal fibroblasts, reticular-endothelial cells, and Westen-Bainton cells (Gimble et al. (November 1996) Bone 19(5): 421-8). In vitro studies have determined that these cells can differentiate along multiple mesodermal or mesenchymal lineage pathways. These include, but are not limited to, adipocytes (Gimble, et al. (1992) J. Cell Biochem. 50:73-82, chondrocytes; Caplan, et al. (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 80(12):1745-57; hematopoietic supporting cells, Gimble, et al. (1992) J. Cell Biochem. 50:73-82; myocytes, Prockop, et al. (1999) J. Cell Biochem. 72(4):570-85; myocytes, Charbord, et al.(1999) Exp. Hematol. 27(12):1782-95; and osteoblasts, Beresford et al. (1993) J. Cell Physiol. 154:317-328). The bone marrow has been proposed as a source of stromal stem cells for the regeneration of bone, cartilage, muscle, adipose tissue, and other mesenchymal derived organs. The major limitations to the use of these cells are the difficulty and risk attendant upon bone marrow biopsy procedures and the low yield of stem cells from this source., 57193=For the development of biomechanical carriers for the re-introduction of the stromal cells into a living organism, the carriers include but are not limited to calcium alginate, agarose, types I, II, IV or other collagen isoform, fibrin, poly-lactic/poly-glycolic acid, hyaluronate derivatives or other materials (Perka C. et al. (2000) J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 49:305-311; Sechriest VF. et al. (2000) J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 49:534-541; Chu CR et al. (1995) J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 29:1147-1154; Hendrickson DA et al. (1994) Orthop. Res. 12:485-497)., 59440=Stromal cells are isolated from human subcutaneous adipose tissue according to methods described in \u201cMethods and Composition of the Differentiation of Human Preadipocytes into Adipocytes\u201d Ser. No. 09/240,029, filed Jan. 29, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,432. These cells are plated at a density of 500 to 20,000 cells per cm2. The present invention contemplates that the creation of a precartilage condensation in vitro promotes chondrogenesis in mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from human adipose tissue. This is accomplished by methods including, but not limited to:, 74757=The synthetic cartilage patch optimally has a size and shape such that when the patch is implanted into the defect, the edges of the implanted tissue contact directly the edges of the defect. In addition, the synthetic cartilage patch may be fixed in placed during the surgical procedure. This can be effected by surgically fixing the patch into the defect with biodegradable sutures, i.e., (Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson) and/or by applying a bioadhesive to the region interfacing the patch and the defect. Preferred bioadhesives include, but are not limited to: fibrin-thrombin glues similar to those disclosed in Fr. Pat. No. 2 448 900; Fr. Pat. No. 2 448 901 and EP.S.N. 88401961.3 and synthetic bioadhesives similar to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,197,973. It is contemplated, however, that alternative types of sutures and biocompatible glues may be useful in the practice of the invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the above methods, the stromal cells are preferably isolated, culture expanded human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells in a chemically defined environment and are condensed into close proximity, such as in the form of a three dimensional cell mass, e.g. packed cells or a centrifugal cell pellet. Further, the contacting preferably comprises culturing a pellet of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells in a chemically defined medium which comprises DMEM with 10% serum, 50 ng/ml ascorbate-2-phosphate, 10\u22127 M dexamethasone. The differentiated cells are then introduced into the surgery site to repair cartilage. Since all components of the system are defined, the system can be used as a product for cartilage repair in mammals, including man and horses. The invention also provides a process for using in vitro differentiated chondrocytes from adipose-derived stromal cells in the repair of cartilage tissue in mammals, including humans. The invention also provides a process for inducing chondrogenesis in human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells by contacting such cells with a chondroinductive agent in vitro where the stromal cells are associated in a three dimensional format. The above demonstrates a culture system in which human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. Since all components are defined, the system can be used for studies of the effects of growth factors etc. on the progression of chondrogenesis. In vitro systems have been used by us and others to show that these cell populations have",
