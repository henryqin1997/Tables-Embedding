One skilled in the art will recognize various alternative methods and apparatus for implementing the invention. The particular embodiment described above is provided for illustrative purposes, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The invention can also be used within RF links employing continuous transmission of the reverse link signal, rather than the gated transmission of IS-95. In such continues transmission systems, the number of phase shifts employed in a codeword can vary greatly, including code words substantially larger than six Walsh symbols. Examples of systems employing a continuous transmission reverse link signal (or up-link) includes various satellite based wireless communication systems. Because the energy associated with a portion of a power control group is very low, however, the error rate at which the power control commands are transmitted in this alternative embodiment of the invention is higher. Thus, this alternative embodiment is useful where an even faster response to fading conditions is required, and where more frequent errors in the transmission of power control commands are tolerable. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, phase rotations between individual Walsh symbols are used to transmit power control commands. That is, the difference in the phase of two successive Walsh symbols, or two sets of Walsh symbols, is used to indicate whether the",
