Her Girl on Fire has a few concessions towards pop trends, like the Jamie xx-produced \"When It's All Over,\" but she mostly delivers those big, torchy moments for which she's famous, as with the titular track with Nicki Minaj, \"Tears Always Win\" and \"101.\" Despite a clunker or two like \"Not Even the King,\" Keys confirms that she's one of the best at mixing personal reflection with universal themes, whether it's motherhood (\"Brand New Me\") or love (\"Fire We Make,\" a duet with Maxwell).
