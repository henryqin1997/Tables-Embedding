In particular, the T1 Standards Committees of ANSI have provided a draft document ANSI T1.105-1988 dated Mar. 10, 1988 which sets forth specifications for a rate and format of signals which are to be used in optical interfaces. Additional details and requirements are set forth in Technical Advisory publications SR-TSY-000202, --000233, -000253, -000303 Issue 3 of Bell Communication Research (Bellcore). The provided specifications detail the SONET standard. SONET defines a hierarchy of multiplexing levels and standard protocols which allow efficient use of the wide bandwidth of fiber optic cable, while providing a means to merge lower level DS0 and DS1 signals in a common medium. In essence, SONET establishes a uniform, standardized transmission and signaling scheme which provides a synchronous transmission format that is compatible with all current and anticipated signal hierarchies. Because of the nature of fiber optics, expansion of bandwidth is easily accomplished., 64159=This is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 07/283,171 filed on Dec. 9, 1988, entitled \"System for Cross-Connecting High Speed Digital Signals\", assigned to the assignee hereof, and which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, now U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the FIFO increment and decrement signals can be generated at any desired start/stop counter transition (not just phase two to phase one, or phase one to phase two). However, for efficiency, it is preferable that only one increment or decrement signal be generated for the slip of an entire word (e.g eight clock cycles for an eight bit word) Moreover, it will be appreciated that while particular circuitry for the phase slip detector was provided, different circuits accomplishing the same functions could be utilized. Therefore, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other changes and modifications may be made to the invention as described without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as so claimed. There have been described and illustrated herein methods and means for transferring a data payload from a first SONET signal of a first frequency and phase to a second SONET signal of a second frequency and phase, the methods relating directly to the apparatus. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it is not intended to be limited thereby, as it is intended that the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow. Thus, those skilled in the art will appreciate that while particular phases of the inBitCount and outBitCount (e.g. phase 6) were compared for their relative",
