The proxy DNS server creates a new UDP socket, a communications interface between it and the remote name server. Typically, the proxy DNS server uses a separate socket and port (such as port \u201c2001,\u201d in this example) which may be arbitrarily assigned) for each mobile device IP address so as to be able to identify to which device in the random LAN the response should be sent. The remote name server then processes and responds to the DNS query from the proxy DNS server, as defined in IETF Standard 13 (step 160). A DNS response packet, which includes the requested address, is generated by the remote name server and sent to the proxy server using the port defined in step 158 (ie., port \u201c2001\u201d in this example). Proxy server (such as proxy server 20) receives the DNS response from the remote name server on the specified port (i.e., port \u201c2001\u201d) using, for example, standard Unix system calls and determines the IP address of the client (i.e., 1.1.1.1 in this example) using that port (step 164). The DNS response is then sent to the client by the proxy server (step 166; see also FIG. 14), which performs a source address and port modification. In one embodiment, the proxy server modifies the source address (the address of the proxy server, e.g., 3.3.3.3 in this example) and source port of the response packet (the port of the link back to the client, which may be arbitrarily assigned) to the original destination address (i.e., 2.2.2.2 in this example) and the original destination port (i.e., port \u201c53\u201d in this example) of the DNS query packet, respectively., 31530=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/072,175, filed Jan. 22, 1998., 44211=FIGS. 3 and 4 depict the routing of information, such as an IP packet 26, from a device within a random LAN 28 to a device within a \u201clegal\u201d LAN 30. For purposes of this discussion, a \u201clegal\u201d LAN is simply a public LAN, i e., one with a legal set of IP addresses. In FIG. 3, packet 26 from the device, which has an IP address of 47.31.128.195, is routed from random LAN 28 to proxy server 20. As shown, proxy server is a server for a subnet (here denoted 137.118.199.X) which, as is known, is a set of machines that are physically connected together in an Ethernet LAN, e.g., the legal LAN in FIG. 3. Proxy server performs a network address translation and, as shown in FIG. 4, the translated packet 32 is transmitted to the legal LAN. The translation may be performed using known techniques, such as those specified in Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments (IETF RFC) 1631. A packet following the opposite path, i.e., packet 34 routed from a device within legal LAN to a device within random LAN 28, would also undergo network address translation (to translated packet 36) in proxy server (see FIGS. 5 and 6).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated by those skilled in this art that various modifications and variations can be made to the IP mobility service strategy consistent with the present invention described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in this art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. As for other protocols, one of ordinary skill will appreciate that proxy servers consistent with the present invention are only capable of supporting IP-based translation services. This is primarily because IP is both a LAN and WAN protocol. Other common LAN protocols, such as Apple Talk, or IPX are significantly limited in scope, and are not capable of the \u201clong range\u201d communications that make the proxy server translation services possible. However, it may be possible for \u201cbridges\u201d to be built to allow IPX-based computers to communicate with their \u201chome\u201d networks. However, this must currently be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Properly configured, proxy servers consistent with the present invention can provide interlopers with a secondary gateway. This has at least two benefits, including reduced congestion on the standard router and improved control over the interloper's internet access. Reduced congestion is a relatively",
