    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22927=This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/463,883, filed Apr. 21, 2003, 47113=Phosphors of the type here described are typically used in light producing devices in thin films, the manufacturing of which is well known in the art. Phosphors located between a phosphor of the invention and a more primary light source can serve to modify the light reaching the phosphors of the invention. Hence, in relation to the phosphors of the invention, the light modified in this way is the relevant source light. Devices can include mirrors, such as dielectric mirrors, to direct light produced by the phosphors to the light output rather than the interior of the device (such as the primary light source). Construction of relevant devices is described in, for example, US Patent Publication 2002/0030444 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,440., 23202=Phosphors, including alkaline earth metal thiogallate-based phosphors (MGaS4) activated with divalent europium, divalent praseodymium, trivalent cerium, and the like are known. For example, Peters et al., J. Electrochem Soc. 119: 230 et seq., 1972 describes phosphors made by solid state reaction from alkaline earth sulfides, gallium sulfide and rare earth sulfides that emit in the green to yellow region of the spectrum. These phosphors have low emission efficiency. For use in color shifting for LED devices and the like, higher photoluminescence efficiency phosphors are desirable., 30681=Where possible, z is determined by quantitative phase analysis of the X-ray diffraction using a Rietveld refinement procedure, which procedure is often called the whole pattern fitting procedure. Experience and a number of round robin comparisons published in the scientific literature have shown the method to be very accurate and is often quoted as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of quantitative analyses. The Rietveld method is based on a least-squares fit of a theoretical calculation of the whole diffraction pattern to an experimental pattern from the actual mixture of two or more phases [\u201cQuantitative X-Ray Diffractometry\u201d by Lev: S. Zevin and Giora Kimmel, Springer, New York/Berlin/Heidelberg, 1995, ISBN 0-387-94541-5; \u201cFundamentals of Powder Diffraction and Structural Characterization of Materials\u201d by Vitalij K. Pecharsky and peter Y. Zavalij, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston/Dordrecht/London, 2003, ISBN 1-4020-7365-8.]. To perform such a refinement, information on the structure of each phase is used. For example, the chemistry, the unit cell parameters, the atomic positions within the crystal structure, the magnitude of the thermal vibrations about the equilibrium position, and the site occupancy are used. In addition to the structural parameters, information about the shape of the diffraction profiles is used. Based upon these data and known scattering physics of X-rays, a diffraction pattern is computed from first principles. Once this has been done, a residual can be computed as the difference between the pattern and experimental patterns. The Rietveld method then consists of minimizing the residual error by refining the structural model and the weight fraction of each phase until a stable minimum of the residual is obtained. A number of databases exist that contain the required information for the structural model. The two most widely used are the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, Fachinformationzentrum Energie Physik Mathematik, Karlsruhe, Germany, published annually] for inorganic materials and the Cambridge Structure Data base (CSD) [Cambridge Structure Data Base, Cambridge Crystallography Data Centre, Cambridge, England, published annually] for organic phases., 42726=Other methods can be used. For example, a soluble strontium or calcium salt, such as the nitrates, can be dissolved in dilute nitric acid. The desired amount of europium salt (e.g., 1-6 mol percent) is added as a soluble aqueous solution. The europium salt can be, for example, the nitrate. The resulting solution can be precipitated by adding base such as ammonium carbonate. Thus, for example: Sr(NO3)2+Ca(NO3)2+Eu(NO3)2+(NH4)2CO3\u2192SrxCa1-xCO3\u2193+Eu(OH)3\u2193+NH4OH The co-precipitated carbonates can be fired with an excess of ammonium sulfate (e.g., 25% molar excess) at, for example, about 200 degrees C., followed for example by firing at a higher temperature, such as about 1100 degrees C., to convert the carbonates to their sulfates. An acidic solution of a gallium salt, such as the nitrate salt, can be added to a solution of the sulfates. The pH can be brought to neutral or further to basic (for example using ammonium hydroxide), causing fine particles to precipitate. The resulting powder can be dried, ground, placed in a refractory boat (e.g., of alumina), and fired in hydrogen sulfide, e.g., for five hours in a tube furnace at about 800 degrees C. The resultant product has the formula: Sr1-xCaxGa2S4:yEu2+ \ufffdzGa2S3,\u2003\u2003(Ic) where z is, for example, 0.0001 to 0.1 (or 0.01 to 10 mol percent). To increase uniformity, the product can be, for example, ground to a powder and re-fired in hydrogen sulfide at about 900 degrees C. for about two hours.}",
