No. 60/195,156 filed on Apr. 6, 2000, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety., 431877=[0525]FIG. 13 illustrates a View Queue Statistics window 1300 which displays a total number of orders in each OMW queue or display totals for all queues. This feature helps evaluate the distribution of orders in the eFalcon system, to see, for example, if a representative is receiving too many or too few orders., 405157=[0427] For example, if a rule has a TFPR of 20:1 and a 5% DDR, on the surface it appears the rule is highly successful. The next step, however, is critical to the integration. If the merchant discover that all or a substantial portion of the fraud cases detected by the rule are in high scoring bands, the rule is not supplementing the scoring system 114, it is duplicating it. This results in an increased volume of ineffective cases on the rules' false positives and excessive outsorted orders and operational inefficiency., 63723=[0023] On-line retailers have been quickly implementing a wide range of fraud fighting techniques to combat this perplexing and ubiquitous problem. The technological level of Internet fraud solutions today is similar to where credit card issuers were in 1992, when the incidence of bankcard fraud exploded and was expected to reach US $1 billion by 1995., 366050=[0367] The transaction detection rate (TDR) represents the number of correctly identified fraudulent orders expressed as a percentage of all actual fraudulent orders. For instance, if there are 100 fraudulent orders and a policy correctly identifies 72 of them, the TDR is 72 percent. The transaction false-positive rate (TFPR), represents the number of orders incorrectly identified as fraudulent for each order correctly detected to be fraudulent by the rule or scoring model. A TFPR of 10:1, for example, means that for each fraudulent order detected, 10 legitimate orders are flagged as fraudulent. The dollar detection rate (DDR) is a percentage, defined as the ratio of the value of the fraudulent orders detected (in dollars) to the total dollar value of the potential fraud that would have been lost without the eFalcon system 100 in operation. For instance, if a person attempts to charge $2,000 to an account over several orders, and the system 100 identifies the account as fraudulent in time to prevent $1,000 of those charges, then the DDR is 50 percent. The DDR shows not merely whether a statistical model 316 and fraud policies catches fraud, but how fast., 429990=[0517] Referring to FIG. 12, the Assign Queues to Users window 1200 allows an authorized user to assign one or more order queues to each user. If desired, the user can customize their own work flow by assigning queues that contain specific types of orders. For example, one representative may be assigned to review all held orders, another review all callbacks. Once the queues are assigned, a representative receives orders only from those queues. The Assign Queues to Users window 1200 the queues currently assigned to a user, and the queues available for assignment. The sections and buttons in the Assign Queues to Users window are:, 57176=[0004] There is, however, great risk associated with merchants doing business on the Internet. The anonymity of online customers makes the incidence of fraud incomparably higher for online merchants than for brick-and-mortar, in-house shopping venues, where the customer is present for all transactions. In March of 1999, Visa International, Inc. reported in Computerworld that less than 2% of their credit-card transactions occurred over the Internet, but that online transactions accounted for up to 50% of their disputed charges. Recent reports state that \u201cone in five online buyers has reportedly been a victim of Net-related fraud . . . according to a National Consumers League survey.\u201d The National Consumers League reported that between 1997 and 1998 there was a 600 percent increase in reports of Internet fraud., 405733=[0428] If on the other hand, the fraud cases identified by the rule are not scored highly by the scoring system 114, the rule is supplemental. The key is to evaluate the scoring system 114 scores on the rule-identified orders in addition to the evaluating pure rule performance. This additional analysis results in integrated supplemental rules instead of volume increasing duplicate rules. For example, assume the sample 20:1 and 5% rule described above identifies fraudulent orders of which the scoring system 114 identifies 50 percent in the 900+ score band and 30 percent in the 800 to 900 score band. The rule would be best used, if at all, to identify fraud cases for those orders scoring below the 700 band. If, however, only 10 percent of the cases are identified by the scoring system 114 in the 900+ score band and 5 percent in the 800 to 900 score band, the rule would be best used to identify fraud for those orders scoring above 800, since the scoring system 114 is not readily identifying such orders as fraudulent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0527] Accordingly, the disclosure of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the invention, which is set forth in the following claims. [0526] As will be understood by those familiar with the art, the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. First, as noted above, the present invention is not limited to credit cards, but may be used with debit card, telephone calling cards, gift certificate cards, ACH transactions, micropayments, and the like. Second, the particular division of functionality between the various system components described herein is merely exemplary, and not mandatory; functions performed by a single system component may instead be performed by multiple components, and functions performed by multiple components may instead performed by a single component, given the variety of software development environments and hardware platforms that may be used to practice the invention. Thus, the particular functions of the rule engine, policy management engine, scoring server, order management workstation, and so forth may be provided in more, fewer, of different combinations of modules. Further, the system may be implemented via a combination of hardware and software, as described, or entirely in hardware elements. Also, the statistical model may be implemented in a variety of modes, including a neural network, a multivariate regression model, or any other model that classifies",
