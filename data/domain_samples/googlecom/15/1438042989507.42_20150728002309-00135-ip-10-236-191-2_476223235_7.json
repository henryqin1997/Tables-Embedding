    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55141=As the binder polymers for the electronically conductive layer, thermoplastic resins or thermosetting resins employed in conventional coatings, such as acrylic resins, vinyl acetate resins, vinyl chloride resins, carbonate resins, protein binders, polyester resins, styrene resins and copolymers of said polymers can be suitably used. Polyester resins and copolymers of methyl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (composition of 50:50 to 98:2) are most preferable from the standpoint of providing a layer having excellent transparency and good electronic conductivity., 57588=The coefficients of static and dynamic friction of the transport-assisting layer are measured against itself using an Instron tensile tester (Model #1120) in accordance with ASTM D1894-78. The static friction refers to the resistance offered by the surface for initiating the relative motion of an object under the influence of external force, whereas the dynamic friction refers to the resistance offered by the surface to an object while the object is in motion relative to the surface. The values of coefficient of static and dynamic friction can be obtained from the recording output of the instrument. The first long spike on the chart is a measure of the coefficient of static friction whereas the average of the remaining high peaks and low peaks is a measure of the coefficient of dynamic friction., 59991=The clear transport-assisting layer contains polymer binders, inorganic or polymeric particulates, and/or conductive moieties. The ratio of polymer binder to particulates preferably should be about 100:1 to about 166:1 by weight, but will function at a lower ratio but at a loss of transparency. The transport-assisting layer has a surface resistivity of about 1\ufffd106 to about 1\ufffd1013 ohms/sq at 25\ufffd C. and 50% RH., 55736=A preferred embodiment of the electronically conductive layer using doped tin oxide has a pigment to binder ratio of 3:1 to 1.5:1 and has a coating weight of 0.25 to 5.00 gm/sq meter. The resin used is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The coating weight of the conductive layer may vary greatly depending upon the required conductive effect, required coating film strength, pigment to binder ratio, and other requirements, but generally it is in the range Of 0.5 gram-per square meter to 3 grams-per square meter., 54639=In order to obtain a conductive layer with a surface resistivity ranging from about 1\ufffd106 ohms/sq to 1\ufffd108 ohms/sq at 25\ufffd C., the ratio of metal oxide to polymer binder should be about 5:1 to about 1:1, preferably from about 3:1 to about 1.5:1. Some of the newer printer-plotters with no multiplexing can use conductive layers with a surface resistivity below about 1\ufffd102 ohms/sq. Thus, for such machines the lower resistivity limit can be extended.}",

Such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. The Sheffield roughness and the abrasivity are 113 cc of air/minute and 0.065 inch, respectively. The haze level of the coated film is 33 percent. The film, when printed on a Versatec V7436 printer, gives good print density and no dropouts but with slightly more flares than Example I. ______________________________________The image receptive layerToluene 43.84 partsMethyl ethyl ketone 43.84 partsPolyvinyl butyral 10.56 parts(Monsanto Company)Amorphous silica 0.35 parts(Av. particle size 8.4 microns)Crystalline silica 1.41 parts(Av. particle size 4.7 microns)The electronically conductive layerMethyl ethyl ketone 65.48 partsCopolymer of methyl methacrylate- 17.86 partshydroxyethyl methacrylate(Ratio 78:22)Melamine-formaldehyde resin 1.86 parts(American Cyanamid)Antimony doped tin oxide 14.88 parts(8.6 percent antimony content)The supporting layerTransparent polyethyleneterephthalateThe transport-assisting layerMethyl Cellosolve 36.92 partsMethanol 38.89 partsQuaternary salt of diacetone 3.53 partsacrylamide copolymer(Calgon Corporation)35% hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate 11.92 parts(35% vinyl alcohol and 75% vinylacetate)Melamine-formaldehyde 6.59 parts(Reichhold Chemicals Inc.)Amorphous silica 0.06 parts(Av. particle size 8.4 microns)Acid Catalyst 2.10 parts______________________________________ Another electrographic film is prepared in the same manner as in Example I using the following components: EXAMPLE III This film has a Sheffield roughness of 130 cc of air/minute and abrasiveness of 0.070 inch.
