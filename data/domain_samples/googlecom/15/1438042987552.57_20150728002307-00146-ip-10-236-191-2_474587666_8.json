While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in a navigation method for calculating a travel route of a vehicle from a starting location or an actual vehicle location to a travel destination, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. The disclosure in German Patent Application 199 33 666.0 of Jul. 17, 1999 is incorporated here by reference. This German Patent Application describes the invention described hereinabove and claimed in the claims appended hereinbelow and provides the basis for a claim of priority for the instant invention under 35 U.S.C. 119. When free parking spaces are scarce at the destination location it is also significant, also in the case of deviations from the calculated travel route, to maintain the selected parking possibility as travel destination, or to transmit a change of the selected parking possibility, as well as the originally selected parking location, as the",
