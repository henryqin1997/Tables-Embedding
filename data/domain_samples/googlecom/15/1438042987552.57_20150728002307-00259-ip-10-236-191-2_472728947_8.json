Those with skill in the chemical, mechanical, electro-mechanical, electrical, and computer arts will readily appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a very wide variety of embodiments. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the preferred embodiments discussed herein. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. Furthermore, by providing document distribution system 10 with availability analysis system 60, an availability of document distribution services 24 can be monitored and availability reports 70 of such availability can be generated. As such, which document distribution services 24 are working and/or available, including, for example, how long and/or how well document distribution services 24 have been working and/or available can reported. Thus, system administrator 58, for example, can review real-time as well as historical analysis of the availability of document distribution services 24, including the availability of document distribution resources 23 providing document distribution services 24. Accordingly, proactive measures can be taken to ensure the availability of document distribution services 24 to users",
