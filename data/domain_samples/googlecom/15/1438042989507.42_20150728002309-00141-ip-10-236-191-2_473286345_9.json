The RFID tag 30 may be an active device containing its own power source, or may be a passive device, relying on the RF interrogation beam 32 for power. The structure and method of operating RF tags is generally known, and the reader is referred to the discussion in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/050,623, filed Mar. 30, 1998, and commonly assigned to the assignee of this application for further details concerning RFID tags. The RFID tag 30 stores a unique identifier and may store additional tax related information. The RFID tag 30 may be programmable, allowing the tax information to be updated. Information in the RFID tag 30 may be encrypted using standard encryption techniques such as private-public key techniques, to provide security for the data. Encrypting the tax related information may take place on a secure computer, for example the central computer 24, were adequate security measures may be provided by the taxing authority operating the secure computer. Additionally, the RFID tag 30 may require a read access code to permit a user to read data stored in the RFID tag 30, and may require a write access code to allow a user to write to or reprogram the data in the RFID tag 30.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations These and other changes can be made to the invention in light of the above detailed description. In general, in the following claims, the terms used should not be construed to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification and the claims, but should be construed to include all apparatus that operate in accordance with the claims to provide a tax verification system and method of operating such system. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the disclosure, but instead its scope is to be determined entirely by the following claims. Although specific embodiments of, and examples for, the invention are described herein for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications can be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention, as will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant art. The teachings provided herein of the invention can be applied to other machine-readable symbols and wireless memory tags, not necessarily the exemplary bar code symbols and RFID tags described above. Likewise, the system may employ other computers, databases and communications links than those described in the exemplary embodiment. The system may keep track of tax information regardless of which point in the distribution system the tax is paid. For example, the tax information may concern collection of tax from one or more of the manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer. Upon collection of any duties, the intermediate database 36 and/or the",
