    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23019=The polymer or oligomer bearing isocyanate groups can be obtained by reacting a polymer bearing groups that are reactive to isocyanate groups, such as amino groups, alcohol groups, or thiol groups, or less preferably carboxyl groups, with an excess of polyisocyanate. The polymer or oligomer bearing isocyanate groups can be prepared, for example, by reacting a monomeric polyisocyanate with a copolymer of polyoxyethylene-propylene polyol using an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of about 5:1 to about 1.05:1, preferably a ratio of about 2.0:1 to 2.5:1. The preparation of isocyanate-terminated prepolymers is disclosed in, for instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,315,703 and 4,476,276 and in references mentioned in those patents. The disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by reference., 48875=Prepolymer was first reacted with BA at 85\ufffd C. for 2 h, cooled to room temperature, and then reacted with A-1170 at room temperature for 2 h. NMR analysis revealed that only 55% BA reacted after 2 h at 85\ufffd C., while completely reacted after 2 h of A-1170's addition., 31420=The molar ratio of the arylalkyl alcohol to the alkoxysilane is preferably in the range of from about 1:1 to about 5:1., 49230=Prepolymer A was reacted with a mixture of BA and A-1170 at room temperature. The total BA and A-1170 equivalent was fixed at 1.86 with respect to the residual TDI. The reactions were carried out for 4 hr at RT and the products were stored under RT under argon atmosphere., 33207=A prepolymer (prepolymer A) bearing isocyanate groups was prepared from a trifunctional polyol (a copolymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, poly\u2122 83-84 from Arch Chemicals) and TDI (Mondur\u2122 TD-80 from Bayer USA) at 1:2.352 equivalent ratio (10.5 wt % TDI charged). The prepolymer is an intermediate product from 3M containing 1.8-2.0 wt. % residual TDI and 2.8-3.2 wt. % isocyanate groups. The residual TDI is usually a mixture of 60-70% 2,6-TDI and 30-40% 2,4-TDI, as determined by NMR. The benzyl alcohol and secondary amines were from Aldrich and the secondary amino alkoxysilanes were industrial samples., 31767=An alkoxysilane bearing a mono secondary amino group, for example, bis(trimethoxysilypropyl)amine (Silquest\u2122 A-1170 from Osi Co.), can catalyze the reaction of arylalkyl alcohols with isocyanate groups. Alternatively, the alkoxysilane can act as a nucleophile. In the event, that the alkoxysilane reacts with a terminal \u2014NCO group of the polymer or oligomer, it will introduce a reactive silyl group, for example a \u2014Si(OMe)3 to compensate for the loss of the \u2014NCO group. Since bulky alkoxysilanes react relatively slowly with \u2014NCO groups, their lifetime as a catalyst can be prolonged., 23825=Monomeric polyisocyanates that can be used to prepare the polymer or oligomer bearing isocyanate groups include aliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates. The preferred polyisocyanates are aromatic polyisocyanates. One of the most useful polyisocyanate compounds that can be used is tolylene diisocyanate, particularly as a blend of 80 weight percent of tolylene-2,4-isocyanate, and 20 weight percent of tolylene-2,6-isocyanate; a 65:35 blend of the 2,4- and 2,6-isomers is also particularly useful. These polyisocyanates are commercially available under the trademark \u201cHylene\u201d, as Nacconate\u2122 80, and as Mondur\u2122 RD-80. The tolylene diisocyanates can also be used as a mixture with other monomeric polyisocyanates, for example, methylene diisocyanate. Other polyisocyanate compounds that can be used are other isomers of tolylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate, diphenyl-methane-4,4\u2032-diisocyanate, m- or p-phenylene diisocyanate and 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate. Polymeric polyisocyanates can also be used, such as polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates, such as those sold under the trademarks \u201cMondur\u201d MRS, and \u201cPAPI\u201d. A list of useful commercially available polyisocyanates is found in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology by Kirk and Othmer, 2nd Ed., Vol. 12, pages 46, 47, Interscience Pub. (1967).}",
