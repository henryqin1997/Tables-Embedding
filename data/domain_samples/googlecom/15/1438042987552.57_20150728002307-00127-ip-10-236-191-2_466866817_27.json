The mats were dried under vacuum. The amount of Imz-PEO bound to the mat was about 70 mg/gram of filter mat. Dried Imz-PEO-coated mats were cross-linked with bis[polyoxyethylene bis(amine)] (TAPEO, 20 K daltons), obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. The cross-linking reaction was performed by soaking the Imz-PEO-coated mat in a water-methanol (1:1) solution of TAPEO at a 2.5 to 5.0 fold molar excess over the bound Imz-PEO. The reaction was allowed to proceed for at least 24 hours. The mats were dried again under vacuum. Dried cross-linked mats were washed extensively by soaking with water several times to remove any unbound PEO. After the final wash, the mats were dried again under a high vacuum. Cross-linked mats were stored at room temperature until used for blood filtration. In this example, the mats were used with pooled (ABO compatible), one day old, human whole blood, obtained from Interstate Blood Bank. The pooled whole blood was suspended about 3 feet above the filter unit, and the blood was allowed to flow by gravity through each of the different types of PEO-filter mats. An aliquot of whole blood (20 to 30 ml) was taken from the unit before filtration and was saved as a control (pre-sample). The filtered blood (post samples) and the pre-samples were counted for platelets with a Sysmex K-1000 cell counter and the WBC concentrations were determined by staining WBC nuclei (after lysing the sample) with propidium iodide and analyzing the stained samples with a FacScan flow cytometer. The results of WBC depletion and platelet recovery are illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 respectively. The degree of platelet recovery ranged from 75 to 80% with Imz-PEO-coated mats vs 0.5% for the uncoated mats. The amount of WBC depletion remained unchanged, in the range of 3 to 4 logs for all of the mats (Table 1)., 34369=FIG. 4 illustrates the relative platelet recovery obtained with PEO-coated and uncoated Asahi R-2000 filters., 21079=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

Although these PLS-10A filters have not been used with whole blood, it appears that the PLS-10A produces at least a 2 to 4 fold increase in C3a and C5a levels as compared to the corresponding pre-samples. These levels of C3a and C5a are higher than the amount of C3a and C5a produced by the PEO-coated Asahi R-2000 filters are more biocompatible than the PLS-10A commercial filter used for platelet concentrate., 34192=FIG. 3 illustrates the relative WBC depletion for PEO-coated and uncoated Asahi R-2000 filters. Log depletion is illustrated on the right side of the figure., 59183=In this experiment, variable such as the age of the blood and the storage temperature were evaluated. The same PEO coated Asahi R-2000 filter mats described above were used for these studies. Units of whole blood were obtained fresh in-house, and stored at room temperature until used (about 2 hours). One day old blood, stored at room temperature or 4 degrees centigrade, were also obtained form Interstate Blood Bank. Each unit was allowed to flow through each PEO-coated filter and the samples were analyzed as described above. The results, summarized in Table 2, suggest that despite the utilization of various units of whole blood stored under different conditions, the yield of platelets obtained from PEO-coated Asahi R-2000 filters is dramatically improved (68 to 83%) as compared to uncoated mats (2%).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that various modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims. A Heparin coating procedure, similar to the one described in section 2a above, was applied in this study. Heparin solution (prepared in bicarbonate buffer pH=8.3) was used instead of amino-PEO to react with Imz-PEO-coated HVT. C. Heparin-treated Imz-PEO-coated-HVT The results indicate that PEO-coated heparinized HVT can significantly reduce fibrinogen binding from both sources, a purified solution of human Fg and Fg from whole blood, compared to uncoated tissues (see FIGS. 13 and 14). 3. Results PEO-coated and non-PEO-coated tissues were tested for their ability to bind fibrinogen (Fg) from a solution of purified human fibrinogen and from fresh whole blood according to the following procedure: PEO-coated and uncoated materials were soaked in a citrate phosphate buffer solution (pH=7.4) containing 125I-labeled fibrinogen (Fg), and were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for one hour. Unbound fibrinogen was removed from the materials by washing extensively with saline, then each sample was counted in a gamma counter. The amount of protein adsorbed was calculated from the specific activity of the fibrinogen and expressed as ng of protein per mg",
