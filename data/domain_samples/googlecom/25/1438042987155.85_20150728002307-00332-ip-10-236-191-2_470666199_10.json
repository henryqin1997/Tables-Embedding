The technique is quite general in nature and can be applied in a fully automated manner. It does require additional resources, namely one or more subject matter dictionaries. This, however, is a minor constraint, as large numbers of machine-readable dictionaries are currently available. Many such dictionaries are free and can be downloaded from the Internet. For example, Specialized Dictionaries 2000, yourDictionary.com http://www.yourdictionary.com/diction4.html [Accessed 12 Sep. 2000] provides links to hundreds of such dictionaries., 35185=The basic technique is described in Deerwester, S., et al, Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis, in Journal of the Society for Information Science, 41(6), 391407 (October, 1990) [Deerwester I] and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,853 Computer Information Retrieval Using Latent Semantic Structure, to Deerwester et al. [Deerwester I]. The optimality of this technique is shown in Ding, C., A Similarity-based Probability Model for Latent Semantic Indexing, in Proceedings of the 22nd Annual SIGIR Conference, (August, 1999) [Ding]. The LSI technique has been shown to be of considerable value as an approach to text retrieval in both Dumais, S., LSI meets TREC: A Status Report, in The First Text Retrieval Conference (TREC1), National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication #500-207, 137\u2013152 (1993) [Dumais I] and Dumais, S., Using LSI for Information Filtering: TREC-3 Experiments, in The Third Text Retrieval Conference (TREC3) National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication #500-226, (1995) [Dumais II]. Each of the above is incorporated herein by reference., 50017=Although each of these extensions to the basic LSI technique is valuable in its own right, more effective application may be attained through combining their use. The techniques have the important virtue that they lend themselves to combination using current data fusion techniques. For details on such techniques see Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION'99), available from the International Society of Information Fusion, and GOODMAN, I., Mathematics of Data Fusion, Theory and Decision Library.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be recognized that various preferred embodiments and characteristics thereof that have been described are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. While the present invention makes use of the properties of the LSI vector space to explicitly compare documents, it should be noted that the use of the specific vector space generated using the LSI technique is not essential. A person skilled in the art could make use of slightly different vector space representations of the documents. However, it has been demonstrated that the LSI space is an optimal semantic subspace based on maximum likelihood estimation. [Ding]. Basing the comparison techniques on the LSI method allows an even greater degree of generality. The \u201cdocuments\u201d that are compared actually can be significantly more general objects. In fact, they can be any set of objects that can be represented by a collection of character strings. The \u201cdocuments\u201d dealt with, both as items of interest and items to be compared against, can be, for example, collections of documents as opposed to individual documents. The objects that are dealt with can even be surrogates for non-textual objects, such as images or protein sequences. A particularly interesting example is where the surrogate objects represent some aspect of people, such",
