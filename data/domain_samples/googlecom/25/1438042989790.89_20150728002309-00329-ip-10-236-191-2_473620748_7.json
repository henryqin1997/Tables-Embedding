The data is checked out or exported from the CDI system 66 into a working directory and, from there, checked back in or imported in to the databases via CDI 66. The data movement module 64 handles data movement between the working directory and the requesting application. It can include a data adapter for conversions of data between different systems. The data movement module 64 receives specific data movement requests, moves the data to the requested location or application, and generates associated notifications such as \u201cdata move completed\u201d or \u201cdata move failed.\u201d These two modules 62 and 64 can be implemented separately or as part of the CDI system 66, and the CDI 66 is used for overall management of the databases, receiving requests from the data manager 62 and interfacing to the different data sources to store and retrieve data. CDI 66 can be implemented in various ways and using conventional database systems, or can be implemented as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/243,295, filed Sep. 13, 2002 and entitled \u201cDatabase Management System Having a Common Database Infrastructure.\u201d This prior filed application is assigned to the assignee of the present application and its entire contents are hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will thus be apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a computerized system for network-based management of engineering projects, which achieves the aims and advantages, specified herein. It will of course be understood that the foregoing description is of preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments shown. Various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the amount of centralized (server side) processing versus client processing can be varied from one system implementation to the next depending upon various deployment, management, and processing considerations that will be known to those skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications are intended to come within the scope of the appended claims. . The workflow rules are provided by the workflow module 44 (and can be stored along with the other data 36) and the data at each step (load, stress, and product life data in the example shown) is stored in the work book 46, meaning that it is stored in the database 36 but logged into and available to the user via his or her work book.
