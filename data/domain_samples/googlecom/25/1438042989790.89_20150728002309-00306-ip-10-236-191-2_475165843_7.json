Inks that are liquid at room temperature, as well as inks of the phase change type which are solid at room temperature, may be used. One example of a suitable phase change ink is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,560, issued Dec. 26, 1989 and entitled, \"Phase Change Ink Carrier Composition and Phase Change Ink Produced Therefrom.\" The drive signal of FIG. 15 exhibits a refill pulse component 102 voltage magnitude that is approximately 1.4 times that of the voltage magnitude of ejection pulse 104. The magnitude of the voltage of refill pulse 102 is approximately 50% of that of an unmodified drive signal for the same acoustic driver. The modified preferred drive signal depicted in FIG. 15 exhibits greater pulse component 102, 104 durations at their respective voltage amplitudes as well as rise and fall times of almost 2 times the duration, as compared to those of an unmodified drive",
