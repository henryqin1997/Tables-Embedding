The loading was done by passing the floss thru a bath of the compositions maintained at about 210\ufffd F. The bath is provided with floss fiber spreading means and the floss is passed through the bath at speeds ranging from between about 1 and about 20 ft/sec. Excess composition is removed using dies and squeegee arrangements. The loaded floss was then passed through a chamber charged with various powder substances which are maintained in a fluid state by a circulating charge of air passed through the chamber. Note, in all these Examples the surfactant used was Pluronic F 127; the coating composition, Dow Corning Silicone 1500, the flavor IFF 101. In these Examples there was no glycerin added. The results are described in Table IV below., 51056=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

No. 4,911,927; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 58640=From 1960 thru 1962, numerous clinical studies reported that there is no clinical difference as to plaque removal and gingivitis scores between waxed and unwaxed dental floss. Note, both are \"cord\" flosses and contain sizing, binders etc. These studies also confirmed that waxed and unwaxed floss are approximately 50% effective with respect to plaque removal and gingivitis scores. Thus the \"cord\" effect severely restricts efficiency of flossing., 51773=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

For example in Table I, different floss constructions are described which show variations in load of up to about 400%. In Examples A-E the composition and the method of loading were held constant while the floss construction was varied. Specifically the composition described as Example 39 in Table IV was loaded into the various flosses by the method described in copending application Ser. No. 07/270,562 filed Nov. 14, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,927., 55600=The concept of the use of dental floss for cleansing interproximal spaces appears to have been introduced by Parmly in 1819 [\"Practical Guide to the Management of the Teeth,\" Collins & Croft, Philadelphia Pa]. Parmly suggested the use of waxed silk to clean teeth of persons subject to gingival inflammation. Numerous types of floss were developed and used for cleaning, until finally in 1948 Bass established the optimum characteristics of dental floss. (Dental Items of Interest, 70, 921-34, (1948))., 91000=Particularly preferred surfactants include block copolymers comprising a cogeneric mixture of conjugated polyoxybutylene and polyoxyethylene compounds having as a hydrophobe, a polyoxybutylene polymer of at least 1200 molecular weight; such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,343,785, 4,465,663, 4,511,563 and 4,476,107,2 and, 89582=In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the floss used is nylon, contains between 4 and 8 strands, with a denier between about 500 and 1000 and contains between about 200 and 600 filaments. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the floss used is nylon, containing 6 strands, has a denier of about 840 and has approximately 408 filaments., 53380=(2) Ser.

Removal of plaque precursors requires the reduction of food sources and building blocks required for the bacteria to synthesize the mucopolysaccharides which polymerize into the plaque film. Going far back into the chain of evens leading to plaque formation and interrupting the chain has much to commend it as a sound oral hygiene strategy. However, for this technique to be effective, the plaque building blocks must be interrupted periodically throughout the mouth, especially at the site of plaque buildup and if possible just below the tooth-gum interface and interproximally. Such disruption is copending applications Ser. Nos. 927,752, now allowed and 927,805, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,479 filed Nov. 7, 1986, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Most other oral hygiene preparations described above fall short on \"frequency-of-use\" basis, abrasion and cleaning. For reference see, L. Menaker, \"The Biologic Basis of Dental Caries\", Chapters, 5, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 18, Harper and Row (1980)., 51499=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

No. 07/270,164--Filed Nov. 14, 1988, entitled Method of Treating the Oral Cavity with Dental Floss Containing Polyvinyl Pyrollidone Iodine Complex, now abandoned;, 120262=In Examples 1 thru 4 various compositions were loaded into flosses of various construction and chemical makeup. The loading was done by dipping the floss into an agitated bath containing these compositions. The loaded floss was then hung in the air until cool and tested. The results are discussed in Table II below. Note, in all of these examples the surfactant used was PLURONIC F127, the coating composition, Dow Corning Silicone 1500, the flavor IFF 101. There was no subsequent powder treatment of the floss in these examples., 57853=As an alternative to sizing, binders, wax etc.. Bass suggests \"steamset\" to set the twist in dental floss so that the floss will not untwist during use. Commercial floss twisters and floss spoolers, opted to use various binders and sizing materials instead. These \"sticky\" substances facilitate floss handling, keep the floss from untwisting during use, and keep the floss from falling off the spool. Although steamset floss does not untwist during use, absent sticky substances, it does unravel off the spool during dispensing and during spooling. Thus, the optimum floss described by Bass could not be manufactured commercially in 1948, so apparently, water insoluble binders, sizing and wax were adopted early on and continue up to the present., 53213=(1) Ser. No. 07/270,161--Filed Nov. 14, 1988, entitled Method of Treating the Oral Cavity with Dental Floss Containing Tetracycline, now abandoned;, 56932=The optimum characteristics of dental floss as described by Bass in 1948 are ignored by today's flosses. Specifically, Bass suggests that these waxed and sized flosses produce the \"cord\" effect discussed above as distinguished from the \"spread effect\" of unwaxed, unsized floss which flattens out and widens, with the filaments spread out. The potential for separate mechanical action of spread out filaments is nullified by this \"cord\" effect, as are the spaces between the filaments, which according to Bass are necessary to receive, hold and remove the microscopic material dislodged during flossing. Thus, the mechanical cleaning attributed to spread filaments and essentially all of the evacuation of microscopic materials from the interproximal spaces by entrapment is impaired or sacrificed with waxed and/or sized flosses, because of this \"cord\" effect., 52116=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

No. 07/325,216 Filed: Mar. 17, 1989 METHOD OF TREATING THE ORAL CAVITY now, pending;, 76263=The floss of the present invention is preferably a nylon dental floss that has been processed to load into it up to about 80 mg/yd of the cleaning and plaque fighting formulation described in copending application Ser. No. 06/927,752, filed Nov. 6, 1986, entitled \"Dental and Oral Hygiene Preparations,\" the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 66930=(6) Ser. No. 07/270,723--filed Nov. 14, 1988, entitled Dental Floss with Stabilized Stannous Fluoride, now abandoned;, 84630=1. Abrasive removal of the plaque film, once it has firmly adhered to the tooth surface, is the only totally effective cleansing mechanism. Again, professional dental hygiene is most effective, but recently, a number of special abrasive toothpastes have been accepted by dental organizations for partially removing supragingival adhered plaque and the tartar which subsequently forms from the plaque. Heretofore, interproximal plaque could only be removed by mechanical means such as flossing and/or by use of appropriately shaped dental stimulators. Dental stimulators containing the substances of the present invention are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 07/270,165 Nov. 14, 1988, entitled \"Dental Stimulator,\" U.S. Pat.

This was reconfirmed in 1982 by Lobene et al. [Clinical Preventative Dentistry, Jan-Feb] who showed no significant clinical difference on plaque and gingivitis scores. Similar results, i.e., no clinical difference between waxed and unwaxed floss with respect to reduced gingival inflammation were shown by Finkelstein in 1979 [J. Dent. Res., 58: 1034-1039]. No differences in gingival health were shown by Wunderlich in 1981 [J. Dent. Res., 60A: 862]. No differences in plaque removal were reported by Schmidt et al. in 1962 [J. Dent. Res.] with flosses of various types. Stevens in 1980, studied floss with variable diameters and showed no difference in plaque and gingival health. Carter et al., Va Dent. J., 52: 18-27 (1975), studied professional and self-administered waxed and unwaxed floss, both significantly reduced gingival bleeding of interproximal and gingival sulci. Unwaxed floss appeared slightly, but not significantly more effective., 50331=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

No. 07/270,166--Filed Nov. 14, 1988, entitled Method of Treating the Oral Cavity with Dental Floss with Chlorhexidine, now abandoned;, 144895=Stannous fluoride was replaced by sodium fluoride in about 1980 by most fluoride dentifrice manufacturers because of the stability problems encountered with stannous fluoride dentifrices., 51935=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser. No. 07/270,161 Filed: Nov. 14, 1988 METHOD OF TREATING THE ORAL CAVITY WITH DENTAL FLOSS CONTAINING TETRACYCLINE now, abandoned;, 146067=The unexpected stability of stannous fluoride in the preferred floss preparations for the present invention were established using the techniques described by Camosci and Tinanoff, J. Dent. Res., 63: 1121-1125 (1984). The stannous fluoride is solubilized in one or more polyols such as sorbitol and added to the preferred floss preparations in the absence of water. Preferably, the mixing and heating of these SnF2 melt preparations are carried out in the absence of oxygen and in metal vessels (to avoid fluoride reactions with glass)., 145102=For example, an aqueous solution of SnF2 becomes turbid on standing due to hydrolysis to Sn(OH)2 or oxidation to SnOF2. Stratemann in 1974 described SnF2 instability in aqueous systems., 122419=In Examples 5 thru 8 various compositions were loaded into flosses of various constructions and chemical makeup. The loading was done by passing the floss under tension and across fiber spreading devices, in an agitated bath containing these compositions. The loaded floss was then passed through a chamber charged with carrageenan, wherein the chamber was fitted with rubber plugs with carrageenan, wherein the chamber was fitted with rubber plugs provided with slits which serve to remove excess powder. The loaded floss with the post added powder was then tested. Note in all these Examples the surfactant used was Pluronic F 127, the coating composition Dow Corning Silicone 1500, the Flavor IFF 101. Carrageenan was included in the loading composition in all examples. The results are set out in Table III below., 50605=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser. No. 07/270,544 Filed: Nov. 14, 1988 DENTAL FLOSS now, abandoned;, 141449=Langner et al. reported in 1984 on the use of tetracycline in various drug delivery systems such as these developed by Goodson. Weeks in 1980, Ciancio in 1976 and Loesche in 1976 have reviewed the use of tetracycline for the treatment of periodontal diseases., 50469=Ira Hill & Robert White Ser.

Assoc., 93: August], reported that \". . . ordinary waxed dental floss was neither an efficient debriding agent nor an effective tool for delivery of the test agents to the interproximal sites\", and, 145351=In addition to the anticaries properties reported for SnF2, there has been extensive research directed to the antimicrobial properties of this substance. Kornman in 1986, Tehranirad in 1980 and Tinanoff et al. from 1979 to 1988, have frequently reported on the antiplaque and gingivitis control properties of topically applied SnF2., 100715=The topical application of various antibiotics to interproximal sites as well as subgingivally is preferred over \"systemic\" treatments with these substances. That is, the risk of adverse side reactions to the patient which accompanies most ingested systemic antimicrobials is reduced substantially. In addition, application of the antimicrobial to specific infected areas can be achieved with a higher frequency, topically than systemically. This assures higher antibiotic concentrations at the site(s) of infection and a higher incidence of effectiveness in a shorter period of time. See Goodson Implant references 1979 to 1988., 53877=(5) Ser. No. 07/270,353--Filed Nov. 14, 1988, entitled Method of Treating the Oral Cavity with Dental Floss with Stannous Fluoride, now abandoned; and, 145725=Additionally, Svanberg in 1983, reported on dental floss dipped in a SnF2 solution. Keene et al. in 1977 reported working with SnF2, topically applied to teeth, interproximally with floss. All of these researchers reported interproximal antimicrobial effects using their crude floss delivery systems., 68900=a. floss having from between two and 12 strands, each containing between about 100 and 800 filaments with a denier between 300 and about 1200, and}",
