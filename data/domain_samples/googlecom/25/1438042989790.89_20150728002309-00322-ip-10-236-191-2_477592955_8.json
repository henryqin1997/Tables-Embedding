    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23823=Some of the potential benefits of narrow beam antennas for cellular radio have been recognised in the literature, see for example \"A Spectrum Efficient Cellular Base Station Antenna Architecture\", S C Swales and M A Beach, Personal & Mobile Radio Communications Conference, Warwick, 1991 and \"Proposed Advanced Base Station Antennas for Future Cellular Mobile Radio Systems\", W S Davies, R J Long and E Vinnal, Australian Telecomms Research, Vol 22, No. 1, pp 53-60. Within current systems the manner in which directive antennas are used allows relatively small benefits to be obtained. The use of directive antennas in current cellular radio systems is based on the principle of sectorisation as illustrated in FIG. 2. The main sources of interference in a cellular system come from the so called first tier reuse cells. An omni-directional base station antenna will receive interference from all six first tier reuse cells (FIG. 2a). If an antenna with nominally 120\ufffd beamwidth is used, corresponding to a tri-sectored configuration, interference will be received from only two first tier reuse cells (FIG. 2b). If an antenna with 60\ufffd beamwidth is used, corresponding to a hexsectored configuration, interference will be received from only one of the first tier cells (FIG. 2c). In sectorised cells the cellular radio transceivers at the base station are only connected to one sector (or antenna) and cannot be used in other sectors within the same cell., 23458=Although the narrow beam is formed at radio frequencies (typically in the 900 or 1800 MHz bands) it can usefully be visualized as analogue to a laser beam which emanates from the base station and tracks the mobiles. When contrasted with an omni-directional antenna this clearly creates a high quality transmission path with minimal interference., 20159=This application is a continuation, of application Ser. No. 08/137,834, filed Oct. 15, 1993, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 6 illustrates the system operation. FIG. 6a shows the concept of a multiplicity of narrow, overlapping beams covering the cell area surrounding the base station. The beams are referenced b1-b24. FIG. 6b shows how, at time t1 four mobile stations msl-ms4 are served by beams b2, b10 and b21. Beam b2 serves two mobile stations ms2 and ms3 at this time. As the mobile stations move geographically in relation to the base station, at time t2 beam b22 now serves mobile stations msl, b4 serves ms3 and b8 serves ms4. Mobile station ms2 has, at time t2 moved out of the cell coverage of this base station and will now be served by an adjoining base station (not shown). A potential disadvantage of the invention is that a relatively large antenna aperture, in terms of wavelengths, is needed to produce the narrow beams. If the antenna aperture were very large this could create aesthetic and structural problems, due to wind loading etc., in some sites. This potential disadvantage is overcome by using the same antenna array 40 for transmit and receive. In this way the outline of the antenna, for reasonable beamwidth, is less than that of many conventional cell sites. Thus the diplexing of transmit and receive through the common aperture is a key feature of the architecture. The positioning of the linear power amplifiers 48 between the transmit azimuth beamformer 52 and the",
