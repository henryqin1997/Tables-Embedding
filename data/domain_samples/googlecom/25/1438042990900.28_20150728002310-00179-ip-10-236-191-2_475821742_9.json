    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of the preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures. The DVD decoding method and system are disclosed in the above embodiment, in which the decoding sequence is changed and the EDC checking is performed during performing the inner code decoding. In this way, it results in reducing the time of access to memory, increasing the speed of the decoding, and improving the error correction capability. On the other hand, the determination as to whether the correction is unable to be performed since the errors are over the limitation of the error correction can be made by finding out the number of erasure flags that are of zero. If the number of zero-valued erasure flags exceeds a limitation of the decoding system, it indicates that the ECC block has too many errors to be corrected. In this case, the DVD decoding system will not perform error correction on the ECC block. Finally, for the determination as to whether the decoding operations are performed for a number of times but the correction is not",
