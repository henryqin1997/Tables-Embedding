It is desired that the embodiments described above may be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims to indicate the scope of the invention. The method of the present invention is not limited to five card poker games, but may be applied or used in other appropriate games such as seven card poker. The method of the present invention does not require a shuffling machine 32, dealing module 33 or a display means 36. However, these facilitate and expedite the play of the game as well as add interest to the game. While the initial wager of the present invention is preferably comprised of three equal bets, the bets do not necessarily have to be equal. While equal bets are essential for casino play, unequal bets may be used in home play, if desired. The wagering game of the present invention might be played live in casinos with a dealer, or in casinos or homes in interactive electronic or video form with automatic coin or betting means receptacles and payout capability, wherein appropriate symbols for cards, wagers or score keeping would be displayed electronically. A \"board-type game\" suitable for home, club or casino use may also be provided for practicing the method of the present invention. ______________________________________Pair, Tens or",
