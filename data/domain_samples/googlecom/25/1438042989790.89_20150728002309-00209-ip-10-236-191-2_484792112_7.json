These infusion sets are used for delivering a fluid, medication or other infusant, for example, insulin, to a subcutaneous site in a patient. Such an infusion set is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,520,938 and 6,056,718, which are herein incorporated by reference. Another example is described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 11/003,225, entitled Medication Infusion Set, filed on Dec. 3, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference. These devices commonly include a delivery tube connected to an infusion pump or other fluid or medication delivering device. Such an infusion set may include a base portion with a cannula deposited in the skin of a patient, and an adhesive patch at the base of the cannula housing to hold the cannula in place. The cannula is inserted into the skin of a patient, with the aid of an insertion device, to facilitate the subcutaneous transfer of an infusant. The possibility of disconnecting the infusion set from other parts of the infusion system is provided in order to improve the user comfort., 29984=This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

The hub 202 is conveniently configured as a single piece where the transition between the handle part 203 and the guard part 204 includes one sliding motion within one piece, avoiding the assembling of separate parts when covering the needle 201. Detents 207 and 208 on the outer sides of the handle part 203 and catches 209 and 210 on the inner sides of the guard part 204 facilitate the locked position of the insertion device 219. The guard part 204 is pulled over the needle 201 until the detents 207 and 208 lock the handle part 203 and the guard part 204. To effectuate the handling of the",
