Specifically, the print data in FIG. 32 assumes an A4 size (297 mm\ufffd210 mm) layout area 51 and, as in the second embodiment, \u201cborderless\u201d printing is instructed (description 33). Furthermore, the placement of a 210 mm\ufffd315 mm box 52 having a \u22129 mm offset to the left with respect to the layout area 51 is also instructed (description 34). In addition, it is instructed (description 35) that a character string 311 should be right-aligned such that the bottom edge of the character string 53 is in a position 3 mm above the bottom edge of the layout area 51, and its right edge is laid out to come 292 mm from the left edge of the layout area 51. Furthermore, it is instructed (description 36 to 38) that \u201cyoko.jpg\u201d should be drawn for the box 52, and subsequently, a date \u201c2004.oo.xx\u201d should be drawn for the character string 53. Here, the image data serving as \u201cyoko.jpg\u201d used in the explanation is assumed to have a 2:3 (vertical\ufffdhorizontal) aspect ratio.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{118976=The position obtainment unit 2101 obtains position information specified by print data, which indicates a position at which a character string is to be superimposed on the object data. The character string position determining unit 2201 determines the position at which the character string is to be superimposed, based on the position information obtained by the position obtainment unit 2101, the magnification rate or the reduction rate calculated by the first magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2041, and the magnification rate or the reduction rate calculated by the second magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2043. In the case where the character string superimposing position determined by the character string position determining unit 2201 extends beyond the printing paper, or approaches a predetermined range away from the edge of the printing paper, the character string correction unit 2202 corrects the character string superimposing position so that the character string is printed within a predetermined range on the printing medium. The character string layout unit 2203 lays out the character string by superimposing the character string on the object data, at the superimposing position corrected by the character string correction unit 2202., 103781=On the other hand, when the magnified/reduced image is smaller than the layout area 11 (No in Step S102), the object image 12 is adjusted to the height of the layout area 11, and magnified/reduced in a manner in which the current aspect ratio is maintained (Step S104). Then the first magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2041 calculates the magnification/reduction rate (Step S103)., 92013=The first magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2041 calculates a magnification rate or a reduction rate for object data so that one of the height and the width of the object data is the same as that of the layout area, and the other is the same or larger than that of the layout area. The first placement unit 2042 places the object data on the layout area according to the magnification rate or the reduction rate calculated by the first magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2041. The second magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2043 calculates a magnification rate or a reduction rate for the layout area so that one of the height and the width of the layout area is the same as that of the effective drawing area, and the other is the same or larger than that of the effective drawing area. The second layout unit 2044 lays out the layout area on the effective drawing area using the magnification rate or the reduction rate calculated by the second magnification/reduction rate calculation unit 2043., 118545=The print data analysis unit 210 includes a position obtainment unit 2101 in addition to the structure in the first embodiment. Furthermore, the layout unit 220 includes a character string position determining unit 2201, a character string correction unit 2202, and a character string layout unit 2203, in addition to the structure in the first embodiment., 91163=The object data obtainment unit 2031 obtains object data which is the object to be printed. The layout area information obtainment unit 2032 obtains layout area information specified by print data, which indicates a layout area. The effective drawing area information obtainment unit 2033 obtains effective drawing area information indicating a printing area which is dependent on the printing apparatus 200., 56943=Patent Reference 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2001-237783, 120683=First, the position obtainment unit 2101 analyzes printing information and judges whether or not text printing is required (Step S150). As a result, in the case where text printing is required (Yes in Step S150), the position obtainment unit 2101 determines whether or not a negative border is set for such character string (Step S151). As a result, when a negative border is set (Yes in Step S151), the character string position determining unit 2201 calculates a relative position for the character string, on the layout area 11 (Step S152). Subsequently, such relative position is converted to a position on the effective drawing area so as to obtain an on-paper position when projecting onto printing paper (Step S153). Next, the text data to be drawn is actually laid out, and judged as to whether or not it is within a predetermined area on the printing paper, in other words, whether or not it extends beyond the printing paper (Step S154). As a result, in the case where it extends beyond the printing paper (No in Step S154), the character string correction unit 2202 corrects the position at which the character string is to be laid out, and establishes the position at which the character string is to be laid out (Step S155). Subsequently, the bitmap data for the object image and the character string which are laid out on the effective drawing area is generated and printed (Step S156).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The printing apparatus in the present invention possesses a function for analyzing XML-related data such as XHTML-Print, and printing a picture content with optimal layout even without the user being concerned, and is useful in a printer and the like which executes printing by having print data or a print command sent from a host device other than a PC. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Furthermore, as the effective drawing area and the layout area are conceptual areas and not real spaces, the same effect is also obtained when image superimposition is carried out by superimposing on the effective drawing area. Furthermore, although the description \u201cframe:non\u201d is interpreted as \u201cborderless\u201d printing in the present embodiment, the present invention is not bound to such description. In addition, a method in which the \u201cborderless\u201d instruction is sent using a print command, instead of being described in print data, is also possible. , a procedure is explained in which drawing is carried out on the effective drawing area after the layout is performed, it is also possible to layout all the elements and carry out drawing and printing with the same timing. FIG. 36 Note that although in Furthermore, in the case where \u201cborderless\u201d printing is not required (No in Step 322), following the instruction in the print data, the layout is carried out on the drawing area (Step S326), drawing is carried",
