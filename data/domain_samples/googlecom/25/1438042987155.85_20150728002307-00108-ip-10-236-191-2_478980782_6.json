Achieving a contrast ratio exceeding 100:1 is desirable., 37180=For additional discussion of the semiconductor processing steps so far, cross-reference is made to co-pending patent application Ser. No. 08/396,024, filed Feb. 27, 1995 entitled \"Method for Creating a Digital Micromirror Device Using an Aluminum Hard Mask,\" this patent application being assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, and the teaching included herein by reference., 35785=Referring now to FIG. 7, a beam layer 74 is sputter deposited over the partially processed wafer shown in FIG. 6, but could also comprise of other metals such as aluminum, if desired. Beam has a thickness of approximately 2000 angstroms and achieves good step coverage over hinge mask 70. This beam layer 74 buries the titanium tungsten binge layer 62 and aluminum hard mask 70, as shown. Next, a thin layer of aluminum 76 is sputter deposited over beam layer 74, preferably comprised of aluminum, and having the thickness of about 100 angstroms., 16442=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/414,831, filed Mar. 31, 1995, now abandoned., 33351=Referring now to FIG. 5, a silicon substrate 50 is processed to include an array of SRAM cells (not shown) and associated pixel data bit lines communicating pixel data between pixel data loading shift registers (not shown) and the SRAM cells, as is disclosed in the commonly assigned co-pending patent application Ser. No. 08/373,692 entitled \"Monolithic Programmable Digital Micro-Mirror Device\" filed Jan. 27, 1995, the teachings included herein by reference. An array of buffed passive charge storage cells could be used instead of the SRAM devices if desired, as disclosed in the commonly assigned co-pending patent application attorney's docket #TI-19626 entitled \"Spatial Light Modulator with Buffed Passive Charge Storage Cell Array\" filed Feb. 2, 1995, the teachings included herein by reference. Next, a layer of field oxide 52 is deposited over processed substrate 50 to provide an insulative non-conductive coating over substrate 50. Next, a first layer of metal known as metal-one, shown generally at 54, is deposited and patterned over oxide layer 52 to define address electrodes 20 (See FIG. 1). These address electrodes 20 are in electrical communication with the SRAM cells through vias extending through oxide layer 52 to the SRAM cells. Next, a thick layer of photoresist 58 is deposited over patterned metal layer 54 to form a spacer layer, and developed to form a via 60.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Though the invention has been described with respect to a specific preferred embodiment, many variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present application. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications. For instance, providing a geometrically oriented light shield over other types of micromechanical pixels including those of the cantilever type disclosed in the cross referenced patents, as these devices also stand to benefit from the present invention. Hence, limitation to SLMs of the torsion-mirror type is not to be inferred, and shielding the support structure including hinges, mirror tips and underlying address circuitry of micromechanical SLMs in general is considered within the scope of the present invention. The geometric implementation of light shields over the pixel superstructure improves the contrast ratio of the spatial light modulator by eliminating the diffraction of terms at the hinges, and at the mirror tips. The shields themselves are geometrically oriented to minimize any diffracted terms from being viewed through the projection optics. The shields have flat, horizontally oriented surfaces so as to not reflect incident light into the darkfield optics. With the additional material inside the posts 12, the mechanical integrity of the superstructure is improved. There are no modifications to the moving portion of the superstructure, and the mirror inertia",
