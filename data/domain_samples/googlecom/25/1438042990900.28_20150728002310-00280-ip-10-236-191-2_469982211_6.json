Those alternatives, variations, and modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the following appended claims. The variations in coil circuit impedance and oscillation frequency due to eddy current losses in nearby external materials can be further reduced by a shield around the sensor coils 1a-b that is made of a material with relatively high magnetic permeability and very low eddy current losses at high frequencies. In the preferred embodiment as shown in FIG. 5, the shield 51 is made of a ferrite material with a thickness of 0.050 inch. Enclosing the sensor coils 1a-b in a shield of ferrite will direct the majority of the magnetic flux through the shield 51 with virtually no eddy current losses, thus allowing only a small amount of flux to escape through the coin slot openings 61 to interact with nearby lossy materials, including the housing 50. The shield 51 thus provides a very stable base oscillation frequency for the coil regardless of other nearby materials so any significant changes in the oscillation frequency can be utilized to improve the ability of the sensor to identify a coin passing through the assembly. The bobbin 60 has a coin slot 61 so that an inserted coin will pass sequentially through",
