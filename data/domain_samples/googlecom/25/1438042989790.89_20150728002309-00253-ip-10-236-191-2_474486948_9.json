Shortly after the Output-- Enable signal transitions to a high state, output select signal Out-- Sel0 transitions to a low state and output select signal Out-- Sel1 transitions to a high state, thereby opening transistor 1309a and closing transistor 1309b. As a result, data value D1 is read out of latch 1302 to output lead 1312. The delay introduced by latency register 1410 spans the resynchronization latency as well as the access latency. The resynchronization latency is the difference between the Sck signal and the Dck signal. Given the waveform diagram of FIG. 15, the data value D1 could have been read out at point 1502 if the latency register 1410 had been programmed for a three half clock cycle delay. However, by programming latency register 1410 with a four half clock cycled delay, the user is able to add a half cycle of latency., 102577=An additional address sequencing circuit similar to address sequencer 1100 is used to generate four column select signals Sb 3:0! in response to a two-bit input CA 4:3!. As previously discussed, column select signals Sb 3:0! control the second level of switches (i.e., the 4-to-1 multiplexers) in tree decoders 901 and 911 (FIG. 9)., 97801=One drawback to address sequencer 1000 is that the total delay from the rising clock edge to the activation of the column select signals is the sum of the clock-to-out delay of counter 1001, the propagation delay of decoder 1002 and the delay through buffer 1003. This total delay limits the burst frequency and therefore the access bandwidth. Another problem arises because the delay paths through decoder 1002 are not uniform for each output transition. Non-uniform decoder delay paths may cause simultaneous assertion of one or more column select signals for the duration of the decoder delay mismatches. As a result, read or write failures may occur, especially during high-speed operation., 137086=Receiver 2003 is a CMOS inverter which includes transistors 2008 and 2009. Receiver 2003 has equal pull-up and pull-down capability. The input of receiver 2003 is coupled to bus line 2030 and the output of receiver 2003 provides a Data-- Out signal, 43219=Prior art memory devices having a high I/O data bandwidth typically use several memory arrays simultaneously to handle the high bandwidth requirement. This is because the individual memory arrays in these devices have a much lower bandwidth capability than the I/O requirement. Examples of such prior art schemes include those described by K. Dosaka et al, \"A 100-MHz 4-Mb Cache DRAM with Fast Copy-Back Scheme\", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 27, No. 11, Nov. 1992, pp. 1534-1539; and M. Farmwald et al, PCT Patent document PCT/US91/02590., 39202=Prior art small swing (less than 1.5 V peak-to-peak) I/O (input/output) schemes generally have a logic threshold voltage different from Vdd /2 (i.e., one-half of the supply voltage), the logic threshold of a conventional CMOS logic circuit. The logic threshold, or trip point, of a bus signal is the voltage level which delineates a logical 1 from a logical 0. An example of such scheme is GTL, where a logic threshold of 0.8 volt is used. (R. Foss et al, IEEE Spectrum Oct. 1992, p.54-57, \"Fast interfaces for DRAMs\"). Other small swing I/O schemes, such as center-tap terminated (CTT) interface (JEDEC Standard, JESD8-4, Nov., 1993), have a fixed threshold (e.g., 1.5 volts) which does not track with the supply voltage. To use a bus signal having logic threshold other than the CMOS logic threshold in a CMOS integrated circuit, a translator circuit must be used to translate the I/O logic threshold to the conventional CMOS logic threshold. These translators consume circuit real estate and power, introduce additional circuit delay and increase circuit complexity., 67716=The organization of memory module 111 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 4. In this embodiment, memory modules 112-128 are identical to memory module 111. Memory module 111 contains two memory arrays 402a and 402b, each having 256K bits organized as 256 rows and 1024 columns. Memory array 402a includes word line driver and decoder 404a, column decoder 406a, sense amplifier circuitry 408a, and column select and data amplifier circuitry 410a. Similarly, memory array 402b includes word line driver and decoder 404b, column decoder 406b, sense amplifier circuitry 408b, and column select and data amplifier circuitry 410b., 83028=FIG. 6 shows the data path in the column area of a memory array in a conventional DRAM. Memory array 601 includes 256 rows and 1024 columns of memory cells. Two complimentary bit lines connect each column in memory array 601 to a sense-amplifier (SA) latch in sense-amplifier circuit 602. The two outputs of each SA latch are connected to a corresponding column select switch in column switch circuit 603. The column select switches in column switch circuit 603 are controlled by signals on column select bus 605. When the column select switches corresponding to an SA latch are closed, the SA latch is coupled to a corresponding complementary pair of data lines. Memory cell array 601 typically uses two data line pairs, (1) DQ0, DQ0 bar and (2) DQ1, DQ1 bar. (See, \"A 50-uA Standby 1M\ufffd1/256K\ufffd4 CMOS DRAM with High-Speed Sense Amplifier\", S. Fujii et al, IEEE JSSC, vol. sc-21, no., 5, Oct. 1986, pp. 643-648; and \"A 60-ns 4-Mbit CMOS DRAM with Built-In Self-Test Function\", T. Ohsawa et al, IEEE JSSC, vol. sc-22, no. 5, Oct. 1987, pp. 663-668)., 108747=The programmable latency control circuit 1204 receives the Out-- Clk signal, the Read-- Enable signal, the Write-- Enable signal and an input signal from DASS bus 102. In response, latency control circuit 1204 generates an Output-- Enable signal which is provided to FIFO 1202 to control the reading of data values out of FIFO 1202. As discussed in more detail below, latency control circuit allows the user to set the number of half clock-cycles between the time a read command is detected to the time data is output from FIFO 1202., 42537=Many prior art memory systems use circuit-module architecture in which the memory arrays are organized into modules and the modules are connected together with either serial buses or dedicated lines. (See, PCT patent document PCT/GB86/00401, M. Brent, \"Control System For Chained Circuit Modules\" serial buses!; and \"K. Yamashita, S. Ikehara, M. Nagashima, and T. Tatematsu, \"Evaluation of Defect-Tolerance Scheme in a 600 M-bit Wafer-Scale Memory\", Proceedings on International Conference on Wafer Scale Integration, Jan. 1991, pp. 12-18. dedicated lines!). In neither case are the circuit modules connected in parallel to a common bus., 137365=Active clamp circuit 2002 (FIG. 20a) includes a CMOS inverter 2020 and clamp transistors 2006 and 2007 connected as source followers. The sizes of transistors 2006 and 2007 control the voltage swing on bus line 2030. In one embodiment, the sizes of transistors 2006 and 2007 are twice the sizes of transistors 2005 and 2004, respectively. When bus line 2030 is driven from high to low by bus driver 2001, and the voltage on bus line 2030 has not reached Vdd /2 volts, the output of inverter 2020 is low, transistor 2007 is on and transistor 2006 is off. When voltage on bus line 2030 is pulled below Vdd /2 volt, output of inverter 2020 goes high, turning transistor 2007 off and turning transistor 2006 on, thereby taking away the sinking current available to bus line 2030. As the voltage on bus line 2030 continues to go down, transistor 2006 is turned on stronger, thereby taking more sinking current from bus line 2030. When the voltage on bus line 2030 is approximately 1.5 VTP above ground, the current through transistor 2006 equals the current through transistor 2005, and the voltage on bus line 2030 becomes steady. VTP is the turn on threshold voltage of transistor 2007 (typically 1 volt)., 128179=FIG. 19 is a block diagram of a memory system 1900 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Memory system 1900 uses memory controller 1920 as a master device and multiple DASS memory devices 1901-1908 as slave devices. One port of memory controller 1920 is coupled to a CPU through CPU bus 1931. Another port of memory controller 1920 is coupled to memory devices 1901-1908 through an I/O bus 1930. In an alternate embodiment, memory controller 1920 resides in the I/O module of one of memory devices 1901-1908., 99106=FIG. 11b is a block diagram of one embodiment of barrel shifter 1102. Barrel shifter 1102 includes eight master/slave D-type flip-flops 1120-1127 connected in a ring configuration. The outputs of 3-to-8 decoder 1101 are provided to the PD inputs of flip-flops 1120-1127. Only one bit of the output of 3-to-8 decoder 1101 is high at any given time. A load signal is provided to each of the L inputs of flip-flops 1120-1127 and a clock signal is provided to each of the C inputs of flip-flops 1120-1127. The Q outputs of flip-flops 1120-1127 are provided to column select buffers 1103. Barrel shifter 1102 is capable of shifting right and left for address increment and decrement, respectively. However, for clarity, only the right-shift configuration is shown., 109974=Transistors 1307a-1307d are controlled by input sequencer 1310. Input sequencer 1310 includes flip-flop 1315, AND gates 1316a-1316e and inverter 1317. Input select bus 1318 couples the outputs of AND gates 1316a-1316d to transistors 1307a-1307d. The outputs of AND gates 1316a-1316d provide input select signals In-- Sel0-In-- Sel3, respectively., 100926=Once the output of 3-to-8 decoder 1101 has been loaded into flip-flops 1120-1127, the load signal is deasserted low, effectively disconnecting the PD inputs of flip-flops 1120-1127 from 3-to-8 decoder 1101. The high bit which was loaded into barrel shifter 1102 is then circulated through flip-flops 1120-1127 in a cyclical manner, with the high bit shifting one flip-flop during each clock cycle., 115639=During the next half clock cycle, the Out-- Clk signal transitions to a low state, thereby resulting in high and low signals on leads 1454 and 1453, respectively. As a result, transmission gate 1440 (FIG. 14b) of latch 1420 closes and the data value stored in latch 1421 (i.e., \"1\") is transmitted through inverters 1443 and 1444 of latch 1420. This \"1\" value is transmitted through transmission gate 1430, resulting in a high Advance-- Enable signal (and a low Advance-- Enable bar signal). The high Advance-- Enable signal enables the output stage of FIFO 1202., 112050=Because FIFO 1202 has four latches, data stored in latches 1301-1304 of FIFO 1202 is over-written every two clock-cycles. Therefore, data cannot remain in FIFO 1202 longer than 2 clock cycles before it is output to lead 1312. Since the Dck signal and the Out-- Clk signal have the same frequency, data stored in FIFO 1202 will be output correctly as long as the Out-- Clk signal does not lag the Dck signal by more than two clock cycles., 113844=When the Read-- Enable signal is asserted low, latches 1420-1428 are disconnected from 3-to-8 decoder 1412, thereby forming a delay queue. When the selected delay is an even number of half-clock cycles (i.e., Q0=0), the Q output of latch 1421 is routed through transmission gate 1431 to provide the Advance-- Enable signal. When the selected delay is equal to an odd number of half-clock cycles (i.e., Q0=1), the Q output of latch 1420 is routed through transmission gate 1430 to provide the Advance-- Enable signal. Latch 1420 is provided to assure that the desired odd half clock cycle delay is properly implemented., 112529=Because of the access latency associated with memory modules 111-128, the Out-- Clk signal actually leads the Dck signal. Latency control circuit 1204 prevents the output sequencer 1320 of FIFO 1202 from being enabled until the access latency has expired., 116775=Resynchronization circuit 1200 operates correctly if the number of half clock cycles programmed into latency register 1410 is greater than the access latency and smaller than access latency plus 4 half-clock cycles (i.e., two clock cycles)., 136700=The gates of transistors 2004 and 2005 are driven by the outputs of NAND gate 2031 and NOR gate 2032, respectively. Logic gates 2031 and 2032 receive a Data-- In signal and a Read-- Enable signal as illustrated. The Read-- Enable signal, when de-asserted high, turns off transistors 2004 and 2005, thereby tri-stating the bus driver., 110362=Transistors 1309a-1309d are controlled by output sequencer 1320. Output sequencer 1320 includes flip-flop 1322, AND gates 1324a-1324e and inverter 1326. Output select bus 1328 couples the outputs of AND gates 1324a-1324d to transistors 1309a-1309d. The outputs of AND gates 1324a-1324d provide output select signals Out-- Sel0-Out-- Sel3, respectively., 35342=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 08/270,856, filed Jul. 5, 1994 pending., 118354=Because the Output-- Enable signal is initially low, output select signal Out-- Sel0 is initially high. Consequently, transistor 1309a is initially closed and data value D0 is transmitted out of FIFO 1202 to output lead 1312 once the access latency has expired. A short flow through latency associated with transmitting the data value D0 through latch 1301 is not illustrated in FIG. 15., 117035=FIG. 15 is a waveform diagram which illustrates the timing of various data and control signals during synchronous operation with latency register 1410 set to a four half-cycle delay. A read command is detected at the rising edge of the Sck signal at point 1501. After a slight delay, the Read-- Enable signal is asserted low. Once the access latency has expired, data value D0 of the Data-- In signal is written into FIFO 1202. In this example, the access latency is less than one period of the Sck clock signal., 41454=Prior art DRAM schemes, such as Synchronous DRAM (JEDEC Standard, Configurations For Solid State Memories, No. 21-C, Release 4, Nov. 1993) and Rambus DRAM (See, PCT Patent document PCT/US91/02590) have attempted to organize the memory devices into banks. In the synchronous DRAM scheme, the JEDEC Standard allows only one bit for each bank address, thereby implying that only two banks are allowed per memory device. If traditional DRAM constraints on the design are assumed, the banks are formed by multiple memory arrays. The Rambus DRAM scheme has a two bank organization in which each bank is formed by multiple memory arrays. In both schemes, due to the large size of the banks, bank-level redundancy is not possible. Furthermore, power dissipation in devices built with either scheme is at best equal to traditional DRAM devices. Additionally, because of the previously defined limitations, neither the Synchronous DRAM scheme nor the Rambus DRAM scheme uses a modular bank architecture in which the banks are connected in parallel to a common internal bus., 120823=On the input side, the low mode-- select signal is transmitted through inverter 1350 to NOR gate 1351. As a result, flip-flop 1315 is disabled and its output Q bar is set to a high state. The low mode-- select signal is also provided to AND gate 1316e, thereby causing a logic low signal at the output of AND gate 1316e. As a result, both inputs to AND gate 1316a are high. As a result, the In-- Sel0 signal transitions to a high state and transistor 1307a of latch 1301 is turned on. Consequently, data value D0 of the Data-- In signal is transmitted through latch 1301. A small flow through delay 1602 is associated with the transmission of the data value through latch 1301. Both the Out-- Sel0 and In-- Sel0 signals stay high as long as the mode-- select signal from mode-- select flip-flop 1207 is low., 120157=FIG. 16 is a waveform diagram illustrating the timing of resynchronization circuit 1200 during asynchronous operation. During an asynchronous operation, the mode select signal of flip-flop 1207 (FIG. 12) is set low, thereby disabling PLL circuit 1206. As a result, the Out-- Clk signal and Advance-- Enable signals are also disabled. Consequently, the output of AND gate 1324e (FIG. 13) is set low and flip-flop 1322 is disabled with its output Q bar set high. Thus, both inputs of AND gate 1324a are high, causing the Out-- Sel0 signal to transition to a high state and turning on transistor 1309a of latch 1301., 138609=Similarly, a low to high transition of bus line 2030 causes transistor 2006 to turn off and transistor 2007 to turn on, with the voltage on bus line 2030 clamped at approximately 1.5 VTN below Vdd, where VTN is the turn on threshold voltage of transistor 2006 (typically 1 volt)., 107742=Mode-- select flip-flop 1207 is programmed by the Write-- Enable signal and another signal received from DASS bus 102. The Q output of mode-select flip-flop 1207 is used as a mode-- select signal. The mode-- select signal enables FIFO 1202 and PLL 1206 when synchronous operating mode is selected (i.e., the mode-- select signal is high). The mode-- select signal disables FIFO 1202 and PLL 1206 when asynchronous operating mode is selected (i.e., the mode-- select signal is low). PLL circuit 1206 is a conventional circuit which generates an output clock (Out-- Clk) signal in response to the Sck signal. The Out-- Clk signal is provided to FIFO 1202 and latency control circuit 1204. The Out-- Clk signal is selected to ensure that transitions in the Data-- Out signal of FIFO 1202 are in phase with the Sck signal (taking into account delays within FIFO 1202)., 114515=For example, if one half clock cycle of delay is desired, latches 1420 and 1422-1428 are loaded with \"0\"s and latch 1421 is loaded with a \"1\". The value of Q0 is 1, thereby closing transmission gate 1430. When the Read-- Enable signal goes high, a delay queue is formed. This delay queue is clocked by the output of NAND gate 1450. NAND gate 1450 receives the Read-- Enable signal, the Out-- Clk signal and the Advance-- Enable bar signal. The Advance-- Enable bar signal is created by transmitting the output of transmission gate 1430 through inverter 1451., 98515=FIG. 11a is a block diagram of an address sequencer 1100 in accordance with the present invention. For simplicity, 3-bit decoding is shown. It is understood that the same principles can be applied to decode other numbers of bits in accordance with the present invention. Address sequencer 1100 includes a 3-to-8 decoder 1101, an 8-stage barrel shifter 1102 and buffers 1103. The 3-bit starting address is input to decoder 1101 on bus 1105. The 8-bit output of decoder 1101 is loaded into barrel shifter 1102 when the load signal input to barrel shifter 1102 is activated., 128729=I/O bus 1930, which employs high-speed Reduced CMOS Swing (RCS) for signaling, includes: 16 bi-directional lines ADQ 15:0! for multiplexed address and data signals, 4 lines C 3:0! for command signals, 2 lines Dm 1:0! for write-mask signals, 1 line for a synchronization clock signal Mck, and 1 line for a clock enable signal Cke. The Cke and Mck signals are specific to I/O bus 1930. However, the remaining signals on I/O bus 1930 are extensions of the signals present on the DASS buses which exist within each of memory modules 1901-1908. Thus, the I/O modules in memory devices 1901-1908 (similar to I/O module 104 in memory device 100) are interface bridges between the DASS buses of memory devices 1901-1908 and I/O bus 1930. However, unlike the DASS buses, which use source synchronization for the timing of information transfer, I/O bus 1930 is fully synchronous with a single clock signal (Mck). The protocol used in I/O bus 1930 is a super-set of the protocol used in the DASS buses. However, the protocol used in the DASS buses does not include the protocol involving the Cke/signal. The Cke signal is used for stopping and starting the clocks inside the memory devices 1901-1908. This allows devices of slower speed to be attached to I/O bus 1930 without lowering the system clock (Mck) frequency. Dedicated chip select (CS) lines to each of memory devices 1901-1908 are also included for system initialization. At power-up or after system reset, the communication addresses of the memory modules in memory devices 1901-1908 are reset to their default values. As a result, memory modules in different memory devices 1901-1908 may have the same communication address. The CS lines are used to program the memory modules within memory devices 1901-1908 so that the memory modules have different communication addresses in the overall memory system 1900., 133371=Within each memory device 1901-1908, redundant memory modules are incorporated in each device and each memory module includes an ID register which is programmable through commands on I/O bus 1930. This redundancy mechanism allows for the efficient repair of defective modules both locally in the memory device and globally in other devices attached to I/O bus 1930. That is, any of the redundant modules in any of the memory devices 1901-1908 can replace any defective memory module in any of the memory devices 1901-1908. As more memory devices are added to memory system 1900, the ratio of redundant modules to regular modules is maintained, but the ability to repair cluster defects increases. For example, in a memory system having four memory devices, with each memory device having one redundant module, a cluster defect involving four or less modules can be repaired without any degradation in performance. This is advantageous because cluster defects are the predominant cause of integrated system failure. Redundant memory modules of traditional redundancy schemes can only be used to replace memory modules within the same memory device (i.e., on the same chip)., 102054=Additionally, because flip-flops 1120-1127 are identically constructed, the outputs of barrel shifter 1102 have uniform clock-to-out delays. Furthermore, there are no combinational logic gates between the output of barrel shifter 1102 and column select lines Sa 7:0!. Consequently, the clock-to-column-select-asserted time is well matched for all column select lines, thereby avoiding simultaneous assertion of the column select lines and minimizing read or write failures caused by address transitions., 131777=In one application the communication addresses of the modules are assigned such that memory system 1900 has a contiguous memory space. In another application, the dynamic address mapping capability of the present invention is used in computer systems operating on virtual memory addresses. In conventional memory devices which map to a fixed address space, the virtual address has to be translated to a physical address before a memory access can be carried out. This required translation increases system complexity and memory access latency. However, using the present memory system, the communication address of a memory module can be programmed to assume a virtual address. A memory access can then be carried out without performing an address translation. Managing such a memory system is straightforward because allocating and de-allocating memory pages is a matter of changing the communication addresses of one or more memory modules. Because the present memory system is capable of operating with virtual addresses and it can be referred to as a \"Virtual Main Memory\"., 111503=Before the Output-- Enable signal is asserted high, output sequencer 1320 is reset so that latch 1301 is selected for output. When the Output-- Enable signal is asserted high, output sequencer 1320 sequentially asserts output select signals Out-- Sel0-Out-- Sel3 on output select bus 1328. Output select signals Out-- Sel0-Out-- Sel3 sequentially enable transistors 1309a-1309d, respectively, one at a time at each transition of the Out-- Clk signal., 116286=The low Advance-- Enable bar signal forces the output of NAND gate 1450 to a logic high state, thereby stopping the clocking of the latches 1420-1428. As a result, the Advance-- Enable signal remains high until the read transaction is terminated (i.e., the Read-- Enable signal is deasserted)., 123034=In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 17, memory array 1732 in module 1711 and memory arrays 1730 and 1731 in module 1728 are selected by programming the memory array-select bits in these modules. In other embodiments, other memory arrays and/or memory modules may be selected. After the desired arrays have been selected, a stream of write data is broadcast from I/O device 1704 to DASS bus 1702 and this data is simultaneously written into memory arrays 1730-1732., 112815=FIG. 14a is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of latency control circuit 1204. Latency control circuit 1204 includes eight latches 1420-1428 connected to form a delay queue. FIG. 14b is a schematic diagram of dynamic latch 1420. Latch 1420 includes transmission gates 1440-1442 and inverters 1443-1445. Latches 1421-1428 are identical to latch 1420., 125076=The waveform of FIG. 18, which is referenced to the structure of memory device 1700 (FIG. 17), illustrates one such interleaving sequence. In this interleaving sequence, the interleave-enable bits in modules 1727 and 1728 are set. In addition, the access-control registers in modules 1727 and 1728 are programmed to indicate that four memory arrays will participate in the interleaved access. A read command is then addressed to column address 7, module 1727, array 1741 (D771). Data words are then sequentially read out of the following addresses: column address 7, module 1727, array 1741 (D771); column address 7, module 1728, array 1734 (D780); column address 7, module 1728, array 1731 (D781); and column address 7, module 1727, array 1740 (D770). The sequence continues until the interleaved-burst read command is terminated. Each participating array takes a turn, in a round robin fashion, to send a data word., 138919=Passive clamp 2011 (FIG. 20b) is a resistor divider. Equal-value resistors 2016 and 2017 are connected between Vdd, bus line 2030 and ground. Passive clamp 2011 can also be a Thevenin equivalent of a resistor divider. For example, a resistor having half the resistance of resistor 2016 can be connected to a supply voltage equal to half of Vdd. Passive clamp 2011 takes the advantage of the finite output resistance of the driver transistors 2004 and 2005. When bus line 2030 is driven from low to high, transistor 2005 is turned off and transistor 2004 is turned on. Initially, transistor 2004 and resistor 2017 source more current than resistor 2016 can sink, thereby pulling the voltage on bus line 2030 high. As the voltage on bus line 2030 continues to rise, the sourcing capability of both transistor 2014 and resistor 2017 decrease and the sinking capability of resistor 2016 increases. This continues until the total source current is equal to the sink current. The voltage on bus line 2030 then remains constant until the Data-- In signal changes. Similarly, when bus line 2030 is driven from high to low, the voltage on bus line 2030 is clamped when the source current in resistor 2017 equals the total sink current in transistor 2005 and resistor 2016. The voltage swing can be adjusted by varying the size of driver transistors 2005 and 2004 or the value of resistors 2016 and 2017., 110756=For synchronous operation, the mode select signal is set high. When the Read-- enable signal is de-asserted high and the Dck signal is low, input sequencer 1310 is reset so that latch 1301 is selected for input. When Read-- enable is asserted low (i.e., after a read command is detected), input sequencer 1310 sequentially generates input select signals In-- Sel0-In-- Sel3 on input select bus 1318. Input select signals In-- Sel0-In-- Sel3 sequentially enable transistors 1307a-1307d, respectively, one at a time at each transition of the Dck signal. This causes the data values in the Data-- In signal to be stored in consecutive latches 1301-1304., 135801=FIGS. 20a and 20b are schematic diagrams of active clamp 2002 and passive clamp 2011, respectively. Clamps 2002 and 2011 limit the swing on a bus line 2030 of I/O bus 1930. P-channel transistor 2004 and n-channel transistor 2005 form push-pull driver 2001 with equal sourcing and sinking capability. This balanced drive capability makes the signal transition of bus line 2030 symmetrical, thereby eliminating signal skew and maximizing the operating bandwidth of bus line 2030. The balance in pull-up and pull-down also yields a circuit with maximum supply noise rejection because transistors 2004 and 2005 spend equal amounts of time in the saturation region during signal transition. In fact, when properly selected, transistors 2004 and 2005 remain in the saturation region at all times, giving bus line 2030 maximum immunity to supply (Vdd) and ground (GND) noise., 101641=The total delay time of address sequencer 1100 is less than the total delay time of conventional address sequencer 1000. This is because address sequencer 1100 does not experience any delay associated with decoder 1101 after the initial address is loaded into barrel shifter 1102. As a result, address sequencing circuit 1100 can operate at much higher frequencies than address sequencer 1000., 99885=FIG. 11c is a schematic diagram of master/slave D-type flip-flop 1120. In the embodiment illustrated, master/slave D-type flip-flops 1120-1127 are identical. When the load signal is asserted high, transmission gate 1162 is closed and the PD input is stored in the master latch formed by inverters 1150 and 1170. The load signal is only asserted high when the clock signal is low. When the clock signal is low, transmission gate 1160 is open and transmission gate 1161 is closed. As a result, the output of the master latch is transferred to the slave latch formed by inverters 1151 and 1171. The Q output then has the same state as the signal applied to the PD input. Inverters 1150 and 1151 have weak output drive so that they can be easily overcome by the drive of transmission gates 1160 and 1161., 82391=Memory arrays in conventional DRAM schemes are incapable of providing data at this frequency. In prior art DRAM schemes, the data accessed from the DRAM is supplied by several memory arrays and each memory array is operating at a significantly bower data bandwidth than the data I/O bandwidth. (See, for example, PCT patent document PCT/US91/02590 Farmwald et al!; \"A 100 MHz 4 Mb Cache DRAM with Fast Copy-back Scheme\" K. Dosaka, Y. Konishi, K. Hayano, K. Himukashi, A. Yamazaki, C. A. Hart, M Kumanoya, H. Hamano, and T. Yoshihara, ISSCC, 1992, pp. 148-149!)., 109344=FIG. 13 is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of FIFO 1202. FIFO 1202 contains four data latches 1301-1304, an input sequencer 1310 and an output sequencer 1320. The Data-- In signal is provided to data latches 1301-1304 through inverter 1305 on lead 1306. Data latches 1301-1304 include transistors 1307a-1307d, inverters 1308a-1308h and transistors 1309a-1309d. The data values stored in latches 1301-1304 are subsequently transmitted through tri-state buffer 1311 to output lead 1312 as the Data-- Out signal. Tri-state buffer 1311 is enabled by the Read-- Enable signal., 115168=Because the Read-- Enable and Advance-- Enable bar signals are high, the Out-- Clk signal determines the output of NAND gate 1451. Because the Out-- Clk signal is initially high, the output of NAND gate 1450 on lead 1454 is initially low. The output of NAND gate 1450 is also transmitted through inverter 1452 to lead 1453. As a result, the transmission gate 1440 (FIG. 14b) of latch 1420 is initially open., 96801=FIG. 10 is a block diagram of a conventional address sequencer 1000 which includes an n-bit binary counter 1001, an n-to-2n decoder 1002 and a buffer 1003. (See, Motorola Memory Data Book, Device MCM62486A, pp. 7-100-7-109, 1992). The starting address is loaded from address bus 1011 to counter 1001 by activating the load signal input to counter 1001. Address advancing is timed by a clock signal input to counter 1001. The output of counter 1001 is decoded by decoder 1002 and then buffered by buffer 1003. The signals provided at the output of buffer 1003 are column select signals that are activated one at a time to gate data words from the sense-amplifier latches. At every rising clock edge, counter 1001 is incremented and its output is decoded to generate the next column select signal to activate the next column select line. The column select lines are thus asserted in consecutive order, with each column select line being asserted for the duration of one clock cycle., 140366=When using either active clamp 2002 or passive clamp 2011, only one clamp circuit per bus line is required. The clamp circuit can be integrated in the master device, in one of the slave devices or in a separate device. Also, in both clamping circuits, bus line 2030 is clamped or terminated with a relatively small value resistance. In active clamp 2002, transistors 2006 and 2007 have relatively low output resistances since they are connected as source followers. In passive clamp 2011, the Thevenin equivalent of the resistor divider facilitates the termination. The termination in both cases suppresses reflection and ringing which can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and limit the operating frequency on bus line 2030., 132925=Memory system 1900 (FIG. 19) is highly tolerant to defects. Three levels of redundancy provide memory system 1900 with high fault tolerance. At the system level, each memory device 1901-1930 incorporates a disable register which when set, disables the device from participating in memory transactions on the I/O bus 1930. Redundant devices can be easily incorporated on I/O bus 1930 for repairing defective devices on the bus., 107156=FIG. 12 is a block diagram of resynchronization circuit 1200 which includes a 4-deep first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory 1202, a latency control circuit 1204, a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit 1206 and a mode-- select flip-flop 1207. FIFO 1202 receives a data input (Data-- In) signal from the selected memory modules and provides temporary storage for the data values in the Data-- In signal. Write operations within FIFO 1202 are controlled by the Dck signal, the Read-- Enable signal and a mode-- select signal., 122131=FIG. 17 is a block diagram of memory device 1700 which is used to perform a broadcast-write operation. Memory device 1700 includes memory modules 1711-1728 which are connected in parallel to master I/O device 1704 through DASS bus 1702. Each of memory modules 1711-1728 has two memory arrays. Two memory array-select bits are provided in the access-control register of each memory module 1711-1728. These two bits are set or reset by a \"Broadcast-write Select\" command received on DASS bus 1702. Once an array-select bit is set, the associated array is selected for participating in the subsequent write operations. A selected array remains selected until its associated array-select bit is reset. One or both arrays in a module can be selected. Furthermore, one or more modules can be selected. A write operation writes a data stream to all selected arrays simultaneously., 113188=Latency register 1410 controls the number of clock edges (i.e., half clock cycles) which elapse after a read command is detected before data is output from FIFO 1202. Latency register 1410 can be programmed with a 3-bit input through DASS bus 102 when the Write-- Enable signal is asserted. The contents of latency register 1410 are provided to a 3-to-8 decoder 1412. When the Read-- Enable signal is high, each of dynamic latches 1420-1428 is isolated from its D input and the outputs of 3-to-8 decoder 1412 are loaded into latches 1421-1428. Latch 1420 is loaded with zero because its PD input is tied to ground., 117589=Upon receiving the Dck signal, input sequencer 1310 (FIG. 13) sequentially generates input select signals In-- Sel0-In-- Sel3. Input select signal In-- Sel0 is initially high, thereby turning on transistor 1307a and allowing data value D0 to be written into latch 1301. Shortly after the Dck signal transitions to a low state, input select signal In-- Sel0 is de-asserted and input select signal In-- Sel1 is asserted, turning on transistor 1307b and allowing data value D1 to be written into latch 1302. This process is continued, with input select signals In-- Sel0-In-- Sel3 sequentially enabling transistors 1307a-1307d to write data values into latches 1301-1304., 101343=The 8-bit output of barrel shifter 1102 is connected through buffer 1103 to consecutive column select lines Sa 7:0! of tree decoders 901 and 911 (FIG. 9). The column select lines Sa 7:0! are thus asserted in consecutive order, one at a time, for the duration of one clock cycle., 130677=All devices attached to I/O bus 1930 are assigned unique communication addresses. This can be accomplished either by hardwired logic or by incorporating programmability in the ID assigning mechanism in the devices. In certain embodiments, a memory device can assume one or more communication addresses. Each memory module within memory devices 1901-1908 assumes a communication address. For memory operations, the communication address is contained in the memory address as a field. Each memory module spans a contiguous memory address space. However, the address space spanned by each memory device does not need to be contiguous since the communication address of each module can be individually programmed. By maintaining the same sets of commands and protocols in I/O bus 1930 and the DASS buses in memory devices 1901-1908, the ID registers of all modules in memory devices 1901-1908 are programmable through I/O bus 1930. Consequently, all modules in memory system 1900 can be dynamically assigned communication addresses to span different areas in the memory address space., 119948=This process is continued, with output select signals Out-- Sel0-Out-- Sel3 sequentially enabling transistors 1309a-1309d to read data values out of latches 1301-1304., 134820=Electrically, the signals on I/O bus 1930 have a swing of approximately 2 volts centered around the middle of the supply voltage. The actual signal swing can be adjusted to optimize the operating frequency and minimize power dissipation. Two types of termination are used on I/O bus 1930 to suppress transmission line effects such as reflections and ringing. Details of the structure of the bus transceiver and termination are described below., 123520=In graphics applications, when the memory device 1700 is used as a display buffer, a fixed pattern can be simultaneously written into multiple display screen memory locations using a broadcast-write operation, thereby significantly increasing the graphics update bandwidth., 116632=The latency control circuit 1204 illustrated in FIGS. 14a and 14b operates in a similar manner for even clock cycle delays., 43801=Traditional memory devices can operate either synchronously or asynchronously, but not both. Synchronous memories are usually used in systems requiring a high data rate. To meet the high data rate requirement, synchronous memory devices are usually heavily pipelined. (See, e.g., the scheme described in \"250 Mbyte/s Synchronous DRAM Using a 3-Stage-Pipelined Architecture\", Y. Takai et al, IEEE JSSC, vol. 29, no. 4, April, 1994, pp. 426-431.) The pipelined architecture disclosed in Y. Takai et al, causes the access latency to be fixed at 3 clock cycles at all clock frequencies, thereby making this synchronous memory device unsuitable for systems using lower clock frequencies. For example, when operating at 50 Mhz the device has an access latency of 60 ns (compared to an access latency of 24 ns when operating at 125 Mhz)., 135283=In order to operate I/O bus 1930 at high clock frequencies, small-swing signaling is employed. To maximize the noise immunity and data rate, and minimize the complexity of the bus transceiver circuit, a logic threshold equal to half of the supply voltage (Vdd) is used. This threshold voltage matches the threshold voltage of the rest of the on-chip CMOS logic. Consequently logic translation circuitry is eliminated. An active clamp or a passive clamp is used to limit the signal swing., 100705=Because the decoded address is loaded simultaneously to both the master and slave stage of D-type flip-flops 1120-1127, the barrel shifter 1102 does not constitute a pipeline stage in the address path.}",
