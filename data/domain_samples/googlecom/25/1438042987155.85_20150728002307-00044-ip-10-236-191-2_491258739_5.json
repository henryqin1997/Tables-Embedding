    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the new resistor has been described in considerable detail, such description is intended to be illustrative rather than limiting, for the resistor may be variously embodied and is to be limited only by interpretation of the claims which follow. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that gaps may be left in some of the resistive portions and they can be filled in or bridged by resistive material that has higher or lower resistance than the marjority of the layer material so that the resistance can be trimmed to exact values overall or in any selected one of the resistive steps or portions. The techniques for applying suitable thick film resistors for bridging the gaps are sufficiently well-known to obviate the need for further discussion. Use of the resistor is depicted symbolically in FIG. 6 where the contact portions 18, 21, 20, 19 and 12 are symbolized by rectangles. The straight portions of the resistive pattern are given the usual symbol for electrical resistances. The top terminal portion 24 may be considered the starting point of the circuit. This portion may be contacted with a contact, not shown, that connects to one line of a power supply. The resistor cooperates with a movable contactor 30 which is illustrated as having fingers such as 31 and 32 of varying lengths. An electromagnetic brake coil 33, for example, may have one of its ends",
