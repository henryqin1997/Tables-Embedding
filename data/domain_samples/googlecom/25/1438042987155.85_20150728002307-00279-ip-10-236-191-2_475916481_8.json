    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38815=After removal of the resist, if necessary, conductive metal 17, such as lead-tin or other terminal metallurgies, is electroplated on the portions of the seed layer remaining in the recesses, to result in the structure shown in FIG. 3. During the electroplating, the barrier layer 11 may act as a cathode terminal for carrying the electroplating current. For lead-tin solders, plating, commercial solder plating baths such as NF 800 HS or NF 72 BC from Technic Inc., Rhode Island, may be used. Other proprietary commercially available lead-tin solders, eutectic solders, lead-free solders and/or other platable terminal metallurgies may be utilized., 34492=Next, a conductive barrier 11 may provided over the insulating layer. Preferably, the conductive barrier may include a layer of tantalum nitride first sputter deposited over the insulating layer, the walls of the recess, and the exposed conductive feature to a thickness of about 15 \u212b to about 500 \u212b and more typically to a thickness of about 50 \u212b to about 300 \u212b to act as adhesion promoting layer between the insulating layer and subsequently to be applied tantalum layer. Then, a tantalum layer may be sputtered over the layer of tantalum nitride, where it may form \u03b1-Ta spontaneously. Typically, the thickness of the tantalum layer is about 500 \u212b to about 3000 \u212b and more typically about 1000 \u212b to about 2000 \u212b. Also, \u03b1-Ta may be deposited directly over the insulator by sputtering methods. Typically, the thickness of the \u03b1-Ta is about 500 \u212b to about 5000 \u212b, and more typically about 1000 \u212b to about 3000 \u212b., 38246=According to an alternative embodiment, photoresist may not be utilized. Such an embodiment may utilize a very hard pad to prevent dishing of the seed layer in the depression. A hard polishing pad, such as IC 1000 or IC 100/Suba IV from Rodel Inc., may be used to polish off the seed layer. One possible disadvantage of not using photoresist is that slurry utilized in chemical-mechanical polishing techniques may enter the recess. The slurry typically would then need to be removed. One way to remove the slurry is in a megasonic cleaning solution., 29899=An example of a device attachment method is the C4 process. This process is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,440 issued Feb. 18, 1992, to Christie et al., the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such methods are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,401,126 and 3,429,040 to Miller, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention is particularly useful in such processes. However, usefulness of the present invention is by no means limited to such processes. In fact, the present invention may be useful in any application for selectively plating one metal to another metal utilizing more than one metal as an electrode., 32696=The substrate and the conductive feature may be covered by at least one layer of an electrically insulating material. The insulating layer be thermally grown or deposited such as by chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Typically, the insulating layer is about 2000 to about 30,000 \u212b thick, and more typically about 4000 to about 20,000 \u212b thick., 35430=After the deposition of the barrier layer, a seed layer 13 may be deposited over the barrier layer 11 including on the walls and bottom of the recess(es). The preferred seed layer is copper, which can be deposited by sputtering or evaporation and preferably by sputtering. The copper may be sputtered employing temperatures of less than about 150\ufffd C., preferably less than about 100\ufffd C., such as about 100\ufffd C. to about \u221210\ufffd C. The sputtering may be carried out in the absence of an anneal. The sputtering is typically carried out to provide a seed layer of about 100 \u212b to about 2000 \u212b and preferably about 400 \u212b to about 1000 \u212b. Also, the copper seed layer may be deposited by CVD methods or by electroless plating method., 36822=An example of a type of photoresist material is based upon phenolic-formaldehyde Novolak polymers. A particular example of such is Shipley AZ-1350 which is a m-cresol formaldehyde novolak polymer composition. Such is a positive resist composition and includes therein a diazo ketone such as 2-diazo-1-naphthol-5-sulfonic acid ester.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of the invention illustrates and describes the present invention. Additionally, the disclosure shows and describes only the preferred embodiments of the invention but, as mentioned above, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations, modifications, and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein, commensurate with the above teachings and/or the skill or knowledge of the relevant art. The embodiments described hereinabove are further intended to explain best modes known of practicing the invention and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention in such, or other, embodiments and with the various modifications required by the particular applications or uses of the invention. Accordingly, the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Also, it is intended that the appended claims be construed to include alternative embodiments. According to the process of the present invention, no lithograph step is required to define the seed layer since the chemical-mechanical polishing step makes the seed layer self-aligning to the recess(es). Not requiring a lithographic step simplifies the process. Additionally, the process may be less costly as compared to typical lithographically defined C4 processes. This simplification and cost advantage may be realized in any process requiring similar selective plating of metal(s). Next, the barrier layer 11 may be removed down",
