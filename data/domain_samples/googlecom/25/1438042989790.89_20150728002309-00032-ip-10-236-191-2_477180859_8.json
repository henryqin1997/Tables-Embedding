The chiral smectic C phase is denoted SC* with the asterisk denoting chirality. The SC* phase is generally considered to be the most useful as it is the fastest switching. Ferroelectric smectic liquid crystal materials should ideally possess the following characteristics: low viscosity, controllable spontaneous polarisation (Ps) and an SC* phase that persists over a broad temperature range, which should include ambient temperature and exhibits chemical and photochemical stability. Materials which possess these characteristics offer the prospect of very fast switching liquid crystal containing devices. Some applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals are described by J. S. Patel and J. W. Goodby in Opt. Eng., 1987, 26, 273., 42620=SCE8+0.5% RLC1+approximately 0.1% Darocur 1173. Thermally aligned., 19247=This is a divisional of application Ser.

The initiator used was Darocur 1173 (approximately 0.1%). FIGS. 2-7 illustrate the appearance of liquid crystal cells viewed under a microscope before and after they had been subjected to mechanical shock. Typically cells were 1.5-2.0 \u03bcm thick for these experiments, though cells of any suitable thickness could have been used. For example 3, one cell was cured a/ in the presence of a d.c. field and another cell b/ was cured without the field. It was only for the cell cured without the presence of a field (3 b) that electro-optic switching studies for example tmin, Vmin studies could be carried out on. tmin against Vmin plots were run for example 3.
