The wiper blade holder 36 is repositioned to the non-wiping position by a camming action of the carriage 26 as the carriage continues to move in the direction of the printing location as indicated by arrow 33 a. Alternatively, the wiper blade holder remains in the wiping position until the carriage returns from the printing location to the non-printing location as depicted in FIG. 2 where the carriage translation in this direction causes the withdrawal of the wiper blade holder 36 from the wiping position to the non-wiping position until the wiper blade 30 is located between the ink tank support structures 10 and 11, whereupon the wiper blade holder is permitted to be moved toward the carriage and position the wiper blade in the wiping position as shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 5, a view that is similar to FIG. 4, except a short time later has past as the carriage continues to translate towards the printing location in the direction of arrow 33A. At this instant in time, the wiper blade is shown in dashed line as it has just contacted the open side 28 of the backstop receptacle 16.",
