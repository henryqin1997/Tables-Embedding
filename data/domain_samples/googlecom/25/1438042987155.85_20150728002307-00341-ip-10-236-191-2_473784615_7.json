The software defined by the flowcharts of FIGS. 3, 4 a, and 4 b can take a variety of specific forms and yet provide equivalent functions. Similarly, the individual software elements in these flowcharts can represent a variety of different instruction sets. We wish the claims following to be interpreted to cover all of these equivalent hardware and software embodiments. If the node is not in transmit mode, the instructions of activity element 144 are executed, which assembles the message for processing as needed and analyzes the message for further actions, which the message may request. Then instruction execution advances to perform normal operating functions and to wait for the next 500 msec. interrupt. Decision element 138 tests a transmit/receive flag to detect whether node 10\u2032 is in transmit mode. (When data transmission is active, the transmit/receive flag is set to indicate that condition, and when the transmission is complete, the flag is changed to indicate that node 10\u2032 is in receive mode.) Collisions need be detected only when transmit mode is active, of course. Activity element 139 calls a collision detect routine. Activity element 141 calls a message transmit routine, which transmits the next bit of the message. Then instruction execution advances to perform normal operating functions and to wait for the",
