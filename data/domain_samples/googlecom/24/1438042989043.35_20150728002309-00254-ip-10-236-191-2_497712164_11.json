It is unknown whether the different stereoisomers of MNTX exhibit different biological and chemical properties. All of the reported functions of MNTX described in the literature indicate that MNTX is a peripheral opioid antagonist. Some of these antagonist functions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,176,186, 4,719,215, 4,861,781, 5,102,887, 5,972,954, 6,274,591, 6,559,158, and 6,608,075, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/163,482 (2003/0022909A1), Ser. No. 10/821,811 (20040266806), Ser. No. 10/821,813 (20040259899) and Ser. No. 10/821,809 (20050004155). These uses include reducing the side-effects of opioids without reducing the analgesic effect of opioids. Such side-effects include nausea, emesis, dysphoria, pruritus, urinary retention, bowel hypomotility, constipation, gastric hypomotility, delayed gastric emptying and immune suppression. The art discloses that MNTX not only reduces the side-effects stemming from opioid analgesic treatment but also reduces the side-effects mediated by endogenous opioids alone or in conjunction with exogenous opioid treatment. Such side-effects include inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, post-operative gastrointestinal dysfunction, idiopathic constipation and other such conditions including, but not limited to, those mentioned above. However, it is unclear from the art whether the MNTX used in these studies was a mixture of R and S stereoisomers or a single stereoisomer.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{85730=As will be readily understood, functional groups present may contain protecting groups during the course of synthesis. Protecting groups are known per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred protecting groups are those that are stable during formation, isolation and purification. A preferred protecting group is an isobutyryl groups,); silyl ethers (SiR3, wherein each R can be independently C1-C6 alkyl, straight chain or branched); 2-tetrahydropyranyl ether, alkyl carbonates; a benzyloxycarbonyl group and a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group. Other preferred protecting groups that may be employed in accordance with the present invention are described in Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991. The expression \u201chydroxyl protective group\u201d as used hereinbelow is intended to designate a group which is inserted in place of the hydrogen atom of an OH group., 134989=A particular methacrylic copolymer is EUDRAGIT L, particularly L-30D and EUDRAGIT L 100-55. In EUDRAGIT L-30D, the ratio of free carboxyl groups to ester groups is approximately 1:1. Further, the copolymer is known to be insoluble in gastrointestinal fluids having pH below 5.5, generally 1.5-5.5, i.e., the pH generally present in the fluid of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but readily soluble or partially soluble at pH above 5.5, i.e., the pH generally present in the fluid of lower gastrointestinal tract. Another particular methacrylic acid polymer is EUDRAGIT S, which differs from EUDRAGIT L-30D in that the ratio of free carboxyl groups to ester groups is approximately 1:2. EUDRAGIT S is insoluble at pH below 5.5, but unlike EUDRAGIT L-30D, is poorly soluble in gastrointestinal fluids having a pH in the range of 5.5 to 7.0, such as in the small intestine. This copolymer is soluble at pH 7.0 and above, i.e., the pH generally found in the colon. EUDRAGIT S can be used alone as a coating to provide drug delivery in the large intestine. Alternatively, EUDRAGIT S, being poorly soluble in intestinal fluids below pH 7, can be used in combination with EUDRAGIT L-30D, soluble in intestinal fluids above pH 5.5, in order to provide a delayed release composition which can be formulated to deliver the active agent to various segments of the intestinal tract. The more EUDRAGIT L-30D used, the more proximal release and delivery begins, and the more EUDRAGIT S used, the more distal release and delivery begins. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that both EUDRAGIT L-30D and EUDRAGIT S can be replaced with other pharmaceutically acceptable polymers having similar pH solubility characteristics. In certain embodiments of the invention, the preferred enteric coating is ACRYL-EZE\u2122 (methacrylic acid co-polymer type C; Colorcon, West Point, Pa.)., 187785=3-O-Isobutyryl-N-Methylnaltrexone Iodide salt (3). Compound (2) (689 mg, 1.67 mmol) was transferred by spatula into a glass pressure vessel. The vessel was purged gently with nitrogen on the manifold for 5 minutes and was then evacuated under high vacuum. When the vacuum was constant, the lower part of the vessel was immersed in liquid nitrogen. Methyl iodide (973 mg, 6.85 mmol) was dispensed into a separate flask on the manifold into a nitrogen atmosphere and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen methyl iodide vessel was evacuated under high vacuum. The main manifold chamber was isolated from the high vacuum pump. The methyl iodide was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and sublime via the main chamber onto the liquid nitrogen cooled 3-O-Isobutyryl-Naltrexone. When sublimation was complete, nitrogen was slowly allowed to leach into the glass pressure vessel. The vessel was then sealed tight, removed from the manifold and heated in an oil bath at 88-90\ufffd C. for 17 hrs. The vessel was allowed to cool to ambient temperature before allowing nitrogen to flow into the vessel. The vessel was then evacuated under high vacuum to remove residues of unreacted methyl iodide giving a white solid. A sample of the solid was removed for 1H NMR analysis. This showed good conversion to product. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the product [dichloromethane/methanol 9:1 (v/v), normal phase silica, UV detection] showed a trace of starting material (2) (Rf=0.8) and a diffuse region (Rf=0-0.4). The solid was dissolved in dichloromethane/methanol (4:1, minimum volume) and applied to a silica gel column (ultrapure silica gel, 22 g in dichloromethane, bed dimensions: 200 mm\ufffd20 mm id). The column was eluted as follows:, 29532=This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of the filing date of U.S. Ser. No. 60/684,616, filed on May 25, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 35244=Goldberg et al.'s U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,186, and more recently Cantrell et al.'s WO 2004/043964 A2 describe a protocol for the synthesis of MNTX. Both describe a synthesis of MNTX by quaternizing a tertiary N-substituted morphinan alkaloid with a methylating agent. Both Goldberg et al. and Cantrell et al. are silent as to the stereoisomer(s) produced by the synthesis. The authors remained cautiously silent about the stereochemistry because the stereochemistry could not be determined based on prior art. The cyclopropylmethyl side-chain in naltrexone is different from the prior art side-chains and may have affected the stereochemical outcome in the synthesis of MNTX, as may other reaction parameters such as temperature and pressure. Based on the method of synthesis described in each, it is unknown whether the MNTX so produced was R, S or a mixture of both., 185988=3-O-Isobutyryl-Naltrexone (2). To a solution of compound (1) (1.62 g, 4.75 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (120 mL) at 0\ufffd C. was added triethylamine (NEt3) (1.4 mL, 10 mmol). After the reaction was stirred for 15 min. at 0\ufffd C., isobutyryl chloride (1.05 mL, 10 mmol) was added dropwise. Reaction mixture was stirred at 0\ufffd C. for 1 hr, then at room temperature for 18 hr before being quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (aq) (70 mL) and 30 ml of H2O. The reaction was extracted with methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) (2\ufffd200 mL). The extracts were combined, washed with brine (130 ml), dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) (50 g), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (column size 40\ufffd450 mm, silica gel was loaded 40\ufffd190 mm) (9.8:0.2\u21929.6:0.4\u21929.4:0.6 CH2C12/MeOH) to give compound (2) (1.5 g 76.8%) as a white solid., 33523=Bianchetti et al, 1983 Life Science 33 (Sup I):415-418 studied three pairs of diastereoisomers of quaternary narcotic antagonist and their parent tertiary amines, levallorphan, nalorphine, and naloxone, to see how the configuration about the chiral nitrogen affected in vitro and in vivo activity. It was found that the activity varied considerably depending on how the quaternary derivatives were prepared. In each series, only the diastereomer obtained by methylation of the N-allyl-substituted tertiary amine (referred to as \u201cN-methyl diastereomer\u201d) was potent in displacing 3H-naltrexone from rat brain membranes, and acting as a morphine antagonist in the guinea-pig ileum. Conversely, diastereoisomers obtained by reacting N-methyl-substituted tertiary amines with allyl halide (referred to as \u201cN-allyl diastereomers\u201d) did not displace 3H-naltrexone and had negligible antagonist activity and slight agonist action in the guinea-pig ileum. In vivo findings were generally consistent with those in vitro. Thus only the \u201cN-methyl\u201d but not the \u201cN-allyl diastereomers\u201d inhibited morphine-induced constipation in rats and behaved as antagonists. The author stated that the prepared materials appeared to be pure by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, but these methods are not accurate. The author cites a literature reference for the assignment of the R configuration to the \u201cN-methyl diastereomer\u201d of nalorphine. No assignment is proposed for the levallorphan and naloxone diastereomers. It would be adventurous to extrapolate the configuration to these diastereomers (R. J. Kobylecki et al, J. Med. Chem. 25, 1278-1280, 1982)., 187008=1H NMR (300M Hz, CDCl3) \u03b4 6.82 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 6.67 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 4.69 (s, 1H), 3.21 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 3.12-2.96 (m, 2H), 2.93-2.82 (m, 1H), 2.71 (dd, J=4.5 Hz, 1H), 2.62 (dd, J=6.2 Hz, 1H), 2.48-2.28 (m, 4H), 2.19-2.10 (m, 1H), 1.93-1.86 (m, 1H), 1.68-1.59 (m, 2H), 1.34 (d, J=0.8 Hz, 3H, CH3-isobutyryl), 1.31 (d, J=0.8 Hz, 3H, CH3-isobutyryl), 0.90-0.83 (m, 1H, CH-cyclopropyl), 0.60-0.54 (m, 2H, CH2-cyclopropyl), 0.18-0.13 (m, 2H, CH2-cyclopropyl). 13C NMR (75.5 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 207.6 (CO), 174.7 (COO/Pr)147.8, 132.8, 130.1, 130.0, 122.8, 119.2, 90.5, 70.0, 61.9, 59.2, 50.6, 43.4, 36.1, 33.8, 31.2, 30.7, 22.9, 19.0, 18.9, 9.4, 4.0, 3.8.

Methylacrylates include those of molecular weight above 100,000 daltons based on, e.g. methylacrylate and methyl or ethyl methylacrylate in a ratio of about 1:1. Typical products include Endragit L, e.g. L 100-55, marketed by Rohm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany. Typical cellulose acetate phthalates have an acetyl content of 17-26% and a phthalate content of from 30-40% with a viscosity of ca. 45-90 cP. Typical cellulose acetate trimellitates have an acetyl content of 17-26%, a trimellityl content from 25-35% with a viscosity of ca. 15-20 cS. An example of a cellulose acetate trimellitate is the marketed product CAT (Eastman Kodak Company, USA). Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalates typically have a molecular weight of from 20,000 to 130,000 daltons, a hydroxypropyl content of from 5 to 10%, a methoxy content of from 18 to 24% and a phthalyl content from 21 to 35%. An example of a cellulose acetate phthalate is the marketed product CAP (Eastman Kodak, Rochester N.Y., USA). Examples of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalates are the marketed products having a hydroxypropyl content of from 6-10%, a methoxy content of from 20-24%, a phthalyl content of from 21-27%, a molecular weight of about 84,000 daltons, sold under the trademark HP50 and available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, and having a hydroxypropyl content, a methoxyl content, and a phthalyl content of 5-9%, 18-22% and 27-35%, respectively, and a molecular weight of 78,000 daltons, known under the trademark HP55 and available from the same supplier., 190351=N-Methylnaltrexone Bromide/Iodide salt (4). Compound (3) (862 mg, 1.56 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (13 ml). To this mixture was added sterile water (11.5 ml) followed by 48% aqueous hydrobromic acid (1.5 ml). The resultant mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated in an oil bath at 64-65\ufffd C. for 6.5 hr. TLC analysis of a sample (dispersed in methanol) of the reaction mixture showed no starting material (3) remaining (Rf=0.4) and conversion to material at Rf=0-0.15. The mixture was concentrated on the rotary evaporator with the bath at 22-25\ufffd C. until approximately 1 ml of oily liquid remained. Acetonitrile (10 ml) was added and the mixture was reconcentrated. This was repeated a further three times, using 10 ml of acetonitrile, to give a ginger colored crisp foam (590 mg, 86% crude yield)., 207378=The disclosures of all patents, patent applications and scientific publications cited or referenced herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety, including the co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

The foam (4) (597 mg) was dispersed in water (6 ml)/methanol (2 ml). Some dark oil remained undissolved. The clear supernatant liquid was decanted and applied to the prepared anion exchange resin column. The residue was washed twice with methanol (0.2 ml)/water (3 ml). The supernatant liquors were applied to the column. The column was eluted with 4.2 L of sterile water and fractions of \u02dc20 ml were collected. The presence of N-Methylnaltrexone salt was detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The majority of N-Methylnaltrexone was located in the initial 1.5 L of eluate of which the first 600 ml contained the most pure material by TLC (4:1 dichloromethane/methanol, normal phase silica). The first 600 ml of eluate was combined and concentrated on the rotary evaporator to give a whitish glass. The water bath was maintained at \u02dc35\ufffd C. Care was needed to control foaming of the eluate while evaporating., 158373=Lotions, which, for example, may be in the form of a suspension, dispersion or emulsion, contain an effective concentration of one or more of the compounds.
