Furthermore, the USDA Economic Research Service has recently reported that the annual cost of the food-borne illnesses caused by six common bacterial pathogens, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus, ranges from 2.9 billion to 6.7 billion dollars (Food Institute Report, USDA, AER, December, 1996). The foods most likely to cause these illnesses are animal products such as red meat, poultry and eggs, seafood, and dairy products., 39302=In another preferred embodiment, testing incorporates phase sensitive or phase lock (lockin) techniques. Testing in this manner allows quantitative measurements to be made in real time and in ambient light conditions, without using a light-tight testing chamber. The skilled practitioner will recognize that other spectroscopic techniques such as boxcar or gated integration techniques may also be used. In accordance with phase sensitive techniques, the excitation light is modulated at a predetermined frequency, for example, by mechanically chopping the light beam with a spinning wheel. Or, the excitation source may be light emitting diodes controlled by high frequency pulse generators. This modulated excitation source will in turn yield fluorescence from a contaminated carcass that is modulated at the same frequency. The fluorescence signals emitted from the carcass are then selectively detected at the same frequency as the modulated excitation light; only emitted fluorescent light at the same frequency is detected and amplified. Hence, no fluorescence signals due to stray or ambient light are detected. A detailed description of phase sensitive spectroscopic techniques which are suitable for use herein may be found, for example, in Horowitz and Hill (The Art of Electronics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 628-631), Shoemaker et al. (Experiments in Physical Chemistry, 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, p. 737), Zanowsky (1996, Laser Focus World, 32:135-137), Ingle and Crouch (Spectrochemical Analysis, Prentice-Hall, New York, 1988, especially at pp. 125, 410, and 526), Fleming (Chemical Applications of Ultrafast Spectroscopy (Oxford Press, New York, 1986, especially at chapter 3), and Schreiber (1986, Photosynthesis Research, 9:261-272), the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is understood that the foregoing detailed description is given merely by way of illustration and that modifications and variations may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. A solid portion of fresh chicken (a drumstick) was intentionally contaminated at a small spot thereon with chicken feces and placed into a light-tight imaging chamber fitted with a CCD camera. The camera was linked to a computer that contained computer imaging software (CHEM IMAGER 4000, AlphaInnotech Corp., San Leandro, Calif.). The amount of ingesta placed onto the drumstick was too dilute to be seen with the naked eye using ambient light. The chamber was closed and the meat sample was then illuminated with an excitation light (actinic blue aquarium light, Energy Savers Unlimited Inc., Harbor City, Calif.) fitted with a 430 nm (10 nm bandpass) optical filter (CVI Laser Corp., Albuquerque, N. Mex.). The fluorescent light emitted from the chicken sample and associated contamination was observed and saved as a computer file using the CCD camera/computer/software package. The camera which was fitted with replaceable 610 nm (10 nm bandpass) and 670 nm (10 nm bandpass) optical filters was used to capture fluorescent images given off from the sample. The imaging software was also used to subtract the 610 nm image from the 670 nm image. Under these conditions, a photo was produced that showed a white spot contrasted against a black",
