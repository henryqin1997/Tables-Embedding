In other words, the balloon in the distal regions of the catheter moves more definitely (in a 1:1 relationship) with motions imparted at the catheter's proximal end by a physician to actually \"sense\" the pathway of the catheter's track. This improved responsiveness gives valuable information to the physician regarding the passage of the catheter to and through the lesions. The catheter is thus extremely responsive to the doctor's controlling movement of the catheter from its proximal end, while at the same time having a relatively small profile and enhancing catheter visualization via fluoroscopy., 20396=This is a continuation of application(s) Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The inventive catheter disclosed herein is a catheter structure with a short distal guide wire lumen. The use of a hypotube-type main shaft for the catheter allows the attainment of a high strength, flexible shaft having thin walls and a small diameter. The core member provides the catheter with sufficient pushability in its distal catheter section from the hypotube main shaft to the short distal guide wire lumen on the distal tip of the catheter, distally of any interoperative portions or members on the catheter. The core member also provides a more gradual transition between the relatively stiff main catheter shaft and the relatively flexible distal section of the catheter shaft. The distal shaft section has good pushability while still being quite trackable. The inventive catheter of the present invention has the ability to track a path already established by a guide wire within a patient's vasculature while being quite pushable and trackable. The inventive catheter allows for easy exchanges in a single-operator angioplasty device. Conclusion Another embodiment of the tip body of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 19. This embodiment again employs a coil to define the guide wire lumen of",
