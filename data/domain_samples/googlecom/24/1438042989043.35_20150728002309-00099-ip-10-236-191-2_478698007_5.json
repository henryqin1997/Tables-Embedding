The circuit 1000 includes an oscillator section 1002, an LED driver section 1004, a receiver section 1006, and a driver and filter section 1008.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44821=A wick of the present invention may be of any desired wick material, such as, for example, a porous/sintered plastics or polymers, such as ultra-density or ultra-high-density polyethylene and polypropylene, bonded fibers, glass sintered fibers, ceramic materials, carbon fibers, sintered carbon, wood, metal foams, compressed wood composites, bundled fibers, woven material fibers, natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and the like. Examples of natural fibers useful in the present invention include cotton and linen. Examples of synthetic fibers useful in the present invention include nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyesters, polyamides, rayon, and polyacetates. Examples of wick materials useful in the present invention are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0136886. One consideration in the selection of the wick material used in a diffuser of the present invention is the temperature required for the volatilization of the active material selected and the temperature tolerance of the wick material. For example, ceramic has a high temperature tolerance, while natural fibers generally have a lower temperature tolerance. The ability to tailor pore size to address wicking rates and fouling is also a consideration when selecting the wick material. Mixtures and combinations of the above wick materials may also be used in the present invention. A container of the present invention may also include one or more wicks of the same or different wick material. Optionally, the wick of the present invention may be surrounded by a plastic shield to protect components of the diffuser from contact with the liquid active material contained in the wick., 82927=In operation, the oscillator section 1002 produces a square wave at a particular frequency of, for example, 8.5 kHz. This square wave is applied to the gate electrode of the transistor Q1 causing the transistor Q1 to turn on and off at such frequency. The LED1 is thereby energized at a rapid rate with the current therethrough being limited by the resistor R6. When the light produced by the LED1, which may be visible light or infrared light is detected by the optical transistor REC1, the optical transistor REC1 turns on and off at the oscillator frequency, thereby producing an AC waveform at the junction between the resistor R7 and the capacitor C2. The capacitor C2 removes any DC component that may be present in such signal and passes the resulting signal to the inverting input of the op-amp 1012. The op-amp 1012 compares the signal at the inverting input with the DC voltage at the non-inverting input thereof as established by the setting of the potentiometer R10 and the values of the resistances R11 and R12. The result of the comparison is then applied through the RC filter including the resistor R13 and the capacitor C3, which causes a high state signal to be applied to the gate of the transistor Q2. This condition, in turn, causes the transistor Q2 to conduct, thereby causing current to flow through the LED2 and the resistor R15 through the source and drain of the transistor Q2 to ground potential. In addition, the voltage at the source electrode of the transistor Q2 drops to a very low potential (substantially zero volts), in turn causing the transistor Q3 to turn off and preventing current flow through the LED3. Thus, when the light emitted by the LED1 is received by the optical transistor REC1, the LED2 is on and the LED3 is off., 79627=The oscillator section 1002 includes a first op-amp 1010 having an inverting input coupled through a capacitor C1 to ground potential. A resistor R1 is coupled between an output of the op-amp 1010 and the inverting input thereof. A further resistor R2 is coupled between the output of the op-amp 1010 and a non-inverting input thereof. The non-inverting input of the op-amp 1010 is further coupled to a junction between biasing resistors R3 and R4 that are, in turn, coupled between a voltage Vcc and ground potential. In addition to the foregoing, a resistor R5 is coupled between the output of the op-amp 1010 and the voltage Vcc., 81621=The driver and filter section 1008 includes a resistor R13 coupled between an output of the op-amp 1012 and a junction between a resistor R14 and a capacitor C3. The resistor R14 and capacitor C3 are coupled across the voltage Vcc and ground., 80756=The receiver circuit section 1006 includes a resistor R7 coupled between the voltage Vcc and a collector electrode of the optical transistor REC1. A drain electrode of the optical transistor REC1 is coupled to ground potential. A capacitor C2 is coupled between the collector electrode of the optical transistor REC1 and an inverting input of a further op-amp 1012. The inverting input of the op-amp 1012 is further coupled to a voltage divider comprising resistors R8 and R9 that are coupled between the voltage Vcc and ground potential. A non-inverting input of the op-amp 1012 is coupled through a potentiometer RIO in series with further resistors RM1 and RM2 across the voltage Vcc and ground potential., 80398=The driver section 1004 includes a transistor in the form of a MOSFET Q1 having source and drain electrodes coupled to a cathode electrode of LED1 and ground potential, respectively. A current limiting resistor R6 is coupled between the voltage Vcc and an anode terminal of LED1., 84935=Conversely, when the light developed by LED1 does not reach the optical transistor REC1, no AC signal is produced at the junction between the resistor R7 and the capacitor C2. As a result, the output of the op-amp 1012 is in a low state, thereby turning off the transistor Q2 and allowing the voltage at the gate of the transistor Q3 to rise to a high level. Because the transistor Q3 is a high impedance device, substantially no current flows through the LED2 at this time, and hence LED2 is turned off. Current does flow, however, between the source and drain of the transistor Q3, thereby illuminating LED3., 92264=The construction of the diffusers and housings, as described herein, is not critical. In fact, the light emitters, light receivers, and/or sensors of the embodiments as described herein may advantageously be incorporated into the housing of virtually any device that uses a refill or replaceable container, including for example, a diffuser for dispensing fragrance and/or insecticide.
