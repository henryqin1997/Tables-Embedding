It is therefore intended that the following claims be interpreted as covering all such alterations and modification as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. , the start-of-file is designated at sector 0 at 102 and remaining sectors of the file are stored in following sector locations, such as sector 1 104 and sector 2 106. However the next sector location, sector 3 10 has been adversely affected or corrupted by a power failure, thus, a new file will be stored starting from 110. FIG. 6 Illustratively, in Additionally, when there are more than one power failures in a media, there may be more than one corrupted sector and thus the system must verify all locations and where new file locations are started and ended. In other words, the system can maintain a table of corrupted files in a spare area so that after power-up, the system can identify and map the corrupted files thereby preventing their use for future storage. If the particular sector has been determined to be corrupted, the next sector is read and if all of the data in the next sector is in a non-programmable state, i.e. all 0's or all",
