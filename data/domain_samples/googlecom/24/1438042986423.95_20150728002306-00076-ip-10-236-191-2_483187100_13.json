Two upstream ATG's in the 5\u2032-noncoding sequence of the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase cDNA were removed and the Kozak sequence were modified as follows. Two fragments from pAD98, which was the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase ct/p cDNA cloned into pcDNA3.1(+), were excised. A 1068 bp XhoI-PstI fragment and a 9746 bp NheI-XhoI fragment were ligated with oligonucleotides with sequences 5\u2032-CTAGCCACCATGGGGTTCAAGCTCTTGCA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:40) and 5\u2032-AGAGCTTGAACCCCATGGTGG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:41) generating pAD105. The poly A sequence near the 3\u2032 end of the cDNA clone was removed by ligating a NheI-BglII fragment from the cDNA with NheI-BamHI cut vector pcDNA3.1(+) generating pAD128., 134685=DNA sequencing of pAD128 identified deletion of an A in an AAAAA sequence (positions 2761-2765 shown in SEQ ID NO:4) that disrupted the coding sequence. Plasmid pAD130 was constructed in an attempt to correct this by ligating a 5929 bp NheI-MfeI fragment and a 2736 bp NheI-AgeI fragment (both from pAD128 with a 515 bp MfeI-AgeI fragment derived from pAD124). Plasmid pAD130 was then grown and subsequent sequencing of plasmid pAD130 demonstrated that the AAAAA sequence had reverted to AAAA again indicating instability in the sequence at this point., 80724=The protein, nucleotide, and EST data bases were searched for sequences that matched these peptide sequences and several human and mouse ESTs were found that had the sequence of the third peptide at their amino termini. Three human infant brain EST clones and one mouse embryo clone were obtained from ATCC and sequenced. The three human clones were all identical except for total length at their 3\u2032 ends and virtually identical to the mouse clone, except that the mouse EST contained a 102 bp region that was absent from all three human brain ESTs. An EcoRI-HindIII fragment of about 700 bp was excised from the human cDNA clone (ATCC # 367524) and used to probe a human liver cDNA library directionally cloned in TriplEx vector (Clontech). Of the positive clones isolated from the library and converted to plasmids (pTriplEx), the largest (2200 bp) was represented by clone 6.5 which was used for the rest of the analysis., 63546=GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was determined to be a complex of six polypeptides with a subunit structure \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32. FIG. 1 shows a model of the subunit structure obtained from quantitative amino acid sequencing, immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies, SDS-PAGE, and cDNA sequences. The evidence for the model is summarized below. The molecular mass of the complex estimated by gel filtration is 570,000 Daltons. The 166,000 Dalton \u03b1-subunit is found as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Likewise, the 51,000 Dalton \u03b3-subunit is found as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Because both the \u03b1- and \u03b3-subunits are found in disulfide-linked homodimers, each molecule must contain at least one \u03b1- and one \u03b3 homodimer. Although the 56,000 Dalton \u03b2-subunit is not found in a disulfide-linked homodimer, two independent lines of evidence strongly suggest each complex contains two \u03b2-subunits as well. First, quantitative aminoterminal sequencing demonstrates a 1:1 molar ratio between the \u03b2- and \u03b3-subunits. Secondly, since the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits are encoded by a single cDNA and divided by proteolytic processing, two \u03b2-subunits are produced for each \u03b1-subunit dimer. The predicted mass of the complex based on the composition \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32 is 546,000 Daltons (2\ufffd166,000+2\ufffd56,000+2\ufffd51,000) in excellent agreement with the mass estimated by gel filtration., 94700=Mammalian or insect host cell culture systems well known in the art could also be employed to express recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase or phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase polypeptides, e.g., Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells (Luckow and Summers, Bio/Technology 6:47 (1988)) or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for mammalian expression may be used. Transcriptional and translational control sequences for mammalian host cell expression vectors may be excised from viral genomes. Commonly used promoter sequences and enhancer sequences are derived from Polyoma virus, Adenovirus 2, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and human cytomegalovirus. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome may be used to provide other genetic elements for expression of a structural gene sequence in a mammalian host cell, e.g., SV40 origin, early and late promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites. Viral early and late promoters are particularly useful because both are easily obtained from a viral genome as a fragment which may also contain a viral origin of replication. Exemplary expression vectors for use in mammalian host cells are well known in the art., 169039=Human acid \u03b1-glucosidase at 10 mg/ml was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2 mM UDP-GlcNAc with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase at 100,000 u/mL at 37\ufffd C. for 2 hours. Phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase, 1000 u/mL was then added and the incubation continued for another 2 hours. The acid \u03b1-glucosidase was then repurified by chromatography on Q-Sepharose, and step elution with NaCl., 103963=The extent of mannose 6-phosphate modification of two different lysosomal enzymes has been published. The oligosaccharide composition of human \u03b1-galactosidase A secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells has been published (Matsuura, F., Ohta, M., Ioannou, Y. A., and Desnick, R. I. (1998). \u201cHuman alpha-galactosidase A: characterization of the N-linked oligosaccharides on the intracellular and secreted glycoforms overexpressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells.\u201d Glycobiology 8(4): 329-39). Of all oligosaccharides on \u03b1-gal A released by hydrazinolysis, only 5.2% were bis-phosphorylated. Zhao et al. partially characterized the oligosaccharide structures on recombinant human \u03b1-iduronidase secreted by CHO cells (Zhao, K. W., Faull, K. F., Kakkis, E. D., and Neufeld, E. F. (1997). \u201cCarbohydrate structures of recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells.\u201d J Biol Chem 272(36): 22758-65) and demonstrated a minority of the oligosaccharides were bisphosphorylated. The qualitative techniques utilized precluded the determination of the fraction of oligosaccharides phosphorylated., 34974=This application is a Divisional application of Ser. No. 09/635,872 filed Aug. 10, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,300 which claims the benefit of Ser. No. 60/153,831 filed Sep. 14, 1999., 94267=Yeast transformation protocols are known to those of skill in the art. One such protocol is described by Hinnen et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 75:1929 (1978). The Hinnen protocol selects for Trp.sup.+transformants in a selective medium, wherein the selective medium consists of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose, 10 \u03bcg/ml adenine, and 20 \u03bcg/ml uracil., 114496=In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases by administering a disease treating amount of the highly phosphorylated lysosomal hydrolases of the present invention to a patient suffering from the corresponding lysosomal storage disease. While dosages may vary depending on the disease and the patient, the enzyme is generally administered to the patient in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 1000 milligrams per 50 kg of patient per month, preferably from about 1 to about 500 milligrams per 50 kg of patient per month. The highly phosphorylated enzymes of the present invention are more efficiently taken into the cell and the lysosome than the naturally occurring or less phosphorylated enzymes and are therefore effective for the treatment of the disease. Within each disease, the severity and the age at which the disease presents may be a function of the amount of residual lysosomal enzyme that exists in the patient. As such, the present method of treating lysosomal storage diseases includes providing the highly phosphorylated lysosomal hydrolases at any or all stages of disease progression., 109419=In a preferred embodiment, the lysosomal hydrolase at 10 mg/ml is incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2 mM UDP-GlcNAc with GlcNAc phosphotransferase at 100,000 units/mL at 37\ufffd C. for 2 hours. Phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase, 1000 units/mL, is then added and the incubation continued for another 2 hours. The modified enzyme is then repurified by chromatography on Q-Sepharose and step elution with NaCl., 81925=There is a unique BamH I site at base #512 and a unique Hind ID site at base # 1581. All three bovine peptide sequences (peptides 1, 2, and 3) were found. Although the sequences of peptides 2 and 3 in the human are 100% identical to the bovine sequences, the amino-terminal peptide in humans is only 67% identical to the bovine sequence. The human liver clone contains the 102 base pair insert that has the characteristics of an alternatively spliced segment that was missing in the human brain EST. The hydrophilicity plot indicates the presence of a hydrophobic membrane spanning region from amino acids 448 to 474 and another hydrophobic region from amino acid 8 to 24 which fits the motif for a signal sequence and there is a likely signal sequence cleavage site between G24 and G25. There are six Asn-X-Ser/Thr potential N-linked glycosylation sites, one of which is within the 102 bp insert. All of these sites are amino terminal of the putative trans-membrane region. These features indicate that the phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase is a type I membrane spanning glycoprotein with the amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi and the carboxyl terminus in the cytosol. This orientation is different from that of other glycosyltransferases and glycosidases involved in glycoprotein processing, which to date have been shown to be type II membrane spanning proteins., 147570=The human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase 7-subunit precursor cDNA was obtained from plasmid pAD133 in pAC5.1/V5-His by cutting with EcoRI. This cDNA was inserted into EcoRI digested pcDNA6/V5/His-A to form plasmid pMK17 containing cDNA as shown in SEQ ID NO:5. Plasmid pMK17 was digested with MluI (position 124-129 as shown in SEQ ID NO:5) and EcoRI (position 1103-1108 as shown in SEQ ID NO:5) and the 980 bp MluI-EcoRI fragment was then subcloned in pBluescriptKSII(+) with a synthetic double stranded cassette having an HindIII site and a MluI site flanking a nucleotide sequence including positions corresponding to 95-123 as shown in SEQ ID NO:5 thereby removing the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino terminal, 24-amino acid signal peptide in plasmid pMK26. Plasmid pMK26 was sequenced to ensure its sequence. The correct cDNA from pMK26, which encodes amino acids for the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase \u03b3 subunit with the signal peptide removed, is then excised from pMK26 by HindIII and EcoRI digestion and placed into plasminds pMK43 to form pMK58; pMK44 to form pMK59, and into pMK45 to form pMK64, plasmids capable of encoding the \u03b3 subunit of human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with its signal peptide deleted, with different signal peptides and all having the HPC4 epitope tag to facilitate purification of the soluble, \u03b3 subunit., 162824=For expression and purification of the enzyme, a modified expression plasmid is constructed in a modified expression vector derived from the pEE14.1 vector (Lonza Biologics). The plasmid directs the synthesis of a soluble epitope tagged phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase molecule. The phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase precursor is modified as follows: The 3\u2032 portion of the cDNA (1342-1548 of SEQ ID NO: 7) which encodes the phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was deleted and replaced with nucleotide sequence GAGGACCAGGTGGACCCCAGGCTGATCCAC GGCAAGGAT (SEQ ID NO:51) that encodes the epitope for monoclonal antibody HPC4 (EDQVDPRLIDGKD (SEQ ID NO:52)) followed by a stop codon., 93101=Yeasts useful as host cells in the present invention include those from the genus Saccharomyces, Pichia, K. Actinomycetes and Kluyveromyces. Yeast vectors will often contain an origin of replication sequence from a 2\u03bc yeast plasmid, an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a promoter region, sequences for polyadenylation, sequences for transcription termination, and a selectable marker gene. Suitable promoter sequences for yeast vectors include, among others, promoters for metallothionein, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255:2073, (1980)) or other glycolytic enzymes (Holland et al., Biochem. 17:4900, (1978)) such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvatee decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Other suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in Fleer et al., Gene, 107:285-195 (1991). Other suitable promoters and vectors for yeast and yeast transformation protocols are well known in the art., 137291=Plasmid pMK19 was digested with BglII (cutting at positions 255 and 2703 shown in SEQ ID NO:20) and self-ligated to reduce the length of the cDNA to be amplified from approx. 3.5 kb to 1 kb so that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the cDNA can be modified by PCR to remove the transmembrane domains of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and used to construct expression vectors to produce soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. This plasmid was designated pMK21. The strategy is that the nucleotides encoding the first 44 amino acids containing the transmembrane domain of the \u03b1 subunit (nucleotides 1-132 of SEQ ID NO:20) are replaced with a HindIII site, and nucleotides encoding the last 47 amino acids containing the transmembrane domain of the \u03b2 subunit (nucleotides 3628-3768 of SEQ ID NO:21) are replaced with a stop codon and a XbaI site., 138163=Plasmid pMK21 was used as a template for PCR with the following primers: A forward primer (5\u2032-TGGTTCTGAAGCTTAGCCGAGATCAATACCATG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:44), oligo TTI 76) containing a HindIII site (underlined) and a sequence complementary to nucleotides 133 to 151 of SEQ ID NO:20 (italics), which will produce the 5\u2032-end of a PCR fragment that removes the coding sequence of the first 44 amino acids comprising the putative transmembrane domain of the \u03b1 subunit. A reverse primer (5\u2032-TAGTACACTCTAGActactaCTTCAATTTGTCTCGATAAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:45), oligo TTI 78) containing a XbaI site (underlined), two stop codons (lower case) and a sequence complementary to nucleotides 3608 to 3627 of SEQ ID NO:21 (italics), which will produce the 3\u2032-end of a PCR fragment that removes the coding sequence of the last 47 amino acids comprising the putative transmembrane domain of the \u03b2 subunit and replaces it with two stop codons. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript KS II+(Stratagene). This plasmid, designated pMK42, was sequenced to ensure no errors were introduced by PCR. The BglII-BglII fragment (positions 255-2703 shown in SEG ID NO:20) which was previously removed was subcloned back into the BglII site of pMK42. The orientation of this fragment was determined to be correct and this plasmid was designated pMK49. Thus, plasmid pMK49 contained a cDNA comprising a 5\u2032 HindIII site and a 3\u2032 XbaI site flanking a coding region for the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase \u03b1/\u03b2 subunits precursor cDNA with the \u03b1 subunit putative transmembrane domain deleted and the putative transmembrane domain of the \u03b2 subunit replaced with two stop codons (soluble \u03b1/\u03b2-cDNA)., 135257=In order to eliminate this instability the first AAA (position 2761-2763 shown in SEQ ID NO:4) that codes for lysine was changed to AAG (also coding for lysine) so that the unstable AAAAA sequence was changed to a stable AAGAA without altering the encoded amino acid. Plasmid pAD130 was corrected by removing a 214 bp MfeI-DraIII fragment and replacing it with a fragment with the correct sequence. The correct MfeI-DraIII fragment was prepared by PCR using pAD130 as a template with forward primer 5\u2032-GAAGACACAATTGGCATACTTCACTGATAGCAAGAATACTGGGAGGC AACTAAAAGATAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:42) (oligo TTI 25 with desired AAGAA sequence as underlined) and reverse primer 5\u2032-ACTGCATATCCTCAGAATGG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:43) (oligo TTI 24). The PCR fragment was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript KS II(+) (Stratagene) generating pMK16. The insert was sequenced for confirmation and the 215 bp MfeI-DraIII fragment was prepared. To avoid MfeI-DraIII sites on the vector pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen), the NheI-XbaI fragment was prepared from pAD130 and subcloned into the XbaI site of pUC19 (Life Technologies) to construct pMK15. pMK15 was cleaved with MfeI and DraIII and the 6317 bp fragment was purified and ligated with the MfeI-DraIII fragment from pMK16 to form pMK19 containing the desired stable sequence in pUC19., 68372=The nucleotide sequence for the human \u03b1/\u03b2-subunit precursor cDNA is shown in nucleotides 165-3932 of SEQ ID NO:4; the nucleotide sequence for the \u03b1-subunit is shown in nucleotides 165-2948 of SEQ ID NO:4; the nucleotide sequence for the \u03b2-subunit is shown in nucleotides 2949-3932 of SEQ ID NO:4; and the nucleotide sequence for the \u03b3-subunit is shown in nucleotides 96-941 of SEQ ID NO:5. The nucleotide sequence for the \u03b3-subunit signal peptide is shown in nucleotides 24-95 of SEQ ID NO:5., 163537=This expression vector was constructed by generating two intermediate plasmids and ligating a fragment from each into pEE14.1 vector (Lonza Biologics) to yield the final expression vector. The first intermediate plasmid designated pKB4 was constructed by ligating the 1034 bp FseI>>Bsu36I fragment of phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase (lacking the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) from clone 6.5, and a Bsu36I-XbaI oligonucleotide fragment that contains the HPC4 epitope into a modified pUC19 vector. The second intermediate plasmid designated pKB5, was constructed by ligating a 850 bp MluI-NcoI fragment containing a modified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter from pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen), a 256 bp BseI-FseI fragment encoding the N-terminus of human phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase from clone 6.5, and an oligonucleotide linker into a modified pUC19 vector. The final expression vector designated pKB6 was constructed by ligating the MluI-FseI fragment from pKB5, and the FseI-HindIII fragment from pKB4 into a MluI/HindIII digested pEE14.1 vector. The plasmid pKB6 contains the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:22., 61517=To obtain isolated and purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and its subunits and the nucleic acid molecules encoding the enzyme according to the present invention, bovine GlcNAc phosphotransferase was obtained and analyzed as follows. Splenocytes from mice immunized with a partially purified preparation of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were fused with myeloma cells to generate a panel of hybridomas. Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies specific for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were identified by immunocapture assay. In this assay, antibodies which could capture GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from a crude source were identified by assay of immunoprecipitates with a specific GlcNAc-phosphotransferase enzymatic assay. Hybridomas were subcloned twice, antibody produced in ascites culture, coupled to a solid support and evaluated for immunoaffinity chromatography. Monoclonal PT18-Emphaze was found to allow a single step purification of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase to homogeneity. Bao, et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 271, Number 49, Issue of Dec. 6, 1996, pp. 31437-31445 relates to a method for the purification of bovine UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:Lysosomal-enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase and proposes a hypothetical subunit structure for the protein. Bao, et. al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 271, Number 49, Issue of Dec. 6, 1996, pp. 31446-31451. Using this technique, the enzyme was purified 488,000-fold in 29% yield. The eluted GlcNAc-phosphotransferase has a specific activity of >106, preferably >5\ufffd106, more preferably >12\ufffd106 pmol/h/mg and is apparently a homogenous, multi-subunit enzyme based on silver-stained SDS-PAGE. The monoclonal antibody labeled PT18 was selected for use in further experiments. A hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibody PT 18 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 Univerisity Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110 and assigned ATCC Accession No. PTA-2432., 83310=The amino acid sequence for the phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase monomer is shown in amino acids 50-515 of SEQ ID NO:6. The signal peptide is shown in amino acids 1-24 of SEQ ID NO:6 and the pro segment is shown in amino acids 25-49 of SEQ ID NO:6. The human cDNA was cloned using the techniques described above. The nucleotide sequence for the monomer that associates to form the phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase tetramer is shown in nucleotides 151-1548 of SEQ ID NO:7. The nucleotide sequence for the signal sequence is shown in nucleotides 1-72 of SEQ ID NO:7. The nucleotide sequence for the propeptide is shown in nucleotides 73-150 of SEQ ID NO:7., 65830=The ineffectiveness of RNAse B, which contains a single high mannose oligosaccharide, as an acceptor is especially notable since the Km was not reached at the solubility limit of the protein (at 600 \u03bcm). This data clearly demonstrates the specific phosphorylation of Lysosomal hydrolases previously observed with crude preparations (Waheed, Pohlmann A., R., et al. (1982). \u201cDeficiency of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine-1phosphotransferase in organs of I-Cell patients.\u201d Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 105(3): 1052-10580 is a property of the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase itself., 84488=The human phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase gene has been identified by database searching. The sequence was determined during the sequencing of clone 165E7 from chromosome 16.13.3, GenBank AC007011.1, gi4371266. Interestingly, the phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase gene was not identified by the SCAN program used to annotate the sequence., 40147=The synthesis of lysosomal enzymes having exposed M6P is catalyzed by two different enzymes, both of which are essential if the synthesis is to occur. The first enzyme is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (\u201cGlcNAc-phosphotransferase\u201d) (E.C. 2.7.8.17). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to the 6 position of \u03b11,2-linked mannoses on the lysosonial enzyme. The recognition and addition of N-acetylgluocosamine-1-phosphate to lysosomal hydrolases by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is the critical and determining step in lysosomal targeting. The second step is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester \u03b1-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (\u201cphosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase\u201d) (E.C. 3.1.4.45). Phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase catalyzes the removal of N-Acetylglucosamine from the GlcNAc-phosphate modified lysosomal enzyme to generate a terminal M6P on the lysosomal enzyme. Preliminary studies of these enzymes have been conducted. Bao et al., in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 271, Number 49, Issue of Dec. 6, 1996, pp. 31437-31445, relates to a method for the purification of bovine UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: Lysosomal enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase and proposes a hypothetical subunit structure for the protein. Bao et al., in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 271, Number 49, Issue of Dec. 6, 1996, pp. 31446-31451, relates to the enzymatic characterization and identification of the catalytic subunit for bovine UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: Lysosomal enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. Kornfeld et al., in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 273, Number 36, Issue of Sep. 4, 1998, pp. 23203-23210, relates to the purification and multimeric structure of bovine N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester \u03b1-N-Acetylglucosaminidase. However, the proprietary monoclonal antibodies required to isolate these proteins have not been made available to others and the protein sequences for the enzymes used in these preliminary studies have not been disclosed., 158447=The human phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase gene was identified by searching the NCBI database nr with the human phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase cDNA using the program blastn. The genomic sequence was determined during the sequencing of a clone from chromosome 16p13.3 and deposited Mar. 6, 1999 in GenBank as an unidentified sequence of 161264 bp with the accession number AC007011. The gene spans about 12 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 16.13 and is arranged in 11 exons., 37905=Lysosomal Storage diseases have been studied extensively and the enzymes (or lack thereof) responsible for particular diseases have been identified (Scriver, Beaudet, Sly, and Vale, eds., The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, 6th Edition, 1989, Lysosomal Enzymes, Part 11, Chapters 61-72, pp. 1565-1839). Within each disease, the severity and the age at which the disease presents may be a function of the amount of residual lysosomal enzyme that exists in the patient., 74237=Following a second intravenous boost with phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase, the spleen was removed and splenocytes fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells according to our modifications (Bag, M., Booth J. L., et al. (1996). \u201cBovine UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. I. Purification and subunit structure.\u201d Journal of Biological Chemistry 271: 31437-31445) of standard techniques; Harlow, E. and Lane, D. (1988). Antibodies: a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The fusion was plated in eight 96-well plates in media supplemented with recombinant human IL-6 (Bazin, R. and Lemieux, R. (1989). \u201cIncreased proportion of B cell hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies of desired specificity in cultures containing macrophage-derived hybridoma growth factor (IL-6).\u201d Journal of Immunological Methods 116: 245-249) and grown until hybridomas were just visible. Forty-eight pools of 16-wells were constructed and assayed for antiphosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase activity using the capture assay. Four pools were positive. Subpools of 4-wells were then constructed from the wells present in the positive 16-well pools. Three of the four 16-well pools contained a single 4-well pool with anti-phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase activity. The 4 single wells making up the 4-well pools were then assayed individually identifying the well containing the anti-phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase secreting hybridomas. Using the capture assay, each hybridoma was subcloned twice and antibody prepared by ascites culture. Monoclonals UC2 and UC3 were found to be low affinity antibodies. UC1, a high affinity IgG monoclonal antibody, was prepared by ascites culture and immobilized on Emphaze for purification of phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase. The monoclonal antibody labeled UC1 was selected for use in further experiments. A hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibody UC1 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 Univerisity Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110 and assigned ATCC Accession No. PTA 2431., 129839=The \u03b3-subunit amino terminal and tryptic peptide sequences were used to search the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base using the program tblastn. Altschul, S. F., Gish W., et al. (1990). \u201cBasic Local Alignment Search Tool.\u201d Journal of Molecular Biology 215: 403-10. Three human EST sequences were identified which were highly homologous to the determined bovine protein sequences. cDNA clone 48250 from which EST sequence 280314 was determined was obtained from Genome Systems and sequenced using standard techniques. This clone contained a 1191 bp insert which contained all the determined protein sequences and appeared to contain a signal sequence 5\u2032 of the determined amino terminal sequence. The clone however lacked an initiator methionine or any 5\u2032 non-coding sequence. The 5\u2032 portion of the cDNA was obtained by PCR. the reverse primer 5\u2032GCGAAGATGAAGGTGGTGGAGGACC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:37) and a T7 promoter primer were used in a reaction along with template DNA from a human brain cDNA library in pCMV-SPORT(GIBCO). A 654 bp product was obtained, cloned in pCR2.1 and sequenced. The sequence demonstrated the amplified product contained 23 bp of 5\u2032 non-coding sequence, the initiator methionine and the signal peptide identified in EST 280314. A full length cDNA for the \u03b3-subunit (pBC36) was assembled by ligating a 75 bp EcoRI-ApaI fragment from the cloned PCR product, an ApaI-NotI fragment from clone 48250 and EcoRI-NotI cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)., 108666=Methods for treating any particular lysosomal hydrolase with the enzymes of the present invention are within the skill of the artisan. Generally, the lysosomal hydrolase at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml and GlcNAc-phosphotransferase at a concentration of about 100,000 units/mL are incubated at about 37\ufffd C. for 2 hours in the presence of a buffer that maintains the pH at about 6-7 and any stabilizers or coenzymes required to facilitate the reaction. Then, phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase is added to the system to a concentration of about 1000 units/mL and the system is allowed to incubate for about 2 more hours. The modified lysosomal enzyme having highly phosphorylated oligosaccharides is then recovered by conventional means., 127449=The amino-terminal protein sequence determined from the isolated bovine \u03b2-subunit was used to search the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base using the program tblastn. Altschul, S. F., Gish W., et al. (1990). \u201cBasic Local Alignment Search Tool.\u201d Journal of Molecular Biology 215: 403-410.

Spleens of immune mice were removed and spenocytes fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells according to Harlow (Harrow, E. and Lane, D. (1988). Antibodies: a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The fusion was plated into 96 well plates and cultured in HAT media until hybridomas were visible., 159129=An expression vector for human phosphodiester \u03b1-GlcNAcase was prepared as follows: The 5\u2032 end of the sequence of clone 6.5 was modified by PCR amplification of the 5\u2032 end of the cDNA with a forward primer with the sequence 5\u2032-GGAATTCCACCATGGCGACCTCCACGGGTCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:49) and a reverse primer 5\u2032-TGACCAGGGTCCCGTCGCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:49). This served to add a consensus Kozak sequence and initiator methionine to the sequence of clone 6.5. The \u02dc500 bp PCR product was purified, digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into pcDNA3.1(\u2212) which was sequenced. This construct was then digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated with a \u02dc1600 bp BamHI-HindIII fragment containing the 3\u2032 portion of the cDNA from clone 6.5 generating the full length expression plasmid., 183092=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional application No. 60/153,831 filed Sep. 14, 1999, and is incorporated herein by reference.}",
