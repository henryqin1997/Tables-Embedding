The wall height was 6 \u03bcm. The deposition angle was 20\ufffd. Optical examination indicated clear gaps between the Mg:Ag lines and resistance measurements showed complete electrical isolation of adjacent lines., 49465=For pixels of relatively shorter edge lengths the ratio of wall height to width becomes important, as the walls in these applications account for a larger percentage of total pixel area. Ratios of wall height to width in the range of from 5:1 to 1:1 are readily achieved and generally preferred. It is contemplated that the active (i.e., the light emitting) portion of each imaging pixel will account for at least 25% and optimally at least 50% of its total area. For pixels larger than about 400 \u03bcm on an edge the width of the walls rarely accounts for a significant fraction of the total pixel area., 17607=Scozzafava EP 349,265 (a patent application published by the European Patent Office on Jan. 3, 1990) discloses an organic electroluminescent image display device and a process for its fabrication., 54943=The glass wafer with the photoresist patterns generated according to Example 1 was transferred to a vacuum deposition chamber. The wafer was placed at a distance of about 36 cm from a tungsten boat containing silver as the evaporant source. The orientation of the wafer was such that the angle between the surface normal of the wafer and the vertical line between the boat source and the center of the wafer was 35\ufffd. An aperture mask was placed in contact with the wafer to define the overall area where silver was to be deposited. Silver deposition was undertaken at a vacuum chamber pressure of about 1\ufffd10-6 torr. The thickness of the silver film deposited on the wafer surface was about 2000 \u212b., 17823=Scozzafava discloses a glass support bearing a series of laterally spaced, parallel indium tin oxide anode strips. An organic electroluminescent medium overlies the anode strips. Laterally spaced, parallel cathode strips, orthogonally oriented relative to the anode strips, are formed over the organic electroluminescent medium by depositing cathode forming metal as a continuous layer followed by patterning. Patterning of the cathode layer into cathode strips is achieved by spin coating a solution of monomeric negative-working photoresist in 2-ethoxyethanol solvent. The photoresist is imagewise exposed to UV radiation to produce a pattern of crosslinking, and uncrosslinked photoresist is removed by dipping the array in 2-ethoxyethanol for a few seconds. This removes unexposed photoresist and uncovers areas of the cathode layer. The uncovered areas of the cathode layer are removed by dipping the array in an acid etch bath consisting of 1000:1 water:sulfuric acid solution. After producing the cathode strips by this procedure, the array is rinsed in water and spun to remove excess water., 56319=Walls on glass wafers were prepared by the method described in Examples 1 and 2, except that the height of the walls were varied by adjusting the spinning speed with which the photoresist was applied on the wafer. The thicknesses of the walls were 6.2 \u03bcm and 9.0 \u03bcm. Silver lines were deposited on these patterns with a deposition angle of 35\ufffd as described in Example 2. Resistance measurements indicated that the resistance between adjacent silver lines was greater than 1\ufffd1012 ohms., 58551=An organic electroluminescent medium matrix was deposited on top of the glass support surface bearing the ITO lines and the photoresist walls. The organic EL medium matrix consisted of, in sequence, a copper phthalocyanine layer (200 \u212b), a 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl layer (1400 \u212b) and an aluminum trisoxine layer (1000 angstroms). The layers were prepared by vacuum deposition. The deposition rate was between 2 to 5 \u212b per second for each of the three organic layers, and the deposition angle was 0\ufffd for each of these for each of the three organic layers. Upon the organic EL medium, Mg:Ag (10:1) alloy film was deposited through an aperture. The deposition angle was 45\ufffd. This deposition produced electrically isolated Mg:Ag lines on top of the organic EL medium matrix. Individual pixels were lit by applying a bias of about 10 to 15 volts between a selected ITO line and a selected Mg:Ag line., 52558=The support was a clean circular glass wafer 10.2 cm in diameter. The negative-working photoresist employed was of the following composition: 65 g of chlorobenzene as solvent, 1 g of ketocoumarin as sensitizer, 2 g of ethyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate as activator, 20 g of dipenta-erythriotal monohydroxyl penta-acrylate (available commercially under the tradename SR-399 from Sartomer Co.), and 20 g of poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer (available commercially Elvacite 2021\u2122 from Du Pont). About 3 to 5 mL of the photoresist was deposited on the wafer, which was then set to spin at a low speed of 400 revolutions per second (RPM) for 5 seconds to spread the photoresist over the entire support surface. The spinning speed was then immediately ramped to 2000 RPM for 60 seconds. The wafer support with the spin-on photoresist coating was then dried in an air-convection oven for 60 seconds at 135\ufffd C., 55671=Conductive silver lines were created on the glass wafer between adjacent walls by the above vapor deposition method. Examined under an optical microscope, it was found that the parallel silver lines were separated from each other with clear gaps formed by interposition of the walls between the evaporant silver source and adjacent portions of the support. Electric measurement showed that these conductive parallel lines were completely isolated from each other. The electric resistance between any adjacent silver lines was greater than 1\ufffd1012 ohms.}",

The length of these lines was 3.8 cm. Orthogonal to these ITO lines,",
