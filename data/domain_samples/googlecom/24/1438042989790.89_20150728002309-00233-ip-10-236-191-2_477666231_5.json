The soft cartridge pressure pads 20 and 48 could cause the floppy disk to bind somewhat within the hard cartridge if they were allowed to operate. Therefore, when the frame 10 is in the lowered position, pressure pad 20 is pivoted away from the surface of the cartridge by lever action between the edge 54 of the hard cartridge and pin 56 on loading frame 10. Similarly, pressure pad 48 is pivoted away from the hard cartridge 52 by the lever action between edge 54 of the cartridge and pin 58 on the drive frame. Thus pressure pads 20 and 48 are not operative when the hard cartridge is inserted into the diskette drive. When loading frame 10 is down, collet 18 clamps the floppy disk (not shown) to the top surface 19A of spindle 19. At the same time, pressure pin 22 which pushes against the cleaning pad 49 (FIG. 2B) in the hard cartridge is in an operative position. In FIG. 4C, the loading frame 10 is lowered into the load position. As frame 10 comes down, springs 24 push against the top side",
