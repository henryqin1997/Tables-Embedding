    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6211=According to the described embodiment, a first data stream of electrical pulses in NRZ (non-return to zero) format is transmitted to a low pass filter 66 located in HDT distribution terminal 18. In a preferred embodiment, the NRZ electrical pulses have a frequency of around 25 MHz. More specifically, using standard and readily-available components and parts this frequency will actually be about 25.92 MHz. Low pass filter 66 will typically be chosen so as to readily pass frequencies less than about 25 MHz, while substantially blocking all frequencies above about 30 MHz. The 25 MHz NRZ data stream is then provided through laser driver 67 to laser diode (LD) 68 in duplexer 52 for modulating light waves having a nominal wavelength of about 1310 nanometers. This modulated light at 1310 nanometers is injected or focused directly onto optical fiber 42 a, or alternatively, as shown in FIG. 4, the modulated light may first be provided to WDM (wave division multiplexer) 70 which combines the modulated 1310 nanometer light with another light frequency (such as 1550 nanometer) from optical fiber 72.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55074=The 1310 nanometer light carrying the NRZ data stream is then provided to triplexer 74 which separates out the 1550 nanometer light carrying the TV signals as shown at 76, and passes the 1310 nanometer light modulated by the NRZ data stream to photo diode 59. Photo diode 59 in triplexer 74 along with recovery circuit 77 recovers the 25 MHz NRZ data stream and provides this data stream on electrical conduit 78 to low pass filter 80 and then onto Quantizer 82. Quantizer 82 regenerates the 25 MHz NRZ data stream to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The output of Quantizer 82 is then provided to PLL (phase lock loop circuit) 83 to recover the 25.92 NRZ data and the 25.92 clocking pulses. The 25 MHz NRZ data is then provided to receiving equipment., 33564=However, because of extremely high band widths available for use by an optical fiber, a single fiber is quite capable of carrying a great number of communications in both directions. One technique of optical transmission is WDM (wavelength divisional multiplexing) which uses different wavelengths for different types of transmissions. Typical examples are the use of 1550 nanometers of light for TV signals transmission and 1310 nanometers of light for bidirectional telephony transmission., 31568=The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for carrying on simultaneous and unrelated transmissions over a single optical fiber. For example, TV signals may be transmitted downstream at 1550 nanometers of light and telephony signals may be transmitted bidirectionally 1310 nanometers of light. More specifically the invention relates to methods and apparatus for use with bidirectional telephony communications using two different codes such as NRZ (non-return to zero) coding and Manchester coding for upstream and downstream transmissions., 50396=Thus, ONU 18 receives fiber optic cable 54 along with fiber optic cables 54 a through 54 d, each carrying the 1310 modulated light and also receives 55-870 MHz TV signals from the TV signal source location 10. The 55-870 MHz electrical signals are used to modulate light having a wavelength of 1550 nanometers. ONU 18 then combines by WDM (wave division multiplexing) the plurality of 1310 nanometer signals along with the 1550 nanometer signal such that cable 42 a carries the TV signals in a downstream direction on 1550 nanometer light and carries bidirectional telephony signals in both directions on 1310 nanometer light. Of course, fiber optical cables 42 b through 42 e carry the 1550 nanometer light and the 1310 nanometer light in a similar manner., 35817=Shortcomings of the above-discussed bidirectional communication system are overcome by the apparatus and methods of the present invention which comprises transmitting a first NRZ data stream having a first clocking frequency by an optical fiber from a first location to a second location. The data stream is transmitted by using a carrier having a selected wavelength of light such as, for example, 1310 nanometers. The selected wavelength of light from the first location is received at the second location and the NRZ data stream is recovered. A second NRZ data stream intended for travel to the first location and also having the first clocking frequency is received at the second location from a third location. The second NRZ data stream is converted to a Manchester coded data stream at a second clocking frequency which is a selected multiple of the first clocking frequency. The selected multiple should be two times (2\ufffd) or greater, and is preferably three times (3\ufffd) the first clocking frequency. The Manchester coded data stream from the second location is transmitted to the first location by the same optical fiber used by the NRZ transmission and at the same selected wavelength of light. The Manchester coded data stream is then received at the first location where it is converted back to an NRZ data stream having the first clocking frequency., 47775=Further, as is shown, in addition to the optical fiber 42A traveling between distribution terminal 18, hereinafter referred to as the ONU (Optical Network Unit) and a remote distribution terminal 20, hereinafter referred to as the HDT (Host Digital Terminal), there will be other optical fibers as indicated by optical fibers 42 b through 42 e which extend between distribution terminal or ONU 18 and other remote distribution terminals or HDT's (not shown) similar to HDT 20. Each of the optical fibers 42 b through 42 e will typically carry light at both 1550 nanometer and 1310 nanometer. As shown, TV signal source location 10 provides signals from equipment 12 and, in this illustrated embodiment, the TV signals may be 55-870 MHz signals provided on copper wire, such as coaxial cable 16. Copper coaxial cable 16 carries the TV signals having a band width of 55-870 MHz to an ONU 18 which uses the electrical TV signals to modulate light having a selected wavelength. In one preferred embodiment a particular selected wavelength is 1550 nanometers. Thus the light waves are provided to each of the individual optical fibers 42 a-42 e and travel in a single direction from ONU 18 to an equal number of remote terminals, such as HDT 20. Also as shown, electrical telephony signals may be carried by copper wires such as copper wires 48 which represent a twisted pair of normal telephone communication wires to a substation 52 where electrical telephony signals traveling downstream are used to modulate light at a selected frequency (typically by a laser diode\u2014(LD) 53). In the same manner, light at that same frequency traveling upstream previously modulated by electrical telephony signals is processed to recover or detect (typically by a photo detector\u2014(PD) 55) the telephony signals. Thus, the fiber optic cable 54 shown between ONU's 18 and substation 52 carries telephony signals at a single wavelength of light typically selected to be about 1310 nanometers. The light signals at 1310 nanometers are able to travel in both directions on the single fiber optic cable 54. Also as shown and as was discussed above with respect to optical fibers 42 a through 42 e, there will be a plurality of additional optical fibers 54 a through 54 d also carrying many other telephony signals at 1310 nanometers., 51284=At the remote downstream distribution terminals such as HDT 20, the bidirectional telephony signals traveling on 1310 nanometer light waves are routed to equipment in HDT 20 which recovers the electrical telephony signals by a photo detector\u2014(PD) 59 from the 1310 nanometer light waves traveling downstream and uses the electrical telephony signals traveling upstream to modulate light waves having a wavelength of 1310 nanometers by laser diode\u2014(LD) 61. The electrical telephony signals are then distributed from distribution box 20 by twisted wire pair 32 b to the telephone 30 b or other telephony equipment such as the 56K telephone modem 34 at home or building 22.}",

The coded signal is then provided from Manchester coder 102 by conductor 118 to Band Pass Filter (BPF) 120 and then through laser driver 122 to laser diode 61 to modulate light having a wavelength of 1310 nanometers. The 3\ufffd modulated coded signal then travels by optical fiber 42 a to photo diode 55 located in duplexer 52 and to recovery circuitry 124 where it is stripped off of the 1310 nanometer light and provided to BPF 126 and Quantizer and clock recovery circuitry 128.
