No. 4,869,247 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,888 both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Reference is also made to the following publications: Howard III, M.

Human experimental studies continue at the NIH campus. Extramural NIH funding is also directed at supporting engineering research on penetrating electrodes optimally suited for neural prosthetics applications. The University of Michigan, for example, has made use of computer-chip manufacturing techniques to synthesize exquisitely small electrode arrays. The etched electrical contacts on these devices are so small that the distance separating adjacent contacts can be in the range of 50 micrometers, approximately the diameter of two nerve cell bodies. Drake, K. L. et al., \u201cPerformance of planar multisite microprobes in recording extracellular single-unit intracortical activity,\u201d IEEE Trans. BME, 35:719-732, 1988., 94326=Longitudinal support 226 can be rigid or flexible. Prosthetic 200 may be introduced into a patient's brain via a rigid introducer, and subsequently electrical contacts 220 are exposed to primary auditory cortex 150. Support 226 can be one of the probes shown in FIGS. 3-5 in \u201cPossible Multichannel Recording and Stimulating Electrode Arrays: A Catalog of Available Designs\u201d by the Center for Integrated Sensors and Circuits, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Mich., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Alternative electrodes such as Depthalon Depth Electrodes and interconnection cables from PMT Corporation 1500 Park Road, Chanhassen, Minn., 55317 could also be used as support 226 and electrical couplers between contacts 220 and a speech processor (410 in FIG. 4)., 43906=Cochlear implants were designed for patients who are deaf as a result of loss of the cochlea's sound transduction mechanism. Implant candidates must have an intact acoustic nerve capable of carrying electrical signals away from the middle ear into the brain stem. The device converts sound waves into electrical signals which are delivered through a multi-contact stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode is surgically inserted by an otolaryngologist into the damaged cochlea. Activation of the contacts stimulates acoustic nerve terminals which would normally be activated by the cochlear sound transduction mechanism. The patient perceives sound as the coded electrical signal is carried from the middle ear into the brain by the acoustic nerve. Cohen, N. L. et al., \u201cA prospective, randomized study of cochlear implants,\u201d N. Engl. J. Med., 328:233-7, 1993., 30444=This application is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 08/549,165 filed Oct. 27, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,093, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/332,755 filed Nov. 1, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,975, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/194,017 filed Feb. 9, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,369., 117282=In one embodiment of the invention, each neuron-inactivating site on electrode support shaft 137 is in the form of a delivery port 141 for releasing a lesion-producing toxic chemical. Each delivery port 141 may be activated to release a measured dose of a toxin to the neuron(s), cell(s), or tissue targeted for inactivation, thereby inducing a localized lesion thereat. Many cytotoxic chemicals are known in the art, and may be used either alone (unconjugated), or conjugated to a specific monoclonal antibody or other carrier molecule (see, for example Stan, A. C., et al., \u201cIn vivo inhibition of angiogenesis and growth of the human U-87 malignant glial tumor by treatment with an antibody against basic fibroblastic growth factor,\u201d J. Neurosurg., 82:1044-1052, 1995). One example of a cytotoxic chemical is ibotenic acid which selectively destroys cell bodies without damaging fibers of passage (Guldin, W. O. & Markowitsch, H. J., \u201cNo detectable remote lesions following massive intrastriatal injections of ibotenic acid,\u201d Brain Res., 225:446-451, 1992., 103572=In accordance with an embodiment of this invention, it has now been discovered that action potentials can be accurately recorded from individual neurons using electrodes with a relatively large exposed surface area, and a relatively low impedance. Namely, action potentials of individual cells can be recorded using a microelectrode comprising a novel multipolar contact array. In a preferred embodiment, each microelectrode comprises a pair of contacts (corresponding to a bipolar contact) in close juxtaposition, which are coupled to at least one differential amplifier (Bak Electronics, Germantown, Md.), and differential recordings are made from one contact relative to the other (instead of relative to patient ground as in the prior art). In another embodiment, each microelectrode may comprise tripolar contact arrays (stereotrodes, B. L. McNaughton, et al., \u201cThe stereotrode: a new technique for simultaneous isolation of several single units in the central nervous system from multiple unit recordings,\u201d J. Neurosci. Methods, 8:391-397, 1983., 35752=The University of Utah has discontinued visual cortex prostheses research. However, the concept has been pursued at NIH where significant additional advances have been made. Their most important discovery to date relates to the use of needle shaped penetrating depth electrodes instead of flat surface stimulating electrodes. Bak, M., et al., \u201cVisual sensations produced by intracortical microstimulation of the human occipital cortex,\u201d Med. Biol. Eng. Comput., 28:257-259, 1990. Penetrating electrodes represent a major design improvement. They are placed within the brain tissue itself so there is optimal surface contact with elements of the brain that are targeted for stimulation. As a result, patients perceive visual phosphenes with approximately a thousand-fold less stimulation current than that required when surface electrodes are used. This allows for safe, chronic stimulation of very small discrete volumes of brain., 38408=During the 1970s the neural prosthetics group at the University of Utah not only explored the feasibility of a visual cortex neural prosthetic device, but carried out experiments in auditory cortex stimulation as well. Led by Dr. Dobelle, they formed a mobile research group that traveled to surgical centers throughout the United States when suitable experimental subjects were identified. These were patients who required temporal lobe surgery for tumor removal or treatment of intractable epilepsy, and who agreed to participate in the experimental protocol. Dobelle, W. H. et al., \u201cA prosthesis for the deaf based on cortical stimulation,\u201d Ann. Otol, 82:445-463, 1973., 32267=As it became clear that brain subregions served specific functions such as movement of the extremities, and touch sensation, it was also noted that direct electrical stimulation of the surface of these brain regions could cause partial reproduction of these functions. Morgan, J. P., \u201cThe first reported case of electrical stimulation of the human brain,\u201d J. History of Medicine, January 1982:51-63, 1982; Walker, A. E., \u201cThe development of the concept of cerebral localization in the nineteenth century,\u201d Bull. Hist. Med., 31:99-121, 1957., 139967=The drug-delivering embodiments of the electrode support shaft 137 may be used, under the invention, as an integral part of a flexible, multicontact, dual purpose, magnetically tipped electrode assembly 103, substantially as described above in the context of stereotactic pallidotomy, and may be similarly used in conjunction with introducer tube 101, also described above. The procedures of introducing and positioning electrode support shaft 137 within the target tissue may be performed substantially as described above in the context of magnetic stereotactic surgery, under the invention, and/or according to prior art stereotactic medical procedures. The method of infusing drugs through small openings in the brain catheter would be similar to that described by Lieberbam et al. (Lieberbam et al,. \u201cConvection-enhanced distribution of large molecules in gray matter during interstitial drug infusion,\u201d J. Neurosurg., 82:1021-1029, 1995), 53144=Neurosurgeons at a number of medical centers worldwide are currently performing stereotactic thalamotomy or pallidotomy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which regions within the target tissue (thalamus or globus pallidus) of the patient's brain are surgically accessed, physiologically monitored, and targeted for localized tissue destruction (Laitinen, L. Y., et al., \u201cLeksell's posteroventral pallidotomy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,\u201d J. Neurosurg., 76:53-61, 1992; Iacono, R. P., et al., \u201cThe results, indications, and physiology of posteroventral pallidotomy for patients with Parkinson's disease,\u201d Neurosurgery, 36:1118-1127, 1995, and references cited therein)., 110606=Electrode assembly 103 and electrode support shaft 137 of the instant invention may be either rigid or flexible. In a preferred embodiment, both electrode assembly 103 and electrode support shaft 137 are flexible. In one embodiment electrode support shaft 103 of the instant invention bears at least one neuron-monitoring electrode 135A/135B. In a preferred embodiment electrode support shaft 103 of the instant invention bears at least one bipolar neuron-monitoring microelectrode 135A. Preferably electrode support shaft 137 comprises an outer sheath 143 constructed of a flexible polymeric or co-polymeric material. A particularly preferred sheath material comprises tecoflex-polyurethane (Thermetics, Woburn, Mass.). Preferably electrode support shaft 137 bears a plurality of bipolar neuron-monitoring microelectrodes 135A, each bipolar microelectrode 135A comprising two electrical contacts 136, in the form of a pair of fine wires lying external to, and approximately parallel with, the external sheath of the shaft. Each electrical contact 136 is coupled to an electrical lead 129 comprising at least one strand of electrically conductive material, whereby a suitable electric current may be conducted to or from each of said electrical contacts 136. Preferably each electrical lead 129 comprises a flexible wire coated with an electrically insulating material. More preferably each strand of electrically conductive material comprises platinum and iridium, and has a diameter in the range of 10-200 micrometers, more preferably in the range of 20-100 micrometers and most preferably in the range of 30-70 micrometers. In a preferred embodiment the electrically insulating material coating each electrical lead comprises polytetrafluoroethene (Teflon\ufffd). In another embodiment electrode support shaft 137 of electrode assembly 103 is flexible, bears a plurality of bipolar neuron-monitoring microelectrodes 135A, and is equipped with a magnetic tip 133 at its distal end. Magnetic tip 133 of the electrode support shaft 137 is responsive to an external magnetic field, thereby allowing for its maneuverability in response to controlled changes in an applied magnetic field. The magnetic manipulation of medical devices within a patient's body, in general, including magnetic stereotactic procedures, is known in the art (see, for example Grady, M. S., et al., \u201cMagnetic stereotaxis: a technique to deliver stereotaxic hypothermia,\u201d Neurosurg., 27:1010-1016, 1990; Grady, M. S., et al., \u201cNonlinear magnetic stereotaxis: Three dimensional, in vivo remote magnetic manipulation of a small object in canine brain,\u201d Med. Phys., 17:405-415, 1990; Gillies, G. T., et al., \u201cMagnetic manipulation instrumentation for medical physics Research,\u201d Rev. Sci. Instrum., 65:533-562, 1994, and references cited therein., 49611=It is difficult to find suitable patients for implantation and testing of cochlear nucleus implants. The most likely candidates are patients who have a rare form of neurofibromatosis and acoustic neuromas on both acoustic nerves. Martuza, R. L. et al., \u201cNeurofibromatosis 2 (Bilateral Acoustic Neurofibromatosis),\u201d N. Engl. J. Med., 318:684-688, 1988. A small number of these patients are referred regularly to such institutions as the House Ear Institute. Many university medical centers, however, would be unable to identify a single suitable candidate during a full year. In the fourteen years since its initial clinical application at the House Institute, cochlear nucleus implant use and testing has remained quite restricted (less than two implants per year average during the epoch reported in Eisenberg, L. S. et al., \u201cElectrical stimulation of the auditory brainstem structure in deafened adults,\u201d J. Rehab. Res. 24:9-22, 1987., 45649=Patients are not candidates for cochlear implants if their hearing loss results from damage in auditory regions other than the cochlea. Because the first auditory relay station \u201cdownstream\u201d from the cochlea and auditory nerve is the brainstem cochlear nucleus, this structure is a logical candidate for consideration as an implantation site. This approach was first developed at the House Ear Institute. Eisenberg, L. S. et al., \u201cElectrical stimulation of the auditory brainstem structure in deafened adults,\u201d J. Rehab. Res. 24:9-22, 1987; Hitselberger, W. E. et al., \u201cCochlear nucleus implant,\u201d Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg., 92:52-54, 1984. As is the case with cochlear implants, sound waves are translated into a complex electrical code F. The implant's stimulation terminals are placed up against the cochlear nucleus, and the patient perceives sounds when the system is activated., 107315=The globus pallidus is a conical subcortical structure within the brain which is involved in the control of movement. FIG. 12A shows the gross morphology, and relative size of the globus pallidus, as well as its approximate location and orientation within the brain. During recent years, stereotactic pallidotomy has become recognized as a valuable procedure in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (see, for example, Laitinen, L. Y., et al., \u201cLeksell's posteroventral pallidotomy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,\u201d J. Neurosurg., 76:53-61, 1992; Iacono, R. P., et al., \u201cThe Results, indications, and physiology of posteroventral pallidotomy for patients with Parkinson's disease,\u201d Neurosurgery, 36:1118-1127, 1995; and references cited therein). Simply stated, the rationale for the success of this treatment is as follows. Parkinson's disease causes dysfunction due to loss of dopaminergic innervation in a part of the movement control circuit (Putamen and Caudate) distinct from the globus pallidus. However, because of the nature of the circuit, the dysfunction in Parkinson's disease can be ameliorated by disruption of the circuit at the point of the globus pallidus (see, for example, Laitinen, L. Y., et al., \u201cLeksell's posteroventral pallidotomy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,\u201d J. Neurosurg., 76:53-61, 1992; Iacono, R. P., et al., \u201cThe results, indications, and physiology of posteroventral pallidotomy for patients with Parkinson's disease,\u201d Neurosurgery, 36:1118-1127, 1995; and references cited therein.), 32882=The most extensive work on electrical stimulation \u201cmapping\u201d of the human brain surface was carried out over several decades by Dr. Wilder Penfield, a neurosurgeon and physiologist at the Montreal Neurological Institute, mostly during the early to mid-1900s. He made precise observations during cortical stimulation of hundreds of awake patients undergoing brain surgery for intractable epilepsy. Among his many findings, he noted that stimulation of the visual and hearing areas of the brain reproducibly caused the patients to experience visual and auditory phenomena. Penfield, W. et al., \u201cSomatic motor and sensory representation in the cerebral cortex of man as studied by electrical stimulation,\u201d Brain 60:389-443, 1937; Penfield, W. et al., Epilepsy and the Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain, London: Churchill, 1954; Penfield, W. et al., \u201cThe brain's record of auditory and visual experience,\u201d Brain, 86:595-696, 1963. Following the results of early human brain mapping studies, electrical stimulation of sensory brain regions to restore lost function was a logical therapeutic extrapolation. Drs. Brindley and Lewin of the University of Cambridge were the first to reduce the concept to practice by implanting a patient with a visual cortex neural prosthetic device. Brindley, G. S. et al., \u201cThe sensations produced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex,\u201d J. Physiol. 196:479-493, 1968. Their device consisted of an array of thin, flat electrodes placed on the surface of the visual cortex. The electrodes were remotely controlled with radio signals. A similar system was later tested at the University of Utah by Dr. Dobelle and colleagues. Dobelle, W. H. et al., \u201cArtificial vision for the blind: stimulation of the visual cortex offers hope for a functional prosthesis,\u201d Science 183:440-444, 1974.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of pallidotomy is strongly influenced by the ability to effectively monitor and assess brain tissue being considered for inactivation. The ability to monitor a number of neurons over an extended period of time, on the ward, allows for the gathering of more precise information on the physiologic status of each neuron, and a more informed decision to be made on which regions of the tissue are to be targeted for lesion production. Secondly, by combining the functions of neuron-monitoring and lesion-production in a single dual purpose electrode assembly, according to the invention, the need for replacing a neuron-monitoring electrode support with a lesion-producing electrode support is eliminated, and consequently the risk of error in electrode support misplacement is also eliminated. Compared with prior art stereotactic pallidotomy, magnetic pallidotomy according to the instant invention has, in theory, less risk and greater benefit to the patient, for the following reasons. Because of the ability of the electrode support shaft to be directed to occupy a specific conformation within the target tissue and the presence of a plurality of neuron-monitoring microelectrodes, a target volume of the globus pallidus can be accesses, and neurons from a number of sites within that target volume can be monitored with a single pass through the brain. In contrast, neuron-monitoring electrodes of the prior art would need to be passed through the brain a number of times to access",
