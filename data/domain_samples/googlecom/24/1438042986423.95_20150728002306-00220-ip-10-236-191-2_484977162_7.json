The scheme of that patent requires the microprocessor to read a fixed pattern read-only-memory (ROM) to initiate self-test routines. The resultant self-test data is fed to a comparator along with the correct output from the self-test ROM. If the microprocessor data output matches the ROM output, the comparator outputs a logic one. A correct output toggles a monostable one shot to increment a binary counter that selects another self-test routine from the ROM to be performed by the microprocessor. While the microprocessor is executing the self-test, the comparator output is zero since the previously latched data does not equal the new ROM data. When the system is operating normally, the comparator output is a square wave. This square wave is then amplified, filtered and rectified to enable an AND gate which permits microprocessor control of the system. If any part of the microprocessor system fails, the square wave from the comparator is lost and the microprocessor loses control of the system. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,635 is hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in terms of what are at present believed to be its preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the predetermined output of the shift register can be any preselected data word. It is only necessary that the key data word produced by the microprocessor is related to the random data word in a manner such that the correct shift register output is produced. It is therefore intended that the appended claims cover all such changes. Control unit 112 monitors current via current transformers 158 and 160 to determine if contactor 122 or 126 is closed. Current transformers 162, 164 and 166 are monitored simultaneously and wired such that any failure in bus wiring between them will produce a signal at control unit 112 indicating that corrective action is necessary. Control unit 110 performs functions similar to those of control unit 106, but for circuits associated with the right bus 114. The function of generator 104 is monitored via data line 148 and the wiring between ground and the right bus 114 is monitored via current transformers 150, 152 and 154. A failure in generator 104, the associated wiring, or control unit 110 would result in contactor 120 being locked open and control unit 112 being informed of the",
