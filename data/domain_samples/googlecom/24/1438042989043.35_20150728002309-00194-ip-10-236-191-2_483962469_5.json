No. 4,369,458., 20026=In connecting the two integrated circuits together to form the focal plane array configuration, each pixel contact of the infrared detector is coupled correspondingly to each cell of the signal processor chip. Accordingly, the two integrated circuits are connected together on an element-to-element basis with well-known metal bonding techniques, the operation being commonly referred to as a flip-chip fabrication method. For an example of such a flip-chip configuration, reference is herein made to the U.S. issued U.S. Pat. No. 4,067,104, issued to John M. Tracey on Jan. 10, 1978 and entitled, \"Method of Fabricating an Array of Flexible Metallic Interconnects for Coupling Microelectronics Components\"., 32449=Typically, the substrate wafer thickness, which may be on the order of 0.02 inches (500 micrometers), is utilized to achieve quantum efficiencies approaching approximately 50%. Normally, an elemental radiation detector zone of a contiguous radiation detector array, partitioned by the dashed lines 15, is defined by the center-to-center separation of the two-dimensional detector contacts 14 which may be typically 40 micrometers on a side and be spaced on 50 micrometer centers. In these conventional arrays, electrical cross talk between the elemental detector zones, which may have a volumetric semiconductor wafer height-to-width aspect ratio of 10:1, may be minimized by ensuring that the same potential difference, like 50 V, for example, is applied between each of the detector ohmic contacts 14 and the common ohmic contact 12., 37416=For the present embodiment, each of the metallic contactors 36, 38 and 40 may be comprised essentially of gold and may be formed over each of the P+ doped injection regions respectively associated therewith by conventional electroplating techniques, for example. The resulting mushroom type bump shape of the metallic contacts 36, 38 and 40 generally arises naturally from the electroplating process, the shape being desirable for the purposes of the present embodiment. Each of the metallic contact bumps 36, 38 and 40 may be formed of a uniform size somewhere in the region between 10 and 25 micrometers diameter while the doped injection area is intentionally kept small on the order of 5 micrometers on the side. The intent here is to keep the CCD parallel input capacitance low, say on the order of a few tenths of a picofarad. Typically, a CCD of this type may be comprised of a 32\ufffd32 cellular array constituting 1024 bonding metallic cell contacts which may reside on 50 micrometer centers.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The aforesaid batch fabrication method tends to result in high yields because it does not require precision alignment of the high density of elements of the arrays of the integrated circuits to ensure complete bonding therebetween. The above batch fabrication method is amenable to either photoconductive or photovoltaic type infrared radiation detector focal plane arrays. Because of the much higher density of detector contacts with respect to the cell contacts of the two integrated circuits, there is offered a degree of redundancy in the batch fabrication bonding operation in forming the flip-chip geometric array configuration. Therefore, a high interconnect reliability is anticipated. Finally, after the separation step, the semiliquid supporting material 132 may be cleaned from the sectioned array dyes 134, 136 and 138, thus leaving the finished products (see FIG. 6E) in preparation for possibly a testing operation. In this manner, it may be possible then as proposed by the method steps hereabove to fabricate a plurality of focal plane array dual integrated circuit flip-chip configurations, having arrays on the order of 16\ufffd32 or 32\ufffd32, simultaneously in a batch-fabricating operation. From the overall dual chip configuration array 128, predefined array dye slices like that shown at 134, 136 and 138, for example, may be divided. For example, array dyes 134, 136 and 138 which may be outlined by the dotted line combinations 140, 142 and 144, 146 may be sawed apart with a precision diamond",
