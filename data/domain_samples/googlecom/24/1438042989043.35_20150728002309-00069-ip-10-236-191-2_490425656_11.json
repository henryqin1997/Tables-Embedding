    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34889=[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,751,880 relates to an optical unit for an optical fiber telecommunications cable, the unit comprising a tube of plastics material, preferably polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride, having a modulus of elasticity less than 1500 MPa at 20\ufffd C. and a stress/elongation curve without a yield point. The proposed materials provide flexible and elastic tubes for the optical fiber unit, thereby making handling thereof easier. Because of its flexibility, the optical unit has greatly reduced \u201cmemory\u201d thereby facilitating splicing operations on stranded loose tube structure cables., 35544=[0007] EP-A-1,024,382 discloses a telecommunications cable element having a transmission element disposed in a buffer tube made from thermoplastic polyolefin elastomeric buffer material, preferably a propylene-ethylene copolymer, having a modulus of elasticity below about 500 MPa at room temperature and below about 1500 MPa at \u221240\ufffd C. Preferably, the polyolefin has an elongation at break below about 500% and an MFI above about 3. Flexibility of the elastomeric material is maintained over a wide range of temperature; further, its compatibility with low cost, thixotropic, water-blocking gel filling materials is observed., 48598=[0040] The above polymeric material comprised into said component should have a sufficiently high flexural modulus (method ISO 178) in order to impart the desired protection to the optical fibers housed therein. Preferably, said modulus is of at least about 500 MPa, preferably at least 800 MPa or higher. Said modulus is however preferably not too high, e.g. below about 1500 MPa, in order to avoid an excessive stiffness of the cable component., 57531=[0054] For instance, with reference to FIG. 1, a buffer tube 101 can be made of a propylene-butene copolymer having an elastic modulus of about 950-1100 (method ISO 178). Said tube may have an outer diameter of about 3.5 mm, a thickness T1 of about 0.3 mm, a tubular passage diameter D1 of about 2.1 mm and a steel wire reinforcing element with a diameter D2 of 0.5 mm. Thickness T2 and T3 can both be of about 0.3 mm and the total thickness of the portion of peripheral wall embedding said strength member will thus be of about 1.1 mm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0092] The melting points were measured by Mettler DSC instrumentation (second melting value) with a scanning rate of 10\ufffd C./min (instrument head type DSC 30, microprocessor type PC 11, Mettler software Graphware TA72AT.1); the relevant values evidently show how the compositions of the invention allow to use lower process temperatures. [0091] Further, the polymer material suitable for the invention shows a very good transparency adversely from heterophase propylene-ethylene copolymers and regardless of the added nucleating agent. Transparency was determined by measuring the transmittance of a ray of light in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) through a 1 mm thick material sample using an UV visible spectrophotometer Varian, mod. CARY3E. [0090] An improvement can thus be evidently observed by using the polypropylene copolymer above defined as material suitable for the buffer tubes of the invention, which guarantees the obtainment and keeping of the desired shape. [0089] Finally, the standard propylene-ethylene copolymer Finapro 4660G material, when added with a sorbitol derivative as nucleating agent (Ex. 3), shows a shape index of 9 with an applied depression of 200 mmHg. The buffer tubes of the invention, comprising the above defined polymer material, when added with the same nucleating agent (Ex. 5 and 6), show instead a shape index of 10 with an even reduced applied depression of 100 and 150 mmHg respectively.
