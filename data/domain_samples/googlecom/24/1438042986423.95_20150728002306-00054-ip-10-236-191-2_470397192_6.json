    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Accordingly, in an LDMOS transistor of the present invention, a first impurity region surrounds a source region, thereby reducing the length of a channel occurring in a body. In addition, first and second impurity regions are disposed at either side of the channel, so that an impurity concentration shows a uniform ion distribution. As a result, channel length can be reduced, a sufficient breakdown voltage can be maintained, and an on-resistance characteristic can be improved. The uniform ion distribution of the channel 221 in the p-type body 220 is due to the n\u2212 second impurity region 242, which has a lower concentration than the n\u2212 semiconductor substrate 200, is disposed between the channel and the n\u2212 extended drain region 230. Thus, the impurity concentration of the channel 221 shows a very nearly uniform distribution even near the n\u2212 second impurity region 242. . For example, the n+ source region 240 exhibits an impurity concentration curve A2, which is relatively high and decreases toward the n\u2212 first impurity region 241. The n\u2212 first impurity region exhibits an impurity concentration curve",
