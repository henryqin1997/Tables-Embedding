As seen further in the Figures, there is a chart 50 which illustrates a series of numbers under the word \u201ctest\u201d and a series of numbers under the word \u201cactual trip\u201d. An example of how the chart would work for example when one has placed the arrow 22 on the number 5 for testing for 5 amps, if the amperage would be between 3 to 4 amps, the pop-out indicator 36 would pop out indicating a problem in the system. The same would occur for each of the amp ranges being tested for in the left hand column and the system would show improper functioning if the amperage was actually in the range as indicated in the right hand column under \u201cactual trip\u201d. As seen further in FIG. 1 and in FIG. 2, there is seen a second test plug 40. Test plug 40 would be of the type which would be utilized for testing the integrity of a system that uses a type of fuse that are known as cylindrical glass fuses. As illustrated, test plug adaptor 40 includes a body portion 42 having a pair of flat openings 44 which would receive the terminals 34 therein. Once the body portion has received the terminals 34 within openings 44, the",
