This is of course an improvement, but patients have difficulty in handling these tubes equipped with such valves. These kinds of tubes are also expensive, which is a serious disadvantage considering the large consumption of tubes in hospitals., 23874=This invention has reference to a container for fluid or semi-fluid substances in small quantities. The substances to be packed according to the invention are mainly drugs consequently the following description deals with such substances. However, it should be obvious that other substances can be packed in the described container. In administering drugs, it is common to pack them in conventional tubes. The medical doctors Mona Hall, Percy Nordqvist, Eva Palmgren and Irene Wilhelmsson have reported in a study at the National Medical Conference 1974 in Sweden, that the conventional tube, irrespective of used material, is very difficult to handle for especially older people. The test tubes used by the doctors have been of various types of existing tubes, containing substances having pharmacological effects. The study is considered to be highly representative for the kind of problems appearing in the use of tubes, and it is related in Svensk Lakartidning 1975 (Swedish Medical Journal).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations When manufacturing the blocks according to FIG. 29, the bottom-parts together with the flanges can be made in one step in one tool, after which this part is fitted with the top-parts, separately made or equally made as one unit. FIGS. 27 and 28 show a container having a top part 1V and a bottom-part 2V. The container has two flanges 4V ad 5V together forming a rectangular surface. The bottom-part 2V has an opening with a sealing organ 10V which is cylindrical and prevents the container from staying upright on a horizontal surface. Because of the rectangular shape of the flanges a number of containers can be joined to each other, forming a block as shown in FIG. 29. Between the flanges are indications of fracture making it possible to break off one container at a time from the block. By making blocks of containers, these blocks can conveniently be packed in boxes 31 which boxes can form multiple, packages enclosed in wrapping 32, such as, for example, thermoplastic foil. Again, it should be noted that all the flanges of the container adapted to the fingers are done such that the emptying is made smoothly and controllably. This implies that the design work has to be based on an empirical study of the fingers and their physiological coordination. Embodiments and sizes of said containers should be designed taking a number of parameters into consideration, like",
