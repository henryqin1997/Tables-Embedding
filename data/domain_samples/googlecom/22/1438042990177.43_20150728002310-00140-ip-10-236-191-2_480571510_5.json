    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28473=By means of modulating valves 89 and 103 the temperature of the exhaust gases from the gas generator is regulated to heat the oil in the formations to a temperature sufficient to break the hydrocarbon chains into lighter segments and the segments reacted with hot hydrogen from the gas generator to form lighter and less viscous end products. For example, the formations may be heated to temperatures of 750\ufffd F or greater at a pressure of approximately 2000 psi. The outputs of thermocouple 161 and transducer 171 are monitored to aid in obtaining the desired temperatures and pressures, it being understood that the temperatures and pressures existing in the formation bed will be less than those measured in the borehole. For so called depleted reservoirs which contain residual oil which occupy 20 to 24% of the pore space in the bed formation, it is necessary to heat the bed above 750\ufffd F and possibly as high as approximately 1100\ufffd F to adequately crack the oil. The 1100\ufffd F upper limit is desirable to prevent decomposition of methane into carbon and hydrogen and which occurs at about 1200\ufffd F. The process is slightly different from the normal hydrocracking process in that the underground bed may not contain the proper catalytic agents and thermal cracking must occur before hydrogenation. Upon reaction of the hydrogen with the hydrocarbons segments, an amount of heat is released which is equal 5 to 15% of that required to raise the sand bed in the reservoir to 750\ufffd F. The manner in which the insitu hydrogenation is programmed is dependent upon the quantity of oil residing in the pore spaces of the formation. Normally the pore space is 38 to 42% of the reservoir volume. Sand, limestone, or shale formations occupy the remainder. If the 42% pore space is fully occupied, the reservoir will contain approximatley 3100 barrels of oil per acre foot. Normally the space is not fully occupied. For reservoirs with high occupancy and using the present method, the temperature is kept just high enough to thermally crack the oil for hydrogenation into liquids primarily. As the occupancy decreases toward 20% it is necessary to increase the temperature to thermally crack and hydrogenate the residual liquid converting it to gases which can escape the pores of the formation. The resulting hydrogenated products then contain a predominance of lighter ends such as methane, propane, and butane. The following table shows the quantity of heat required for elevating the bed temperature to 750\ufffd F for various reservoirs depths., 20997=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application, Ser. No. 611,138 filed Sept. 8, 1975, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,982,542 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application, Ser. No. 534,778 filed Dec. 20, 1974, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,982,591., 34407=If the composition of the bed is unknown, the gas generator may be initially operated to produce gases at a lower temperature to determine if lighter hydrocarbons can be recovered from well 501 by hydrocracking. If no recovery is had, the gas generator may be operated at the higher temperature to induce thermal cracking and then hydrogenation. The gas and liquids resulting from hydrogenation whether by thermal cracking without catalysts followed by hydrogenation or by hydrocracking move through perforations 509 formed through the borehole casing 511, and into the borehole 501 to the surface. At the surface the gases and liquids move through conduit 505 to the cooling and separating tower 503. The liquids and gases are separated in the tower and the liquids move through conduit 513 to a reservoir 515. The gases from the top of the tower 503 move through conduit 517 to a compressor 519 which recompresses the gases to 2500 psi plus whatever pressure drop may be encountered in the system ahead of the well bore chamber 31. From compressor 519, the gases flow to hydrogen producer 81 by way of conduit 521. In some applications, for adequate control, the pressure may have to be increased to 3800 psi so as to maintain sonic velocity across the generator nozzle or outlet 49. Hydrogen production in hydrogen producer 81 may be by reforming with water or by partial oxidation. If partial oxidation is used, a conduit, shown by broken line 523, is connected from the oxygen source 83 to the hydrogen producer 81. The oxygen source 83 may be a tank which is filled from a commerical supply or from an on site air to oxygen converter. The high pressure required may be from 2500 to 3800 psi and may be best achieved by vaporization of liquid oxygen in a closed container., 69532=In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-12, ignition was described as being affected by a spark plug or electrode 75 energized from a source located at the surface. In order to eliminate the electrical conductors extending from the surface to the gas generator required for actuating electrode 75, a hypergolic combination of fuel and an oxidizer may be employed to effect ignition of the combustible gases in the chamber 67 of the gas generator. Such a process is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent Application, Ser. No. 714,787 filed Aug. 16, 1976. As described in Application, Ser. No. 714,787, prior to start-up valves 127 and 129 will be closed. A slug of start-up fuel is injected through conduit 93 to closed valve 127. A slug of oxidizing fluid also injected through conduit 107 to closed valve 129. In one embodiment the start-up fuel may be aniline and the oxidizing fluid may be N2 O4 (white fuming nitric acid). Next the hydrogen and oxygen sources will be connected to conduits 93 and 107 respectively to pressurize these conduits with hydrogen and oxygen behind the start-up fuel and oxidizing fluids. Valves 127 and 129 then are opened to allow the slugs of start-up fuel and oxidizing fluid to flow into the combustion chamber 67 for mixture where the start-up fuel will ignite spontaneously and in turn ignite the hydrogen and oxygen which follow through conduits 93 and 107., 32728=For some reservoirs, it may not be necessary to thermally crack the oil, but to apply hydrocracking because of the wide variety of trace elements present in some beds that may act as catalysts for the hydrocracking process. As is well known hydrocracking is the combination of mild thermal cracking and hydrogenation which can be carried out at lower temperatures in the presence of a suitable catalyst. With some catalysts, hydrocracking may proceed at temperatures as low as 500\ufffd F and 500 psi. The temperatures, however, may be higher with an upper limit of about 800\ufffd F. For a detailed discussion of thermal cracking and hydrogenation and hydrocracking reference is made to the report \"Impact of New Technology on the U.S. Petroleum Industry 1946-1965\" by the National Petroleum Council, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 67-31533.}",
