In a variant embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the transparent windows 13 and 14 include regularly spaced apart stripes 17 on their inside surfaces facing the fluorescent tube 11. Here again, it should be observed that in other embodiments, not shown, the stripes could be placed on the outside faces of the windows, and they could be replaced by other light-processing means such as prisms, toruses, or beads. The light radiation emitted through the top window 13 is directed substantially horizontally while the light radiation emitted through the bottom window 14 propagates in an essentially vertical downward direction. FIG. 3 shows another embodiment of the lighting device in which the first and second directional light flux recovery means 12, 15, and 16 of the housing comprise cylindrical reflecting surfaces having profiles determined by computation using a computer. The reflecting surfaces of said recovery means combine so as to direct the light flux emitted by the fluorescent tube 11 towards the top and bottom transparent windows 13 and 14 which are disposed substantially parallel to each other in this case. In this typical case, the transparent windows 13 and 14 through which the light flux is emitted have inside and outside",
