    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Embodiments of the present invention described above are exemplary. Many changes and modifications may be made to the disclosure recited above, while remaining within the scope of the invention. Therefore, the scope of the invention should not be limited by the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalent. n, the chromium 409 is removed to yield the final structure. FIG. 4 Referring to m, the exposed structures at the higher plane 406 of elevation may be anisotropically etched downward to a lower plane of elevation (e.g., plane 407) which might be substantially coplanar with other structures. FIG. 4 Referring to l, the resist 410 is removed at this point to improve the performance of the subsequent etch process, as needed. FIG. 4 Referring to k, the chromium 409 is etched from the unmasked portion of the substrate 401. FIG. 4 Referring to j, the substrate 401 may be coated with another thin layer of chromium 409, and the structures that exist at a lower plane 407 of elevation may be masked, e.g., with resist 410. FIG. 4 Referring to i, the resist 404 and chromium 402 may be removed as needed. At this point, the template 401 contains desired local structures,",
