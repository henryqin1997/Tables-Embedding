No. 06/856,475 filed Apr. 28, 1986 now abandoned from which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 120., 52243=Continuing with the description of the mechanism of the device, it is essential to accurate operation of the mechanism that a tablet to be counted drop through the drop-out hole designated by reference numeral 46 and located at the 3 o'clock position of the surface 24 and further that only one tablet shall be dispensed. A factor relating to accurate dispensing is concerned with allowing only one tablet to be dispensed each time a slot is presented to the drop-out hole., 59165=Referring again to FIG. 4B, the counting control and indicator means 18 and start switch 21, connected to the motor 55 and detector 22 by internal wiring, may be conventional. Commercially available solid state or electro-mechanical predetermining counting units of types which are satisfactory are manufactured by VeederRoot, Digital Systems Division of Hartford, Conn.; and ENM Company of Chicago, Ill. As indicated above, the counting control disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 3,368,713, issued on Feb. 13, 1968, may be used, or the circuit disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,111,332 may be used., 30531=The most pertinent of the prior art patents are U.S. Pat. No. 3,368,713, issued on Feb. 13, 1968, for Article Counting Device and U.S. Pat. No. 4,111,332, issued on Sep. 5, 1978, for Article Counting Device. The subject matter of Pat. No. 4,111,332 relating to the disks for segregating the pills for counting and the machine controls are incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously the invention is susceptible to changes or alterations without defeating its practicability, therefore, we do not wish to be confined to the preferred embodiments shown in the drawings and described herein. It should be noted that although the present invention is described as applicable to dispensing drugs, the principles of this invention are applicable to dispensing other types of discrete items. The inclination of the platform 24 of the drug cells should be about 40 relative to the horizontal. If the angle is much greater, the articles are not collected properly by the disk for conveyance to the upper region of the (hopper) and the feed rate is materially reduced. The angle of about 40\ufffd has been found to be the angle which produces maximum feed rate. Relative to the slots in the disks, they are generally curved to allow maximum smoothness and speed of movement through the slot. The platform 24' is inclined forward, therefore retaining pins 34 are necessary to hold the cassette in place. The cassette is mounted by moving perpendicular to the platform 24' in the direction of arrow F. FIGS. 17 and 18 illustrate a second alternative embodiment of the present invention, wherein the cassette 14' is positioned on an incline platform 24' which angles forward instead of backward. The counting unit 80 is comprised of a platform 24' similar to 24 described above and a counter 18' and switch",
