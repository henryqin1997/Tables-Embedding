While the method, apparatus and system shown and described has been characterized as being preferred, it will be readily apparent that various changes and modifications could be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. At step 85, if the mobile station is located in the roamer port area, then the serving exchange MSC 63 allocates a temporary local directory number (TLDN) and returns this information to the HLR 62 in a ROUTREQ response message 73. Otherwise, if the mobile station was located outside the roamer port area, then the call is terminated according to the exchange data. When the ROUTREQ response message 73 is received by the HLR 62, the HLR constructs a LOCREQ response message 74 by adding the mobile identification number (MIN) and electronic serial number (ESN) of the mobile to the information provided by the serving MSC 63. The HLR 62 then returns the LOCREQ response message 74 to the originating MSC 61. At call setup at step 86, the originating MSC 61 establishes a voice path to the serving MSC 63 using existing interconnection protocols and the TLDN specified in the LOCREQ response message 74. In response to the ROUTREQ INVOKE message 69, the serving MSC 63 consults its internal data",
