Accordingly, all expedient modifications readily attainable by one of ordinary skill in the art from the disclosure set forth herein, or by routine experimentation there from, are deemed to be within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Of course, the invention applies to the production of wafers comprising donor layers made of other materials, such as aluminum nitride and more generally semiconductor, especially large-gap, monometallic or polymetallic nitrides, diamond, etc., or else single-crystal silicon of very high quality for the donor layer and low-quality single-crystal or polycrystalline silicon for the support. a and 1 b may be carried out on the premises of the donor wafer fabricator, whereas the following steps may be part of a separate process carried out on the premises of the fabricator of composite substrates for electronics, optoelectronics and optics industries. FIGS. 1 In one implementation, steps shown in These steps may be repeated with donor wafer 30\u2032 until donor layer 10 has been almost entirely consumed, without however breaching support layer 20. e, a separation is performed, especially by thermal and/or mechanical stress, at the region of weakness 12 in order to obtain, on the one hand, desired assembly 40, 101, typically forming a",
