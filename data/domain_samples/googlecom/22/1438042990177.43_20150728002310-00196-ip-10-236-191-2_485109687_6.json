Specifically, in the system of FIG. 6, a transmitter/receiver such as transmitter/receiver 380 (FIG. 5) may be resident in programmer 420. This transmitter/receiver may interrogate transponders provided on one or more of the leads to determine lead types, serial numbers, and any available sensor calibration values in a manner similar to that described above. The transfer of information from the transponders may be performed using data encryption technology as described in the co-pending application entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus to Secure Data Transfer from Medical Device Systems\u201d, Ser. No. 09/431,881 filed Nov. 2, 1999 by Nichols and incorporated herein by reference. Information that is gained during the interrogation may be entered and stored into a patient record either within the memory of programmer 420, or at data center 462. The information may further be employed to configure one or more IMD functions or systems automatically based on lead types, and/or may also be used to calibrate sensor circuits in ways similar to those discussed above.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0083] Other modifications are possible within the scope of the current invention. For example, although the above-described embodiments primarily relate to a transponder attached to, or integrated within, a lead, the invention may be usefully employed to identify other implantable medical devices that may be used in conjunction with the active IMD in the system. For example, pluggable antennas or electrodes that may be selectively coupled to the active IMD may be identified and configured using a mechanism similar to that described herein. Additional components such as heart valves or stents could include similar transponders on the surface of, or integrated within, the device to store information that may then be transferred to external devices that are located within, or outside of, the body. Therefore, while particular embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed, it is to be understood that various different modifications are possible and are contemplated within the scope of the specification, drawings, abstract and appended claims. [0082] According to another aspect of the invention, data stored within a transponder 362 of a component is employed by an IMD to configure circuitry within the component. For example, an embodiment of a lead may include data interface to couple to an interface of the IMD. Based on information transferred from a transponder of the lead to the IMD, a processing circuit such as micro-computer circuit 302 is capable of",
