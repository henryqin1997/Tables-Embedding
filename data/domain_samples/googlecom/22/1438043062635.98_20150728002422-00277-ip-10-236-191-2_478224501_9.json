See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,322,010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the preferred embodiment, a liquid process is used to create a film on the order of 100 microns with relatively tight tolerances across the film, e.g., \ufffd1%. The viscosity of the dielectric material in its liquid form is selected to ensure complete wetting of the surfaces of the micro-components to the extent that the micro-components should be covered, and to ensure uniformity of the film thickness. The key parameter to be observed in formation of the dielectric film is the uniformity of the dielectric properties so that the surface flashover (voltage breakdown that occurs on or above the surface of an insulator) and bulk dielectric breakdown characteristics are tightly controlled to minimize the possibility of arcing or voltage breakdown across any dielectric discontinuities when voltage is applied to electrodes corresponding to a given micro-component. A typical good dielectric material has a breakdown voltage in the range of 500 to 5000 volts per mil (about 200 to 2000 kV/cm) in the bulk, with a preferred range of 1000 volts per mil (400 kV/cm) or higher. The surface flashover field strength should also be in the range of 1000 volts per mil (400 kV/cm). This will be achieved partially through material selection and principally with the application of a thin coating, such as a resin or epoxy, to the surfaces of the electrodes and micro-component. This coating inhibits electron flow over the surface between the electrodes thereby raising its flashover voltage. In addition, a good loss tangent for the dielectric material, typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.1, at 100 kHz to 1 MHz is preferred. An exemplary range for dielectric constant in this frequency range is 3.5 to 5., 33561=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/789,976, filed Mar. 2, 2004, now U.S. Pat.

Each of the above-identified applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 99526=Electrodes are formed by applying a conductive liquid to the upper surface of the second substrate (step 218). The electrodes may be patterned using known lithographic techniques, e.g., conductive film deposition over the entire area, photoresist deposition, masked exposure and development followed by etching, or by printing, e.g., ink-jet printing, or by using liquids that are selectively drawn to the desired locations using one or a combination of characteristics of the liquid including surface tension, viscosity, thickness and electrical conductivity. In the preferred embodiment, a conductive ink is applied using an ink-jet printing technique. The ink contains copper, indium oxide, silver, or other conductive material carried in an epoxy or epoxy-like material. Appropriate conductive inks are commercially available and will have electrical conductivity in the range of 1250 mhos/cm or higher. After printing, the conductive ink is cured based on the manufacturer's recommendations (step 220).}",

The present description and examples should be considered exemplary only, with the true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, variations and modifications of each of the disclosed embodiments, including combinations thereof, can be made within the scope of this invention as defined by the following claims. In yet another embodiment, after formation of the protective layer (step 224) and before dicing, an RF screen is formed by depositing a conductive liquid over the entire top surface of the assembly, where the conductive liquid is clear or becomes clear when cured. For example, indium-tin-oxide (ITO) can be used, however, other transparent conductive coatings are known, including transparent gold (TPG) and transparent silver or aluminum-based coatings. It may be desirable to coat an additional protective dielectric layer over RF screen, which may be performed using a liquid dielectric material followed by curing, or by applying a sheet of dielectric materials over the assembly. In addition to use as a RF screen, transparent conductive materials can be used in the construction of the light-emitting displays so as to facilitate implementation as a heads-up display for use in motor vehicles for",
