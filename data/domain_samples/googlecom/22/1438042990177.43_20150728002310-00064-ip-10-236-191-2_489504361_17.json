This is because, without modulation, the under-sampling pulses occur at the same point of subsequent cycles of the input signal 2004. As a result, the under-samples form a constant output baseband signal. If the input signal 2004 includes lower frequency changes, such as amplitude, frequency, phase, etc., or any combination thereof, the charge stored during associated under-samples reflects the lower frequency changes, resulting in similar changes on the demodulated baseband signal. For example, to directly down-convert a 900 MHZ input signal to a demodulated baseband signal (i.e., zero IF), the frequency of the control signal 2006 would be calculated as follows: (Freqinput\u2212FreqIF)/n=Freqcontrol (900 MHZ\u22120 MHZ)/n=900 MHZ/n For n=0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the frequency of the control signal 2006 should be substantially equal to 1.8 GHz, 900 MHZ, 450 MHZ, 300 MHZ, 225 MHZ, etc., 682891=UFU module 12812 comprises a pulse-shaping circuit 12954, a first reference potential 12956, a filter 12958, a second reference potential 12960, a resistor 12962, and a UFT module 12810., 530791=At the rising edge of \u03c62 at time t\u22121, a switch 1954 in the down-convert and delay module 1924 closes, allowing a capacitor 1956 to charge to the level of the capacitor 1952.

The input signal is down-converted according to a control signal. The control signal under-samples the input signal., 683996=The output of UFT module 12810 is a harmonically rich signal 12966. Harmonically rich signal 12966 has a fundamental frequency and phase substantially proportional to control signal 12964, and an amplitude substantially proportional to the amplitude of second reference potential 12956. Each of the harmonics of harmonically rich signal 12966 also have phase proportional to control signal 12964, and in a PM or PSK embodiment are thus considered to be PM or PSK modulated., 690547=Embodiments are provided below for implementing QPSK transmitters and receivers that may be implemented in WLAN stations, according to embodiment of the present invention. For example, the QPSK transmitters described below may be implemented in transmit DSSS PMD sublayer 12900 to transmit DQPSK modulated WLAN signals.

As described above, many embodiments exist for UFD module 12814. For instance, in embodiments, oscillator 12927, or both oscillator 12927 and pulse-shaping circuit 12929, may be external to UFD module 12814., 695595=The phase of \u201cI\u201d-oscillating signal 12996 is shifted by phase shifter 12990 to create \u201cQ\u201d-oscillating signal 12998. Phase shifter 12990 preferably shifts the phase of \u201cI\u201d-oscillating signal 12996 by 90 degrees., 350756=As another example, to down-convert a FSK signal to an amplitude shift keying (ASK) signal (a subset of AM), either the lower frequency F1 or the upper frequency F2 of the FSK signal is down-converted to zero IF. For example, to down-convert an FSK signal having F1 equal to 900 MHZ and F2 equal to 901 MHZ, to an ASK signal, the aliasing rate of the control signal 2006 should be substantially equal to: (900 MHZ\u22120 MHZ)/n=900 MHZ/n, or (901 MHZ\u22120 MHZ)/n=901 MHZ/n. For the former case of 900 MHZ/n, and for n=0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the frequency of the control signal 2006 should be substantially equal to 1.8 GHz, 900 MHZ, 450 MHZ, 300 MHZ, 225 MHZ, etc. For the latter case of 901 MHZ/n, and for n=0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the frequency of the control signal 2006 should be substantially equal to 1.802 GHz, 901 MHZ, 450.5 MHZ, 300.333 MHZ, 225.25 MHZ, etc. The frequency of the down-converted AM signal is substantially equal to the difference between the lower frequency F1 and the upper frequency F2 (i.e., 1 MHZ)., 518490=The UDF module 1702 effectively performs various types of filtering, including but not limited to bandpass filtering, low pass filtering, high pass filtering, notch filtering, all pass filtering, band stop filtering, etc., and combinations thereof., 726921=Down-converted \u201cQ\u201d signal 12967 is optionally amplified by second optional amplifier 12957 and optionally filtered by second optional filter 12959, and a second information output signal 12971 is output., 697537=Filter 12994 filters out the undesired harmonic frequencies, and outputs an transmitted modulated signal 12924 at the desired harmonic frequency or frequencies., 552666=As noted above, the computers 2512 and 2526 interact with the network 2534 via wireless links. In embodiments of the invention, the interfaces 2514, 2528 in computers 2512, 2526 represent modulator/demodulators (modems)., 359284=In step 12206, a DC offset voltage in the down-converted signal generated during step 12204 is reduced. In an embodiment, the DC offset voltage is generated at least by charge injection effects due to interaction of the control signal with the universal frequency down-conversion module, as further described above., 696720=Harmonically rich \u201cI\u201d signal 12903 and harmonically rich \u201cQ\u201d signal 12905 are preferably rectangular waves, such as square waves or pulses (although the invention is not limited to this embodiment), and are comprised of pluralities of sinusoidal waves whose frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of the waveforms. These sinusoidal waves are referred to as the harmonics of the underlying waveforms, and a Fourier analysis will determine the amplitude of each harmonic., 377023=In step 12304, the input signal is frequency down-converted with a first universal frequency down-conversion module to a first down-converted signal, according to a first control signal. In an embodiment, the input signal is frequency down-converted to a non-inverted I-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal. For instance, in an embodiment, a first phase of the in-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal is under-sampled. In an embodiment, the RF I/Q modulated signal may be under-sampled every 3.0 cycles of a frequency of the RF I/Q modulated signal by the first control signal. Furthermore, in embodiments, a first DC offset voltage in the first down-converted signal is reduced by a capacitor of the first universal frequency down-conversion module., 257101=\u201cMethod and System for Frequency Up-Conversion with a Variety of Transmitter Configurations,\u201d Ser.

In embodiments, a third DC offset voltage in the third down-converted signal and a fourth DC offset voltage in the fourth down-converted signal cancel one another., 350222=Frequency of the down-converted signal=0 (i.e., baseband) (Freqinput\u2212FreqIF)/n=Freqcontrol (900 MHZ\u22120 MHZ)/n=900 MHZ/n For n=0.5, 1, 2, 3, etc., the frequency of the control signal 2006 should be substantially equal to 1.8 GHz, 900 MHZ, 450 MHZ, 300 MHZ, 225 MHZ, etc. The frequency of the down-converted PSK signal is substantially equal to one half the difference between the lower frequency F1 and the upper frequency F2., 510499=Redundant spectrums 2208 a\u2013n are centered on unmodulated spectrum 2209 (at f, Hz), and adjacent spectrums are separated by f2 Hz. The number of redundant spectrums 2208 a\u2013n generated by generator 2311 is arbitrary and unlimited, similar to spectrums 2206 a\u2013n discussed above. Therefore, optional spectrum processing module 2304 may also include a filter with passband 2325 to select, for example, spectrums 2208 c,d for transmission over communications medium 2108. In addition, optional spectrum processing module 2304 may also include a filter (such as a bandstop filter) to attenuate unmodulated spectrum 2209. Alternatively, unmodulated spectrum 2209 may be attenuated by using phasing techniques during redundant spectrum generation. Finally, (optional) medium interface module 2320 transmits redundant spectrums 2208 c,d over communications medium 2108., 684551=Harmonically rich signal 12966 is received by filter 12958. Filter 12958 preferably has a high Q. Filter 12958 preferably selects the harmonic of harmonically rich signal 12966 that is at the approximate frequency desired for transmission. Filter 12958 removes the undesired frequencies that exist as harmonic components of harmonically rich signal 12966. Filter 12958 outputs UFU module output signal 12952., 518778=Conceptually, the UDF module 1702 includes a frequency translator 1708. The frequency translator 1708 conceptually represents that portion of the UDF module 1702 that performs frequency translation (down conversion)., 697260=Harmonically rich \u201cI\u201d signal 12903 and harmonically rich \u201cQ\u201d signal 12905 are combined by summer 12992 to create harmonically rich \u201cI/Q\u201d signal 12907. Summers are well known to persons skilled in the relevant art(s)., 609221=In the second state, state 12604, the station has been authenticated. This is indicated by the authentication state being true. In state 12604, however, the station has not yet associated. In state 12604, additional frame types are allowed, beyond those allowed in state 12602. The additional frame types provide the capability for a station in state 12604 to implement the association, re-association, and disassociation services. If a station is not successful in becoming associated, it will remain in state 12604, unless it receives a de-authentication notification. If it receives a de-authentication notification, it will return to state 12602 via a transition 12610, and authentication state will be made false. If a station becomes associated, setting association state to true, it will travel along a transition 12612 to a state 12606., 725492=Phase shifter 12951 receives \u201cI\u201d oscillating signal 12961, and outputs \u201cQ\u201d oscillating signal 12963, which is a replica of \u201cI\u201d oscillating signal 12961 shifted preferably by 90\ufffd., 796075=All information contained in the service field, PSDU 13910, tail field 13912, and pad field 13914 are encoded using a convolutional encoding rate R=\ufffd, \u2154, or % corresponding to the desired data rate. Convolutional encoding is generated using the following polynomials; g0=133 8 and g 1=1718 of rate R=\ufffd. Puncture codes are used for the higher data rates. Industry standard algorithms, such as the Viterbi algorithm, are recommended for decoding., 733030=SFD: This field contains information marking the start of a PSDU frame. A common SFD is specified for all IEEE 802.11 FHSS radios using the following bit pattern: 00001100101111101. The left most bit is transmitted first., 535934=Further at the rising edge of \u03c61 at time t+1, the switch 1966 in the second delay module 1930 closes, allowing the capacitor 1968 to charge to the level of the capacitor 1964. Accordingly, the capacitor 1968 charges to VOt, as indicated by cell 1846 of Table 1802., 726660=Down-converted \u201cI\u201d signal 12965 is optionally amplified by first optional amplifier 12953 and optionally filtered by first optional filter 12955, and a first information output signal 12969 is output., 379170=In step 12310, the input signal is frequency down-converted with a third universal frequency down-conversion module to a third down-converted signal, according to a third control signal. In an embodiment, the input signal is frequency down-converted to a non-inverted Q-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal. For instance, in an embodiment, a third phase of the quadrature-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal is under-sampled. The RF I/Q modulated signal may be under-sampled 0.75 cycles of the frequency of the RF I/Q modulated signal after under-sampling of the RF I/Q modulated signal occurs in step 12304, for example. Furthermore, in embodiments, a third DC offset voltage in the third down-converted signal is reduced by a capacitor of the third universal frequency down-conversion module., 723814=Receiver 12930 comprises an oscillator 12949, a first UFD module 12941, a second UFD module 12943, a first UFT module 12945, a second UFT module 12947, a phase shifter 12951, a first optional amplifier 12953, a first filter 12955, a second optional amplifier 12957, and a second filter 12959., 378837=In step 12308, the second down-converted signal is subtracted from the first down-converted signal to form a first output signal. In embodiments, a first DC offset voltage in the first down-converted signal and a second DC offset voltage in the second down-converted signal cancel one another., 694972=Oscillator 12988 generates an \u201cI\u201d-oscillating signal 12996., 380042=In step 12312, the input signal is frequency down-converted with a fourth universal frequency down-conversion module to a fourth down-converted signal, according to a fourth control signal. In an embodiment, the input signal is frequency down-converted to an inverted I-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal. For instance, in an embodiment, a fourth phase of the quadrature-phase signal portion of the RF I/Q modulated signal is under-sampled, wherein the fourth phase of the quadrature-phase signal portion is of an opposite phase to the third phase under-sampled of the quadrature-phase signal portion. In an embodiment, the RF I/Q modulated signal may be sampled 1.5 cycles of the frequency of the RF I/Q modulated signal after under-sampling of the RF I/Q modulated signal occurs in step 12304, for example. Furthermore, in embodiments, a fourth DC offset voltage in the fourth down-converted signal is reduced by a capacitor of fourth universal frequency down-conversion module., 344689=Alternatively, to down-convert an input FM signal to a non-FM signal, a frequency within the FM bandwidth must be down-converted to baseband (i.e., zero IF). As an example, to down-convert a frequency shift keying (FSK) signal (a sub-set of FM) to a phase shift keying (PSK) signal (a subset of PM), the mid-point between a lower frequency F1 and an upper frequency F2 (that is, [(F1+F2)\ufffd2]) of the FSK signal is down-converted to zero IF. For example, to down-convert an FSK signal having F1 equal to 899 MHZ and F2 equal to 901 MHZ, to a PSK signal, the aliasing rate of the control signal 2006 would be calculated as follows:, 706242=De-spread correlator 12928 receives transmitted modulated signal 12924 from antenna 12926, and receives an 11-bit Barker word. De-spread correlator 12928 convolves the received signal with the 11-bit Barker word and correlates it, and outputs a de-spread signal 12938. The design and use of a conventional de-spread correlator 12928 is well known to those skilled in the relevant art(s). A suitable conventional de-spread correlator 12928 may be designed and implemented in software, firmware, hardware, and any combination thereof, or it may be purchased \u201coff the shelf.\u201d, 538387=Further details of unified down-conversion and filtering as described in this section are presented in U.S. Pat. No. 6,049,706 \u201cIntegrated Frequency Translation And Selectivity,\u201d filed Oct. 21, 1998, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 505866=Redundant spectrums 2206 a\u2013n are substantially centered around f1, which is the characteristic frequency of first oscillating signal 2305. Also, each redundant spectrum 2206 a\u2013n (except for 2206 c) is offset from f1 by approximately a multiple of f2 (Hz), where f2 is the frequency of the second oscillating signal 2312. Thus, each redundant spectrum 2206 a\u2013n is offset from an adjacent redundant spectrum by f2 (Hz). This allows the spacing between adjacent redundant spectrums to be adjusted (or tuned) by changing f2 that is associated with second oscillator 2309. Adjusting the spacing between adjacent redundant spectrums allows for dynamic real-time tuning of the bandwidth occupied by redundant spectrums 2206 a\u2013n., 685055=Further details pertaining to UFU module 12812 are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,940 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Frequency Up-Conversion,\u201d filed Oct. 21, 1998, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 517242=The effect achieved by the UDF module 1702 is to perform the frequency selectivity operation prior to the performance of the frequency translation operation. Thus, the UDF module 1702 effectively performs input filtering., 771567=SFD: This field contains information that marks the start of a PPDU frame. A common SFD is specified for all IEEE 802.11 IR implementations. The SFD is represented by the following bit pattern: 1001, 610168=In the third state, state 12606, the station has been both authenticated and associated, indicated by both authentication state and association state being true. In this state, all frame types are allowed and the station may use the data delivery service. A station will remain in state 12606 until receiving either a disassociation notification or a de-authentication notification, or until it re-associates with another station. If a station receives a disassociation notification, it will travel along a transition 12614 to state 12604 and set association state to false. If a station receives a de-authentication notification, it will travel along a transition 12616 to state 12602 and set both authentication state and association states to false., 352257=In an embodiment, the pulses of the control signal 2006 have negligible apertures that tend towards zero. This makes the UFT module 2002 a high input impedance device. This configuration is useful for situations where minimal disturbance of the input signal may be desired., 358824=In step 12202, an input signal is coupled by a series capacitor to an input of a universal frequency down-conversion module., 256721=\u201cMethod and System for Down-Converting Electromagnetic. Signals Including Resonant Structures for Enhanced Energy Transfer,\u201d Ser. No. 09/293,342, filed Apr. 16, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,687,493., 692484=Signal separator 12972 separates filtered signal 12922 into two signals: first information signal 12974 and second information signal 12976. When filtered signal 12922 is a bused signal, signal separator 12972 may merely be a location on the bus where filtered signal 12922 is separated into separate buses or data signals, for instance. Signal separator 12972 may alternatively comprise logic and memory for receiving and storing filtered signal 12922, and logically dividing it into the two signals. A suitable signal separator 12972 may be designed and implemented in software, firmware, hardware, and any combination thereof., 724216=Oscillator 12949 provides an oscillating signal used by both first UFD module 12941 and second UFD module 12943 via the phase shifter 12951. Oscillator 12949 generates an \u201cI\u201d oscillating signal 12961., 881552=In July of 1998, the IEEE 802.11 Working Group adopted CCK as the basis for the high rate extension to deliver PSDU frames at speeds of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps. CCK was adopted because it provides for interoperability with existing IEEE 802.111 and 2 Mbps systems by maintaining the same bandwidth and incorporating the existing DSSS PHY PLCP preamble and header., 535269=At time t+1, at the rising edge of \u03c61, the switch 1950 in the down-convert and delay module 1924 closes, allowing the capacitor 1952 to charge to VIt+1. Therefore, node 1902 is at VIt+1, as indicated by cell 1838 of Table 1802., 563010=The transmitter module 2912 includes an optional D/A converter 2922, an I/Q modulator section 2918, one or more IF sections 2916, an RF section 2914, and a frequency generator/synthesizer 2920. The I/Q modulator section 2918 includes mixers 2924, a phase shifter 2926, and a signal combiner 2928. The phase shifter 2926 operates the mixers 2924 ninety degrees out of phase with one another to generate I and Q modulated information signals 2930 and 2932, respectively, which are combined by the signal combiner 2928. The IF section(s) 2916 and RF section 2914 up-convert the combined I and Q modulated information signals 2930 and 2932 to RF for transmission by the antenna, in a manner well known in the relevant art(s)., 519055=The UDF module 1702 also conceptually includes an apparent input filter 1706 (also sometimes called an input filtering emulator). Conceptually, the apparent input filter 1706 represents that portion of the UDF module 1702 that performs input filtering., 341496=When the aliasing rate of control signal 2006 is off-set from the frequency of input signal 2004, or off-set from a harmonic or sub-harmonic thereof, input signal 2004 is down-converted to an IF signal. This is because the under-sampling pulses occur at different phases of subsequent cycles of input signal 2004. As a result, the under-samples form a lower frequency oscillating pattern. If the input signal 2004 includes lower frequency changes, such as amplitude, frequency, phase, etc., or any combination thereof, the charge stored during associated under-samples reflects the lower frequency changes, resulting in similar changes on the down-converted IF signal. For example, to down-convert a 901 MHZ input signal to a 1 MHZ IF signal, the frequency of the control signal 2006 would be calculated as follows: (Freqinput,\u2212FreqIF)/n=Freqcontrol (901 MHZ-1 MHZ)/n=900/n For n=0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the frequency of the control signal 2006 would be substantially equal to 1.8 GHz, 900 MHZ, 450 MHZ, 300 MHZ, 225 MHZ, etc., 520740=The invention exhibits additional advantages. For example, the filtering center frequency fC of the UDF module 1702 can be electrically adjusted, either statically or dynamically., 503149=An advantage of the present invention should now be apparent. The recovery of modulating baseband signal 2202 can be accomplished by receiver 2112 in spite of the fact that high strength jamming signal(s) (e.g. jamming signal spectrum 2211) exist on the communications medium. The intended baseband signal can be recovered because multiple redundant spectrums are transmitted, where each redundant spectrum carries the necessary information to reconstruct the baseband signal. At the destination, the redundant spectrums are isolated from each other so that the baseband signal can be recovered even if one or more of the redundant spectrums are corrupted by a jamming signal., 675199=Scrambler 12904 receives a PPDU signal 12914. In embodiments, PPDU signal 12914 comprises one or more whole PPDU frames and/or portions of PPDU frames. For example, in DSSS PMD embodiments transmitting according to DBPSK modulation, PPDU signal 12914 may comprise a PLCP preamble, a PLCP header, and/or an MPDU. In DSSS PMD embodiments transmitting according to DQPSK modulation, PPDU signal 12914 may comprise an MPDU. In alternate embodiments, the DSSS PMD PLCP preamble, PLCP header, and MPDU may be modulated according to any of the modulation schemes described herein., 533111=Also at the rising edge of \u03c61 at time t, the switch 1958 in the first delay module 1928 closes, thereby allowing the capacitor 1960 to charge to VOt. Accordingly, node 1906 is at VOt. This is indicated in cell 1820 in Table 1802., 610995=A station must react to frames it receives in each of the states, even those frames that are disallowed for a particular state. A station will send a de-authentication notification to any station with which it is not authenticated if it receives frames that are not allowed in state 12602. A station will send a disassociation notification to any station with which it is authenticated, but not associated, if it receives frames not allowed in state 12604.

The structure and operation of transmit DSSS PMD 12900 is applicable to transmit HR/DSSS PMD 14300, and is hence considered incorporated in transmit HR/DSSS PMD 14300. Refer to Section 6.6.2.6.1 above for detailed description of transmission of DBPSK and DQPSK modulated signals by transmit HR/DSSS PMD 14300. The transmission of CCK and PBCC modulated signal is described below., 534290=Also at the rising edge of \u03c62 at time t, the switch 1962 in the first delay module 1928 closes, allowing the capacitor 1964 to charge to the level in the capacitor 1960.
