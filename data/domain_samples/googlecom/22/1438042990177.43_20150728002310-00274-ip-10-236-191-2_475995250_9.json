    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30388=The twisted ferroelectric liquid-crystal modulator of FIG. 1 was fabricated and optically tested. Indium-tin-oxide was deposited on soda-lime glass substrates and patterned to produce a 1 cm\ufffd1 cm area. The aligning material was poly(1,4-butylene terephthalate) coated to a thickness of about 30 nm and then buffed in a single direction. These cell side assemblies were placed together with the buffing directions perpendicular to each other and with spherical spacers of 2.5 \u03bcm diameter defining the gap. The resultant gap was measured at 2.6 \u03bcm. The gap was filled with a ferroelectric liquid crystal, Type CS 2004 commercially available from the Chisso Corporation. Following the procedure described by Patel et al. in \"Alignment of liquid crystals which exhibit cholesteric to smectic C* phase transitions,\" Journal of Applied Physics, volume 59, 1986, pp. 2355-2360, a large AC electric field was applied to the sample at an elevated temperature close to the transition temperature of about 62\ufffd C. between the cholesteric and smectic C* phases to cause the smectic layers to be aligned at\u02dc45\ufffd to the rubbing axes. That is, the smectic C* liquid crystal is aligned with one of its two stable tilt angles parallel to the adjacent rubbing axis. Polar surface interactions breaks the degeneracy between the two possible layer orientations with respect to the rubbing axes. With such an alignment procedure, the stable tilt angle is nearly temperature independent at 45\ufffd. An ideal liquid-crystal material would convert directly from the isotropic phase into the smectic C* phase with a 45\ufffd alignment of the smectic layers with respect to the rubbing direction. For a particular layer orientation, two domains were sometimes observed, corresponding to the two possible director orientations in the middle of the cell, that is, the two precession directions. It is possible to convert such sample to a mono-domain sample by leaving the sample in a high AC electric field of 50 V/\u03bcm for a minute. In the experimental example, polarizers in an optical microscope replaced the polarizing sheets., 18402=On the other hand, several classes of ferroelectric liquid-crystal devices have been proposed. See, for example, the review articles by Patel et al., \"Ferroelectric liquid crystal devices,\" Proceedings of SPIE, volume 613, 1986, pp. 130-134 and \"Properties and applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals\", Optical Engineering, volume 26, 1987, pp. 373-384. A ferroelectric liquid crystal is one in which the liquid-crystal molecule is chiral and forms smectic layers. In such a system, a polarization develops having a vector direction within the plane of the layer and perpendicular to the director. See Patel, \"Electro-optics of ferroelectric liquid crystals,\" Proceedings of SPIE, volume 567, 1985, pp. 81-85. In most ferroelectric liquid-crystal devices, such as disclosed by Isogai et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,586,791, the material is confined between two glass plates such that the director lies in the surface plane at the surfaces. In this geometry, if the cell surfaces are rubbed in a particular direction, then the smectic layers develop in the smectic A phase such that the smectic planar layers are normal to the surface and the layer normal is parallel to the rubbing direction. When this material is cooled into the smectic C phase, two degenerate states are possible, due to the fact that the tilt angle in the smectic C* phase has a non-zero value of the tilt angle (defined with respect to the layer normal) and it could be positive or negative. Thus, in presence of an electric field applied across the two surfaces, the spontaneous polarization couples with the applied electric field and forces the molecules to reorient such that the molecules are collinear throughout the cell. The orientation of the molecules is such that it lies in the surface plane and at an angle equal to the tilt angle with respect to the rubbing axis. The direction of the applied electric field determines whether the molecules tilt at positive or negative tilt angles. When the prior-art smectic C* liquid crystals are so formed, the low temperature tilt angle is generally about \ufffd22\ufffd but it then decreases with temperature to a 0\ufffd tilt angle, at which point there is a transition to the cholesteric phase., 37415=A twisted ferroelectric liquid-crystal Fabry-Perot filter was fabricated and tested. Its fabrication followed that of Example 1, but interference mirrors were added following the disclosure of the Patel patents. Alignment layers were deposited on top of the interference layers following the procedures disclosed by Patel et al. in the Journal of Applied Physics article. The gap was made to 6.5 \u03bcm thick. The CS 2004 ferroelectric liquid crystal was filled into the gap in the isotropic phase. The electric field treatment disclosed by Patel et al. produced mono-domain samples., 32507=The optical modulator of the example was tested using an arbitrary-waveform generator programmed to produce a 5 ms pulse of amplitude V followed by no voltage for 5 ms and then a similar pulse of opposite polarity. This sequence avoided prolonged DC field exposure found to produce gradual changes in the transmitted intensity. The liquid-crystal cell was precisely held at a temperature near room temperature. Visible light irradiated the cell, and the transmitted intensity was detected by a photo-diode, the output pulses of which were monitored on an oscilloscope. The data of FIG. 4 show the relative intensities for both the positive and negative pulses, which are equal. The polarizers 22 and 24 were arranged to have their polarization directions to be perpendicular, which is the configuration of FIGS. 1-3, for the data of curve 46 and to be parallel for the data of curve 48. Thus, changing the relative orientations nearly reverses the voltage dependence of the contrast. The lack of total mirror symmetry between the curves 46 and 48 indicates that the waveguiding condition of Eqn. (1) is not fully satisfied. Thus, the gray scale of transmission is wavelength dependent and should be optimized for a given wavelength by choice of the sample thickness. The contrast saturates above 2 V, at which point the contrast ratio is better than 25:1. Yet higher voltages degrade the contrast because they reorient the molecules at the surface. Switching times are less than a millisecond for both the electrically driven untwisting and the electrically driven retwisting, but they improve at higher temperatures. The short switching times apparently derive from the fact that the surface molecules need not reorient.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The liquid-crystal modulator of the invention may be easily fabricated in two-dimensional arrays by dividing each of the electrodes 14 and 16 into perpendicular arrays of linearly extending parallel electrodes. The invention thus allows an inexpensive liquid-crystal modulator array having an easily controlled gray scale. The assembled cell was exposed to 1.5 \u03bcm light from a light-emitting diode. When a sufficiently high voltage (greater than 10 V/\u03bcm) was applied to the liquid crystal to saturate (completely untwist) it, a total of four transmission peaks were observed. Peaks at 1.4916 and 1.6388 \u03bcm correspond to eigenmodes polarized along the long axis of the molecules with mode numbers 12 and 13 while the peaks at 1.4836 and 1.6148 correspond to the eigenmodes polarized along the short axis with mode numbers 13 and 14. Restricting the discussion to a single mode number, if a polarizer is added with its polarization axis aligned with one of the stable liquid-crystal states, one wavelength is passed with a positive applied voltage and the other wavelength is passed with a negative applied voltage. It is however pointed out that prolonged exposure of the liquid crystal to a DC bias electrochemically degrades the liquid crystal because of charge migration. The switching times were measured to be between 2 and 4 ms for switching between resonances although it took less than 450 \u03bc s to switch out of resonance. It may be possible to improve",
