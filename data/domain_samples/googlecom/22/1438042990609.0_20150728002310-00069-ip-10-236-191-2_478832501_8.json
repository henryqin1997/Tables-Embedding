    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although various specific constructions have been given for the present invention, it is to be understood that these are for illustrative purposes only. Various modifications and adaptations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the substance or scope of the invention. For example, although the transmission line segments have been described as rotating along with rotating frame or gantry 15 (FIG. 1) and the coupler has been described as attached to stationary frame 12 (FIG. 1), it is equally possible to instead have the transmission line segments stationary and the coupler mounted on the rotating frame, i.e., stationary and rotating mechanical mounting for the coupler and transmission line segments can be readily interchanged with equally effective results. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the claims appended hereto. FIG. 6 shows a simplified block diagram of an exemplary receiver 400, such as a differential pulse-amplitude (DPAM) modulation receiver that can be conveniently employed for receiving the respective modulated signals in the differentially driven transmission line. If desired, full use of the differential signals can be achieved by using a 180\ufffd hybrid power combiner 402, i.e., power combiner 402 combines the substantially out-of-phase modulated signals into a single combined output signal. A bandpass filter 404 is centered at the predetermined carrier frequency, and protects from outside interference the combined output signal from",
