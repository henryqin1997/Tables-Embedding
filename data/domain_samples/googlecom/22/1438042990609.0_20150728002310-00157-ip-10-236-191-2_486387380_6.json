The process as per the invention may be used when looking for anti-bodies developed during all infectious diseases of bacterial, fungic, viral or parasitic origin, in hormonology the anti-bodies occurring in any biological fluid: blood, urine, etc. In the case of an isotopic reading, the compound is replaced by an anti-body marked at I 125 and the reaction can be interpreted after only 2 hours. The whole of the reactions take approximately 3 hours. The time may probably be shortened because of the greater degree of contact achieved by using a tape for the development of the reactions instead of a smooth-surfaced polystyrene tube. The result is printed out on a stylo linear recorder or on a printer giving all the information stored, or on a small additional computer which inteprets the result in the light of the positivity thresholds previously calculated with check specimens. On contact with the alkaline phosphatase fixed at 13, the p.nitrophenylphosphate is transformed into yellow para-nitrophenolate. The development of this colouring takes place in an enclosure similar to enclosure 31 (not shown here) for approximately 1 hour at 37\ufffd C. At the exit from this enclosure, at 36, there is a colorimeter which measures the linear absorption through the tape, at 13, at a wavelength of 420 nm. Simultaneously, a reading is taken of the specimen number and the analysis number stored at 12. At 33",
