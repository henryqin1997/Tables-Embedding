    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6366=FIG. 11 shows the window assembly 100 including screen assembly 300. The screen assembly 300, is coupled to the outer perimeter 108 of the sash 104. In one option, the screen assembly 300 extends substantially around the outer perimeter 108. The screen assembly 300 extends to the corners of the sash 104, in another option. Optionally, the screen assembly 300 includes multiple engagement portions 402 each extending to the corners of the sash 104. In one option, foam plugs 1100 are coupled to the ends of the engagement portions 402. In another option, the foam plugs 1100 extend between the engagement portions 402 and between the sash 104 and frame 102. The foam plugs 1100 are coupled to the sash 104 and slidably coupled to the frame 102, in still another option. Optionally, the foam plugs 1100 are coupled to the sash with an adhesive, deformable barb, or the like. In one option, the engagement portions 402 extend from the sash 104 and are slidably coupled to the frame 102. As a result, a continuous screen is provided around the sash 104 and between the sash 104 and the frame 102 with the engagement portions 402 and foam plugs 1100.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36078=This document is a continuation under 37 C.F.R. 1.53(b) of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/933,686 filed Sep. 3, 2004 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,182,119, issued Feb. 27, 2007), which application is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof., 100984=Several options for the method 1300 follow. In one option, the sash has at least one corner. Optionally, a second engagement portion is coupled to the spring member, and the at least one engagement portion and the second engagement portion extend along the window frame from the at least one corner. In another option, a foam plug is coupled between the at least one engagement portion and the second engagement portion. In yet another option, the foam plug extends from the sash to the frame. Optionally, the method 1300 includes forming a foam membrane and at least one of the engagement portion and the spring member include a deformable foam membrane. In still another option, openings are formed in the at least one engagement portion. Screen material (e.g. interlaced mesh screen material) is coupled to the at least one engagement portion, in one option. Optionally, the screen material is disposed within the openings (e.g. the material of the engagement portion is folded over the screen material). In another option, the interlaced screen material is disposed over or under the openings. The method 1300 further includes, in yet another option, surrounding at least a portion of the foam membrane with a jacket., 102259=In another option, coupling the at least one spring member around the outer perimeter of the sash includes coupling the at least one spring member to a support panel. Optionally, the method 1300 includes coupling the support panel to the sash. In one option, a deformable projection coupled to the support panel is disposed within a channel extending around the outer perimeter of the sash., 50144=In one option, the sash 104 is coupled to the frame 102 through drive mechanisms. The drive mechanisms are operable for projecting the sash 104 substantially horizontally with respect to the frame 102. One example of a drive mechanism is shown in Curtis et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/933,817 filed on Sep. 3, 2004, entitled \u201cWINDOW DRIVE MECHANISM,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In one option, the drive mechanisms project the sash 104 with respect to the frame 102 with a predominant horizontal component and a vertical component. As a result, the sash 104 is translatable with respect to the frame 102., 99411=Several options for the method 1200 follow. In one option, the support panel includes a deformable projection extending along a length of the support panel, and the deformable projection is dimensioned and configured to interference fit within a sash channel. In another option, the method 1200 includes coupling a second engagement portion to the spring member. Optionally, a foam plug is coupled between the at least one engagement portion and the second engagement portion. In still another option, openings are formed in the at least one engagement portion. Screen material (e.g. wire mesh screens) is coupled to the at least one engagement portion, in one option, wherein the screen material is disposed within the openings. In another option, the engagement portion is integral to the spring member. Optionally, the engagement portion is coated with a deformable coating., 85208=The screen assembly 1002 includes a spring member 1012. In one option, the spring member 1012 extends between the sash 104 and the engagement portion 1004. In one example, the spring member 1012 is coupled to the sash 104 and the engagement portion 1004. In another option, the spring member 1012 includes a deformable membrane such as a foam membrane (e.g., a reticulated foam). Optionally, the deformable membrane includes, but is not limited to foamed rubber, filter fiber, vinyl, gel material within a sleeve or the like. In another option, the deformable membrane includes POLYDAMP\ufffd a registered trademark of Polymer Technologies, Inc., 84640=In another option, the support panel 1006 includes a projection 408 sized and shaped to fit within a channel extending along the sash 104. The projection 408 includes, optionally, barbs 410 that engage against the surfaces defining the channel to create an interference fit between the screen assembly 1002 and the sash 104. In yet another option, the screen assembly 1002 is coupled to the sash 104 with, but not limited to, adhesives, tacks, screws, staples or the like.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. It should be noted that embodiments discussed in different portions of the description or referred to in different drawings can be combined to form additional embodiments of the present application. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. Moreover, openings are formed in the screen assembly to allow ventilation. In one option, the openings are small enough to prevent the ingress of insects, leaves, dust or the like. In another option, the openings are covered with a screen material (e.g. interlaced mesh). The continuous sliding engagement of the engagement portion to the frame cooperates with the openings to prevent insect ingress while allowing ventilation around the window. In one option, the screen assembly includes a spring member and an engagement portion coupled to the spring member. In another option, the spring member is coupled to an outer perimeter of the window sash. In yet another option, the engagement portion extends from the spring member and is slidably engaged to an inner perimeter of the window frame. When the sash is translated with respect to the window",
