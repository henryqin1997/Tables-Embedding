    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19832=At power-up, the system software contained in the bubble memory 13 is down-loaded from the bubble memory into the system memory 7. A part program can be input from an external device (for example, a paper tape or cassette reader) via the program port 23, or the ASCII keyboard of the N.C. Control Station 21. The part program is stored by the I/O controller 19 in nonvolatile memory 13. The part program is transferred into system memory. The computer numerical control operates under the control of the system CPU 5 executing programs which reside in the system memory. The system CPU directs the execution of part programs through the axis controller 9 and the analog and digital I/O controllers 15 and 17, respectively, which are all connected to the machine tool 27. Local digital I/O component 17 generates digitized actuator control signals and monitors the status of contact inputs. The local analog I/O component 15 enables the numerical control to control low precision servo driven devices. The axis controller 9 supplies variable dc voltage to axis feed drives contained in the machine tool to control axes and spindle movements. The axis controller is explained in further detail in copending application Ser. No. 415,507, filed Sept. 7, 1982 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,515,814, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) and assigned to the instant assignee., 33922=Although the method of defining and executing canned cycles is applicable with any type of computer numerical control, the implementation disclosed herein is particularly applicable for use with a Mark Century\ufffd 2000 CNC available from General Electric Company. The hardware architecture for the Mark Century 2000 CNC is shown in FIG. 1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to one preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The foregoing describes a method for defining and using customized canned cycles in a computer numerical controlled machine where both the original equipment manufacturer and the end user can alter the canned cycles supplied by the controller manufacturer or completely redefine the canned cycles. Although the method of defining and executing canned cycles is applicable with any type of computer numerical control, the implementation disclosed herein is particularly applicable for use with a Mark Century\ufffd 2000 CNC available from General Electric Company. The hardware architecture for the Mark Century 2000 CNC is shown in FIG. 1. The block synchronization task 39 retrieves axis records from the axis record queue and sends appropriate commands to the axis controller 9 and machine control logic 41. The axis board and the MCL, in turn, respond with axis motion and MCL functions, such as coolant on, operator feedhold off, etc. An explanation of the execution of a customized canned cycle will now be given with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. Executing a program containing a customized canned cycle can be performed by entering a part program 24 from a part tape or from",
