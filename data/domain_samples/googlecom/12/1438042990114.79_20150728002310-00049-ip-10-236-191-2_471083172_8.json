No. 4,795,454, entitled \"Absorbent Article Having Leakage-Resistant Dual Cuffs\" issued to Dragoo on Jan. 3, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference. As shown in FIG. 4, the topsheet 80 comprises a primary layer 86 and barrier layers 88 joined to and extending laterally outwardly from the primary layer 86. The primary layer 86 is a liquid pervious material allowing liquids to rapidly penetrate through its thickness and be absorbed by the absorbent core. The two barrier layers 88 are preferably hydrophobic to prevent leakage out the sides of the diaper and are more preferably drawable to strengthen the stretch laminates., 135511=A secondary \"barrier\" is created by a second elastic spacing member 894 operatively joined with said flap intermediate said proximal edge and said distal edge, preferably at least about 12.5 mm (about 0.5 in) from the elastic spacing members 94. The second elastic spacing member 894 is preferably joined to the flap between the flap and the containment layer 814. Since the containment layer is most preferably joined to the flap at spaced apart zones (adjacent the proximal edge 895 and adjacent the folded over portion of the flap) such that an intermediate portion of the containment layer is unsecured to the flap, the second elastic spacing member is preferably joined to the flap adjacent this intermediate portion such that the second spacing elastic member tends to space the flap away from the containment layer 814 to form a pocket. The second elastic spacing member 894 thus provides a more breathable section of flap adjacent the body since only the nonwoven flap contacts the body. The second elastic spacing member 894 is preferably operatively joined with the flap at a lower force than the elastic spacing members 94 so as to not affect the functionality of the elastic spacing member 94 but to space the flap away from the containment layer 814. The second elastic spacing member 894 is operatively joined in an elastically contractible condition, preferably being secured only adjacent its ends such than an intermediate portion is unsecured to the flap (i.e., it is secured in a manner to form a drawstring elastic as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,025 entitled \"Disposable Diaper Having An Improved Leg Conforming Cuff\" issued to Richardson on Mar. 28, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference) to allow the second spacing elastic member 894 to float within the flap, within the space defined by the flap and the containment layer, so as to provide softness and flexibility as well as better breathability/skin health by spacing the breathable nonwoven flap away from the containment layer and contact the body., 115022=A preferred embodiment of the absorbent core has an asymmetric, modified hourglass shape and has a body surface toward the body of the wearer (inner surface) and a garment surface opposite the body surface. An exemplary absorbent structure for use as the absorbent core of the present invention that has achieved wide acceptance and commercial success is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,420 entitled \"Absorbent Structures Containing Stiflened Fibers and Superabsorbent Material\" issued to Cook, Lash, Moore, & Young on Nov. 1, 1994. These references are incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the absorbent core will comprise an acquisition/distribution layer of chemically stiffened cellulosic fibers and a storage layer positioned beneath the acquisition/distribution layer comprising a mixture of wood pulp fibers and superabsorbent material such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,610,478 entitled \"High-Density Absorbent Structures\" issued to Weisman and Goldman on Sep. 9, 1986, and incorporated herein by reference., 43735=In order to solve this deficiency in balloon-style pants, some manufacturers have positioned elastic strands across the entire front and back regions of the product. For example, WO 93/17648 published on Sep. 16, 1993, discloses a pant-type diaper in which the front and/or the rear pans are elastically contractible and the ends of the absorbent core are disposed in these regions. These additional elastic strands act to contract the entire front and back waist parts of the pant including the end areas of the absorbent core. This allows greater expansion of the product in the waist region but causes the absorbent core to be gathered and bunch at the waist opening. This gathering and bunching results in a higher risk of leakage at the waist since channels are created along the absorbent core that allows body exudates to wick or flow out of the waist. This gathering of the absorbent core also affects the appearance of the product in that the product does not appear as aesthetically pleasing as the balloon style pants., 77422=Because the chassis layer 40 is preferably a polymeric film, it is also generally impervious to liquids (e.g., urine) so that it may also serve as the component which prevents exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent core from wetting garments which contact the pull-on diaper such as bed sheets and undergarments (i.e., it acts as the traditional diaper backsheet). If the chassis layer is not liquid impervious, typically an additional layer such as a traditional backsheet should be used behind the absorbent core. The chassis layer may also be breathable (pervious to air or water vapor) if desired. In particular, since the belt layers, and preferably the barrier layers, are each drawable nonwoven webs to strengthen the stretch laminates to carry the forces and since there is no need for a high lateral tensile strength material in the crotch region, the chassis layer can alternatively comprise breathable materials that are microporous and that are, typically, lower in strength and elongation. An example of such a film is that manufactured by Exxon Chemical Company under the tradename EXXAIRE. Exemplary films for use as the chassis layer of the present invention having relatively good drawability but that are not breathable include polymeric films manufactured by Clopay Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio under the designation Clopay 1401, or films available from Tredegar of Terre Haute, Ind., under the designation X-8323 or X-9954., 104585=Referring to FIG. 1, the seams 32 are preferably formed by bonding together the seam panels 66 of the front region 26 with the seam panels 66' of the back region 28. The seams 32 can be formed in a number of different ways. For example, the seams can be formed by bonding together portions of outwardly extending seam panels to form an outwardly extending fin seam, bonding together portions of inwardly extending seam panels to form an inwardly extending fin seam, the seam panels may be overlapped and bonded together to form lap seams, or the seam panels may be bonded together using any other seam configurations that are known in the art, such as a flangeless side seam. An example of a flangeless seam is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,430 entitled \"Disposable Training Pant Having Fusion-Slit Side Seams\" issued to Russell P. Bridges on Aug. 17, 1993, which patent is incorporated herein by reference. The bonding of the seams of the present invention can be by any suitable means well known in the art appropriate for the specific materials employed in the seam panels. Thus, sonic sealing, heat sealing, pressure bonding, adhesive bonding, sewing, autogeneous bonding, and the like may be appropriate techniques., 85270=The elastic extensibility in the side panels may be provided by a number of different materials and configurations. Various components of the belt (e.g., the belt layers or the chassis layer) may comprise conventional elastic materials or the side panels of the belt may be constructed front a number of different elastic laminate structures. For example, the side panels of the belt can comprise an elastic material operatively joined to one or more inelastic components (belt layer or chassis layer or both) in an elastically contractible condition such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 entitled \"Contractable Side Portions For A Disposable Diaper\" issued to Buell on Jan. 14, 1975, which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the side panels can comprise a structural elastic-like film (SELF) web such as described in WO 95/03765, \"Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-like Behavior\", The Procter & Gamble Company, published Feb. 9, 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference. While the side panels of the belt may be constructed from a number of different extensible or elastic materials as are known in the art, one or more, and preferably each, of the side panels of the belt are constructed of a stretch laminate., 44784=Another type training pant is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,464 issued to Van Gompel, et al. on Jul. 10, 1990, wherein a pant-like garment is formed by attaching discrete stretchable members to the side edges of the main body of the garment. This stretchable member allows the article to fit variations in size as the stretchable member expands to meet the size of the wearer. However, the seaming of the main body with the stretchable members are a major problem in the product and in the manufacturing process. The seams must be made extremely strong and capable of handling great forces during application and use. A pant undergoes severe forces and stresses during use which may cause the side panels to break away or tear from the main body portion. Further, controlling these separate stretchable members severely complicates the manufacturing process and causes these pants to be more costly to the consumer. The seams to the main body portion also tend to concentrate the fitment forces at the top and bottom of the product resulting in increased seam tearing and poorer fit of the garment., 91292=The elastic panel members can be operatively joined in the stretch laminate to the chassis layer, the belt layers, or both, using either an intermittent bonding configuration or a substantially continuous bonding configuration. As used herein, an \"intermittently\" bonded laminate web means a laminate web wherein the plies are initially bonded to one another at discrete spaced apart points or a laminate web wherein the plies are substantially unbonded to one another at discrete spaced apart areas. Conversely, a \"substantially continuously\" bonded laminate web means a laminate web wherein the plies are initially bonded substantially continuously to one another throughout the areas of interface. Because it is preferred that the stretch laminate be bonded over all or a significant portion of the stretch laminate so that the inelastic webs (belt layers, chassis layer, and barrier layers) elongate or draw without causing rupture, and the layers of the stretch laminates are preferably bonded in a configuration that maintains all of the layers of the stretch laminate in relatively close adherence to one another after the incremental mechanical stretching operation, the elastic panel members and the other plies of the stretch laminate are substantially continuously bonded together using an adhesive. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the adhesive selected is applied in a spiral pattern (such as is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,911,173 (Sprague, Jr.) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,666 (Werenicz)) at a basis weight of about 0.00116 grams/square cm (0.0075 grams/square inch). The spirals have a width of about 1.9 cm (0.75 in) and either are positioned just next to each other or overlap slightly (less than 2 mm). The adhesive is preferably an adhesive such as is available from Findley Adhesives under the designation H2120. Alternatively, the elastic panel member and any other components of the stretch laminates may be intermittently or continuously bonded to one another using heat bonding, pressure bonding, ultrasonic bonding, dynamic mechanical bonding, or any other method as is known in the art., 124238=The pull-on diaper would preferably have a plurality of vents within the side panels, the vents being arranged in a defined pattern of large and small apertures. The apertures are generally in the range of about 0.3-2.5 mm in diameter, with the larger apertures being preferably in the range of about 1-2 mm and the smaller apertures being in the range of about 0.5-0.9 mm in diameter. The apertures can be formed by punching holes or apertures into the fabric or by forming holes by autogeneous bonds such as ultrasonic or thermal/pressure techniques. Such apertures and forming techniques are described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,544,069 issued to Cutler on Mar. 6, 1951; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,738 issued to Kielpikowski et al. on May 30, 1989; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the apertures extend through all of the layers of the product, all of the layers of the stretch laminates in the side panels, such that the vents extend from the inside to the outside of the product. Alternatively, the vents may only be made in one or more of the layers or they may comprise slits or cuts rather than holes., 87205=In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an elastic panel member 78 is operatively joined in the side panel, preferably between the chassis layer and the belt layers, to allow the stretch laminates to be elastically extensible in at least the lateral direction. As used herein, the term \"elastically extensible\" means a segment or portion that will elongate in at least one direction (preferably the lateral direction for the side panel) when tensional forces (typically lateral tensional forces for the side panel) are applied, and will return to about its previous size and configuration when the tensional forces are removed. Elastomeric materials which have been found to be especially suitable for use as the elastic panel members (especially for zero strain stretch laminates) are styrenic block copolymer based elastic films, preferably with a thickness of 0.05 mm-0.064 mm (0.002 in-0.0025 in), such as are made by Clopay Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio under the designation PA18-2870; or Exxon 500 series elastic films from Exxon Chemical of Baytown, Tex. A stress/strain (force/extension) graph of the P 18-2870 elastomeric material described above is shown in FIG. 12. The stress/strain graph shows the typical shape of the force curve in grams per 1 inch wide sample when subjected to an applied strain or extension at a rate of 50.8 cm/min (20 in/min) at about 23\ufffd C. (room temperature). Other suitable elastomeric materials for use as the elastic panel members include \"live\" synthetic or natural rubber, other synthetic or natural rubber foams, elastomeric films (including heat shrinkable elastomeric films), elastomeric woven or nonwoven webs, scrims, elastomeric composites, or the like., 45901=U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,433 issued to Hasse, Bridges & Miller on Sep. 21, 1993, discloses a pant having stretch laminate side panels as well as elastic waistbands and leg bands. The stretch laminates in the side panels provide stretch in the sides of the product to better fit the pant on the wearer. The stretch laminates are unitary with the rest of the pant to overcome the drawbacks associated with the pants having separate and discrete elastic panel members attached thereto while improving the fit over the conventional balloon-style pants. However, these pants suffer from the drawback that the side panels are not sufficiently stretchable to allow a wearer to easily pull the pant on by themselves. The stretch laminates disclosed therein provide a limited amount of stretch. Further, the materials used to form the stretch laminates can have problems with tearing or shredding during use resulting in the products being scrapped by the manufacturer., 100534=In a preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 4, the elastic waist feature 50 comprises a unitary waistcap/waistband 82 positioned on the topsheet 80 and operatively joined in an elastically contractible condition with the topsheet 80 to gather the waistband panel 60 or 60' of the pull-on diaper 20. The unitary waistcap/waistband 82 preferably comprises a laminate of a nonwoven coverstock layer, an elastomeric layer, and more preferably a second nonwoven coverstock layer. An example of such a unitary waistcap/waistband for use herein is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,364, entitled \"Absorbent Article Having Unitary Waistcap and Waistband\", issued to Robertson on Jun. 25, 1991; and which is incorporated herein by reference. The elastomeric layer is preferably an elastomeric film such as that marketed by Exxon Chemical under the name Exxon 500 which is stretched to between about 50% and 100% prestrain. When operatively joined to the topsheet in the central panel of the pull-on diaper, the unitary waistcap/waistband in conjunction with the underlying layers of the pull-on diaper provide extension forces, when stretched to 67% (1 inch in this particular embodiment) extension, preferably between about 100 grams/in and 300 grams/in, more preferably between about 150 grams/in and about 200 grams/in. The unitary waistcap/waistband, in this preferred embodiment, also provides at least 37 mm (1 1/2 inches) of contraction (i.e., 76 mm (3 inches) of contraction in the entire product) to provide a tapered fit at the upper pan of the pull-on diaper., 99332=The elastic waist feature 50 comprises an extension of at least the belt layers (first belt layer 42 or second belt layer 44) and, preferably, one of the other elements of the pull-on diaper such as the chassis layer 40 or the topsheet 80 or any combination of these elements, alone (if one of these layers are extensible or contractible) or with an elastic material joined thereto. The elastic waist feature 50 may be constructed in a number of different configurations including those described herein with regard to the stretch laminates; those elasticized waistbands such as are known in the art and as are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,515,595 entitled \"Disposable Diapers With Elastically Contractible Waistbands\" issued to Kievit & Osterhage on May 7, 1985, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092 entitled \"Absorbent Article With Dynamic Elastic Waist Feature Having A Predisposed Resilient Flexural Hinge\" issued to Buell, Clear & Falcone on Sep. 29, 1992; and elasticized waistbands made from a structural elastic-like film (SELF) web as described in the previously referenced WO 95/03765; each of which is incorporated herein by reference., 88962=In an especially preferred embodiment, the elastic panel members are operatively joined in the side panel by securing them to the chassis layer, the belt layer, or both while in a substantially untensioned (zero strain) condition. At least a portion of the resultant composite stretch laminate containing the elastic panel member is then subjected to mechanical stretching sufficient to permanently elongate the non-elastic components (the chassis layer, the barrier layer, and the belt layer) of the stretch laminate. The composite stretch laminate is then allowed to return to its substantially untensioned condition. The side panel is thus formed into a \"zero strain\" stretch laminate. (Alternatively, the elastic panel member could be operatively joined in a tensioned condition and then subjected to mechanical stretching; although this is not as preferred as a \"zero strain\" stretch laminate.) As used herein, the term \"zero strain\" stretch laminate refers to a laminate comprised of at least two plies of material which are secured to one another along at least a portion of their coextensive surfaces while in a substantially untensioned (\"zero strain\") condition; one of the plies comprising a material which is stretchable and elastomeric (i.e., will return substantially to its untensioned dimensions after an applied tensile force has been released) and a second ply which is elongatable (but not necessarily elastomeric) so that upon stretching the second ply will be, at least to a degree, permanently elongated so that upon release of the applied tensile forces, it will not fully return to its original undeformed configuration. The resulting stretch laminate is thereby rendered elastically extensible, at least up to the point of initial stretching, in the direction of initial stretching. Particularly preferred methods and apparatus used for making stretch laminates utilize meshing corrugated rolls to mechanically stretch the components. Particularly preferred apparatus and methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,897 issued to Weber et al. on Dec. 1, 1992; U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,793 issued to Buell et al. on Oct. 20, 1990; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,679 issued to Weber et al. on Sep. 1, 1992; each of which are incorporated herein by reference., 108411=The elastic leg features 52 provide improved containment of liquids and other body exudates in the crotch region 30 and about the leg openings in general. Each elastic leg feature 52 may comprise several different embodiments for reducing the leakage of body exudates in the leg flap panels 58 (the elastic leg feature can be and is sometimes also referred to as leg bands, side flaps, barrier cuffs, or elastic cuffs.) U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 entitled \"Contractable Side Portions For A Disposable Diaper\" issued to Buell on Jan. 14, 1975 describes a disposable diaper which provides a contractible leg opening having a side flap and one or more elastic panel members to provide an elasticized leg cuff (gasketing cuff). U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,803 entitled \"Disposable Absorbent Article Having Elasticized Flaps\" issued to Aziz and Blaney on Mar. 20, 1990, describes a disposable diaper having \"stand-up\" elasticized flaps (barrier cuffs) to improve the containment of the leg regions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,278 entitled \"Absorbent Article Having Dual Cuffs\" issued to Lawson on Sep. 22, 1987, describes a disposable diaper having dual cuffs including a gasketing cuff and a barrier cuff U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,454, entitled \"Absorbent Article Having Leakage-Resistant Dual Cuffs\" issued to Dragoo on Jan. 3, 1989 discloses a disposable diaper having leakage resistant dual cuffs wherein the topsheet stops short of the side edge of the diaper to prevent wicking out to the side of the garment. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. While each elastic leg feature may be configured so as to be similar to any of the leg bands, side flaps, barrier cuffs or elastic cuffs described above, it is preferred that each elastic leg feature comprise a combination of a gasketing cuff and a barrier cuff. The gasketing cuff and barrier cuffs are preferably formed as shown in the Dragoo patent and as discussed herein., 111967=The absorbent core 84 is preferably positioned adjacent the inner surface 76 of the chassis layer 40 and is preferably joined thereto by attachment means (not shown) such as those well known in the art. For example, the chassis layer may be secured to the absorbent core by a uniform continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned layer of adhesive, or an array of separate lines, spirals, or spots of adhesive. Adhesives which have been found to be satisfactory are manufactured by Findley Adhesives of Wauwautosa, Wis., and marketed as Findley H2120. The attachment means preferably comprises an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,986 entitled \"Disposable Waste-Containment Garment\", which issued to Minetola and Tucker on Mar. 4, 1986, and which is incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary attachment means of an open pattern network of filaments comprises several lines of adhesive filaments swirled into a spiral pattern such as is illustrated by the apparatus and methods shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,911,173 issued to Sprague, Jr. on Oct. 7, 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,996 issued to Ziecker, et al. on Nov. 22, 1978; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,666 issued to Werenicz on Jun. 27, 1989. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the attachment means may comprise heat bonds, pressure bonds, ultrasonic bonds, dynamic mechanical bonds, or any other suitable attachment means or combinations of these attachment means as are known in the art., 42251=Many training pants and pull-on diapers use conventional elastic elements secured in an elastically contractible condition in the waist and leg openings. Typically, in order to insure full elastic fit about the leg and the waist such as is provided with durable undergarments, the leg openings and waist opening are encircled with elasticized bands of rubber or other materials positioned along the curve of the opening. These pants are typically characterized as \"balloon style\" pants because of the contraction caused by the elasticized bands in specific zones of the product while the remaining material tends to blouse. Examples of such training pants are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,239 to Igaue, et al. on Dec. 15, 1992 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,610,681 to Strohbeen, et al. on Sep. 9, 1986. Although these pants will allow fit of various waist and leg sizes due to the fact that the contractive elastic openings will expand to accommodate various size wearers, these products still fit a limited range of fit sizes because the elastic elements are in contraction and do not have a high degree of stretch. The narrow elastic bands used in the waist opening and the leg openings also tend to concentrate the \"fitment\" forces in a narrow zone of the wearer's body leading to increased incidence of skin marking of the wearer. Further, the sides and remainder of the products are typically not elastically extensible thereby reducing the fit., 140263=FIG. 10 shows a still further alternative embodiment of the pull-on diaper of the present invention. The chassis layer 1040 also serves as the belt layers. The chassis layer 1040 also provides the outer surface 22 of the pull-on diaper 1020 in both the front region, the back region, and the crotch region. In this embodiment, the chassis layer 1040 preferably comprises a nonwoven web to give the overall pull-on diaper the feel and appearance of a cloth garment. The topsheet 80 comprises a primary layer 86 and a pair of barrier layers 88. In this embodiment, the pull-on diaper 1020 is provided with a composite backsheet that acts as the backsheet for the absorbent core 84 and as reinforcement layers for the stretch laminates in the side panels. In this embodiment, the backsheet comprises a central backsheet layer 1002 and a pair of backsheet reinforcement layers 1004. The central backsheet layer 1002 is preferably a liquid impervious film to contain exudates within the absorbent core 84. However, since the central backsheet layer 1002 need not be subjected to mechanical stretching, it can comprises the liquid impervious, vapor pervious fihns such as previously described herein to give the product overall breathability in the crotch region and the central panels of the front region and the back region. Since the backsheet reinforcement panels 1004 are subjected to mechanical stretching, they preferably comprise any of the materials suitable for use as a reinforcement layer as previously described herein including nonwoven webs or plastic fihns. In the embodiment illustrated, the backsheet reinforcement layers 1004 comprise a plastic film such as is used as the chassis layer for the embodiments of FIGS. 1-4. Although it is preferred that the backsheet reinforcement layers overlap with and, more preferably are joined to, the central backsheet layer, the backsheet reinforcement layers may alternatively be spaced laterally outward from and not be secured to the central backsheet layer such that the backsheet reinforcement layers act as independent reinforcement layers. Since both the central backsheet layer 1002 and the backsheet reinforcement layers 1004 preferably each comprise a plastic film, the layers may be joined together prior to being combined into the pull-on diaper for ease of handling during manufacture. The elastic panel members 78 are preferably positioned between the chassis layer 1040 and the backsheet reinforcement layer 1004 to provide the stretch laminates.}",
