    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there have been shown preferred embodiments of an electrical stimulation technique for stimulating tissue regeneration in accordance with the invention, it will be appreciated that many changes and modifications may be made therein without, however, departing from the essential spirit thereof. There are, however, special situations in which it is desirable to inhibit or retard the growth and proliferation of cells, as in carcinogenic tumors. In that situation, the electrical stimulation technique in accordance with the invention can be used to produce a current flow through the tumor which is along the same path at which proliferating tumor cells seek to migrate, but the polar direction of the current is then the reverse of the polar direction taken by the migrating cells so as to inhibit such migrations. Whether the polar direction of current flow in the path is forward or reverse, it must be such as to facilitate the regeneration of cells in the healing process. Usually, a forward polar direction of current flow which correspondes to the polar direction of cell migration is most conducive to the regenerative process, though in some instances a reverse polar direction is more effective. Specific combinations of skin healing and reperfusion or reperfusion and tendon healing may necessitate electrode shapes and orientations which act to maximize each response. Thus when it is important for skin to be reperfused, skin cell migration is also needed. In reperfusion of",
