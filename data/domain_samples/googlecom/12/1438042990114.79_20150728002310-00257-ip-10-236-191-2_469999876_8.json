It is intended that the scope of the invention not be limited in any way to the illustrative embodiment shown and described but that the invention be limited only by the claims appended hereto. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention described herein provides inherent advantages over the prior art. The automatic banner resizing allows a web site to have coherency among each web page in the site by incorporating the same banner across all web pages in the site. Additionally, all web sites developed by a common manufacturer, company, or organization can incorporate an identical banner without thought to the targeted users' display configuration.

The user's browser automatically resizes the banner according to the type, resolution, and configuration of the user's display independently and without intervention of the web site developer's code. Finally, the banner may be defined to adjust to expand to the size of the web page window rather than display resolution, and accordingly, may be used to",
