MAPPHJG J (VGP) (VAP) RESULTS A process for allocating a plurality of block units with a predescribcd interconnection specification, to a plurality of module units. The allocation process may be varied from a partition having a zero block redundancy, to a mapping which has some degree of redundancy for the purpose of minimizing the total number of modules required. The process is applicable to any system wherein interconnected block sub-units must be assigned to larger module units for organizational purposes. For example, the allocation of circuits to chip structures., 17652=AUTOMATED LOGIC MAPPING SYSTEM Original Filed May 17, 1974 Sheet 8 of s AREA PINS MODULE 1 2 1 FIG. 8 MODULE 2 4 4 VER1 IV5 MODULE 1 1 2 PINS PM FIG. 9 MODULE 2 3 4 VER1 1V5 MODULE 1 2 2 AREA AH FIG. 10 MODULE 2 2 3 vER1 IV5 VER1 IVS MODULE 1 132 -1 132 144 F11 F11 MODULE 2 156 182 156 182 FIG.11A FiG.11B, 17502=AUTOMATED LOGIC MAPPING SYSTEM Sheet 7 of 8 Original Filed May 17, 1974 MODULE 1 MODULE 2 Nov. 4, 1975 P.
