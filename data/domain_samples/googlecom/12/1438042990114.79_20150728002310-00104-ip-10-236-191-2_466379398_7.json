May be zero for parameters and based items (in PL/I) or for zero-length bit fields (in `C`)., 43291=The heart of the syntax analysis phase is a parser which translates the source code 2 into an abstract syntax parse tree (AST). As is now standard in compiler construction, the parsers are driven directly from a context free grammar for the high level language. The grammar embodies the syntactic structure of valid programs in the compiled language and contains auxiliary directives used by the parser for building the parse tree and recovering from syntax errors. The grammar is translated into a compact table representation and the table is interpreted during actual source code parsing., 59285=Return the number of seconds which elapsed from 00:00:00 GMT Jan. 1, 1970 (hereafter--the Zero Date) to the creation of the file.}",
