Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a knee joint prosthesis comprising: The present invention can be advantageously used within any bioprosthetic device in which sliding wear (especially from articulation) is expected to occur. This includes the hip joint prosthetic, the knee prosthetic, and shoulder prosthetic. Preferably, however, the prosthetic is a hip joint prosthetic comprising an acetabular cup and a spherical head. It is acknowledged by the art that there is a possibility that the articulation surfaces of the bioprosthetic component can become dry during use, with the result of increasing friction and wear. However, the grooves of the present invention can also trap and retain synovial fluid and thereby act as a source for lubrication of the sliding surface. In use, lubricant trapped in the grooves could be released into the articulation interface when the surfaces surrounding the grooves slightly wear. The released lubricant could prevent further wear by reducing the friction coefficient of the articulation surfaces. It is believed that the",
