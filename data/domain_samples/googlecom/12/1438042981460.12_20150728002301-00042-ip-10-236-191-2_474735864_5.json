No. 07/741,689 filed Aug. 7, 1991 now abandoned, for a Flexible, Kink-Resistant Introducer Sheath., 44586=Depicted in FIG. 6 is a side view of coil transfer mechanism 59 mounted on carriage 60 of a commercially available lathe such as the previously identified Grizzly Model No. G-1550. This side view is viewed from the tail stock end of the lathe. The coil transfer mechanism includes adapter plate 61, which is horizontally mounted on the carriage of the lathe, and tool holder 62, which is vertically mounted on the horizontal adapter plate. Pivotedly mounted on the tool holder is adjustable guide support 63 with semicircular recess 64 extending through the guide support adjacent the free end thereof. Extending perpendicularly from the guide support toward the tail stock of the lathe is coil retaining pin 65. The coil retaining pin engages the flat wire coil to unwrap the coil while the lathe rotates a mandril with the inner tube mounted thereon. While the mandril and inner tube are being rotated the expanded coil is being wrapped and compression fitted on the outer surface of the inner tube. The transfer mechanism also includes adjustable shield 66 which is positioned adjacent the rotating inner tube to prevent the flat wire coil, which is being unwrapped, from scoring the surface of the inner tube., 41448=Coil 43 comprises a plurality of flat wire turns, for example, 47-51 with uniform spacing including equal width spaces 52-55 therebetween. Coil 43 is 30 cm in length with an outside diameter of 0.080\"\ufffd0.005\" prior to annealing. The coil is annealed by baking the coil at 800\ufffd F. \ufffd25\ufffd for approximately ten minutes. After annealing, the outside of the coil has a nominal dimension of 0.085\". The coil is formed from 0.004\" thick by 0.012\" wide flat rectangular stainless steel wire wound with a uniformspace in the range of 0.005\" to 0.010\" between the turns of the coil. Prior to being wound around inner tube 42, wire coil 43 has an inside diameter which is at least 0.040\" smaller than the outside diameter of the inner tube. Wire coil 43 is wound and compression fitted around outer surface 46 of inner tube 42 approximately 3-4 mm from the distal end thereof and approximately 5 mm from the proximal end thereof to taper and flare the distal and proximal ends, respectively. After being wound around the outer surface of the inner tube, the spacing between the turns of the coil is approximately 0.007\" to 0.009\". The coil is wound and compression fitted around inner tube 42 by inserting a mandril having, for example, an outside diameter of 0.1260\"\ufffd0.0002\"-0.0000\" through passage 41 of the inner tube and positioning the mandril and tube into the head and tail stock of a commercially available lathe such as the Grizzly Model No. G-1550. A transfer mechanism, as depicted in FIGS. 6-8, is mounted on the carriage of the lathe to wind and compression fit the coil around the inner tube.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the above-described flexible, kink-resistant, introducer sheath is merely an illustrative embodiment of the principles of this invention and that other introducer sheaths may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. It is contemplated that various other materials may be utilized for the inner, outer, and heat shrink tubes. It is also contemplated that introducer sheaths with an inside diameter ranging in size from 5.5 to 14.0 French are readily producible. In summary, the flexible, kink-resistant, introducer sheath provides a thin-wall sheath that is extremely kink-resistant for long-term use applications. The flat wire coil construction of this introducer sheath is also extremely kink-resistant with small outside diameter dilators during introduction through an access site. FIG. 8 depicts an enlarged view of adjustable guide support 63 and adjustable shield 66 of FIG. 7 with inner tube 42 and mandril 69 positioned therebetween in recess 64 of the support. To start the coil winding process, several turns of coil 43 are manually wrapped around the distal end of inner tube 42 mounted on mandril 69. The next several turns of the wire coil are positioned over coil retaining pin 65, as depicted. Adjustable shield 66 is then slid down and adjacent the inner tube to prevent the remaining free end of the coil from scoring the surface of the rotating inner tube.",
