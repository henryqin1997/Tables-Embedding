    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{125726=The intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 is preferably designed to track the presence of all employees within a particular security zone 50. In addition, the computer 22 of the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 evaluates and compares matters which occurred yesterday, to matters currently unfolding during today, in conjunction with the use of filters to minimize errors with respect to the identification of classifications and/or groups of vehicles 70 or individuals 56 to receive further investigation. In addition, a particular profile may be established for a group of vehicles 70 such as a motorcade. An additional filter may search and detect an authorized vehicle 70 within an observed motorcade. In addition, a processor/controller may search optical images observed at a specific checkpoint 52 to identify a particular group of vehicles 70 such as a motorcade. If any deviation in the number or type or other factors as related to the group of vehicles 70 is detected, then the computer 22 may issue an immediate warning signal to a surveillance, security, and/or law enforcement officer as to the necessity for an immediate investigation or warning. In addition, a particular group of optical devices 12 as in communication with a computer 22 may recognize the deviation of a group of vehicles 70 from a pre-planned or normal travel route to issue an investigation and/or warning signal to an officer. Generally, the filter sensitivity for the computer 22 of the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 will involve one standard deviation from the normal data as previously stored for a particular vehicle 70, individual 56, group of vehicles 70, and/or occupants 56 of vehicles 70. Therefore, in the event that observed data for a particular vehicle 70 having an identifiable license plate 54 statistically insignificantly deviates from the prerecorded data, then the computer 22 will not issue a communication to initiate additional investigation into the presence of the vehicle 70 within the security zone 50. However, in an example wherein an employee having normal work hours of 8 to 5, Monday through Friday as recorded data within the database 30 is identified as being adjacent to a secured area at 3:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning, then the computer 22 for the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 will automatically issue a warning signal to initiate immediate appropriate investigation based upon a weighted signal generated by the computer 22., 128592=The intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 may be used in conjunction with a government structure such as an embassy. In this example, a plurality of optical recording devices 12 may be positioned to observe, identify, and record the passage of vehicles 70 past the embassy. The intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 generally creates a file for each individual vehicle 70 which passes the embassy. The vehicle 70 license plate 54 number, make, model, observed load, and time and date are generally stored within the individual vehicle 70 file. The computer 22 for the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 may separate the data within a particular vehicle file into categories which may include occurrences which have been observed between 12:01 a.m. and 11:59 p.m. as a first category and noon to midnight as a second category. Any number of time or other confirmed categories may be established to satisfy the requirements of a customized application. The computer 22 for the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 will then calculate a mean value with respect to time of passage of an embassy for the identified vehicle 70 within each category, and will further calculate the mean observed appearance of the vehicle 70 with respect to load. Sensitivity software may be incorporated into the computer 22 for the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 which is designed to trigger a warning and/or flag in the event that observed data exceeds a calculated mean value by a selected percentage or value. For example, if a vehicle 70 is observed to be approaching an embassy at 3:30 in the morning where the calculated mean values for the first category are 7:45 a.m. and for the second category 5:45 p.m. then a signal may be communicated to a law enforcement, surveillance, or a security officer to trigger heightened security for the embassy. In addition, the intelligent audio/visual observation and identification database system 10 may observe a vehicle 70 approaching an embassy to compare the observed vehicle 70 appearance with respect to load to pre-stored data and/or a pre-calculated observed mean with respect to the vehicle 70 as related to load. In the event that the vehicle 70 appearance exceeds the observed mean value with respect to load, and/or the standard database value with respect to load, by an amount of five percent or more, then a signal will be generated for communication to a law enforcement, surveillance, and/or security officer to exercise heightened security measures for the embassy., 18689=This application is a Continuation application from Ser. No. 12/254587, filed Oct. 20, 2008; which is a Continuation application from Ser. No. 10/646,856, filed Aug. 22, 2003, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,902,978; which claims priority from Provisional Applications 60/405,592 and 60/405,379, both filed Aug. 23, 2002 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties., 109399=During pattern learning, the computer 22 sensitivity may be established by the initial creation of a file and/or data pertaining to an individual. Next, the input of a desired amount of data representative of repeated actions may be required. The number or amount of data may represent 20, 50, 100, or 200, repetitive occurrences. The occurrences may be required to be within a certain classification, such as all within a certain zone 50, or all within a certain period of time during the day, such as between 3 and 4 o'clock p.m. The computer 22 may then calculate a mean value based upon the recorded data. Alternatively, the recorded data may be divided into more than one segment and a mean may be calculated for each desired segment. The computer 22 will generally continue to store data, and therefore update the pattern, as detected by the input devices 12, 18. The computer 22 is preferably designed to recalculate a mean for the data following each additional data entry. The computer 22 may include sensitivity trigger software which will identify a desired threshold deviation from the calculated mean which may be more or less than one standard deviation from the calculated mean. Alternatively, the sensitivity trigger may be established at a certain percentage for deviation from the calculated mean. The computer 22 continually compares the observed occurrence information to the calculated mean data to determine if investigation signals are required to be communicated to law enforcement and/or security officers. In this respect, the computer 22 is engaged in updating activities becomes smarter and more efficient in analyzing risk situations over time.}",
