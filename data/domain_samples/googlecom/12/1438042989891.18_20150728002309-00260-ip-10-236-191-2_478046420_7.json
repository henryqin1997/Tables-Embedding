For example, although the GPSI interfaces are described as the serial interfaces, other serial interfaces such as, for example, the IEEE 802.3 MII Media Independent Interface (MII) could be utilized and their use would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. In another example, although the data rate of the multiplexer interface is four times the data rate of the serial interface as disclosed in the application the data rate can be any multiple of the data rate of the serial interface and that use would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Finally, it should be understood that although the disclosed multiplexer interface utilizes seven pins, the number of pins is not the critical feature; the critical feature being that number of pins in the multiplexer interface is a subset of the total pins of the general purpose serial interfaces. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. It synchronizes the input data stream (network timing) with the system clock. Significantly reducing the",
