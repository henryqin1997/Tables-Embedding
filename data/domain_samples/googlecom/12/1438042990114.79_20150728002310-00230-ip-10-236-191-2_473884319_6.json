Apparatus as claimed in claim 13 wherein said layer is silicone oil. 13. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 comprising a layer of material surrounding the heating Wires `and preventing adhesion of the concrete and the heating wires, said layer being relatively thin so that the material does not substantially reduce the conduction of heat between the heating Wires and the concrete. 12. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 comprising pieces of foil located in the concrete beneath the reinforcement mat for upwardly reflecting heat. 11. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 wherein said rods of the reinforcement mat are of heat conducting material, said rods being densely distributed so that the heat conduction of the reinforcement mat is at least as -great as the heat conduction of the concrete above the mat. 10. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 wherein said reinforcement mat is constituted by a steel sheet having slits therein whereby forming said rods. 9. Apparatus -as claimed in claim 5 wherein the groups of wires in the heating mat are adapted for being coupled together by electrical impulse welding. 8.
