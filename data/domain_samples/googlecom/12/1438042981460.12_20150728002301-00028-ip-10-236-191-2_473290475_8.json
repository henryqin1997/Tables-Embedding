Accordingly, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without deviating from the spirit thereof. The present invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of the following appended claims. The first preferred embodiment as shown in FIG. 1 is used as an example for illustrating the surgical application of the present invention. As soon as the bone screw 20 is fastened onto a vertebra intended to be fixed, the vertebral fixation rod 40 must be held by the curve portion 13 of the U-shaped clamping block 10 such that the wedging portion 21 of the bone screw 20 is held securely in the through holes 14 and 15 so as to fix the vertebral fixation rod 40. The wedging portion 21 and the knurl positions of the through holes 14 and 15 must be so adjusted as to permit the holding plug 30 to be inserted mechanically such that the holding groove 31 of the holding plug 30 and the curve portion 13 of the U-shaped clamping block 10 form a holding hole of a columnar construction, which holds securely the vertebral fixation rod 40. In the meantime, the knurled surface 32 of the holding plug 30 urges the wedging portion 21 of the bone screw 20 such that the",
