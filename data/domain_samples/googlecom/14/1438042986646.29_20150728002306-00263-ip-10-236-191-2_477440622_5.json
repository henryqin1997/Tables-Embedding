As shown in FIG. 5, a face plate 30, also serving as a scale plate, is fixed to the end of the threaded shaft 12. Scales 31, 32 are marked both on the rim of the face plate 30 and on the end of the adjusting cap-nut 15. According to this invention, tilting tension or frictional force against camera rotation can be controlled in proportion to the weight of the camera. In this device, dialing or rotating the adjusting cap-nut 24 varies the pressure or frictional force applied by said frictional plate 23 against horizontal part 11a, so that frictional force can be controlled. FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 shows another embodiment designed for the above-mentioned purpose. Horizontal part 11a of camera supporting plate 11 is connected with vertical part 11b, so as to rotate or tilt rightward or leftward about the axis of pin 21, which is in integral engagement with said vertical part 11b. As shown in FIG. 4, a threaded shaft 22 is provided on the end of said pin 21, and a frictional plate 23 is set at the threaded end of said pin 21, so as to prevent rotation. An",
