[0042] The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and the accompanying figures. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. [0041] The container provided to the patient may be a compartmentalized dispenser, such as that described above, or any other disposal system for transdermal dosage forms. The container can be made of sturdy construction so that it is tamper proof. Additionally, window(s) may be provided so that the user can determine how many unused dosage forms remain and how many used dosage forms have been deposited. In addition, a pharmacist can use the window to confirm that the first compartment is actually full of used patches before providing the patient with another container. In accordance with further embodiments, the container can identify the user, alternatively or in addition to the dosage form. For example, the container can accept a special encoded tag of the patient, or may even scan the patient directly by a hand/finger/retina, (etc.) scanner to identify the patient. Alternatively, the container could include a camera and the detector",
