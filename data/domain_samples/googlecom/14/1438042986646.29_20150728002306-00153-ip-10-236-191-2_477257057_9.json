Although varying depending on the kind of physiologically active substance used, desired pharmacological action, duration of action and other factors, the ratio of the physiologically active substance to polymer of lactic acid is normally about 0.01 to about 50% (w/w), preferably about 0.5 to about 40% (w/w), and especially preferably about 0.1 to about 30% (w/w)., 84052=10 g of DL-polylactic acid having a weight-average molecular weight of 79,900 which is produced by ring-opening polymerization (RESORMER, R206, Lot No. 211967, produced by Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany)(hereafter referred to as Polymer F) was hydrolyzed by soaking it in 400 ml of a solution wherein DL-lactic acid was diluted with distilled water 1/50 or 1/100 (w/w) times (respectively pH 2.09, pH 2.27) at 60\ufffd C., 32705=The starting polylactic acid produced by the ring-opening reaction and polymerization is a polymer of a high molecular weight region, which is not obtained by a dehydration condensation of lactic acid wherein heating is conducted under reduced pressure after addition of a catalyst (JP-A 45920/1981, EP-A 26599), or a method for producing a polymer which is obtained by polymerization of lactic acid without using a catalyst and is substantially free from a catalyst (JP-A 28521/1986, EP-A 172636). The ring-opening reaction and polymerization (hereafter referred to as ring-opening polymerization) is conducted by a method wherein a cyclic dimer of a lactic acid is used and a catalyst is added while heating (e.g. J.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A sustained-release preparation of the present invention has a good dispersibility and is excellent in workability. Also, the sustained-release preparation is excellent in a storage stability and can be stored for a long time. Additionally, a sustained-release preparation of the present invention shows an almost continuous zero order release of a physiologically active substance over a long period of at least about 5 months. By employing a polymer according to the present invention, a sustained-release preparation (especially microspheres) having a high drug entrapment ratio and drug content with a small initial burst can be produced in a high yield. Further, a polymer of the present invention is high in safety since it is substantially free from a poisonous catalyst and organic solvent. As is clear from Table 8, microspheres of the present invention (Microspheres A and B) showed a small initial burst and subsequently an almost continuous zero order release of a drug over a long period of about 6 months. On the contrary, Microspherers D and E released almost whole amount of a drug at 17 weeks and showed substantially no subsequent release as well as showing a large initial burst, although polylactic acid having a large molecular weight and being slow in biodegradability was employed.
