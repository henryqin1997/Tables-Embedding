It thus, exhibits a steep filter edge., 13022=The theory of glued edge interference filters (see the above mentioned article by Mahlein) shows that filters for transmitting short-wave can be realized with a standard layer materials composed of SiO2 and TiO2 only for narrow interchannel spacings of about 40 nm given a wavelength of 1300 nm and a 20\ufffd angle of incidence. Filter for transmitting the long-wave can only be realized for greater interchannel spacings of about 120 nm given a wavelength of 1300 nm and a 20\ufffd angle of incidence., 12366=Filters having a layer sequence of alternating high and lower index of refraction are known. Examples are disclosed in an article by F. H. Mahlein, \"A High Performance Edge Filter for Wavelength-Division Multi-Demultiplexer Units\", Optics and Laser Technology, February 1981, pages 13-20. Under certain conditions, pairs of spectrally complementary edge interference filters are required for optical communication transmissions and wavelength-division multiplex. Such pairs in an unglued execution are known and examples are disclosed in a book by H. A. Macleod, Thin Film Optical Filters, Hilger, London, 1969, pages 111-153.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although various minor modifications may be suggested by those versed in the art, it should be understood that I wish to employ within the scope of the patent granted hereon, all such modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of my contribution to the art. wherein S stands for the outer medium, H for the more highly refractive layers, L for the more lowly refractive layers, a number preceding H or L indicates the amount of the standardized layer thickness for the appertaining layer. A lack of a number preceding the H or L means that the layer thickness of the appertaining layer is equal to one standardized layer thickness. The eighth power of the parenthetical expression (HL) indicates that this period composed of the two layers is repeated eight times. S; 0.241 H; 0.914 L; (HL)8 ; H; 0.914 L; 0.241 H; S. The present filter can also be characterized in brief as following a formula-like symbolism: The transmittance T curve is for unpolarized radiation, the transmittance Ts curve is for an s-component, which is the component of linearly polarized radiation which is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and the transmittance Tp curve is for the p-component, which is the component for the radiation parallel to the plane of incidence. FIG. 2 shows the spectral transmittance curves T, Ts and Tp and also shows the transmittance of the edge interference filter for",
