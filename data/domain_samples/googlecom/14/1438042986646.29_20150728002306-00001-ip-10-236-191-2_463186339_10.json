    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6403=FIG. 21 depicts a partial cross-sectional front view of one embodiment of a communication device 74 according to the present invention. There is a payload box 300, including an interior container 302 and exterior Styrofoam insulation 304 surrounding the interior container 302. Within the container 302 is a circuit board 306 to which various electronic components are attached and interconnected to provide signal communication and remote control of the platform as desired. The electronics section consist of the RF section, antennas, GPS receiver, processor and power regulators. The RF section is based on the low cost transmitter and receiver section of current two-way pagers. The transmitter power is increased to approximately 7 watts. A single 900 MHZ collinear dipole array antenna serves both for transmit and receive functions. Additional antennas may be added for gateway RF links to the Ground Terminals if the additional frequencies become available. Possible frequencies include the 1680 MHz band assigned to meteorological instruments. If the SNS system also collects weather data for the NWS and this data is transmitted on the meteorological aids band, it may be possible to send additional gateway traffic with the meteorological data. A twelve channel GPS receiver in conjunction with the processor provides positional information to both the NWS during ascent and to the SNS NOC for the entire flight. The NOC uses the information to locate the SNS platforms, to determine coverage holes or gaps, and to make rudimentary position adjustments by varying the altitude into favorable wind speeds and directions.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{63265=In contrast to the large deployment and new equipment costs for orbiting satellite systems, the present invention provides a low cost alternative that does not require new subscriber equipment. Thus, a benefit of the SNS System is an advanced messaging SNS network that is compatible with standard one-way and two-way pagers already in existence and already in use with tower-based transceiver networks. Even without considering deploying of the SNS system, market analysts predict 35 million users will be carrying compatible, standard two-way pager equipment by the year 2003. At, for example, $100/unit, this represents an investment by users of over $3.5 billion. These users can receive the enhanced coverage of the inventive SNS platform network as an extension of their present service simply by electing to pay the monthly and incremental usage fees. There are no up-front costs for new user equipment or training and no need to change the user's habits and burden them with carrying more than one pager or other communication device as is the case with current satellite pagers., 33135=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/342,440, filed Jun. 29, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,628,941 and U.S. application Ser. No. 10/129,666, filed May 9, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,203,491 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 60/284,799, filed Apr. 18, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 38125=The location systems currently used to track weather balloons are either being deactivated (Omega, beginning before the year 2000, and Loran-C, shortly after the year 2000) or are so old that the operation and maintenance is becoming prohibitively expensive (radars and radiotheodolites)., 93429=The FAA further prohibits uncontrolled lighter-than-air free drifting balloons. Again there may be a concern that uncontrolled flight may present a hazard to aircraft. For example, in 1998, the Canadian Space Agency lost control of a large scientific balloon. This prompted re-routing of trans-Atlantic passenger flights for 10 days as the balloon drifted from its launch site in Canada until it finally landed in Finland. The uncontrolled balloon also resulted in aviation concerns in Russia and Norway. Significant resources were expended, including the use of fighter jets to try to bring the uncontrolled balloon down., 40366=Personal communications services (PCS) are a new category of digital services that the FCC started auctioning spectrum for in 1994. PCS is split into two categories: broadband and narrow band PCS. The broadband category is primarily for voices services and PCS broadband phones now compete with traditional cellular phones. The narrow band category is for advanced messaging, which is essentially two-way paging. The paging industry sees advanced messaging as being the mobile extension of one's e-mail account, just as a cellular phone has been the mobile extension of one's desktop phone. Nationwide narrow band PCS (NPCS) was the first spectrum ever auctioned by the FCC. About 30 regional and nationwide NPCS licenses have been auctioned and sold to private commercial ventures. The fact that the spectrum was auctioned is significant in that there are fewer restrictions on the use of this spectrum than on the use of traditional spectrum licensed from the FCC. Before auctions, the FCC granted spectrum on a piecemeal basis, and companies had to prove that they were using the airwaves for the \u201cpublic good.\u201d Usually there was very specific federal regulation on how the frequency could be used. Since companies paid for their PCS licenses, they essentially owned the spectrum. The FCC imposed only minimal regulations required to prevent systems from interfering with other carriers' and other countries' systems. Additionally, the FCC and Industry Canada reached what is known as a Terrestrial Radio Communication Agreement and Arrangement in which Canada allocated the same frequencies for NPCS with the same channel structure as the auctioned spectrum for the NPCS in the United States. This made cross-boarder NPCS possible and in 1996, at least one paging system company was granted an NPCS license in Canada to operate on the same frequencies as its U.S. licensee. Mexico also has specified the same channel spacing as used in the United States., 122113=The communications signal transceiver comprises circuitry capable of communications using FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, and ReFLEX protocols. All of these named protocols use \u201chandoff.\u201d For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,000, issued Jul. 15, 1997, discloses a method and system for providing a different frequency handoff in a CDMA cellular telephone system. Devices using these protocols periodically scan for neighboring control channel in the background, without interrupting normal operations. If the device finds a better channel, in terms of significantly better signal strength or higher priority, it can request a transfer. This is usually done using \u201cmake before break,\u201d a concept similar to the soft hand-off used in PCS phone networks, where registration with a new channel is completed before communication with the old channel is broken. Normally, this means that a device will always be registered with the network, and capable of receiving messages. This permits communication devices to move quickly and efficiently across service areas with different control channels., 38446=Changes in radiosonde systems are usually very slow, since meteorologists study climatic trends by comparing data collected over decades. Thus, they are very leery of any changes that may introduce new biases into data as it is collected. This is evident from the fact that major users, like the U.S. National Weather Services (NWS) still use analogue radiosondes tracked by radiotheodolites when digital, navaid sondes have been around for many years. Tightening of governmental budgets has made some users unable to pay for new technology required. There presently is a push in the sonde marketplace to convert to using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for wind tracking on radiosondes. From 1995 to 1998, the NWS tried and failed to get the U.S. Congress to find a program to develop a GPS tracking system for the U.S. Observation Network. This inability to obtain the necessary newer technology to replace old and unsupportable radiosonde infrastructure is occurring simultaneously with the rapid reallocation of the radiosonde's RF spectrum to commercial uses. Radiosondes have traditionally transmitted at 400 MHZ for navaid sondes and 1680 MHZ for radiotheodolite sondes. The 400 MHZ band is being auctioned off by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States for simultaneous use by commercial services. Thus, interference is increasing and sondes may be forced to use to narrower bandwidths with digital downlinks instead of the wide bands with analogue downlinks still in common use., 69532=Since existing paging equipment owners and users may acquire the expanded coverage provided by the present invention through their existing carrier, the decision to expand coverage can be as simple as checking a box on their monthly bill. They could keep their current page system company, and simply add the benefit of remote area coverage provided by the SNS. No new equipment is needed and no start-up time is needed to learn the features of a new electronic gadget. There is simply improved coverage for the user without changing equipment. A very important benefit of the inventive SNS network is the significant improvement in complete remote area geographic coverage. Currently, wireless data coverage is a patchwork of covered high-density population areas, primarily around metropolitan areas. The SNS network works cooperatively with the existing coverage areas and fills in all the low-density population and thus low communication traffic areas all using the same subscriber device. The governmental regulations governing NPCS systems require minimum system build-outs for all licensees. For example, by about 1999, a licensee providing NPCS must service at least 37.5% of the U.S. population or 750,000 square kilometers, and by the year 2004, a NPCS licensee must service at least 75% of the U.S. population, or 150,000 square kilometers. Since the population is very concentrated, prior systems have been required to build towers for coverage over a very small percentage of the total landmass. In fact, the minimum area requirement for the 1999 and for the 2004 population service limits correspond to approximately 8% and 16% of the total U.S. landmass, respectively. Because of the high population density in U.S. cities. For example, covering 90% of the population requires a carrier to build out only about 20% area coverage of the country's total landmass. Servicing areas of low population density is more expensive for prior systems since tower transmitter/transceivers have a short range so that much more equipment is needed per potential customer. Thus, few prior carriers have systems that cover more than 90% of the population because of the diminishing returns. Many established wireless data carriers are built out only to about 70%-80%., 185797=The National Weather Service requires that weather balloons rise at a standard rate of 1000 feet per minute. This is nearly impossible to maintain throughout the balloon's rise due to many factors including the variance with altitude of the pressure and temperature of both the lifting gas and the ambient air, the variance in the balloon material, the manufacturing process, and the physical change in the size of the balloon itself as the balloon rises.}",
