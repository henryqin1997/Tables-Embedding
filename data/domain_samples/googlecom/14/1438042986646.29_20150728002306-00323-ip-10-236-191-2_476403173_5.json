    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30904=The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolites with a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred in some instances to use zeolites having substantially higher silica/alumina ratios, e.g. 70 and above or even 1600 and above. In addition, zeolites as otherwise characterized herein but which are substantially free of aluminum, that is zeolites having silica to alumina mole ratios of up to infinity, are found to be useful and even preferable in some instances. Such \"high silica\" or \"highly siliceous\" zeolites are intended to be included within this decription. Also to be included within this definition are substantially pure silica analogs of the useful zeolites described herein, that is to say those zeolites having no measurable amount of aluminum (silica to alumina mole ratio of infinity) but which otherwise embody the characteristics disclosed., 42156=Therefore, the preferred zeolites useful with respect to this invention are those having a Constraint Index as defined above of about 1 to about 12, a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a dried crystal density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubic Angstroms, as given, e.g., on Page 19 of the article Zeolite Structure by W. M. Meier. This paper, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, is included in Proceedings of the Conference on Molecular Sieves, (London, April 1967) published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968., 33378=Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules of larger cross-section than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the \"Constraint Index\" as herein defined may be made by passing continuously a mixture of an equal weight of normal hexane and 3-methylpentane over a sample of zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedure. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube. Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at 540\ufffd C. for at least 15 minutes. The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature is adjusted between 290\ufffd C. and 510\ufffd C. to give an overall conversion of between 10% and 60%. The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at 1 liquid hourly space velocity (i.e., 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of zeolite per hour) over the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to (total) hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4:1. After 20 minutes on stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons., 58517=Alkylation is suitably accomplished utilizing a feed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of between about 1 and about 1000, and preferably between about 1 and about 200. The reaction product, consisting predominantly of the 1,4-dialkyl isomer, e.g. 1,4-dimethylbenzene, 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene, etc., or a mixture of the 1,4- and 1,3-isomers together with comparatively smaller amounts of 1,2-dialkylbenzene isomer, may be separated by any suitable means. Such means may include, for example, passing the reaction product stream through a water condenser and subsequently passing the organic phase through a column in which chromatographic separation of the aromatic isomers is accomplished. Alkylation using the water vapor-treated catalysts of the present invention can provide product mixtures containing at least 80% or even 90% or more by weight of the para-dialkylbenzene isomer., 50646=In addition to treatment of the zeolite composites to incorporate phosphorus and/or magnesium oxides as hereinbefore described in detail, such zeolites may also be modified in a substantially similar manner to incorporate thereon a variety of other oxide materials to enhance para-selectivity. Such oxide materials include oxides of boron (U.S. Pat. No. 4,067,920); antimony (U.S. Pat. No. 3,979,472); beryllium (U.S. Pat. No. 4,260,843); Group VIIA metals (U.S. Pat.

Water vapor treatment increased the overall yield of para-ethyltoluene.
