In one embodiment, the verified presence tracking engine 2000 comprises a User Manager 2100, a Location Request Manager 2200, a Location Tracking Manager 2300. a Confidence Manager 2400 and a Communications Manager 2600. In one embodiment, the verified presence tracking engine 2000 is hosted on one or more servers hosted by a verified presence tracking service such as the service 100 shown in FIG. 1.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{134324=The Communications Manager 2500 serves as the Verified Presence Tracking Engine's interface to sensor 2700 and communications networks 2800 and supplies location data relating to registered users to the Location Tracking Manager 2300 and the Confidence Manager 2400., 133080=In one embodiment, if a first user or a first user's device supplies corroborating location data for a second user, Confidence Manager 2400 could reward the first user for consistent and reliable responses to such requests or reduced in reputation or reliability rating for failing to respond or for reports that later are proved likely to have been false (or fraud). In some embodiments, verification sources may be monetarily compensated while in others a points, scoring, reputation or reliability rating., 122839=In one embodiment, if the source of a location request has sufficient access authority to access the target's location data at the request's required level of granularity, the Location Request Manager 2200 requests the target's location data from the Location Tracking Manager 2300 at a required level of reliability. In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 receives location data and location reliability data from the Location Tracking Manager 2300 relating to location tracking requests and formulates and transmits responses to such location tracking requests to the requesting sources., 93104=A request for a location is received 1100, over a network, such as the Internet. The request may have been transmitted from a user, an organization or a system using any conventional methodology for transmitting information over a network, such as data entered through a web form, transmitted using a custom API, an email, or an instant message. In one embodiment, the request comprises a request type, a request source and a request target. In one embodiment, the request may additionally comprise one or more request parameters., 129331=In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 can enable a system level user to manually define the reliability of types of users, types, and contexts where empirical reliability data is not available. Users, sensors and contexts representing types unknown to the Confidence Manager 2400 can be assigned a default reliability. In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 is configured to continuously or periodically evaluate the reliability of users, sensors and contexts and types of users, sensors and contexts using location data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300., 135575=Note that a Location Tracking Engine 2000 with limited functionality could also be implemented as a self-contained PIM application or process for only handling a user's own location requests relating only to the user's devices, e.g. synchronization and cross-platform applications or interdevice communication., 133628=In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 can be configured to constantly designate, track and update a list of immediately available verification sources, including overseeing any terms associated with use of that source. As users locations change and corroborating sources come and go, the Confidence Manager 2400 can maintains a prioritized list of contact information for verification sources. For example, monetarily compensated verification sources may, for example, be given a higher certification rating that non-monetarily compensated sources because of the additional protections against fraud in commerce created by that transaction., 105520=In at least one embodiment, steps 1200 through 1400 as described above are optional. In one embodiment, all users of the service are authorized to view location data for all other users. In one embodiment, a user of the service is only authorized to view location data for a target when the target expressly consents to allow the user to view the target's location data., 127497=In one embodiment, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 requests reliability scores from the Confidence Manager 2400 for specific location data when it is responding to a request from the Location Request Manager 2200 for location data relating a target user. In one embodiment, the reliability of the location data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300 is continuously evaluated by the Confidence Manager 2400 and reliability scores can be stored in a database accessible to the Location Tracking Manager 2300 or the Confidence Manager 2400 or both. In one embodiment, reliability scores are stored along with location data in a global presence graph 2500 maintained by the Location Tracking Manager 2300., 128307=In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 assigns reliability scores to data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300. In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 scores the reliability of data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300 only when specifically requested to do so by the Location Tracking Manager. In one embodiment, the reliability of the location data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300 is continuously evaluated by the Confidence Manager 2400 at or near the time the data is collected., 131126=In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 can attempt to retrieve, additional corroborating data from sources not normally used by the Location Tracking Manager 2300. Such sources could include fixed sensors, such as biometric sensors, cameras, microphones, RFID tracking sensors and so forth, that data from which data can be automatically acquired. Such sources could also include mobile sensors associated with a user known to the system. Such sensors could include, without limitation mobile devices carried by a user such as mobile phones, PDA, cameras, voice recorders, and so forth., 107243=The reliability of the retrieved location data is then determined 1600. In one embodiment, for each location data point, the reliability of the users and the sensors involved in collecting the data is identified and the reliability of the context under which the data was collected is identified. In one embodiment, the reliability of users, sensors and contexts can be determined empirically or typologically, and may vary temporally., 124526=Location Request Manager 2200 can return a can return a simple \u201cverified\u201d or \u201cnot verified\u201d response to a request to verify a location. Alternatively, more information can be provided such as \u201cno information available\u201d or \u201cinformation indicates target was in another location.\u201d The verification message could also contain a confidence score that the target is or was in a location at a specific time., 100509=The relationship of the request source to the request target is then determined 1200. In one embodiment, the source and the target are members of a verified presence tracking service and the relationship between the source and the target is known to the service. In one embodiment, the relationships between the target and the source could include, without limitation, \u201cspouse\u201d, \u201cparent\u201d, \u201cchild\u201d, \u201cemployer\u201d, \u201cemployee\u201d, \u201cagent\u201d, \u201cclient\u201d, \u201cself\u201d, \u201cfriend\u201d, \u201crelative\u201d, \u201cacquaintance\u201d, \u201ccoworker\u201d, \u201cvendor\u201d or \u201cadvertiser\u201d or \u201csponsor.\u201d In one embodiment, users explicitly define their relationships with other users. In one embodiment, the relationships between users is automatically mapped by analyzing available data sources such as user emails, user BLOGs, user social network profiles and user status messages. In one embodiment, the relationship between the source and the target can be verified by the target before a request is processed. The relationship could be verified by the user in real-time via, for example, emails, instant messages or any other medium that can enable a user to respond to an inquiry. In one embodiment, the relationship between the source and the target can be automatically verified by a device associated with the target., 104800=If the source does not have sufficient access permission to access the target's location data at the request's required level of granularity, the request is rejected 1400. As discussed above, every request will be associated with an explicit, implied or default required granularity. Many requests may simply be for \u201cbest available\u201d location data, which is the most detailed level of location data to which the source has access. If a specified granularity of a request is a preferred granularity and the source does not have access to location data for a target at that level of detail, the target receives can receive data at a \u201cbest available\u201d level, and can thus be processed., 81800=The reliability of location data can be inferred from currency. Time elapsed between sensor input and a presence request will generally decrease confidence in a location. For example, a GPS upload from 7:30 PM will provide more evidence that a user was at a given location at 7:35 PM than will a GPS reading from 8:00 PM. Time between sensor data acquisition and data upload will also decrease confidence (increasing the likelihood of tampering with the data. For example, a GPS reading that was uploaded immediately is more likely to be reliable than a reading contained in a GPS log that was uploaded a week after the fact. In another example, a social status message recorded on Tuesday that identifies the location of a user the previous Saturday may be suspect., 121502=In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 is further configured to determine, for each location request, the relationship between the source and the target using relationships defined and maintained by the target user using facilities provided by the User Manager 2100. Where no defined relationship exists, a default relationship such as \u201cstranger\u201d or \u201cunknown\u201d could be used., 128918=In one embodiment, the Confidence Manager 2400 determines the reliability of the users and the sensors involved in collecting location data and further determines the reliability of the context under which location data was collected. In one embodiment, the reliability of users, sensors and contexts can be determined empirically or typologically, and may vary temporally., 120747=The request parameters can include a variety of options depending on the request type, source and target. Such parameters could include: spatial parameters that comprise an identification of a location or list of locations, temporal parameters that specify a time or time range or a list of times or time ranges, parameters that define the purpose of the request, parameters explicitly indicating the granularity required for the request and parameters explicitly indicating the reliability of data required for the request. Such parameters are discussed in detail above in the description of process step 1100. All request parameter could additionally be assigned default values if they are not explicitly entered., 75005=As discussed above, types of contexts can exhibit significant temporal variations in reliability. Types of user and sensors may, however, also exhibit significant temporal variations in reliability. For example, mobile devices which utilize a mobile network that is prone to instability during peak load hours may exhibit significant temporal variations in reliability regardless of location. A user between the ages of 21-25 may become unreliable sources of information on Friday night after 8:00 PM regardless of location., 129978=In one embodiment, Confidence Manager 2400 empirically determines the reliability of location data retrieved by the Location Tracking Manager 2300 by evaluating the data for corroboration, consistency, and currency as discussed in detail above. In one embodiment, a global presence graph maintained by a verified presence tracking system can be used to identify corroborating data, evaluate the consistency of location data for users over time and determine the currency of location data., 101809=The level of access the source is allowed to the target's location data is then determined 1300. In one embodiment, the target has defined access privileges on a verified presence tracking services. In one embodiment, access privileges are defined for types of relationships such as \u201cfriend\u201d, \u201ccoworker\u201d and \u201cstranger\u201d, and can additionally be defined for specific users or groups of users. In one embodiment, access privileges specify the level of granularity of location data a user to which a user has access. In one embodiment, lists of users, groups of users or relationships could be placed on a whitelist that have defined access rights to a user's location data, and all other users have no access rights. In one embodiment, lists of users or groups of users could be placed on a blacklist such that such users are denied access rights or given reduced access rights even if the relationship of the source to the target would ordinarily imply access to the target's location data., 130513=In one embodiment, when the Location Tracking Manager 2300 requests reliability scores from the Confidence Manager 2400 relating to location data, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 can additionally specify a preferred or required level of reliability for the data. If the Confidence Manager 2400 determines the reliability of the location data is insufficient to satisfy the terms of the request, Confidence Manager 2400 can attempts to retrieve additional corroborating data using facilities provided by the Communications Manager 2500., 124966=In one embodiment, communications between the Location Request Manager 2200 and requesting users can be encrypted at an appropriate level of encryption based on the source and the targets security needs. In one embodiment, communications between the Location Request Manager 2200 and requesting users can be conducted on a secure channel., 116674=In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 can provide facilities that enable a user to define the user's contacts and the users relationships to such contacts. Such relationships could include categories such as \u201cfriend\u201d, \u201crelative\u201d, \u201cacquaintance\u201d, \u201ccoworker\u201d, \u201cvendor\u201d or \u201cadvertiser.\u201d In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 automatically identifies a user's contacts and categorizes the user's relationships with such contacts by analyzing available data sources such as user emails, user BLOGs, user social network profiles and user status messages., 132239=The Confidence Manager 2400 could acquire corroborating location data using facilities provided by the Communications Manager 2500 involving steps requiring a user to take a specific action. For example, if the Confidence Manager 2400 has reason to believe that a first user whose location is to be verified may be within the visual range of a second user, the Confidence Manager 2400 could send a message to a mobile device associated with the second user asking the second user if he or she can see the first user. The Confidence Manager 2400 could also request the second user to take some other action that would provide data suitable to verify the first user's location, such as taking a picture of the first user or taking a voice recording of or near the first user., 115768=In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 provides facilities that enable users or other entities, such as business organizations, to become users 2120 of the system. The User Manager 2100 can allow users to set up user profiles that can include user demographic information and preferences, define user devices that can serve as sources of location data for the user, and third party websites, such as social networking sites and microblogging sites, that can serve as additional sources of data relating to the user and the user's location. In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 can provide a web enabled interface to users, such as a website comprising one or more HTML pages. In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 can provide an API that enables software running on user devices to access facilities provided by the User Manager., 105937=Location data related to the request is then retrieved 1500 from one or more location data sources. In one embodiment, location data is retrieved from one or more databases of location data maintained by a verified presence service that retrieves location data from sensor networks, communication networks and other location data sources. In one embodiment, the verified presence tracking service collects additional data regarding users in additional to spatial and temporal data and references and cross-references data associated among users known to the system to create a global presence graph that has the path and last known/current locations in real-space mapped together relative for all known users. In one embodiment, the global presence graph can be used to retrieve location data relating to a target., 121937=In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 is further configured to determine the level of access a source is allowed to a target's location data using access privileges defined by the target user through facilities provided by the User Manager 2100. In one embodiment, requests could be rated using a multifactor rating given to the request based on source and purpose as discussed in detail above, and the level of access allowed to the source the level of access a source is allowed to a target's location data is determined using the rating. If the source of a location request does not have sufficient access authority to access the target's location data at the request's required level of granularity, the request the Location Request Manager 2200 rejects the request and can further send a rejection message to the request source., 108444=If the reliability of the location data is insufficient to satisfy the terms of the request, additional corroborating data is retrieved 1700., 125351=In one embodiment, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 continuously or periodically retrieves location data relating to users registered through the User Manager 2100 from one or more location data sources using the facilities of the Communications Manager 2600. Such location sources sensor networks 2700, communication networks 2800 and other location data sources such as third party location data providers. In one embodiment, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 stores retrieved location data on one or more databases. In one embodiment, the verified presence tracking service collects additional data regarding users in addition to spatial and temporal data and references and cross-references data associated among users known to the system to create a global presence graph that has the path and last known/current locations in real-space mapped together relative for all known users., 113394=A response is then formulated and transmitted to the request source 1800. The content of the response will depend on the type of the request. A request for a location will return a description of a location. In one embodiment, the description of the location can be at the requested level of granularity if the source is permitted to view location data at that level of granularity and such data is available. If a source is not permitted to view data at that level of granularity, the location data description can provide a location description at the level of granularity the source is permitted to view. If location data is not available at the requested (or default) level of granularity, the location data can be provided at the best available level of granularity. The response can additionally include a reliability or confidence score for the location data. If more that more location is displayed, or if a location is displayed for a time range as a series of time slices, confidence or reliability scores can be displayed for each location or time slice., 117275=In one embodiment, the User Manager 2100 can provide facilities that enable a user to define access privileges to the user's location data. Access privileges could be defined for the user's contacts individually, or could be defined by categories of relationships. In one embodiment, access privileges specify the level of granularity of location data a user to which a user has access., 126982=Alternatively, in one embodiment, real-time location data could be retrieved in real-time from a network of sensors from sensor networks, communication networks and other location data sources using the facilities of the Communications Manager 2600. In one embodiment, real-time location data and data retrieved from one or more databases could be combined. In one embodiment, real-time and historical location data could be retrieved from a third-party location data source., 131767=The Confidence Manager 2400 could acquire data from mobile sensors automatically. For example, if it is desired to verify the location of a first user who has a mobile phone that supports a short range wireless protocol, the location of the first user's mobile phone could be verified by requesting a second user's mobile phone that supports the same short range wireless protocol to attempt to locate the first user's mobile phone., 118481=In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 can provide facilities to receive and respond to requests for location data and location verification from location requesters 2220 and external systems 2240 that have an interest in location data. In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager is configured to receive location requests comprising a request type, a request source, a request target and, optionally, one request or more request parameters. In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 can provide a web enabled interface to users, such as a website comprising one or more HTML pages. In one embodiment, the Location Request Manager 2200 can provide an API that enables software running on user devices to access facilities provided by the Location Request Manager., 126316=In one embodiment, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 responds to requests from the Location Request Manager 2200 for location data relating to target users and returns the location data along with reliability scores for the data to the Location Request Manager 2200. In one embodiment, the Location Tracking Manager 2300 retrieves location data from one or more databases of location data maintained by the Location Tracking Manager 2300. In one embodiment, a global presence graph maintained by the Location Tracking Manager 2300 can be used to retrieve location data relating to a target.}",
