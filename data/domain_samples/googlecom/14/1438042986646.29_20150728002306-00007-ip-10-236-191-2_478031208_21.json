If it specifies 82 a CLSID, CoGetClassObjectFromURL checks to see if the desired software component (i.e., the control file) is registered and installed 84 on the local computer 36 with the right version number 86. If it does not specify a CLSID (i.e., has a value of CLSID_NULL), CoGetClassObjectFromURL will choose the appropriate CLSID by interpreting the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) 88 type specified in the szContentType parameter. MIME provides a standard mechanism for messages to be exchanged over computers connected to the Internet. See Internet Standard Document: RFC 1521 for specific details on MIME.}",

Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto. It should be understood that the programs, processes, and methods described herein are not related or limited to any particular type of computer apparatus, unless indicated otherwise. Various types of general purpose or specialized computer apparatus may be used with or perform operations in accordance with the teachings described herein. However, other applications which are not network browsers, and do not parse HTML documents with <OBJECT> or <EMBED> tags can also use system 56 and methods 66 to download any type of computer software component from a local or remote computer by passing appropriate parameters to CoGetClassObjectFromURL interface. The computer software components need not provide dynamic or interactive multimedia to a client application. In addition interfaces other than CoGetClassObjectFromURL could also be used. HTML documents typically contain one or more HTML <OBJECT> or <EMBED> tags. When an HTML <OBJECT> or <EMBED> tag is encountered during browsing, Internet Explorer\ufffd parses the appropriate parameters out of the <OBJECT> and <EMBED> tags and passes them to the CoGetClassObjectFromURL interface as was described above.
