For attaching a tow line to the device, an eye bolt 244 is screwed into the lower part of pivot block 226, which block, as before indicated, is securely fastened to adapter 224. Latch pins 239 are actuated by respective cam plates 240, FIG. 10, into cam slots 240a of which extend camming projections 239a, respectively, of such latch pins for back and forth sliding movement. Extension of the latch pins toward and into a set of opposing recesses 237 is effected by a spring 241 bearing against the cam plates, while retraction of such latch pins is effected when the user pulls cable 242 that connects the cam plates with a lever 243 pivotally mounted conveniently adjacent to the other handle 225a of handle bar 225. Pressing of lever 243 toward such handle 225a by the rider while riding pulls cable 242 to retract cam plates 240 against the urge of spring 241 and to force latch pins 239 through their retraction strokes for unlatching the two sections 220a and 220b of",
