    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18031=To achieve the object mentioned above, this invention provides a method for the production of a superplastic Mg-based composite material which comprises preparing a composite material consisting of ceramic particles formed of at least one compound selected from among TiC, AlN, Si3 N4, and TiB2 and having a maximum particle diameter of 15 \u03bcm and a matrix formed of a magnesium alloy containing at least one element selected from among Al, Zn, Zr, and Li in an amount in the range of from 2 to 15% by weight, the ceramic particles being dispersed in the matrix in the range of from 5 to 40% by volume based on the total volume of the composite material, keeping the composite material at a temperature in the range of from 200\ufffd to 500\ufffd C. and meanwhile extruding the heated composite material at an extrusion ratio of at least 10:1, and then keeping the resultant extrudate at a temperature in the range of from 250\ufffd to 550\ufffd C. and meanwhile rolling the heated extrudate at a distortion rate in the range of from 1.0 to 4.0, and also provides a superplastic Mg-based composite material produced by the method mentioned above., 26260=A bar, 40 mm in diameter, of a Mg-5% Zn composite material reinforced with TiC particles (average TiC particle diameter 2 to 5 \u03bcm and particle diameters of Mg 100 to 200 microns) produced by the melt stirring method was extruded at 673\ufffd K. at an extrusion ratio of 25:1 to obtain a bar 8 mm in diameter. This bar was rolled repeatedly at 673\ufffd K. at a draft ratio equivalent to a distortion rate of not more than about 0.1 to obtain a thin sheet composite material having a thickness of about 1 mm., 15392=As magnesium composite materials reinforced with ceramic whiskers or particles, magnesium-based composite materials reinforced using SiC whiskers or particles are known to the art (Jun Sun Kim, Junichi Kaneko, and Makoto Sugamata: J. Japan Inst. Metals, 56-7 (1992) 819/827 p). Methods available for the production of these magnesium-based composite materials include the forging cast, the melt stirring and mixing (vortex) method, the compocasting method, the powder metallurgy method, and the foil metallurgy method., 22251=The extrusion has to be carried out at a temperature in the range of from 200\ufffd to 500\ufffd C. at an extrusion ratio of at least 10:1 and the subsequent rolling has to be carried out at a temperature in the range of from 250\ufffd to 550\ufffd C. at a distortion rate in the range of from 1.0 to 4.0.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In FIG. 2, each open mark (\u2218) represents a total elongation exceeding 300% at a high strain rate of 0.0675-1 and each solid mark (\ue8a0) the occurrence of superplasticity, though the magnitude of total elongation is lower than that of the open mark (\u2218). Since superplasticity is manifested when m exceeds 0.3 [Higashi Kenji, Materia Japan, 34-8 (1995), Yasuhiro Maehara, Terence Langdon, Netsushori, 30-3 (1991)], the marks \u2218 and \ue8a0 in FIG. 1 both indicate the occurrence of superplasticity. In FIG. 1, the symbol \"m\" stands for the sensitivity index of the strain rate relative to the resistance of material deformation, i.e. the linear gradient indicating the relation between the magnitude of the resistance of the material deformation and the strain rate (variation of resistance of material deformation)/(variation of strain rate). In FIG. 1, m=0.3 occurs for o and m=0.43 for \ue8a0. This sheet material was subjected to a tensile test at 743K. The relation between the strain rate and the resistance of the material deformation is shown in FIG. 1 and the relation between the total elongation and the strain rate in FIG. 2. In both diagrams, the open circles (\u2218) and the solid circles (\ue8a0) represent the TiC contents, 20% and 10% by volume, in the material.
