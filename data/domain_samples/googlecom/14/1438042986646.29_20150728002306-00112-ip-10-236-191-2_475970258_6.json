The channel is so constructed as to support the flexible tubing 56 therein above the power cable within the enclosed chamber 12. The flexible tubing 56 includes fog nozzles 60 extending downwardly therefrom at equal intervals along the length of the tubing. The flow of liquid within the flexible tubing is provided by a small pump within the manhole, the pump having a suction line connected to the main reservoir within the manhole 30. The nozzles 60 generate a water mist within the enclosed chamber which is carried by the flow of forced air. Cooling is achieved by evaporation of small liquid droplets entrained in the air stream. Further, evaporation of the liquid may be achieved by use of the embodiment of the invention including the vacuum pump 50. Vacuum pump 50 is employed to reduce the pressure within the enclosed chamber to 50 to 100 mm. of mercury absolute, whereby rapid evaporation of the liquid can be achieved. For example, when water is utilized as the liquid, the water boils at",
