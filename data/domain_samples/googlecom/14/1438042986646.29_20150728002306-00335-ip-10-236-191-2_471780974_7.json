FIG. 1 depicts the heart of a human subject. \u201cLA\u201d refers to the left atrium, and \u201cRA\u201d refers to the right atrium. The interatrial septum is depicted as 107. Interatrial pressure vent 100 includes a body element 101 and flow control element 104, embodiments of which will be described in further detail below. The body element 101 comprises flanges 102 and 103. In this and other embodiments described herein, flanges 102 and 103 may be annular flanges, which define a gap 2000 into which the septum 107 fits. In embodiments, after insertion, the interatrial pressure vent is securely situated in an opening created in the interatrial septum. Arrow F in FIG. 1 shows the direction of flow. It can be thus seen that a build up of pressure in the LA can be vented, by way of the inventive device, to the RA.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing exemplary embodiments, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example, and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the claims which follow. . In this embodiment, the core segment 106 and flanges 102 and 103 of the device are substantially similar those described herein. Instead of the flow control elements described above (or in addition thereto) a tube-like member 700 is secured to the core segment 106. The tube member 700 is attached to the core segment 700 in a manner to allow the RA end of tube to extend into the RA in an axial direction, thus the tube's length must be sufficient to extend a distance into the RA. It has been found that the tube 700 configured in this manner prevents embolic particles from entering the tube and crossing over the septal divide into the LA. The distance that the tube 700 extends into the RA and beyond the plane of the RA-side flange opening (indicated by dotted line) should be at least a 1 mm but may be up to 2 cm in preferable embodiments. Even at relatively short lengths (such as where the tube extends only a few millimeters",
