    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{77674=In the respective embodiments using the aforesaid tablets, the coordinate input that is the original function of the tablet and the approach or contact detection function are both used. Also, the electric power saving control operation such as the tablet control, the decrease of the clock frequency of the control circuit or a low voltage driving or the like is carried out such that the tablet is operated as only the approach or contact sensor. Further, such a variant is also possible that the approach or contact situation of the operation medium can constantly be monitored by using approach/contact detection exclusively-designed sensor such as an image sensor, a microphone or a temperature sensor instead of the tablet regardless of the situation that the whole of the apparatus is set in the power saving state/non-power saving state. FIG. 20 shows a block diagram of the hardware for the above-mentioned case. In FIG. 20, reference numeral 2003 designates an approach or contact detection sensor, and 2004 a sensor control circuit. In this case, an electric power saving control such as a clock pulse frequency control and the power supply voltage control is not carried out as shown in FIG. 20., 84425=As a method of directly judging a distance between the apparatus and the object by using image information, there is known a method that utilizes a stereoscopy. As shown in FIG. 14, for example, two television cameras 1401 and 1402, each of which is formed of a lens and an image sensor though not shown, are located at positions distant from each other and a distance up to the object is calculated on the basis of a difference (parallax) of the images thereof. In FIG. 14, reference numeral 1405 designates a display portion. If the distance up to the operation medium or the like is sequentially calculated, then it can be determined by the processing similar to those of FIGS. 12, 13 for the black pixel count value B(t) in FIG. 12 that the operation medium approaches or gets away from the apparatus. As shown in FIG. 15, assuming now that optical axes 1403, 1404 of two television cameras 1401, 1402 are made parallel, b is a distance from the lenses of the television cameras 1401, 1402 to the image sensors thereof, D is a spacing between the two television cameras 1401, 1402 and X1, Xr are positions of object images, then a distance a from the lenses to the objects is expressed by the following equation (1):, 78999=FIG. 10 is a conceptual diagram of an apparatus that utilizes image information supplied thereto from some proper image apparatus such as a television camera to judge whether or not the user operation medium approaches. According to this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 10, by effectively utilizing the fact that image information such as the user operation medium obtained from a television camera 1001 is changed considerably, it is determined whether the user operation medium 1000 is approaching or is separated from the apparatus. In FIG. 10, reference numeral 1002 designates a display unit. If a fisheye lens or a wide-angle lens is used as a lens of the television camera 1001, then a wide field of vision around the apparatus can be detected with the result that the approach of the operation medium 1000 can be picked up as a picture more reliably. In addition, in the case of the wide-angle lens, a depth of focus is small and therefore the change of a shading of a picture of a distant scene becomes small and such small change can be neglected., 80073=FIG. 11B shows a time relationship between a black pixel count value B(t) in a binary image (signal) from the television camera 1001 and the state of the apparatus, i.e., a distance in which the operation medium 1000 is approaching from the condition that no operation medium is staying around the apparatus and comes away from the apparatus after the apparatus was operated in FIG. 10 and the change that the black pixel count value B(t) in the binary image is changed with time. As shown in FIG. 11, when no operation medium is staying around the apparatus, only a distant scene is changed. However, because such distant scene is not focused, the value of the black pixel count value B(t) is not changed substantially. In this case, the apparatus is set in the standby mode under the power saving state. When the operation medium 1000 is approaching the apparatus, the operation medium 1000 is started being focused and an image thereof becomes large so that image information is changed considerably and the value of the black pixel count value B(t) is increased. If the operation medium 1000 approaches a certain distance of the apparatus, then the value of the black pixel count value B(t) becomes larger than a threshold value \u03b8 so that the apparatus enters the non-power saving state. Then, it is displayed that the apparatus is made active. During the user operates the apparatus by using the operation medium 1000, the value of the black pixel count value B(t) is changed in response to a motion of hands and fingers. Although it is frequently observed that the value of the black pixel count value B(t) becomes smaller than the threshold value \u03b8, a time in which the value of the black pixel count value B(t) is smaller than the threshold value \u03b8 is short and the apparatus continues its non-power saving state. Soon after the user gets away from the apparatus, the value of the black pixel count value B(t) becomes small and then settled in the state that it becomes smaller than the threshold value \u03b8. If a duration of this state becomes longer than a predetermined time T, then the information processing apparatus again enters the standby mode under the power saving state., 28991=In order to save an electric power of a primary battery, a secondary battery or a solar battery of an electronic apparatus such as a portable personal computer, a word processor or the like, an electric power saving control operation such as a resume operation for interrupting the supply of the whole power after information necessary for continuing work had been saved in a nonvolatile memory has heretofore been carried out when a user operation medium such as a keyboard or a mouse is not in use for a long period of time. Further, as a technique for preventing a battery from being consumed uselessly, JP-A-1-271796, for example, describes such a technique where a quantity of light of a back light that illuminates a display screen of a liquid crystal display device is adjusted in accordance with a quantity of external light. This previously-proposed method is effective, to a certain extent, for electronic equipments such as a portable personal computer, a word processor or a pen-based electronic equipment having a liquid crystal display panel with a back light in saving an electric power and also in improving viewability of picture screen. This method, however, has no consideration of the situation that the user operates these electronic equipments. There is then the problem that, when the user has left his seat and the electronic equipment has not been in use during a long period of time, the battery thereof is consumed uselessly., 82280=FIGS. 12 and 13 show examples of flowcharts of the electric power saving control operation and the state display control operation that are executed by using video information from the television camera 1001, respectively. Because the situation that the electric power saving control and the state display control of the value of the black pixel count value B(t) shown in FIG. 11 are changed with time becomes similar to the change of the distance shown in FIG. 2, such situation need not be described herein and only a part inherent in the image information will be described. In any of the flowcharts shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, the processing is executed at the unit of fields corresponding to one picture of image information. A flowchart shown in FIG. 12 corresponds to the flowchart shown in FIG. 3 and is used to judge whether or not the operation medium 1000 approaches the apparatus while the apparatus is in the standby mode under the power saving state. A flowchart of FIG. 13 corresponds to the flowchart of FIG. 4 and is used to judge whether or not the operation medium 1000 is distant from the apparatus for a sufficiently long period of time while the apparatus is made active under the non-power saving state., 83524=Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, following the start of operation, it is judged in judgement steps 1205 and 1309 whether or not the scanning of one picture screen is completed by the image sensor. Further, in steps 1205 and 1309, the synchronization also is effected. In the next steps 1201 and 1301, image information of analog value is converted into binary value. Then, the processing proceeds to steps 1202 and 1302, whereat the black pixel count value B(t) within the picture screen is referred to. In the next judgement steps 1203, 1303 and 1305, it is judged whether or not the black pixel count value B(t) and the threshold value \u03b8 are compared with each other. The judgement steps 1202, 1303 and 1305 in which the black pixel count value B(t) and the threshold value \u03b8 are compared with each other correspond to the distance judgement steps 301, 401 and 403 in FIGS. 3 and 4., 86555=As shown in FIG. 17, analog signals 1703, 1704 from two image sensors 1401, 1402 are digitized by a sampling and A/D conversion in digitizers 1705, 1706, respectively. Digital signals 1707, 1708 are stored in buffer memories 1709, 1710, each of which is of a frame memory configuration that can store digital image information of one picture screen, for example. FIGS. 16A, 16B respectively show shading images stored in the frame memories, in which reference numerals 1601, 1602 depict images of the operation medium 1400. Reference numeral 1711 in FIG. 17 denotes a feature extracting unit which scans a local mask 1603 of a proper size on each point of an image shown in FIG. 16A to extract a coordinate (X1, Y) of the feature at which the shading pattern within the mask is changed most. The coordinate (X1, Y) is registered in a coordinate value registration unit/shading pattern memory 1712 together with the shading pattern 1604. The size of the scanning mask 1603 may be determined in advance in response to the size of the image such as the operation medium in the distance to be detected. In the image stored in the buffer memory 1710 and which is shown in FIG. 16A, the feature point extracting circuit 1711 scans the detected feature point coordinate (X1, Y) and respective points on the same Y coordinate with a local mask 1605 of the same size as the local mask 1603. Then, shading patterns obtained from respective points and the registered pattern 1604 are compared with each other by a pattern matching unit 1714, thereby detecting the most similar shading pattern 1601 and its coordinate (Xr, Y). In FIG. 17, the Y coordinate common to the two images shown in FIGS. 16A, 16B is supplied from the coordinate value registration unit 1712 to the buffer memory 1710 in response to a signal 1719, and the shading pattern 1604 (see FIG. 16A) is supplied to the pattern matching unit 1714. In this way, the corresponding points (X1, Y) and (Xr, Y) can be obtained. In FIG. 17, reference numeral 1717 denotes a distance judging unit which calculates a distance from X1, Xr obtained from signals 1713, 1716 and the equation (1) and, determines whether or not the calculated result is larger than the threshold value \u03b8 similarly to FIG. 12. A judged result is output from the distance judging unit 1717 as a signal 1718. In FIG. 17, because the two images shown in FIGS. 16A, 16B are processed by using the two-dimensional local masks 1603 and 1605, the buffer memories 1709, 1710 may be replaced with a two-dimensional local memory that can be realized by connecting a serial-input and serial-output shift register having a capacity of (n-1) rasters and serial-input and parallel-output registers having n\ufffdn pixels. As described above, the approach detection processing can be effected by a real time processing in synchronism with the scanning of the picture screen or by a so-called off-line processing during the blanking period., 89604=FIG. 18 shows an example of an arrangement of an apparatus for detecting the approach or contact of the operation medium by utilizing acoustic information. As shown in FIG. 18, an operation medium 1800 provided as acoustic information such as a voice and a sound wave is detected by a microphone 1801. Although it is preferable that the microphone 1801 is of a non-directional microphone as much as possible so that the user can detect the operation medium 1800 by accessing the operation medium 1800 from any direction, microphones may be attached to side surfaces and rear surface of the housing as shown by reference numerals 1802, 1803, 1804 in FIG. 18. In FIG. 18, reference numeral 1805 designates a display portion., 91943=FIG. 19 shows an example of the processing apparatus that detects an operation medium by utilizing acoustic information. As shown in FIG. 19, when an operation medium 1800 provided as acoustic information approaches or comes in contact with the apparatus, an analog acoustic signal 1901 is obtained from a microphone 1801. The acoustic information is sampled and digitized by a sampling and digitizing unit 1902. In this case, the acoustic information is sampled by effectively utilizing a ratio of power information to band power or a ratio of low band power to wide band power and so on. A feature extracting unit 1903 is adapted to any one of the above-mentioned frequency spectrum and the feature parameters or a combination thereof. There is provided a standard pattern unit 1904 in which a standard pattern 1908 of the contents corresponding to the above-mentioned (i), (ii) and (iii) is registered in advance. The feature parameter registered in the standard pattern unit 1904 is the feature parameter of the same kind as that of the input pattern 1907 extracted by the feature extracting unit 1903. A pattern matching unit 1905 is adapted to judge a similarity by verifying the input pattern 1907 and the standard pattern 1908. An approach or contact judging unit 1906 judges the approach or contact of the object on the basis of such similarity.}",
