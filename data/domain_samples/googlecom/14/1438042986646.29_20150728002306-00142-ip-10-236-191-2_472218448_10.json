    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A superior effect is yielded in that a highly reliable high purity cobalt target-backing plate assembly capable of withstanding high power sputtering could be obtained without lowering the sputtering efficiency of the high purity cobalt target, while assuring the target thickness by reducing the warp amount after diffusion bonding, and eliminating or at least alleviating corrective procedures. A sputtering test was performed at 30 KW to the targets used in the Examples, but vacuum deterioration caused by water leakage or the like could not be acknowledged. Moreover, the reduction in sputtering efficiency of the cobalt target did not change. Further, upon examining the high purity cobalt target-backing plate assembly of the Examples with ultrasonic flaw detection, it has been confirmed that there were no portions which were not bonded. Accordingly, it is clear that an aluminum insert material having a thickness of 2 mm or more is optimum when bonding a high purity cobalt target and a copper chrome alloy backing plate. Further, although not shown in the Examples, similar results were obtained upon using an aluminum alloy insert material such as A5052. In addition, in the case of employing a nickel plate or silver plate having a thickness of 2 mm as the insert material, the result was that the high purity cobalt target and copper chrome alloy backing plate did not bond even though the insert material had sufficient thickness. Contrarily, in Comparative Example",
