The processor (47) also carries out, where appropriate, the elimination of the stimulatory impulse in the processing of the signal. The four conversion systems (46), (46'), (46\") and (46\"') may be replaced by four sampling/blocking units, followed by an analogue multiplexer, followed by a single analogue-to-digital converter. FIG. 13 shows the localization, on the needle (32) for example, of the active portion (51) of the means of destruction of the seat of activation (12) of the ventricular tachycardia. In FIG. 12, the amplifier (34) is protected at its input, by a limiter (45), against voltage surges which are introduced by devices which the operator may use in proximity to the probe (for example: electric scalpel, defibrillator). In FIG. 9, if it is used, an external cardiac stimulator connected directly to the input (42) is used to control an",
