It will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that modifications and changes may be made to the invention as thus described without departing from the scope and spirit thereof. Web 11 may be installed on top of a sheet or sheets of filter fabric 35 to achieve further protection of surface 20. Such an installation may be appropriate where both fabric layers 12 are impermanent in nature, and revetment mat 31 would otherwise be without filtering means after fabric layers 12 have worn away. Over a period of time, fabric layers 12 and selvage 14 of web 11 may wear partially or completely away leaving hardened forms 30 interconnected by cables 16 to form a revetment mat 31 as shown in FIG. 10. Because the inflated filling slots 27 are of minor cross-sectional area compared to hardened forms 30, they serve as controlled failure areas; they tend to fail or break rather than hardened forms 30 and in so doing leave a highly articulable revetment mat 31. This mat 31 of interconnected forms becomes even more articulable after one or both fabric layers 12 have worn away. Cables 16 extend beyond the edges of web 11 so that they may be swaged or otherwise connected to cables of other webs of the present invention and thereby allow the webs",
