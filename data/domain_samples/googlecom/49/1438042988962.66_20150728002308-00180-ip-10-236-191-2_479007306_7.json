As shown in FIG. 25, the evaluation component 2170 has determined that the user is busy and that the notification therefore fails. The evaluation component 2170 then provides this information, along with a copy of the notification, to the arbitrary process 2410. In response to this information, the arbitrary process 2410 sends an OOF message 2510 based on the user's calendar. More specifically, the arbitrary process 2410 has evaluated the sender of the notification (using whatever heuristics have been selected) and determined that the sender is important enough to the user to receive a customized announcement. For example, the customized busy announcement could state \u201cthe user you are trying to contact is giving a presentation right now, but if you try and contact him at time x, you will likely be successful as his calendar is free then.\u201d}",

The user context 2150 would thus indicate to the notification system that the user is currently not available to interruption. For example, the user may be giving a presentation or may be otherwise fully occupied such that drawing anything on the screen would currently be inappropriate. Alternatively, if the user is available, then the user context 2150 will so indicate., 163752=At a block 2730, a second process registers for receiving communication events. The second process in one embodiment may be a program that has some domain knowledge of the user's activities outside of the data that the notification system has. For example, the second process may be a calendaring program and may have knowledge of what activities the user is currently engaged in., 131057=The portion 1520 relates to the icon for sending the notification. In one embodiment, minimum and maximum sizes are specified (e.g., in one example a minimum size is 16\ufffd16 and a maximum size is 80\ufffd80). The portion 1530 relates to the title text for the notification. The portion 1540 relates to the main BodyText for the notification. The portion 1550 relates to a property that should be set as True if the user is to be able to click inside the notification to trigger some event.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It will be appreciated that the elements of the system may be configured to address certain privacy concerns. For example, the system described above may be configured so as to properly broker the permissions for sending customized automated busy replies such that personal information is not revealed inappropriately. In one embodiment, the system brokers the permissions for a process to register to receive such busy replies, such that the system may not know what the arbitrary process is going to do, but the system can broker what processes can be registered and can help guide the user to understanding the implications of allowing a process to be registered. In addition, there are various possible implementations for how this new type of agent process can act on the user's behalf. For example, the process may choose to send the communication back to the communication initiator itself, or it may choose to manipulate a public object model of the process by which the communication was sent. In addition, there are various possible implementations as to the list of individuals for whom such an agent should send a busy reply. One implementation would be to send it to all individuals who initiated communication during",
