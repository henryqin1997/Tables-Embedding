Examples of in-vivo sensing devices providing image data are provided in embodiments described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,531 to Iddan et al. and/or in International Application number WO 01/65995 entitled \u201cA Device And System For In Vivo Imaging\u201d, published on Sep. 13, 2001, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Such embodiments generally use light or electromagnetic radiation to provide images, while various embodiments of the present invention use ultrasonic energy to provide such images. Typically, a device according to the present invention need not include video imaging capability, although it is within the scope of the present invention to include video or other types of imaging capability. However, certain features of the embodiments described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,531 and/for International Application WO 01/65995 may be used in embodiments of the present invention. In addition, the device, system and method according to the present invention may be used with any device, system and method sensing a body lumen or cavity., 45334=[0035] In a typical embodiment, location detection methods such as those discussed in United States patent application publication number US-2002-0173718-A1, filed May 20, 2002, entitled \u201cArray System and Method For Locating an In-Vivo Signal Source,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference, may be used.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0054] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described herein above. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the claims that follow: [0053] In one embodiment of the system and method of the present invention, a device may measure an average (e.g., typical) mechanical compliance of slices of tissue (e.g., using ultrasonic or acoustical impedance). In such an embodiment, the measured values may be, for example, presented on a graph. A possible pathology may be observed as, for example, a deviation from the typical values of the acoustic impedance. A multiple frequency (e.g. f1 and f2) graph may be presented in order to strengthen the single frequency findings. [0052] In alternate embodiments, multiple images may be acquired using multiple ultrasonic frequencies for the same locations in the lumen. [0051] In certain embodiments, multiple methods of collecting sensing data may be used. For example, one or more of a single transducer, a set of transducers, and/or an optical imager may be used, and one modality may augment another. For example, a graph or other representation may be created of acoustical impedance to gather information which can be used to mark portions of an associated image stream as significant. A plurality of ultrasonic transmitters may be used with",
