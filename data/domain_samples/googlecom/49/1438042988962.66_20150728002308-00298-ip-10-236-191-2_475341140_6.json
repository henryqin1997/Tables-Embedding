While this description of the invention is made with reference to a specific embodiment, the description is only illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications to the present invention can be made to the embodiment described above by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In this alternative version of the injector body [500], a ball [517] and spring [518] are used as the check valve. The function of this check valve is identical to the check valve [304] described above. An alternative tip trigger piece [516] of the injector body [500] presses against a cylinder [511] that has angled ramps on its opposite end. The ramps engage with the clips on a ring [510] that force it to rotate counter clockwise. The rotation of the ring unlocks the translation of the main cylinder [506], which moves the parts [501] to [509] forward. The attached needle assembly [200] also moves forward, inserting the needle [201] into the subcutaneous or intra muscular space of the body. At the maximum forward motion of translation, the ramps on the main cylinder [506] engage with and rotate the release ring [509] clockwise, disengaging the ratchets on the main cylinder. This allows",
