    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33760=By the way, it has been known to use water-absorbent fine particles composed of an organic polymer in printing media for ink-jet printing. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2-223466 discloses a printing medium provided with an ink-receiving layer containing high water-absorbent resin particles and a binder, while Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-61114 discloses a printing sheet comprising water-absorbent gel particles. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-228039 discloses an ink-receiving layer composed of partially crosslinked multi-layer fine particles and a binder., 72399=(Note 1) Emulsifier Solution A: a solution of a 50:50 (by weight) copolymer of methyl methacrylate and Brenmer PE 200 (trade name, product of Nippon Oil & Fats Co., Ltd.; an acrylic ester monomer having an ethylene oxide chain at its side chain) in methyl ethyl ketone and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (50:50 by weight); solid content: 25%., 53723=Neopentyl glycol, hexamethylenediamine and tolylene diisocyanate were reacted to obtain a polyurethane polyurea resin having hydroxyl groups at its terminals. After 1,035 parts of the polyurethane polyurea resin were dehydrated at 100\ufffd C. under reduced pressure and then cooled down to 70\ufffd C., 397 parts of ethyl acetate were added, and the mixture was thoroughly mixed. Then, 157 parts of tolylene diisocyanate were added to conduct a reaction at 70\ufffd C. for 4 hours. The resultant prepolymer having isocyanate groups at its terminals was diluted with 795 parts of methyl ethyl ketone. After the resultant prepolymer solution was reacted with a solution of 30.8 parts of ethylenediamine and 127.8 parts of triethylenediamine in 2560 parts of water, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, thereby obtaining a transparent colloidal aqueous dispersion having a solid content of 30% and a pH of 8.0., 65008=The mixing ratio by weight of the resin particles to the binder is preferably within a range of from 5:95 to 90:10, more preferably from 30:70 to 70:30. If the content of the resin particles is lower than the lower limit of the above range, the effect of enhancing water absorbency is not markedly brought about. If the content of the resin particles is higher than the upper limit of the above range, the resulting printing medium becomes opaque, and the adhesion of the ink-receiving layer to the base material is lowered, resulting in reduction of practicability., 61576=Examples of the ultraviolet-curing binder resins include the (meth)acrylic esters of polyhydric alcohols, glycols, polyethylene glycol, polyester polyol, polyether polyol, urethane-modified polyether or polyester and the like, and the (meth)acrylic esters of epoxy resins. Specific compounds thereof include ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, propanediol di(meth)acrylate, butanediol di(meth)acrylate, pentanediol di(meth)acrylate, hexanediol di(meth)acrylate, neopentyl glycol di(meth)-acrylate, neopentyl glycol hydroxypivalate di(meth)-acrylate, polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate having 10 to 100 ethylene oxide chains as repeating units, polypropylene glycol di(meth)acrylate and copolymers thereof, polytetrafuran glycol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, the acrylic esters of water-soluble polyepoxides, and urethane-modified products of the above-mentioned compounds. When a urethane-modified product is used, it is desirable to select a non-yellowing aliphatic isocyanate in order to prevent the yellowing of the resulting printing medium. In order to provide an ultraviolet-curing coating formulation, it is possible to use catalysts commonly used as photo-initiated catalysts. Among those, substances having a hydrophilicity and scarcely causing yellowing of a cured film are preferred. Typical examples thereof include photo-cleavable compounds such as Irgacure 184, Irgacure 651 and Irgacure 2959. In the case where the ultraviolet-curing resin is used, a compounding ratio by weight of the fine particles of the resin to the ultraviolet-curing resin is preferably within a range of from 90:10 to 5:95. The ratio of the fine particles of the resin to the ultraviolet-curing resin may vary according to the molecular weight, softening point and the like of the resin used. In the form that the fine particles of the resin are mainly used, the ratio is within a range of from 90:10 to 50:50, while in the form that the resin is mainly used, the ratio is within a range of from 50:50 to 5:95. The ultraviolet-curing resin and the fine particles are thoroughly dispersed, and the resultant dispersion is applied on a base material and subjected to exposure of ultraviolet radiation, thereby completing an ink-receiving layer.}",

To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions. As apparent from Table 1, it is understood that according to the present invention, the water absorbency and brightness are equal to or better than those having an ink-receiving layer in which the conventional water-absorbent resin or particles high in water absorption capacity are used, and the resistance to coloring or rub-off when wetted is greatly improved.
