The local computer may accomplish this by developing several evolving models of what the background is believed to look like, and then comparing its concepts of the background to what camera 105 is currently imaging. Alternatively, components of the local computer that process camera 105 input are collectively known as the vision system. Various embodiments of projection interactive video display system 100 and the vision system are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
