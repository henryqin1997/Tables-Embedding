    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6160=FIG. 1 shows an optical layout discussed in Lahlert for a Lambda Physik ELA machine. Turning to FIG. 1 it can be seen that the assembly 20. The assembly 20 comprises a laser output beam 22, e.g., the output of a XeCl LS 1000 excimer laser made by Lambda Physik. The laser beam 22 is passed through an attenuator 24, which comprises a pair of attenuator plates 26. The beam 22 is then expanded in the long axis by a long axis expansion optic 30, including a first telescope lens 32 and a second telescope lens 34, together forming an expanding telescopic element in the long axis of the beam 22. The beam is then passed through a long axis homogenizer 40 consisting of a first row of cylindrical lenses 42 and a second parallel row of cylindrical lenses 44, the cylindrical lenses of the first row 42 each having a focal point at a selected distance there between in the long axis, followed by an imaging lens 46, imaging the long axis of the beam. The beam is then passed through a short axis homogenizer 50, including a first row of cylindrical lenses 52 and a second row of cylindrical lenses 54, with each lens of the first row 52 having a focal point at a selected distance there between, and followed by an imaging lens 56, imaging the beam in the short axis at a slit 62 formed in a field stop 60, also including a field lens 64. The widened beam 80 is then rotated 90\ufffd by a mirror 90, having, a 90% reflectivity and then passed through a beam short axis magnifier 100, consisting of a 5\ufffd magnification cylindrical doublet having a first lens 102 and a second lend 104, which forms the final ELA beam 120 on or about the substrate 130. The prior art assembly 20 may also have a beam quality monitoring system 110 including a first CCD camera 112 and a second CCD camera 112.}",
