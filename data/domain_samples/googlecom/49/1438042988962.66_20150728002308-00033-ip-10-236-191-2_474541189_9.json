With a pseudolite a GPS transmitter transmits a timing signal much like a GPS satellite. See, The Use of Pseudo-Satellites For Improving GPS Performance, D. Klein, B. Parkinson, Navigation (1984), reprinted Vol. III GPS Navigation p. 135 (1986); Optimal locations of Pseudolites for Differential GPS, B. Parkinson, K. Fitzgibbon, 30 Navigation J. No.4, winter 1986-87 (incorporated by reference for background). The pseudolite transmits from a known location on or near the standard GPS carrier frequency (e.g. L1 or L2) to appear to the GPS receiver like another gps satellite. The difference is the pseudolite does not have normal gps errors (or at least minimal), such as ephemeris, ionospheric, multipath, etc., and more importantly, the pseudolite does not have the intentional degradation, selective availability. Additionally, a differential correction signal can be added to the pseudolite signal if desired. A primary benefit of use of pseudolites is that unlike normal differential correction, pseudolites do not require a separate communications channel. That is, the pseudolites appear as another satellite channel to the receiver. Another benefit is that the timing data from the pseudolite channel is known to be much more precise., 22734=The present invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/804,368 filed Dec. 10, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,093 entitled \u201cGolf Distance Measuring System and Method\u201d and a continuation of Ser.

No. 6,266,008 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Determining Freight Container Locations.\u201d, 25422=As a GPS receiver locates 3 or 4 satellites it determines its distance from each satellite. The intersection of these 3 or 4 spheres enables a precise location of the receiver (and some compensation for timing errors in the receiver's internal clock). The GPS system should have 21 satellites and 3 spares once the system is fully deployed. The full constellation of 24 ellites was declared operational in 1994.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that a variety of combinations of the above embodiments can be easily made. For example, a remote unit 10 may be configured to only operate when it is moved\u2014therefore it includes only the motion detector 54. Movement initiates operation of the repeater 50 and radio system 20 for a short time period or alternatively, when movement stops. ) and determines a location for each remote receiver. A differential correction from the calibration section 40 is applied to achieve a more accurate location if desired. FIG. 5 When operation is initiated, the repeater 50 simply begins to amplify an transmit the GPS timing signals it receives. Therefore, the repeater 50 transmits an identification and a number of GPS timing signals. Each timing signal includes a satellite identification. The base station 12 receives the GPS timing signals ( attached. The remote unit 10 is attached to a freight container 90 when it enters the freight yard. The remote unit 10 is configured to operate once a week unless it is moved. That is, the timer 52 is programmed to initiate operation of the remote unit 10 once every 7 days. Alternatively, motion detector 54 will initiate operation of the remote unit 10 whenever it senses movement. FIG. 6 , the freight yard has a number of freight containers 90 positioned along accessways 92. A number of the",
