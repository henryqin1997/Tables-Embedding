In the therapeutic field, solutions can be injected containing drugs for the treatment of flogistic processes affecting the rear urethra and the prostate. The catheter device can be advantageously used for diagnosis of urethra in men and women. By following the above described method a contrast medium can be injected into the canal or part thereof. Stenosis, fistulae, diverticula which cannot be displayed by the conventional methods can thus be evidenced. The uretro-prostatic and uretro-deferental reflux can also be observed, featured by the contrast display of the deferens and prostate gland ducts. Diagnostics and endo-urethral therapy The two balloon catheter device can be therapeutically used for determining the hydraulic dilation of stenotic portions and to bring drugs, such as cortisone, anti-plastics and the like, into contact with portions thereof. For such use the catheter can be held in situ for the time of treatment without hampering the urinary drain by maintaining only the balloon of the outer catheter 7 partially inflated. The same method can be applied in the same way to a more restricted sector of the canal, where an injury has been already detected (fistulous confluence of traumatic delaceration). The method of double contrast (liquid and gas) can also be used with success, by withdrawing the liquid medium after injection thereof and by insufflating air. This makes it possible",
