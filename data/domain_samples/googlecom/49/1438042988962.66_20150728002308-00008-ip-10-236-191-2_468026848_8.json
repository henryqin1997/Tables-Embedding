    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of various embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and equivalent arrangements will be apparent. G. Conclusion In still another embodiment, spine 105 may comprise the accessory device, or alternatively form a detachable connection for other components. For example, the spine 105 may have a connection to couple to different types of other devices in a modular fashion. In another embodiment, cover portion 120 extends from spine 105 without a flex member 110. The cover portion 120 may be moveable within device slot 212 to enable cover portion 120 to move between the front face 222 and the back face 224 of handheld computer 100. Another embodiment of the invention includes a stylus housed with the handheld computer. The stylus may be equipped with features of spine 105, in a manner described with embodiments of the invention. In a specific embodiment, a stylus includes an elongated member having a length and a cross-section. The cross-section permits the stylus to engage the device slot. The length enables the stylus to be received and retained within the slot. A majority of the length of the elongated member may include a deformable layer. As used herein, majority refers to an amount greater than 50% of the whole. The deformable layer deforms when the stylus engages",
