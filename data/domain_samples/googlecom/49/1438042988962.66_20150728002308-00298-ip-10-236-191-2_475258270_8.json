No. 08/200,353, filed Feb. 22, 1994, now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/803,644, filed Dec. 4, 1991, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/657,460, filed Feb. 19, 1991, now abandoned., 26232=In view of these circumstances, it has been conceived to use an excimer laser light divided from the same light source as the exposure light as an illuminating light for the TTL-type alignment of the excimer stepper. Where the excimer laser light is used for detecting the marks on a wafer, however, there are many cases in which the excimer laser light is intensely absorbed by the resist layer uniformly applied onto the wafer. In the case of a novolac-type photoresist, e.g., MP-2400 (the tradename of Shipley Co.), for example, the photoresist layer applied to a thickness of 1 \u03bcm has a transmittance of as low as 5 to 8% and also the quantity of the light reflected from the mark and returned to the projection lens system represents a double-trip transmittance through the reisist layer thus allowing to expect only the transmittance of about 0.64% at the most., 101223=Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated an example of the exposure apparatus (the stepper 110) used in the system shown in FIG. 12. As the exposure apparatus used in the present embodiment, the conventional apparatus (the exposure apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-283129 corresponding to U.S. application Ser. No. 192,784 filed on May 10, 1988) can be utilized as such.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While, in the foregoing description, the removal of the resist layer from the areas formed with the wafer marks WM has been described in detail, it is needless to say that the each of the methods of respective embodiments is equally applicable to cases where the resist is directly processed to form a desired pattern form by the photo etching method. While, in the foregoing description, the contamination preventive film comprises a water-soluble high molecular film, it is needless to say that the contamination preventive film may be composed of an ARC, negative resist or the like provided that there is no detrimental effect on the resist layer used. Further, the method of removing the contamination preventive film at the final step is not limited to the removal by dissolution and any physical method may be used. Also, in order to effect the selective removal of the resist according to the processing steps of the third embodiment, it is preferable to form a system of the type in which such resist removing apparatus as shown in FIG. 14 is incorporated in a so-called coater/developer including a resist coater and a resist developer in one unit (e.g., the system described in connection with FIG. 12) so that after the resist and the contamination preventive film have been applied by the coater of the coater/developer, the wafer is transferred to the resist removing apparatus to remove the resist",
