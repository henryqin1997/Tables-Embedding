There is no intention, therefore, of limitations to the exact abstract or disclosure herein presented. While a time division multiplexing technique has been described, it will become apparent to those skilled in the art after reviewing the foregoing disclosure that pulse code modulation or random access techniques can be used. It should also be understood that while the system 10 has been described in connection with fast food restaurants, other possible applications will become apparent after reviewing the foregoing specification. Referring now to FIG. 1, the transmitted message-carrying signals are received and recognized by the receptors of all the remote units, such as the receptor 39 of the remote unit 16, in a similar manner as described above in connection with the signals modulated at the 90 KHz subcarrier frequency. The audio signal at the output of the detector 113 is fed to the summing amplifier 41 and then to the delay circuit 40. In this respect, one form of the delay circuit 40 includes an analog to digital converter 40A that is connected to the output of the amplifier 41. A delay device 40B is connected to the output of the analog-to-digital converter 40A and to the input of a",
