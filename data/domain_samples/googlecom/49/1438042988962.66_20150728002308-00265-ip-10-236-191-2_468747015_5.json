MEMS is an enabling technology in the field of solid-state transducers, i.e., sensors and actuators. The MEMS microfabrication technology enables fabrication of large arrays of devices, which individually perform simple tasks but in combination can accomplish complicated functions. Current applications include accelerometers, pressure, chemical and flow sensors, micro-optics, optical scanners, and fluid pumps. For example, one micromachining technique involves masking a body of silicon in a desired pattern, and then deep etching the silicon to remove unmasked portions thereof. The resulting three-dimensional silicon structure functions as a miniature mechanical force sensing device, such as an accelerometer that includes a proof mass suspended by a flexure. Existing techniques for manufacturing these miniature devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,006,487, \u201cMETHOD OF MAKING AN ELECTROSTATIC SILICON ACCELEROMETER\u201d; and 4,945,765 \u201cSILICON MICROMACHINED ACCELEROMETER\u201d; and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the dynamic centerline Cd of the S-bend flexure 304 is optionally determined as a function of the intended operational g-range of the device. Accordingly, the dynamic centerline Cd of the effective bending portion B of the flexure 304 is determined as a function of a deflection of the flexure 304 toward or away from the planar reference surface 310 to a degree consistent with a selected load or operational g-force applied to the movable acceleration sensing element 302. Optionally, the selected load or operational g-force used for determining the S-bend deflection of the flexure 304 is less than the maximum operating g-force of the device 300. The one or more metal electrode layers 104, 105 are positioned as a function of the dynamic centerline Cd of the effective bending portion B of the flexure 304 as determined when the flexure is deflected by S-bending toward or away from the planar reference surface 310. The dynamic centerline Cd of the effective bending portion B of the flexure 304 is shifted relative to the geometric centerline Cg of the relaxed and undeflected flexure. , each",
