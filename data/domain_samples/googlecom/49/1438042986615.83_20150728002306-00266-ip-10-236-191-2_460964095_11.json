    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{102596=[0109] The data shows that epoxy resins EPON 828, RSL 1462, and EPON 825, which have hydroxyl groups in the molecule, have shorter gel times than the purified EPON 828 resin. This leads to a processing advantage for the non-hydroxyl containing purified EPON 828 glycidyl epoxy resin. Even though the cycloaliphatic epoxy resin ERL 4221E contains no hydroxyl moieties, it is far more sensitive to acid and is more susceptible to gelation., 54735=[0044] A preferred method of making ionically clean epoxy resins is described in U.S. application No. 09/454,558, entitled \u201cProcess for the Elimination of Materials Containing Hydrolyzable Halides and Other High Molecular Weight Materials from Epihalohydrin Derived Epoxy Resins\u201d, filed on Dec. 7, 1999, incorporated by reference herein., 40843=[0013] \u201cSubstantially insoluble\u201d means that when a particulate form (1-10 mil (0.025-0.25 mm)) of the insoluble component is added to a liquid component, an opaque blend is formed which remains unchanged and only goes translucent upon heating of the mixture to a temperature of 80\ufffd C. or greater., 45103=[0022] Examples of useful bisphenol A-epichlorohydrin epoxy resins include, but are not limited to, EPON\u2122 Resins 825, 826, and 828, available from Shell Chemical Company, Houston, Tex.; D.E.R.\u2122 330, 331, and 332, available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.; and ARALDITE\u2122 GY 6008, GY 6010, and GY 2600, available from Vantico Inc., Brewster, N.Y., 63600=[0058] \u201c4,8-Bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]dodecane\u201d was available from Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, Wis.;, 45817=[0024] Examples of useful mono, di and multifunctional glycidyl ether resins include, but are not limited to, XB 4122, TACTIX 556, TACTIX 742, and ARALDITE 510, available from Vantico Inc., Brewster, N.Y; and EPON\u2122 1510, HELOXY\u2122 Modifier 107, and HELOXY\u2122 Modifier 48, available from Shell Chemical Company, Houston, Tex., 43723=[0019] The adhesives and adhesive compositions of the invention do not include polyimide oligomers having a molecular weight of up to about 8,000 g/mol (Mn) having a backbone that is unreactive with an epoxy resin as described in U.S. application No. 09/611,450, entitled Polyimide Hybrid Adhesives, filed on Jul. 6, 2000., 34708=[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/216,280, filed Jul. 6, 2000., 87758=[0100] About 0.2 g of 1:1 blends by weight of purified EPON 828 and a hydroxyl containing compound were prepared and placed on a one inch (25.4 mm) wide\ufffdtwo inch (50.8 mm) long\ufffd0.0155 inch (0.39 mm) thick copper test piece. Eight 0.025 inch (0.635 mm) diameter eutectic solder balls (63:37 by weight Sn/Pb) were placed in the blend and pressed down gently to make contact with the copper surface. The copper test piece was placed on a hot plate set at 220\ufffd C. After 60 seconds, the number of solder balls that spread was recorded., 79203=[0092] Examples 1-3, Comparative Example C-4, and Comparative Example C-5 were tested for outgassing as determined by percent weight loss by Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) using a TGA 2950 Thermogravimetric Analyzer, available from TA Instruments, New Castle, Del. Each sample was heated from ambient temperature to 140\ufffd C. at a rate of 90\ufffd C. per minute, held at 140\ufffd C. for 1 minute, then heated to 225\ufffd C. at the rate of 90\ufffd C. per minute, and held at 225\ufffd C. for 2 minutes. This profile mimics the temperature conditions in a solder reflow oven., 53781=[0042] The purified epoxy product has a higher cured glass transition temperature than the less pure version which is advantageous. The purified epoxy product is also more predictable due to product consistency. The viscosity is lower than the less pure version of the same epoxy resin. There is no residual base in the epoxy product which is advantageous. Residual base may inhibit cationically cured epoxies. Other low hydrolyzable halide epoxy resins such as EPON\u2122 Resin 1462, available from Shell Chemical Company, which have some residual base are described as having a yellow color (a Gardner Color Scale value of less than 3). The purified epoxy product is colorless. For example, using the Gardner test (ASTM D1544-80), the Gardner Color Scale value is less than 0.1 for EPON\u2122 Resin 828., 68153=[0085] A three-neck, round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and temperature probe was used. First, 500 parts of EPON RESIN 828 (689 parts per million by weight hydrolyzable chloride) was added to the flask and heated to 70\ufffd C. A premix of 1.5 parts of 85 percent potassium hydroxide in 1.5 parts of water was added to the EPON RESIN 828, with mixing. The mixture was heated for 4 hours, after which dry ice was added and mixing continued for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, yielding a crude product. The crude product was distilled on a rolled film evaporator at 185\ufffd C. and 0.001 Torr to give 224 parts of a colorless material. Analysis showed that hydrolyzable chloride in the material was reduced to 2.2 parts per million by weight as determined according to ASTM Method D 1726-90, \u201cStandard Test Methods for Hydrolyzable Chloride Content of Liquid Epoxy Resins\u201d, (Test Method B);}",
