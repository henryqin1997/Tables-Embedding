    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The details of construction can be altered, for example, by coupling the drive of the lens systems 24 to plate 28 with an equivalent system using cables pulled around rollers. Energization of motor 38 can be controlled by a foot switch 51, as described above, or by an autofocus system with a distance measurement system using, e.g., infrared distance measurement and a computer control. A motor 38 with an output push rod 39 is attached to a transverse portion of anchor plate 37 and rod 39 is attached to slot plate 28. When energized, motor 38 drives rod 39 to move plate 28 forward and backward in the directions of arrow 31. Reaction arms 40 are pivotally mounted at one end on drive plates 25 and at the other ends at anchor plate 37. These arms provide movable pivot points about which plates 25 and the optical systems are swivelled rather than simply being moved back and forth by the motor drive and plate 28. It is necessary for slot plate 28 to be guided parallel with the centerline of the optical systems as it is moved in the manner described above so that it does not rotate. For this purpose, slot plate 28 has a central longitudinal guide slot 34 along the center line of the system, parallel with the central bisector, through which two pins 35 and 36 which are carried by an anchor",
