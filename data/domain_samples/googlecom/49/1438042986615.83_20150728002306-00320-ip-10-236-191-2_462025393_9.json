This facilitates the laser radiation positioned on the one side of the disk structure to penetrate the first and subsequent layers and the recording or read out can be performed without the use of excessive laser power. For a high performance Co/Pt superlattice disk the desirable thickness is greater than 15 nm. Also sputter deposition is a method of choice for high throughput manufacturing the Co/Pt superlattice magneto-optic media and sputtering pressure is kept less than 15 mT. It was observed earlier that the squareness of the Kerr hysteresis loop and the anisotropy energy is very small when the Co/Pt multilayers are deposited at a sputtering pressure above 15 mT. (For example, see references, Carcia et al J. Mag. Magn. Mat. 121(1993)452; Hashimoto et al J. Mag. Magn. Mat. 88(1990)211; Zeper et al J. Appl. Phys. 70(1991)2264, Ochiai et al IEEE Trans. MAG 25 (1989)3755, and Ochiai et al, European Patent Appl. 0304873 (1988). These multilayers have poor crystalline quality and the optical noise is unacceptably high. Thus the useable sputtering pressure for depositing Co/Pt with satisfactory performance was limited to less than 15 mT (see reference, International Patent Appl. WO/91/08578 by Carcia, \"Process for sputtering multilayers for magneto-optic recording\", 1991). Also, Co/Pt media having greater than 15 nm thickness and deposited using conventional sputter deposition conditions such as use of low sputtering pressure is opaque to light transmission. The laser energy is totally absorbed in the recording layer and is not able to pass through the subsequent layers. Thus Co/Pt superlattices of these thickness prepared in a conventional manner cannot be used for multilevel recording scheme., 31486=As shown in FIG. 3 the transmission through the film increases with decreasing the Co/Pt film thickness. Also Co/Pt multilayer deposited at higher pressure has higher transmission through the multilayer. But the magnetic coercivity of the film shows an adverse effect with decreasing multilayer thickness. It decreases rapidly with the decreasing film thickness. For example, FIGS. 4A and 4B show the Kerr hysteresis loops of the 15 nm and 5 nm Co/Pt films deposited at 40 mT Kr. It shows that the coercivity has decreased dramatically from 1446 Oersted for 15 nm thick film to a significantly a lower value of 256 Oersted for 5 nm thick film. Such a low coercivity film can not be used for magneto-optic recording. First, it is difficult to write on this film even with a low bias field. Secondly, the recorded is data is very unstable., 32343=We unexpectedly found that very thin Co/Pt multilayer can be used as the recording layer if the Co/Pt medium is deposited at an unusually high sputtering pressure. FIG. 5 shows the Kerr hysteresis loops of the 5 nm Co/Pt multilayer deposited at 100 um Kr. This multilayer has a coercivity of 1275 Oe and high Kerr hysteresis loop squareness., 17561=The present application is related to U.S. application Ser.

In the above examples, results were described using indium-tin-oxide seed layers. We also used other seed layers such as ZnO, Zn--Sn--O, and SiC and found similar beneficial effects as above when the seed layer of thickness less than 16 nm were deposited below sputtering pressure of 5 mT and thin Co/Pt multilayers were deposited at a sputtering pressure of greater than 15 mT. A two-level disk structure as shown in FIG. 2 was prepared as follows: First a data level 1 recording layer was deposited by sputter depositing 5 nm thick alternating layers of Co/Pt at a sputtering pressure of 100 mT Kr on to a 3.5 nm thick In-Sn-O seed layer deposited at 1 mT Kr on the on the 5.25\" dia. glass substrate. A 20 \u03bcm lacquer layer which acts as a spacer was overcoated by spin coating on the Co/Pt multilayer. Then data level 2 recording layer consisting of 3.5 nm In-Sn-O seed layer deposited at 1 mT Kr followed by 20 nm Co/Pt multilayer deposited at 100 mT Kr was deposited on the lacquer layer. Finally",
