Typically the thickness of the laminations is of the order of 0.001-inch. While this invention is disclosed herein in detail as applied to a transformer having a core of a wound amorphous metal web of small thickness, as to which this invention has unique advantages, it is understood that the adaptation of the principles of this invention to transformers of other types is within the scope of equivalents of this application and of any patent that may issue on or as a result thereof, typically as the range of equivalents is applied in Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co. 339 U.S. 605; 70 Supreme Court Reporter 854 (1950) and interpreted in Uniroyal v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp. 5 USPQ 2d 1434 (CAFC 1988)., 21124=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/293,162, filed Jan. 3, 1989 abandoned}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While preferred embodiments and preferred practice of this invention have been disclosed herein, many modifications thereof are feasible. This invention is not to be restricted except insofar as is necessitated by the spirit of the prior art. In the practice of this invention, the flux f2' flows from lamination R2' into lamination L1' at gap G2' and reenters laminations R2' after it passes gap G2'. Flux f1' when reaching gap G1' flows through R2'. It reenters R1' after passing gap G1'. In the practice of this invention the inclination is 60\ufffd and the cut is at 60\ufffd to the center line 41. The area above gap G2' is 0.25\ufffd4.6 or 1.15 square inches. The area over which flux f2' reenters R2' is 0.375\ufffd4.6=1.73 square inches. The increase in area in each case is produced without reducing the number of steps within the region. The smaller the inclination of the cut to the center line, the greater the area over which the crowding is spread. One way to minimize this flux crowding and the resulting saturation and core loss increase is to spread the flux crowding over as large an area as practicable. In the prior art as shown in FIG. 12, the crowding is spread over an area of 1.0 square inch, 0.25\ufffd4. Once flux f2 passes gap G2, it reenters R2 before reaching the gap G1. This reentry of flux f2 takes place over 0.375-inch.",
