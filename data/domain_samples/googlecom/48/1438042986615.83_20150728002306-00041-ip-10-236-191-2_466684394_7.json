While I have shown and described the preferred embodiments of my invention, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise than as herein specifically illustrated or described, and that certain changes in the form and arrangement of parts and the specific manner of practicing the invention may be made within the underlying idea or principles of the invention. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the envelope 2 may be everted or turned inside out to the configuration of FIG. 6 in which the second material 12 is on the outside enveloping the first material 11 on the inside. This embodiment may be useful when the different physical properties of materials 11 and 12 may be more useful on the outside for certain applications, making a single device more versatile. FIGS. 4-6 show another embodiment of the invention in which the entire device may be turned inside out like a reversible jacket. As shown in the first mode of operation in FIG. 4, the device 1 is formed of two double walled sheets 3, 4 containing in the volumes 10 between outer panels 9 and inner panels 8 a first high thermal capacity material 11. The two sheets are sealed on three edges",
