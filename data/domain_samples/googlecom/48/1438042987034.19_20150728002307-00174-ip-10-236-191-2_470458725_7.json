When the new user station 302 responds with a general polling response message, the base station 304 may determine the range of the user station 302 and thereby determine a required timing adjustment for subsequent transmissions by the user station 302. The base station 304 may thereafter issue periodic timing adjustment commands to maintain receipt of user-to-base transmissions at the start of each user timing interval. The base station 304 may monitor the distance of the user station 302 by looking to the time of receiving either the control pulse preamble or the user-to-base message from a user station 302., 258259=A user station 302 may be designed in a similar fashion to the dual-mode base station of FIGS. 19A-B, except that a user station 304 may not require a diplexer 1910 in air interface structures wherein the user station 302 does not need to transmit and receive simultaneously. Also, frequency multiplier circuits 1930 and 1950 would be swapped because the user station 302 transmits and receives on the opposite frequency bands from the base station 304., 163629=Thus, in the second time slot TS2', the base station receives from the first user station M1 a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1012 and a user-to-base message in the user message interval 1013., 226449=Thus, the header formats for user stations 302 and base stations 304 are selected to be the same length in the exemplary embodiment described with respect to FIGS. 12A-C, whether or not in polling or traffic mode, and whether or not the polling message is general or specific., 138449=The total length of the base timing sub-element 1001 may be 1400 chips. The total length of each of the user datalink timing sub-element 1011 and the range timing sub-element 1021 may be 1725 chips. For these particular exemplary values, a chipping rate of 5 MHz is assumed., 236744=In the Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band (2400-2483.5 MHz), applications are similar to the unlicensed isochronous band, except that the federal regulations are somewhat less restrictive. Spread spectrum techniques are preferred to minimize transmission power (e.g., to 1 watt or less), with a minimum of 10 dB processing gain typically required. A TDD or TDMA/FDD hybrid structure is preferred due to the small frequency range of the ISM band., 214989=The depiction of the frame structure in FIG. 11C (i.e., the exploded time slots 1151) assumes that the user stations 302 are at zero distance from the base station 304. However, if the user station 302 is not immediately adjacent to the base station 304, then part of guard time 1114 (as shown in FIG. 11A) will be consumed in the propagation of the preamble and user-to-base message to the base station 304. Thus, if the user station 302 is at the cell periphery, then the user-to-base message will appear at the base station 304 after the elapsing of a time period equal at most to the duration of guard time 1114. In order to ensure that the guard times 1114 and 1118 are kept to a minimum, timing adjustment commands are preferably transmitted from the base station 304 periodically so as to keep the user preambles and user-to-base messages arriving at the base station 304 as close to the start of the user timing sub-element 1110 as possible, without interfering with the transmissions of the previous use station 302., 166313=The latter portion of the time slot TS4' preferably comprises a range timing sub-element 1021 as previously described with respect to FIG. 10A. Thus, in response to the base station 304 transmitting a general polling message in the base message interval 1003 of the third time slot TS3', the new user station M3 sends a ranging message in a user ranging message interval 1023 of the following time slot TS4'. The depiction of the exploded time slot TS4' in frame structure in FIG. 10D assumes that the user station M3 is at zero distance from the base station 304; hence, the user-to-base messages appear in FIG. 10D directly after the transmit/receive switch interval 1004 of the base timing sub-element 1001. However, if the user station M3 is not immediately adjacent to the base station 304, then part of guard time 1014 will be consumed in the propagation of the user-to-base message to the base station 304. Thus, if the user station M3 is at the cell periphery, then the user-to-base message will appear at the base station 304 after the elapsing of a time period equal at most to the duration of guard time 1014. Timing adjustment commands from the base station 304 may allow a shorter maximum necessary guard time 1014 than would otherwise be possible., 154170=FIG. 10C shows a subsequent time frame 1040 after communication has been established between the base station 304 and the third user station M3, with or without the use of a ranging transaction. In FIG. 10C, the transactions occurring in the first time slot TS1 between the user station M1 and the base station 304 are the same as those for FIG. 10B. Also, the transactions occurring in the second time slot TS2 between the user station M2 and the base station 304 are the same as those for FIG. 10B. However, during the second time slot TS2, instead of there being no transmitted control pulse preamble in the preamble interval 1016, the third user station M3 transmits a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2. Alternatively, the user station M3 may wait until the base station 304 acknowledges its ranging message, sent in the prior time frame 1040, before transmitting a control pulse preamble in each time slot TS2 preceding its designated time slot TS3 for communication., 187724=In the following time slot TS2\" after the first time slot TS1\", the base station 304 transmits, using the base station frequency band 1170, a preamble during the base preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103, both directed to the second user station M2. The base station 304 thereby rapidly responds to the control pulse preamble sent by the user station M2. It is assumed, however, in the exemplary time frame 1140 of FIG. 11B that the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot TS4\" over the base station frequency band 1170. Thus, in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 following the base message interval 1103, the base station 304 does not transmit a 123-preamble burst directed to a user station 302., 265888=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08,383,518, filed Feb. 3, 1995, Lyon & Lyon Docket No. 201/081, in the name of inventor Logan Scott, entitled \"Spread Spectrum Correlation Using SAW Device.\", 222853=In the following time frames 1150, after establishing communication with the third user station M3 in the manner described above, communication may be carried out between the base station 304 and the user station M3 as shown in FIG. 11D. As part of each transmission from the base station 304, the base station 304 may update the timing adjustment command to the user station M3., 161461=After the preamble interval 1016 is an antenna adjustment interval 1017 during which the base station 304 has opportunity to adjust its transmission antenna, if necessary, to direct it towards the second user station M2. Following the preamble interval 1016 is an antenna adjustment interval 1017, during which the base station 304 adjusts its transmission antenna, if necessary, so as to direct it towards the second user station M2. Following the antenna adjustment interval 1017 is another guard band 1018, which accounts for the propagation time of the control pulse preamble to the base station 304. After the preamble interval is another transmit/receive switching interval 1019 to allow the base station 304 opportunity to switch from a receive mode to a transmit mode, and to allow the second user station M2 opportunity to switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode., 200411=Should a user station 302 terminate communication in a time slot 1141 or be handed off to a new base station 304, then the base station 304 may begin to transmit a general polling message during the newly opened time slot 1141, indicating that the time slot 1141 is free for communication. New user stations 302 may thereby establish communication with the same base station 304., 221892=FIG. 11D shows a subsequent time frame 1150 after a ranging transaction has been completed with the third user station M3. In FIG. 1D, the transactions between the user stations M1, MN and the base station 304 occurring in the first time slot OTS1 are the same as for FIG. 11C. Also, the transactions between the user stations M1, M2 and the base station 304 occurring in the second time slot OTS2 are the same as for FIG. 11C. However, during the second time slot OTS2, instead of there being no transmitted control pulse preamble in the preamble interval 1116, the third user station M3 may transmit a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1116 of the second time slot OTS2. Alternatively, the user station M3 may wait until the base station 304 acknowledges its ranging message sent in the prior time frame 1150 before transmitting a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1116 of each preceding time slot OTS2., 178921=The user datalink timing sub-element 1110 comprises a datalink preamble interval 1112, a user message interval 1113, a guard band 1114, a transmit/receive switch interval 1115, a second preamble interval 1116, an antenna adjustment interval 1117, a second guard band 1118, and a second transmit/receive switch interval 1119. The preamble intervals 1112, 1116 may each be 56 chips in length. The user message interval 1113 may be 205 bits in length, or 1312 chips, using the 32-ary spread spectrum coding technique described previously herein. The length of the guard bands 1114, 1118 may vary, but should be sufficient to allow receipt of the pertinent message transmissions without interference. The transmit/receive switch intervals 1115, 1119 may each be of a duration sufficient to allow proper switching between transmit and receive modes, or between receive and transmit modes, as the case may be. The antenna adjustment interval 1117 may be of sufficient duration to allow transmission of a data symbol for selecting a particular antenna beam or permitting minor adjustments to the angle of a directional antenna at the base station 302, or permitting selection of one or more antennas if the base station 302 is so equipped., 135979=The user datalink timing sub-element 1011 comprises a datalink preamble interval 1012, a user message interval 1013, a guard band 1014, a transmit/receive switch interval 1015, a second preamble interval 1016, an antenna adjustment interval 1017, a second guard band 1018, and a second transmit/receive switch interval 1019. The preamble intervals 1012, 1016 may each be 56 chips in length. The user message interval 1013 may be 205 bits in length, or 1312 chips, using the 32-ary spread spectrum coding technique described above with respect to the base timing sub-element 1001. The guard bands 1014, 1018 may each be 102.5 chips in length. The transmit/receive switch intervals 1015, 1019 may each be of a duration sufficient to allow proper switching between transmit and receive modes, or between receive and transmit modes, as the case may be. The antenna adjustment interval 1017 may be of sufficient duration to allow transmission of a data symbol indicating selection of a particular antenna beam or permitting minor adjustments to the angle of a directional antenna at the base station 302, or permitting selection of one or more antennas if the base station 302 is so equipped., 140819=In the first time slot TS1, the base-to-user message transmitted in the base message interval 1003 is directed to a first user station M1, which may be mobile. After the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, the first user station M1 responds with a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1012 and with a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1013. Proper timing is preferably set upon initial establishment of communication, and the transmissions from the user stations, such as the first user station M1, may be maintained in time alignment as seen at the base station 304 by timing adjustment commands from the base station 304, such as the timing adjustment commands described with respect to FIGS. 8-9 and elsewhere herein. However, a round-trip guard time must be included in each time slot 1041 so as to allow the base-to-user message to propagate to the user station 302 and the user-to-base message to propagate to the base station 304. The depiction of the exploded time slot TS1 in FIG. 10B is generally shown with the assumption that the user station M1 is at zero distance from the base station 304; hence, the user-to-base messages appear in FIG. 10B directly after the transmit/receive switch interval 1004 of the base timing sub-element 1001. However, if the user station M1 is not immediately adjacent to the base station 304, then part of guard time 1014 will be consumed in the propagation of the user-to-base message to the base station 304. Thus, if the user station M1 is at the cell periphery, then the user-to-base message will appear at the base station 304 after the elapsing of a time period equal at most to the duration of guard time 1014. Timing adjustment commands from the base station 304 may allow a shorter maximum necessary guard time 1014 than would otherwise be possible., 176985=The three preamble burst intervals 1104, 1105, and 1106 are each preferably 56 chips in length; thus, the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 is preferably 168 chips in length. The transmit/receive switch interval 1108 is preferably selected as a length of time sufficient to enable the switching of the base station 304 from a transmit mode to a receive mode and may be, for example, 32 chips or 11.43 microseconds in length. The transmit/receive switch interval 1108 and the base fill code interval 1107 collectively comprise, in a preferred embodiment, a length of 189 chips., 175502=In FIG. 11A are shown a base timing sub-element 1101, a user datalink timing sub-element 1110, and a range timing sub-element 1121. For each of these sub-elements 1101, 1110, and 1121, as explained more fully below, timing is shown from the perspective of the base station 304 with the range of the user station 302 at zero., 144701=In response to receiving the control pulse preamble in the preamble interval 1016 and determining the quality of the received signal and other operating parameters, the base station 304 may if necessary send a message commanding the user station 302 to adjust its power. Based on the quality of the received signal, the base station 304 may command the user station 302 to change (i.e., increase or decrease) its transmit power by a discrete amount (e.g, in minimum steps of 3 dB) relative to its current setting, until the quality of the control pulse preamble as periodically received by the base station 304 in the preamble interval 1016 is above an acceptable threshold., 204484=In operation, the base station 304 transmits, as part of the base timing sub-element 1101 of each time slot 1151, in sequence to user stations 302 with which the base station 304 has established communication. Thus, the base station 304 transmits a preamble during the preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103. After the base message interval 1103, the base station 304 transmits three short preamble bursts in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 directed to a different user station 302. In the exemplary system of FIG. 11C, the three preamble bursts in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 are directed to the user station 302 to which the base station 304 will be sending a main data message two time slots 1151 later., 164662=Should a new user station M3 desire to establish communication with the base station 304, then the new user station M3 waits until an open user portion of a time slot 1051, such as the fourth time slot TS4' in the present example, to take action. Thus, ordinary communication is carried out between the base station 304 and the second user station M2 in the latter portion of the third time slot TS3' in a manner similar to that of the first user station M1. Moreover, because another user station M4 is in established communication with the base station 304, the base station 304 receives a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1016 of the third time slot TS3' from the next user station M4. In the subsequent time slot TS4', the base station 304 sends a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1003 to the user station M4. The user station M4 responds with a user-to-base message in the following time slot TS5'., 151986=The ranging guard band 1024 in time slot TS3 is preferably of sufficient length to allow the ranging transaction between the base station 304 and the user station M3 to occur. Thus, the length of the ranging guard band 1024 is determined in part by the radius of the cell 303 in which the base station 304 is located, or may be determined in part by the maximum cell radius of the cellular system., 221011=In the FIGS. 11C-D embodiment, time slots 1151 on the user frequency band 1173 are offset from those on the base frequency band 1172 by an offset time 1160. The offset time 1160 allows the base-to-user message to propagate to the user station 302 prior to transmission of the user-to-base message by the user station 302. The user station 302 therefore does not need a diplexer, which can be a relatively expensive component. Operation without a diplexer is particularly beneficial where the user station 302 is embodied as a mobile handset, because it is often important to keep manufacturing costs of the handset as low as possible. Other hardware efficiency may also be achieved by not requiring simultaneous transmission and reception; for example, the user station 302 could use the same frequency synthesizer for both transmitting and receiving functions., 155213=The base station 304 may use the control pulse preamble for a variety of purposes, including power control and other purposes, as previously described. In the third time slot TS3 of FIG. 10C, the base station 304 may send an acknowledgment signal to the user station M3 during the base message interval 1003. The acknowledgment signal may be sent using a spread spectrum code determined by a user identifier sent by the user station M3 as part of the ranging message. As part of the acknowledgment signal, or in addition thereto, the base station 304 sends a timing adjustment command instructing the user station M3 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount., 169315=In response to receiving the ranging message from the user station M3 and determining the distance of the user station 302 and/or the propagation delay time thereto, the base station 304 may issue a timing adjustment command to the user station M3 in the next time frame 1050 instructing the user station M3 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount. For the time frame 1050 immediately after communication with the user station M3 is established, the timing adjustment command may be set equal to the round-trip propagation time as determined by the base station 304 during the ranging transaction. Preferably, the timing adjustment command is selected so as to cause the user transmission from the user station M3 to the base station 304 in the subsequent time frame 1050 to be received by the base station 304 immediately after the end of the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, as described with respect to FIG. 10A, giving the base station 304 an opportunity to switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode, but not interfering with the base-to-user message sent in the base message interval 1003., 203656=In the frame structure of FIG. 11C, a time frame 1150 comprises a plurality of time slots 1151. For convenience, time slots are designated in sequential order as OTS1, OTS2, OTS3, and so on. Each time slot 1151 comprises a base timing sub-element 1101 on the base station frequency band 1170, and either a user datalink timing sub-element 1110 or a range timing sub-element 1121 on the user station frequency band 1171. The time slots 1151 are shown from the perspective of the base station 304, so that the base timing sub-elements 1101 and the user timing sub-elements 1110, 1121 appear staggered in FIG. 11C by a predetermined offset time 1160. The frame structure of FIG. 11C supports both range timing sub-elements 1121 and user datalink timing sub-elements 1110 on the user station frequency band 1171., 156828=Should a user station 302 terminate communication in a time slot 1041 or be handed off to a new base station 304, then the base station 304 may begin to transmit a general polling message during the newly opened time slot 1041, indicating that the time slot 1041 is free for communication. New user stations 302 may thereby establish communication with the same base station 304., 134889=The transmit/receive switch interval 1004 is preferably selected as a length of time sufficient to enable the switching of the base station 304 from a transmit mode to a receive mode or, in some embodiments, to enable the switching of a user station 302 from a receive mode to a transmit mode, and may be, for example, two microseconds in length., 163857=It is assumed in the exemplary time frame 1050 shown of FIG. 10D that there is no established communication link in the duplex channel comprising the base portion of the third time slot TS3' and the user portion of the fourth time slot TS4', and therefore that particular duplex channel is free for communication. Because no user station 302 is in established communication during the duplex channel, no control pulse preamble is transmitted during the preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2'. The base station 304 may indicate that a particular duplex channel is available for communication by, for example, transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1003 of the duplex channel, such as during the base message interval 1003 of time slot TS3'., 197699=In the above described embodiment supporting ranging transactions, the ranging guard band 1124 is preferably of sufficient length to allow the ranging transaction between the base station 304 and the user station 302 to occur. Thus, the length of the ranging guard band 1124 is determined in part by the radius of the cell 303 in which the base station 304 is located, or may be determined in part by the maximum cell radius of the cellular system., 255105=Signals received over the antenna 1901 pass through the diplexer 1910 and are provided to a multiplier 1951. Clock divider circuit 1923 is connected to a frequency multiplier circuit 1950, which multiplies its input by a factor of, e.g., N. The frequency multiplier circuit 1950 is connected to multiplier 1951, which combines its inputs and generates a first IF signal 1944. The first IF signal 1944 is connected to a spread spectrum bandpass filter 1952 and a narrowband bandpass filter 1953. The spread spectrum bandpass filter 1952 is a wideband filter, while the narrowband bandpass filter 1953 operates over a relatively narrow bandwidth. The bandpass filters 1952 and 1953 remove image noise and act as anti-aliasing filters. A multiplexer 1954 selects between an output from the spread spectrum bandpass filter 1952 and an output from the narrowband bandpass filter 1953., 195408=The depiction of the frame structure in FIGS. 11A-B assumes that the user stations 302 are at zero distance from the base station 304, and therefore the user-to-base message appears immediately after the preamble interval 1112 or 1122. However, if the user station 302 is not immediately adjacent to the base station 304, then part of guard time 1114 shown in FIG. 11A will be consumed in the propagation of the preamble and user-to-base message to the base station 304. Thus, if the user station 302 is at the cell periphery, then the user-to-base message will appear at the base station 304 after the elapsing of a time period equal at most to the duration of guard time 1114. In order to ensure that the guard times 1114 and 1118 are kept to a minimum, timing adjustment commands are preferably transmitted from the base station 304 periodically so as to keep the user preambles and user-to-base messages arriving at the base station 304 as close to the start of the user timing sub-element 1110 as possible, without interfering with the transmissions of the previous use station 302., 251277=FIG. 19A is a block diagram of an exemplary dual-mode base station capable of operating over multiple frequencies and having both spread spectrum and narrowband communication capabilities. The base station block diagram of FIG. 19A includes a frequency plan architecture for use with a low IF digital transceiver ASIC 1920. The base station may employ an FDD technique wherein the user stations 302 transmit at the lower duplex frequency, and the base station 304 transmits at the higher duplex frequency. The base station of FIG. 19A preferably uses a direct synthesis digital CPM modulator, such as described, for example, in Kopta, \"New Universal All Digital CPM Modulator,\" IEEE Trans. COM (April 1987)., 212978=It is assumed in the exemplary time frame 1150 of FIG. 11C that the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot OTS4 over the base station frequency band 1172. The base station 304 may indicate that a particular time slot 1151, such as time slot OTS4, is available for communication by, for example, transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1103 of the time slot OTS4., 162359=In the following time slot TS2 after time slot TS1, the base station 304 transmits a preamble during the base preamble interval 1002 and transmits a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1003, both directed to the second user station M2. The base station 304 thereby rapidly responds to the control pulse sent by the user station M2. As with the first time slot TS1', following the base message interval 1003 occurs a transmit/receive switch interval 1004 during which the base station 304 switches to a receive mode. Unlike the FIG. 10B-C embodiment, in which the latter portion of the time slot TS2' is used for receiving a transmission from the second user station M2, in the FIG. 10D embodiment the latter portion of the time slot TS2' is used for receiving a transmission from the first user station M1. While the first user station M1 is in the process of transmitting, the second user station M2 thus has the opportunity to process the data received from the base station 304 during the same time slot TS2', and to transmit a responsive transmission timed to arrive at the base station 304 in the following time slot TS3' without interfering with other transmissions from either the base station 304 or other user stations 302., 188577=Simultaneous with the base station transmissions in the second time slot TS2\", the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1171, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the user station M1 with which the base station 304 communicated in the first time slot TS1\". Similar to the first time slot TS1\", during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the second time slot TS2\" on the user station frequency band 1171, the base station 304 receives a control pulse preamble from the user station M3 to which the base station 304 is to transmit in the following time slot TS3\"., 198167=In response to receiving the ranging message from the user station 302 and determining the distance of the user station 302 and/or the propagation delay time thereto, the base station 304 may issue a timing adjustment command to the user station 302 in the next time frame 1140 instructing the user station 302 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount. For the time frame 1140 immediately after communication with the user station 302 is established, the timing adjustment command may be set equal to the round-trip propagation time as determined by the base station 304 during the ranging transaction. Preferably, the timing adjustment command is selected so as to cause the user transmission from the user station 302 to the base station 304 in the subsequent time frame 1140 to be received by the base station 304 immediately after the end of the previous time slot 1141., 232137=Preamble processing may be augmented by taking advantage of the control pulse preamble (e.g., in preamble interval 1016) and 123-preamble message transmissions described earlier herein with respect to FIGS. 10A-11D. The control pulse preamble and 123-preamble transmissions generally have fixed timing with respect to the initial preamble transmissions (e.g., in preamble intervals 1002 or 1102) preceding each main user or base transmission, and can be used to aid in synchronization particularly on the reverse link where two full-length preamble transmissions are associated with each main user or base transmission. Preamble length is effectively doubled by processing both the control pulse preamble or 123-preamble, and the preambles preceding the main user or base transmission., 186693=The functions of the control pulse preamble sent during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 are similar to those described earlier with respect to the control pulse preamble of FIGS. 10A-E (e.g., power control, antenna adjustment, etc.). Following the preamble interval 1116 is an antenna adjustment interval 1117, during which the base station 304 has an opportunity to adjust its transmission antenna, if necessary, so as to direct it towards the second user station M2 based upon information acquired from receipt of the control pulse preamble. Following the antenna adjustment interval 1117 is another guard band 1118, which accounts for the propagation time of the control pulse preamble to the base station 304. After the preamble interval is another transmit/receive switching interval 1119 to allow the base station 304 opportunity to switch from a receive mode to a transmit mode (if necessary), and to allow the second user station M2 opportunity to switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode., 185067=Following the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 is the base fill code interval 1107, during which the base station 304 transmits a fill code. Following the base code fill interval 1107 is the transmit/receive switch interval 1104, during which the base station 304 may switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode. If the base station 304 has separate transmit and receive hardware, however, then the base station need not switch modes, and may instead continue to transmit a fill code during the transmit/receive switch interval 1104., 135255=The user datalink timing sub-element 1011 and the range timing sub-element 1021 each generally provide for transmissions by more than one user station 302. As explained further below, each of these timing sub-elements 1011, 1021 provides for transmission by a first user station 302 of a data message or a ranging message in the first part of the timing sub-element 1011 or 1021, and transmission by a second user station 302 of a control pulse preamble in the latter part of the timing sub-element 1011 or 1021. The control pulse preamble, as further described below, generally allows the base station 304 to carry out certain functions (e.g., power control) with respect to the second user station 302., 250869=Alternatively, a zero IF digital correlator may be used instead of a low IF digital correlator. A zero IF digital correlator performs I and Q separation prior to A/D conversion, hence requiring the use of two A/D converters instead of one. The A/D converters for the zero IF correlator may operate at the code rate, instead of at four times the code rate as is done by A/D converter 1811., 254397=Multiplexer 1939 is connected to a multiplier 1931. The clock divider circuit 1922 is connected to another clock divider circuit 1923, which divides its input by a factor, e.g., of 4. The output of the clock divider circuit 1923 is connected to a frequency multiplier circuit 1930, which multiplies its input by a factor of (N+400), where N defines the frequency of the receiving channel, as further described herein. The frequency multiplier circuit 1930 is connected to the multiplier 1931, which multiplies its inputs to generate an output signal 1942. The output signal 1942 is connected to the diplexer 1910, which allows transmission of the output signal 1942 over the antenna 1901., 174254=Should a user station 302 terminate communication in a time slot 1051 or be handed off to a new base station 304, then the base station 304 may begin to transmit a general polling message during the newly opened time slot 1051, indicating that the time slot 1051 is free for communication. New user stations 302 may thereby establish communication with the same base station 304., 252014=The FIG. 19A dual-mode base station comprises an antenna 1901, preferably capable of operating at a 2 GHz frequency range. The antenna 1901 is connected to a diplexer 1910, which allows the base station to simultaneously transmit and receive signals through the antenna 1901. The transmitted and received signals are translated to appropriate frequencies generated by multiplying or dividing a master clock frequency output from a master oscillator 1921. The master oscillator 1921 generates a master frequency (e.g., 22.4 MHz) which is provided to a clock divider circuit 1922 for dividing the master frequency by a predefined factor, e.g., 28. The master oscillator 1921 is also connected to another clock divider circuit 1926 which divides the master frequency by a programmable parameter M, determined by the physical layer with over which the base station operates. The output of clock divider circuit 1926 may be further divided down by another clock divider 1927 which divides by a programmable parameter M2, in order to support a second mode of operation over a different physical layer, if desired., 180173=The range timing sub-element 1121 comprises a ranging preamble interval 1122, a user ranging message interval 1123, a ranging guard band 1124, a transmit/receive switch interval 1125, a second preamble interval 1126, an antenna adjustment interval 1127, a second guard band 1128, and a second transmit/receive switch interval 1129. The preamble intervals 1122, 1126 may each be 56 chips in length. The user ranging message interval 1123 may be 150 bits in length, or 960 chips, using the 32-ary spread spectrum coding technique described previously herein. The length of the ranging guard band 1124 may vary depending, for example, on cell radius, but should be sufficient to allow receipt of a ranging message without interference. The other guard band 1128 should likewise be of sufficient length to allow receipt of the pertinent information without interference. The transmit/receive switch intervals 1125, 1129 may each be of a duration sufficient to allow proper switching between transmit and receive modes, or between receive and transmit modes, as the case may be. The antenna adjustment interval 1127 may be of sufficient duration to allow transmission of a data symbol for selecting a particular antenna beam or permitting minor adjustments to the angle of a directional antenna at the base station 302, or permitting selection of one or more antennas if the base station 302 is so equipped., 210039=In the third time slot OTS3, the base station 304 transmits, using the base station frequency band 1172, a preamble during the base preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103, both directed to the third user station M3. Following the base message interval 1103 is a 123-preamble burst interval 1109 during which the base station 304 transmits three short preamble bursts (i.e., the 123-preamble burst) directed to a different user station M5, with which the base station 304 will communicate two slots 1151 later., 256004=Multiplexer 1954 is connected to a multiplier 1960. An output from frequency multiplier circuit 1935 is also connected to multiplier 1960, which outputs a final IF signal 1946. The final IF signal 1946 is connected to a low pass filter 1961 and thereafter to an A/D converter 1962. The A/D converter 1962 is clocked at a rate determined by the clock divider circuit 1926. The output of the A/D converter is provided to ASIC 1920 for correlation and further processing. In particular, the received signal may be processed by the low IF correlator shown in FIG. 18 and described above, in which case A/D converter 1961 may be the same as A/D converter 1811., 182903=In the frame structure of FIG. 11B, a time frame 1140 comprises a plurality of time slots 1141. For convenience, time slots are designated in sequential order as TS1\", TS2\", TS3\", and so on. Each time slot 1141 comprises a base timing sub-element 1101 on the base station frequency band 1170, and either a user datalink timing sub-element 1110 or a range timing sub-element 1121 on the user station frequency band 1171. The time slots 1141 are shown from the perspective of the base station 304, so that the base timing sub-elements 1101 and the user timing sub-elements 1110, 1121 appear lined up in FIG. 11B. While the frame structure of FIG. 11B supports range timing sub-elements 1121 on the user station frequency band 1171, it is contemplated that communication from the user stations 302 to the base station 304 in the FIG. 11B system will ordinarily occur using user datalink timing sub-elements 1110., 148619=Should a third user station M3 desire to establish communication with the base station 304, then, in response to the base station 304 transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1003 of the third time slot TS3, the third user station M3 sends a general polling response message in a user message interval 1013 of the time slot TS3. When the third user station M3 responds with the general polling response message, the base station 304 may determine the range of the user station M3 and thereby determine a required timing adjustment for subsequent transmissions by the user station M3., 265712=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/334,587, filed Nov. 3, 1994, in the name of inventor Logan Scott, entitled \"Antenna Diversity Techniques\"; and, 223252=Should a user station 302 terminate communication in a time slot 1151 or be handed off to a new base station 304, then the base station 304 may begin to transmit a general polling message during the newly opened time slot 1151, indicating that the time slot 1151 is free for communication. New user stations 302 may thereby establish communication with the same base station 304., 189897=Simultaneous with the base station transmissions, the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1171, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the user station M2 with which the base station 304 communicated in the previous time slot TS2\". Because the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot TS4\" over the base station frequency band 1170, the base station 304 does not receive a control pulse preamble during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the third time slot TS3\" on the user station frequency band 1171., 249394=The A/D converter 1811 outputs a digitized signal 1812, which is connected to two multipliers 1815 and 1816. A carrier numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) block 1821 and a vector mapping block 1820 operate in conjunction to provide an appropriate frequency for demodulation and downconversion to a low IF frequency. The vector mapping block 1820 outputs a sine signal 1813 and a cosine signal 1814 at the selected conversion frequency. The sine signal 1813 is connected to multiplier 1815, and the cosine signal 1816 is connected to multiplier 1816, so as to generate an I IF signal 1830 and a Q IF signal 1831. The I IF signal 1830 is connected to an I multiplier 1842, and the Q IF signal 1831 is connected to a Q multiplier 1843., 211370=A similar exchange is carried out in the fourth time slot OTS4, and in subsequent time slots 1151 as well. Whether or not particular user-to-base message, base-to-user messages, and preambles or control pulse preambles are transmitted depends on whether or not the base station 304 is in communication with a user station 302 requiring such exchanges at the particular time., 193784=For efficiency reasons, the guard times 1114 and 1118 are preferably kept to a minimum. The smaller the guard times 1114, 1118, the more user stations 302 may be supported by the frame structure of FIG. 11B. Typically, therefore, the guard times 1114, 1118 will not be of sufficient duration to allow a full ranging transaction to occur. In particular, a ranging transaction may result in interference between the transmission of a user station 302 seeking to establish communication and the control pulse preamble of the user station 302 already in communication in the immediately following time slot 1141 with the base station 304. If the guard times are lengthened to permit ranging transactions, then fewer user stations 302 can be supported, particularly in a large cell environment. An alternative structure having improved efficiency in a large cell environment, along with the flexibility of ranging transactions, is shown in FIGS. 11C and 11D and explained in more detail below., 214146=For efficiency reasons, the guard times 1114 and 1118 are preferably kept to a minimum. The smaller the guard times 1114, 1118, the more user stations 302 may be supported by the frame structure of FIG. 11C., 217598=In response to receiving the ranging message from the user station 302 and determining the distance of the user station 302 and/or the propagation delay time thereto, the base station 304 may issue a timing adjustment command to the user station 302 in the next time frame 1150 instructing the user station 302 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount. For the time frame 1150 immediately after communication with the user station 302 is established, the timing adjustment command may be set equal to the round-trip propagation time as determined by the base station 304 during the ranging transaction. Preferably, the timing adjustment command is selected so as to cause the user transmission from the user station 302 to the base station 304 in the subsequent time frame 1150 to be received by the base station 304 immediately after the end of the previous time slot 1151., 191020=Thus, in general, to support communication between a user station 302 and base station 304 communicating during a single time slot 1141, four messages are exchanged in each time frame 1140 between the particular user station 302 and the base station 304. The base station 304 first sends a 123-preamble in a 123-preamble interval 1109 of the time slot 1141 two slots 1141 prior to which the base station 304 intends to transmit to the user station 302. In the following time slot 1141, on a different frequency band 1171, the user station 302 responds by sending a control pulse preamble, which is received at the base station 304 during the control pulse preamble interval 1116. In the following time slot 1141, after making determinations as to power adjustment and/or timing adjustment, the base station 304 transmits to the user station 304 a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103 on the base station frequency band 1170. In the following time slot 1141, after adjusting its power and/or timing, the user station 304 responds with a user-to-base message, which is received at the base station 304 during the user message interval 1113., 183847=In operation, the base station 304 transmits, as part of the base timing sub-element 1101 of each time slot 1141, in sequence to user stations 302 with which the base station 304 has established communication. More specifically, the base station 304 transmits a preamble during the preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103. After the base message interval 1103, the base station 304 transmits three short preamble bursts in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 directed to a different user station 302. In the exemplary system of FIG. 11B, the three preamble bursts in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 are directed to the user station 302 to which the base station 304 will be sending a main data message two time slots 1141 later., 167860=In more detail, a ranging transaction is carried out between the base station 304 and the user station M3, whereby the user station M3 transmits a preamble during a ranging preamble interval 1022 of time slot TS4' and a ranging message during the user ranging message interval 1023 of time slot TS4'. The user station M3 delays transmitting the preamble and ranging message for an amount of time .increment.T. The delay time .increment.T may be communicated by the base station 304 as part of the general polling message, or may be a pre-programmed system parameter. The base station 304 determines the propagation delay from the user station M3 to the base station 304 by measuring the round trip propagation delay from the end of the base message interval 1003 in the fourth time slot TS4' (i.e., the earliest possible receipt of the preamble and ranging message) to the time of actual receipt of the responsive preamble and ranging message from the user station M3, taking into account the delay time .increment.T., 213460=Should a user station 302 desire to establish communication with the base station 304 (such as in the fourth time slot OTS4), then, in response to the base station 304 transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1103 of the fourth time slot OTS4, the new user station 302 may send a general polling response message during a user message interval 1113 of the following time slot OTS5. When the new user station 302 responds with a general polling response message, the base station 304 may determine the range of the user station 302 and thereby determine a required timing adjustment for subsequent transmissions by the user station 302., 175846=The base timing sub-element 1101 comprises a base preamble interval 1102, a base message interval 1103, three more preamble burst intervals 1104, 1105, and 1106 (collectively referred to as a 123-preamble burst interval 1109), a base fill code interval 1107, and a transmit/receive switch interval 1108. The base preamble interval 1102 may be 56 chips in length. The base message interval 1103 may be 205 bits in length, or 1312 chips using 32-ary coding, as described previously herein with respect to FIGS. 10A-E. The base message interval 1103 comprises a total of up to 41 5-bit data sequences, for a total of 205 bits; thus, a transmission in the base message interval 1103 may comprise a series of up to 41 spread spectrum codes, each selected from the set of 32 spread spectrum codes, for a total of 1312 chips., 200810=A simple means to adapt an FDD/TDMA system such as shown in FIG. 11B to emulate a TDD system is to alternately black out time slots on each of the two frequency bands 1170 and 1171. Thus, during time slot TS1\", the base station 304 transmits to a user station M1 over frequency band 1170, while no transmission is conducted over frequency band 1171. During the next time slot TS2\", the user station M1 responds over frequency band 1171, while no transmission is conducted over frequency band 1170. The next two time slots TS3\" and TS4\" are used for duplex communication between the base station 304 and the next user station M2, with the user slot in TS3\" and the base slot in TS4\" being dormant. The described frame structure generally supports fewer user stations 302 than the frame structure shown in FIG. 11B due to the dormancy of alternating time slots on each frequency band 1170 and 1171, but allows a TDD interface such as shown in FIG. 10B to be emulated with minimal modification to the base and user stations (e.g., by transmitting and receiving on different frequency bands). If both frequency bands 1170 and 1171 are selected to be the same, then the system will be true TDD, thus allowing the same hardware to be capable of either FDD/TDMA or TDD operation simply by appropriate selection of the frequency bands and appropriate selection of the time slots (i.e., by selecting in an alternating manner) on the forward and reverse links during which to transmit., 172528=The base station 304 may use the control pulse preamble for a variety of purposes, including power control and other purposes, as previously described. In the third time slot TS3' of FIG. 10E, the base station 304 may respond by sending an acknowledgment signal to the user station M3 during the base message interval 1003. The acknowledgment signal may be sent using a spread spectrum code determined by a user identifier sent by the user station M3 as part of the ranging message. As part of the acknowledgment signal, or in addition thereto, the base station 304 preferably sends a timing adjustment command instructing the user station M3 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount., 147976=It is assumed in the exemplary time frame 1040 of FIG. 10B that there is no established communication link in the third time slot TS3, and therefore the third time slot TS3 is free for communication. Because no user station 302 is in established communication during time slot TS3, no control pulse preamble is transmitted during the preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2. The base station 304 may indicate that a particular time slot 1041, such as time slot TS3, is available for communication by, for example, transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1003 of the time slot TS3., 196515=If a ranging transaction is supported in the FIG. 11B environment, then the portion of a time slot 1141 on the user station frequency band 1171 may comprise a range timing sub-element 1121, as described previously with respect to FIG. 11A, during which a ranging transaction is carried out between the base station 304 and a new user station 302. Thus, the user station 302 transmits a preamble during a ranging preamble interval 1122 of time slot 1141, and transmits a ranging message during the user ranging message interval 1123 of time slot 1141. The user station 302 delays transmitting the preamble and ranging message for an amount of time .increment.T. The delay time .increment.T may be communicated by the base station 304 as part of the general polling message, or may be a pre-programmed system parameter. The base station 304 determines the propagation delay from the user station 302 to the base station 304 by measuring the round trip propagation delay from the end of the previous time slot 1141 to the time of actual receipt of the responsive preamble and ranging message from the user station 302, taking into account the delay time .increment.T., 182110=FIG. 11B is a frame structure for a system using two frequency bands for communication in addition to certain aspects of time division multiple access. A first frequency band 1170, also referred to as a base station frequency band, is used primarily for communication from a base station 304 to user stations 302. A second frequency band 1171, also referred to as a user station frequency band, is used primarily for communication from the user stations 302 to the base station 304. The two frequency bands 1170, 1171 are preferably located 80 MHz apart. The 80 MHz frequency separation helps to minimize co-channel interference and allows easier construction of filters in the receiver for filtering out potentially interfering signals from the reverse path communication., 214373=Proper timing is preferably set upon initial establishment of communication, and the transmissions from the user stations, such as the first user station M1, may be maintained in time alignment as seen at the base station 304 by timing adjustment commands from the base station 304, similar to the timing adjustment commands described elsewhere herein. A full round-trip guard time need not be included in each time slot 1151 because the user stations 302 and base station 304 transmit on different frequency bands, preventing interference between base-to-user messages and user-to-base messages., 210617=Simultaneous with the base station transmissions but offset therefrom by an offset time 1160, the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1173, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the user station M2 with which the base station 304 communicated in the previous time slot OTS2. Because the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot OTS4 over the base station frequency band 1172, the base station 304 does not receive a control pulse preamble during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the third time slot OTS3 on the user station frequency band 1173., 158887=In operation of the FIG. 10D system, the base station 304 transmits, as part of the base timing sub-element 1001 of each time slot 1051, to user stations 302 with which it has established communication. The base station 304 thus transmits a preamble during the preamble interval 1002 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1003. In the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, the base station 304 switches from a transmit mode to a receive mode., 137186=The range timing sub-element 1021 comprises a ranging preamble interval 1022, a user ranging message interval 1023, a ranging guard band 1024, a transmit/receive switch interval 1025, a second preamble interval 1026, an antenna adjustment interval 1027, a second guard band 1028, and a second transmit/receive switch interval 1029. The preamble intervals 1022, 1026 may each be 56 chips in length. The user ranging message interval 1023 may be 150 bits in length, or 960 chips, using the 32-ary spread spectrum coding technique described above with respect to the base timing sub-element 1001. The ranging guard band 1024 may be 454.5 chips in length. The other guard band 1028 may be 102.5 chips in length. The transmit/receive switch intervals 1025, 1029 may each be of a duration sufficient to allow proper switching between transmit and receive modes, or between receive and transmit modes, as the case may be. The antenna adjustment interval 1027 may be of sufficient duration to allow transmission of a data symbol for selecting a particular antenna beam or permitting minor adjustments to the angle of a directional antenna at the base station 302, or permitting selection of one or more antennas if the base station 302 is so equipped., 219005=It may also be possible to minimize potential interference between ranging messages and control pulse preambles by using a particular designated spread spectrum code for only ranging messages, or for only control pulse preambles. However, it is anticipated that in most cases the use of an offset time 1160 between time slots 1151 on the base frequency band 1172 and the user frequency band 1173 should sufficiently separate the relevant transmissions in time so as to result in a system having minimal interference between user stations 302., 173246=In following time frames 1050, communication may be carried out between the base station 304 and the user station M3 in an interleaved fashion in time slots TS3' and TS4' (in addition to the receipt of the control pulse preamble in the second time slot TS2' each time frame 1050). In each preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2', the user station M3 transmits a control pulse preamble allowing the base station 304 to take certain actions--for example, to exercise power control, synchronize to the user station M3, or determine the distance of the user station M3. The base station 304 then sends a communication directed to the user station M3 in the first portion of the third time slot TS3', and the user station M3 responds with a communication directed to the base station 304 in the latter portion of the following time slot TS4'. During each communication from the base station 304, the base station 304 may update the timing adjustment command to the user station M3., 248711=FIG. 18 is a block diagram of a particular low IF digital correlator for use in a receiver operating in conjunction with the air interface structures disclosed herein, although it should be noted that a variety of different correlators may be suitable for use in the various embodiments disclosed herein. In the FIG. 18 correlator, a received signal 1810 is provided to an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 1811. The A/D converter 1811 preferably performs one or two bit A/D conversion and operates at roughly four times the code rate or higher. Thus, code rates of 1.023 MHz to 10.23 MHz result in sample rates for A/D converter 1811 in the range of 4 to 50 MHz., 159372=In the first time slot TS1', the base-to-user message transmitted in the base message interval 1003 is directed to a first user station M1, which may be mobile. After the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, the last user station MN to have been sent a message from the base station in the last time slot TSN' of the prior time frame 1050 transmits a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1012 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1013. The frame structure of FIG. 10D, as noted previously, is shown from a perspective of the base station 304, and the transmissions from the user stations, such as user station MN, are maintained in time alignment as seen by the base station 304 by timing adjustment commands from the base station 304, similar to the timing adjustment commands described elsewhere herein. Proper timing is preferably set upon initial establishment of communication, by use of a ranging transaction., 253141=Signals to be transmitted are provided by ASIC 1920 to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter 1933, which is clocked by a signal from clock divider circuit 1926. The output of the D/A converter 1933 is connected to a low pass filter 1934 to provide smoothing of the signal envelope. The low pass filter 1934 is connected to a multiplier 1936. An output from the clock divider circuit 1922 is connected to a frequency multiplier circuit 1935 which multiplies its input by a conversion factor, such as 462. The frequency multiplier circuit 1935 is connected to a multiplier 1936, which multiplies its inputs to generate an IF transmission signal 1941. The IF transmission signal 1941 is connected to a spread spectrum bandpass filter 1937 and a narrowband bandpass filter 1938. The spread spectrum bandpass filter 1937 is a wideband filter, while the narrowband bandpass filter 1938 operates over a relatively narrow bandwidth. The bandpass filters 1937 and 1938 filter out, among other things, CPM modulator spurs from the transmitter. A multiplexer 1939 selects between an output from the spread spectrum bandpass filter 1937 and an output from the narrowband bandpass filter 1938, depending upon the mode of operation of the base station., 208430=In the following time slot OTS2 after the first time slot OTS1, the base station 304 transmits, using the base station frequency band 1172, a preamble during the base preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103, both directed to the second user station M2. The base station 304 thereby rapidly responds to the control pulse preamble sent by the user station M2. It is assumed, however, in the exemplary time frame 1150 of FIG. 11C that the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot OTS4 over the base station frequency band 1172. Thus, in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 following the base message interval 1103 in the second time slot OTS2, the base station 304 does not transmit a 123-preamble burst directed to a user station 302., 157227=FIG. 10D is a timing diagram for another embodiment of a frame structure in accordance with certain aspects of the present invention. FIG. 10D shows an interleaved time division duplex frame structure using the timing sub-elements depicted in FIG. 10A. A time frame 1050 comprises a plurality of time slots 1051. For convenience, time slots 1051 are designated in sequential order as TS1', TS2', TS3', etc. Each time slot 1051 comprises a base timing sub-element 1001 and either a user datalink timing sub-element 1011 or a user ranging sub-element 1021, as described in more detail below., 250150=A code NCO block 1840 and a code mapping block 1841 operate in conjunction to provide a selected spread spectrum code 1846. The selected spread spectrum code 1846 is coupled to both the I multiplier 1842 and the Q multiplier 1843. The output of the I multiplier 1842 is connected to an I summer 1844 which counts the number of matches between the I IF signal 1030 and the selected spread spectrum code 1846. The output of the Q multiplier 1843 is connected to an Q summer 1845 which counts the number of matches between the Q IF signal 1031 and the selected spread spectrum code 1846. The I summer 1844 outputs an I correlation signal 1850, and the Q summer 1845 outputs a Q correlation signal 1851., 181595=The total length of each of the user datalink timing sub-element 1110 and the range timing sub-element 1121 may be 1750 chips, or the same length as the base timing sub-element 1101. These particular exemplary values assume a chipping rate of 2.8 MHz., 189303=In the third time slot TS3\", the base station 304 transmits, using the base station frequency band 1170, a preamble during the base preamble interval 1102 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103, both directed to the third user station M3. Following the base message interval 1103 is a 123-preamble burst interval 1109 during which the base station 304 transmits three short preamble bursts (i.e., the 123-preamble burst) directed to a different user station M5, with which the base station 304 intends to communicate two time slots 1141 later., 139077=In FIG. 10B, a time frame 1040 comprises a plurality of time slots 1041. For convenience, time slots are also designated in sequential order as TS1, TS2, TS3, etc. Each time slot 1041 comprises a base timing sub-element 1001 and either a user datalink timing sub-element 1011 or a range timing sub-element 1021. While the frame structure of FIG. 10B supports range timing sub-elements 1021, it is contemplated that communication in the FIG. 10B system, which may be denoted a fixed framing structure, will ordinarily occur using user datalink timing sub-elements 1011., 219567=An advantage of the frame structure of FIGS. 11C-D utilizing the offset time 1160 is that a diplexer, a device which allows simultaneous transmission and reception of signals, is generally not necessary in the user station 302. With the fixed offset frame structure of FIG. 11B, on the other hand, a diplexer may be necessary to support a high density of users, particularly in a large cell environment, because a user station 302 may need to transmit in a time slot 1141 prior to receiving the entire base-to-user message intended for it sent in the previous time slot 1141. Because FIG. 11B is constructed from a perspective of the base station 304, the time slots 1141 appear lined up to the base station 304, but the user station 302 is required to send its information in advance of the user portion of the time slot 1141 in order for the information to arrive at the base station 304 lined up as shown in FIG. 11B. In a large cell environment, where a user station 302 is distant, the user station 302 may be required to send its information prior to receiving the entire base-to-user message. In order to do so, the user station 302 may require the capability to transmit and receive information simultaneously, and may thus require a diplexer. In a protocol requiring that the user station 302 receive the base message before responding, the FIG. 11B system may thus not be suitable in a very large cell environment., 165625=In the meantime, during the fourth time slot TS4', the new user station M3 attempts to establish communication with the base station 304. Thus, in response to the base station 304 transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1003 of the third time slot TS3', the new user station M3 sends a general polling response message in a user message interval 1013 of the following time slot TS4'. When the new user station M3 responds with the general polling response message, the base station 304 may determine the range of the user station M3 and thereby determine a required timing adjustment for subsequent transmissions by the user station M3., 133090=In FIG. 10A are shown a base timing sub-element 1001, a user datalink timing sub-element 1011, and a range timing sub-element 1021. For each of these sub-elements 1001, 1011, and 1021, as explained more fully below, timing is shown from the perspective of the base station 304 with the initial range of the user station 302 at zero for range timing sub-element 1021., 160342=After the transmission of the user-to-base message from the first user station M1, which may, as perceived by the base station 304, consume up to all of the user message interval 1013 and the guard band 1014, is another transmit/receive switch interval 1015. Following is another transmit/receive switch interval 1015 to allow appropriate switching of modes. Following the transmit/receive switch interval 1015, a control pulse preamble is received from a second user station M2 during the preamble interval 1016. The control pulse preamble sent during the preamble interval 1016 may serve functions such as those described with respect to the FIG. 10B-C embodiments. Thus, the base station 304 may determine, in response to the power, envelope, or phase of the control pulse preamble, the direction or distance of the user station M2, and/or the degree of noise or multipath error to which the communication link with the user station M2 may be prone. The base station 304 may command the user station M2 to adjust its power based on the quality and strength of the received control pulse preamble., 177580=Thus, the total length of the base timing sub-element 1101 is preferably 1750 chips (for the assumed 2.8 MHz chipping rate), which matches the length of the user datalink timing sub-element 1110 and the range timing sub-element 1121 as described below. In the FIGS. 11A-D embodiment, it is preferred to have the base timing sub-element 1101 equal in length to the user timing sub-elements 1110, 1121 to maintain synchronicity in the dual-frequency band system described in FIGS. 11A-D, wherein the base station 304 communicates over one frequency band and the user stations 302 over another frequency band., 205273=As with the system of FIG. 11B, the three short preamble bursts sent in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 may be used for forward link diversity sensing and forward link power control purposes. Each of these three preamble bursts may be transmitted on a different antenna to allow receiving user stations 302 an opportunity to make a diversity selection for an upcoming forward link data message in a subsequent time slot 1151., 265256=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/284,053 filed on Aug. 1, 1994, in the name of inventors Gary B. Anderson, Ryan N. Jensen, Bryan K. Petch, and Peter O. Peterson, entitled \"PCS Pocket Phone/Microcell Communication Over-Air Protocol\";, 150724=If a ranging transaction is supported in the FIG. 10B environment, then the latter portion of the time slot TS3 may comprise a range timing sub-element 1021, as described previously with respect to FIG. 10A, during which a ranging transaction is carried out between the base station 304 and user station M3, instead of timing sub-element 1011. In such a case, the user station M3 transmits a preamble during a ranging preamble interval 1022 of time slot TS3, and transmits a ranging message during the user ranging message interval 1023 of time slot TS3. The user station M3 delays transmitting the preamble and ranging message for an amount of time .increment.T. The delay time .increment.T may be communicated by the base station 304 as part of the general polling message, or may be a pre-programmed system parameter. The base station 304 determines the propagation delay from the user station M3 to the base station 304 by measuring the round trip propagation delay from the end of the base message interval 1003 (i.e., the earliest possible receipt of the preamble and ranging message) to the time of actual receipt of the responsive preamble and ranging message from the user station M3, taking into account the delay time .increment.T., 194792=Proper timing is preferably set upon initial establishment of communication, and the transmissions from the user stations, such as the first user station M1, may be maintained in time alignment as seen at the base station 304 by timing adjustment commands from the base station 304, similar to the timing adjustment commands described elsewhere herein. A full round-trip guard time need not be included in each time slot 1141 because the user stations 302 and base station 304 transmit on different frequency bands, preventing interference between base-to-user messages and user-to-base messages., 146270=Although preferred values are provided in Table 10-1, the number of power control command steps and the differential therebetween may vary depending upon the particular application and the system requirements. Further details regarding the use of a control pulse preamble (i.e., control pulse) as a power control mechanism, and other related details, may be found in copending application Ser. Nos. 08/215,306 and 08/293,671, filed Mar. 21, 1994 and Aug. 1, 1994, respectively, both in the name of inventors Gary B. Anderson, Ryan N. Jensen, Bryan K. Petch, and Peter O. Peterson, both entitled \"PCS Pocket Phone/Microcell Communication Over-Air Protocol,\" and both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 143842=The control pulse preamble received during the preamble interval 1016 preferably serves a number of functions. The control pulse preamble may be used by the base station 304 to determine information about the communication link with the user station 302. Thus, the control pulse preamble may provide the base station 304 with a power measurement indicative of the path transmission loss and link quality over the air channel. The base station 304 may determine the quality of the received signal, including the received power and the signal-to-noise ratio. The base station 304 may also determine, in response to the power, envelope, or phase of the control pulse preamble, the direction or distance of the user station 302, and the degree of noise or multipath error to which the communication link with the user station 302 may be prone., 264755=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/146,491, filed Nov. 1, 1993, in the name of inventors Robert A. Gold and Robert C. Dixon, entitled \"Despreading/Demodulating Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Signals\", now abandoned;, 211764=Thus, in general, to support communication between a user station 302 and base station 304 communicating during a single time slot 1151, four messages are exchanged in each time frame 1150 between the particular user station 302 and the base station 304. The base station 304 first sends a 123-preamble in a 123-preamble interval 1109 of the time slot 1151 two slots 1151 prior to which the base station 304 intends to transmit to the user station 302. In the following time slot 1151, on a different frequency band 1173 and delayed by an offset time 1160, the user station 302 responds by sending a control pulse preamble, which is received at the base station 304 during the control pulse preamble interval 1116. In the following time slot 1151, after making determinations as to power adjustment and/or timing adjustment, the base station 304 transmits to the user station 304 a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1103 on the base station frequency band 1172 In the following time slot 1151, after adjusting its power and/or timing, the user station 304 responds with a user-to-base message, which is received at the base station 304 during the user message interval 1113., 235871=High tier and low tier designations may be applied to operations in either the licensed or unlicensed frequency bands. In the unlicensed isochronous band (1910-1920 MHz), FCC rules essentially require a TDD or TDMA/FDD hybrid because of the narrow available frequency range, with a maximum signal bandwidth of 1.25 MHz. \"Listen before talk\" capability is commonly required in order to sense and avoid the transmissions of other users prior to transmitting. Applications in the isochronous band are typically of the low tier variety, and include wireless PBX, smart badges (e.g., position determining devices and passive RF radiating devices), home cordless, and compressed video distribution. Dynamic channel allocation and low tier structure is preferred due to the FCC requirements. Further, power limitations generally preclude large cells., 133476=The base timing sub-element 1001 comprises a base preamble interval 1002, a base message interval 1003, and a transmit/receive switch interval 1004. The base preamble interval 1002 may be 56 chips in length. The base message interval 1003 may be 205 bits in length (or, equivalently, 1312 chips if using 32-ary encoding). In a preferred 32-ary encoding technique, each sequence of five data bits is represented by a unique spread spectrum code of 32 chips in length. The number of spread spectrum codes used is 32, each the same number of chips long (e.g., 32 chips), to represent all possible combinations of five data bits. From the set of 32 spread spectrum codes, individual spread spectrum codes are selectively combined in series to form a transmission in the base message interval 1003. The base message interval 1003 comprises a total of up to 41 5-bit data sequences, for a total of 205 bits; thus, a transmission in the base message interval 1003 may comprise a series of up to 41 spread spectrum codes, each selected from the set of 32 spread spectrum codes, for a total of 1312 chips., 145395=After the base station 304 determines the power setting of the user station 302, the base station 304 may adjust its own power as well. The base station 304 may adjust its power separately for each time slot 1041., 185622=The specific communication exchanges shown in the example of FIG. 11B will now be explained in more detail. In the first time slot TS1\", on the base station frequency band 1170, the base station transmits a base-to-user message in the base message interval 1103 directed to a first user station M1. The base station 304 then transmits a 123-preamble burst during the 123-preamble burst interval 1109, directed to another user station M3. Simultaneous with the base station transmissions, the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1171, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the last user station MN with which the base station 304 is in communication. During the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the first time slot TS1\" on the user station frequency band 1171, the base station 304 receives a control pulse preamble from the user station M2 to which the base station 304 is to transmit in the following time slot TS2\"., 206305=The specific communication exchanges shown in the example of FIG. 11C will now be explained in more detail. In the first time slot OTS1, on the base station frequency band 1172, the base station transmits a base-to-user message in the base message interval 1103 directed to a first user station M1. The base station 304 then transmits a 123-preamble burst during the 123-preamble burst interval 1109, directed to another user station M3. Simultaneous with the base station transmissions, but offset therefrom by an offset time 1160, the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1173, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the last user station MN with which the base station 304 is in communication. During the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the first time slot OTS1 on the user station frequency band 1173, the base station 304 receives a control pulse preamble from the user station M2 to which the base station 304 is to transmit in the following time slot OTS2., 178206=The user datalink timing sub-element 1110 and the range timing sub-element 1121 each generally provide for transmissions by more than one user station 302. As explained further below, these timing sub-elements 1110, 1121 provide for transmission by a first user station 302 of a data message or a ranging message in the first part of the timing sub-element 1110 or 1121, and transmission by a second user station 302 of a control pulse preamble in the latter part of the timing sub-element 1110 or 1121. The control pulse preamble, as further described below, generally allows the base station 304 to carry out certain functions (e.g., power control) with respect to the second user station 302., 265002=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/293,671, filed Aug. 18, 1994, in the name of inventors Robert C. Dixon, Jeffrey S. Vanderpool, and Douglas G. Smith, entitled \"Multi-Mode, Multi-Band Spread Spectrum Communication System\";, 199988=In the following time frames 1140, after establishing communication with user station M3 in the manner described above, communication may be carried out between the base station 304 and the user station M3 in an interleaved fashion over several time slots 1140. As part of each transmission from the base station 304, the base station 304 may update the timing adjustment command to the user station M3., 184649=The three short preamble bursts sent in the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 may be used for forward link diversity sensing and forward link power control purposes. Each of these three preamble bursts may be transmitted on a different antenna to allow receiving user stations 302 an opportunity to make a diversity selection for an upcoming forward link data message in a subsequent time slot 1141., 205723=Following the 123-preamble burst interval 1109 is the base fill code interval 1107, during which the base station 304 transmits a fill code. Following the base code fill interval 1107 is the transmit/receive switch interval 1104, during which the base station 304 may switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode. Preferably, however, the base station 304 has separate transmit and receive hardware, and therefore does not need to switch modes. Instead, the base station 304 may continue to transmit a fill code during the transmit/receive switch interval 1104., 192200=As noted, it is assumed in the exemplary time frame 1140 of FIG. 11B that the base station 304 is not in established communication with any user station 302 during the fourth time slot TS4\" over the base station frequency band 1170. The base station 304 may indicate that a particular time slot 1141, such as time slot TS4\", is available for communication by, for example, transmitting a general polling message during the base message interval 1103 of the time slot TS4\"., 171567=FIG. 10E shows a subsequent time frame 1050 after a ranging transaction has been completed with the third user station M3. In FIG. 10E, the transactions between the user stations M1, MN and the base station 304 occurring in the first time slot TS1' are the same as for FIG. 10D. Also, the transactions between the user stations M1, M2 and the base station 304 occurring in the second time slot TS2 are the same as for FIG. 10D. However, during the second time slot TS2', instead of there being no transmitted control pulse preamble in the preamble interval 1016, the third user station M3 may transmit a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2'. Alternatively, the user station M3 may wait until the base station 304 acknowledges its ranging message sent in the prior time frame 1050 before transmitting a control pulse preamble during the preamble interval 1016 of each preceding time slot TS2'., 147041=Returning to FIG. 10B, in the following time slot TS2 after time slot TS1, the base station 304 transmits a preamble during the base preamble interval 1002 and transmits a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1003, both directed to the second user station M2. The base station 304 thereby rapidly responds to the control pulse preamble sent by the user station M2. As with the first time slot TS1, following the base message interval 1003 is a transmit/receive switch interval 1004 during which the base station 304 switches to a receive mode and the user station M2 switches to a transmit mode. The user station M2 then responds with a preamble in the datalink preamble interval 1012 and a user-to-base message in the user message interval 1013. The remaining steps in time slot TS2 are similar to those of the first time slot TS1, except with respect to the preamble interval 1016 as noted below., 209297=Simultaneous with the base station transmissions in the second time slot OTS2 but offset therefrom by an offset time 1160, the base station 304 receives, on the user station frequency band 1173, a preamble during the datalink preamble interval 1112 and a user-to-base message during the user message interval 1113 from the user station M1 with which the base station 304 communicated in the first time slot OTS1. As with the first time slot OTS1, during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 of the second time slot OTS2 on the user station frequency band 1173, the base station 304 receives a control pulse preamble from the user station M3 to which the base station 304 is to transmit in the following time slot OTS3., 149253=For efficiency reasons, the guard times 1014 and 1018 are preferably kept to a minimum. The smaller the guard times 1014, 1018, the more user stations 302 may be supported by the frame structure of FIG. 10B. Typically, therefore, the guard times 1014, 1018 will not be of sufficient duration to allow a full ranging transaction to occur. In particular, a ranging transaction (such as may be carried out using timing sub-element 1021 instead of timing sub-element 1011) may result in interference between the transmission of a user station 302 seeking to establish communication and the control pulse preamble of the user station 302 already in communication in the immediately following time slot 1041 with the base station 304. If the guard times are lengthened to permit ranging transactions, then fewer user stations 302 can be supported, particularly in a large cell environment. An alternative structure having improved efficiency in a large cell environment, along with the flexibility of ranging transactions, is shown in FIGS. 10D and 10E and explained in more detail below., 217201=The ranging guard band 1124 should be of sufficient length to allow the ranging transaction between the base station 304 and the user station 302 to occur. Thus, the length of the ranging guard band 1124 is determined in part by the radius of the cell 303 in which the base station 304 is located, or may be determined in part by the maximum cell radius of the cellular system., 152403=In response to receiving the ranging message from the user station M3 and determining the distance of the user station 302 and/or the propagation delay time thereto, the base station 304 may issue a timing adjustment command to the user station M3 in the next time frame 1040 instructing the user station M3 to advance or retard its timing by a designated amount. For the time frame 1040 immediately after communication with the user station M3 is established, the timing adjustment command may be set equal to the round-trip propagation time as determined by the base station 304 during the ranging transaction. Preferably, the timing adjustment command is selected so as to cause the user transmission from the user station M3 to the base station 304 in the subsequent time frame 1040 to be received by the base station 304 immediately after the end of the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, as described with respect to FIG. 10A., 207406=The functions of the control pulse preamble sent during the control pulse preamble interval 1116 are similar to those described earlier with respect to the control pulse preamble of FIGS. 10A-E and 11B (e.g., power control, antenna adjustment, etc.). Following the preamble interval 1116 is an antenna adjustment interval 1117, during which the base station 304 has an opportunity to adjust its transmission antenna, if necessary, so as to direct it towards the second user station M2 based upon information acquired from receipt of the control pulse preamble. Following the antenna adjustment interval 1117 is another guard band 1118, to allow for propagation of the control pulse preamble to the base station 304. After the preamble interval is another transmit/receive switching interval 1119 to allow the base station 304 opportunity to switch from a receive mode to a transmit mode (if necessary), and to allow the second user station M2 opportunity to switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode., 190621=A similar exchange is carried out in the fourth time slot TS4\", and in subsequent time slots 1141 as well. Whether or not particular user-to-base message, base-to-user messages, and preambles or control pulse preambles are transmitted depends on whether or not the base station 304 is in communication with a user station 302 requiring such exchanges at the particular time., 202863=FIG. 11C is a frame structure for a system using two frequency bands for communication in addition to certain aspects of time division multiple access. A first frequency band 1172, also referred to as a base station frequency band, is used primarily for communication from a base station 304 to user stations 302. A second frequency band 1173, also referred to as a user station frequency band, is used primarily for communication from the user stations 302 to the base station 304. The two frequency bands 1172, 1173 are preferably located 80 MHz apart. The 80 MHz frequency separation helps to minimize co-channel interference and allows easier construction of filters in the receiver for filtering out potentially interfering signals from the reverse path communication., 140215=In operation, the base station 304 transmits, as part of the base timing sub-element 1001 of each time slot 1041, to user stations 302 in sequence with which it has established communication. Thus, the base station 304 transmits a preamble during the preamble interval 1002 and a base-to-user message during the base message interval 1003. In the transmit/receive switch interval 1004, the base station 304 switches from a transmit mode to a receive mode. Likewise, the user station 302 during the transmit/receive switch interval 1004 switches from a receive mode to a transmit mode., 139665=It may be noted that the designated starting point of the time slots TS1, TS2, TS3, etc. is to some degree arbitrary in the FIG. 10B frame structure and various of the other embodiments as are described further herein. Accordingly, the frame structure may be defined such that time slots each start at the beginning of the user timing sub-elements 1011 or 1021, or at the start of the preamble interval 1016, or at the start or end of any particular timing interval, without changing the operation of the system in a material way., 168897=The ranging guard band 1024 in time slot TS4' is preferably of sufficient length to allow the ranging transaction between the base station 304 and the user station M3 to occur. Thus, the length of the ranging guard band 1024 is determined in part by the radius of the cell 303 in which the base station 304 is located, or may be determined in part by the maximum cell radius of the cellular system., 157836=The primary difference between the frame structure of FIGS. 10B-C and the frame structure of FIG. 10D is that the frame structure of FIG. 10D may be considered interleaved in the sense that each user station 302 does not respond immediately to the communication from the base station 304 intended for it, but rather delays its response until a subsequent time slot 1051. The effect of the interleaved frame structure of FIG. 10D is that guard times can be shorter, allowing more time slots 1051 per time frame 1050, and therefore more user stations 302 per base station 304. The interleaved frame structure of FIG. 10D also allows efficient use of ranging transactions between the base station and the user stations, particularly upon initial link-up of communication. Because the frame structure of FIG. 10D is interleaved, the first time slot TS1' comprises a transmission from the base station 304 to the first user station M1 and a responsive transmission, not from the first user station M1, but from the last user station MN., 75728=To further reduce the possibility of intercell interference, different orthogonal spread spectrum codes or code sets C1 through C7 are assigned as shown in adjacent clusters 310. Although seven spread spectrum codes or code sets C1 through C7, which are convenient to form a 7-cell repeated pattern, are shown in FIG. 3B, the number of spread spectrum codes or code sets may vary depending upon the particular application. Further information regarding a particular cellular communication environment may be found in U.S. application Ser. No. 07/682,050 entitled \"Three Cell Wireless Communication System\" filed on Apr. 8, 1991 in the name of Robert C. Dixon, and in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/284,053 entitled \"PCS Pocket Phone/Microcell Communication Over-Air Protocol\" filed on Aug. 1, 1994 in the name of Gary B. Anderson et al., each of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 256933=FIG. 19B is a chart showing selected frequencies and other parameters for use in the dual-mode base station of FIG. 19A. The FIG. 19B chart is divided according to spread spectrum and narrowband modes. The first three columns relate to different transmission rates using spread spectrum techniques, and the latter four columns relate to different transmission rates using narrowband techniques. The frequencies in each column are given in megahertz. The master oscillator frequency is designated in FIG. 19B as f0. M and M2 are programmable divide ratios for clock divider circuits 1926 and 1927. The sample rate in FIG. 19B applies to the A/D converter 1962 and D/A converter 1933. The Fs/(IB+Fch) figure represents the sampling ratio. The final IF frequency and second IF frequency are the center frequencies of the bandpass filters. Towards the bottom of FIG. 19B are sample first LO and N numbers for three different input frequencies, 1850 MHz, 1850.2 MHz, and 1930 MHz., 155905=In the following time frames 1040, after establishing communication with the third user station M3 in the manner described above, communication may be carried out between the base station 304 and the third user station M3 in time slot TS3. In each preamble interval 1016 of the second time slot TS2, the user station M3 transmits a control pulse preamble allowing the base station 304 to exercise power control, synchronize to the user station M3, or determine the distance of the user station M3. The base station 304 then sends a transmission directed to the user station M3 in the first portion of the third time slot TS3, and the user station M3 responds with a transmission directed to the base station 304 in the latter portion of the third time slot TS3. As part of each transmission from the base station 304, the base station 304 may update the timing adjustment command to the user station M3., 216034=When a user station 302 first establishes communication with the base station 304 in the FIG. 11C frame structure, a ranging transaction is carried out. The time slot 1151 on the user station frequency band 1173 during which the ranging transaction is initiated preferably comprises a range timing sub-element 1121, as described previously with respect to FIG. 11A. The user station 302 transmits a preamble during a ranging preamble interval 1122 of time slot 1151, and transmits a ranging message during the user ranging message interval 1123 of time slot 1151. The user station 302 delays transmitting the preamble and ranging message for an amount of time \u0394T. The delay time \u0394T may be communicated by the base station 304 as part of the general polling message, or may be a pre-programmed system parameter. The base station 304 determines the propagation delay from the user station 302 to the base station 304 by measuring the round trip propagation delay from the end of the previous time slot 1151 to the time of actual receipt of the responsive preamble and ranging message from the user station 302, taking into account the delay time \u0394T., 142673=After the transmission of the user-to-base message from the first user station M1, which may, as perceived by the base station 304, consume up to all of the user message interval 1013 and the guard band 1014, is another transmit/receive switch interval 1015. Following the transmit/receive switch interval 1015, a control pulse preamble is received from a second user station M2 during the preamble interval 1016. The function of the control pulse preamble is explained in more detail below. Following the preamble interval 1016 is an antenna adjustment interval 1017, during which the base station 304 adjusts its transmission antenna, if necessary, so as to direct it towards the second user station M2. Following the antenna adjustment interval 1017 is another guard band 1018, which accounts for the propagation time of the control pulse preamble to the base station 304. After the preamble interval is another transmit/receive switching interval 1019 to allow the base station 304 opportunity to switch from a receive mode to a transmit mode, and to allow the second user station M2 opportunity to switch from a transmit mode to a receive mode.}",
