Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope defined by claims. In the claims, means-plus-function claims are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. In any case, there are many of variations that may utilize the teachings herein, depending on the particular implementation preferred in one situation or another. Thus, the terms and expressions which have been employed herein are used as terms of teaching and not of limitation, and there is absolutely no intention, in the use of such terms and expressions, of excluding equivalents of the features shown and described, or portions thereof, it being recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the embodiments contemplated and suggested herein.
