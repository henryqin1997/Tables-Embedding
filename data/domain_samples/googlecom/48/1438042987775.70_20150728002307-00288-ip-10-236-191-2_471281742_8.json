    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is evident that the detection tag according to the invention is suitable not only for detecting theft, but also for detecting other information. In general, the invention has the advantage that after each discharge a residual resonance remains present at all times, so that it is possible to detect whether or not the circuit has been damaged. Application of the invention further makes available a detection tag which can be reused after activation by discharge. After all, the through-connection between adjacent regions, caused by the discharge, can be removed again by supplying energy at a high level. The original state with a discharge gap is thus obtained. Moreover, the invention has the advantage that prior to or following a discharge, it is possible to test whether the circuit has been damaged. The same effects occur if the bridging resistor is connected in parallel with the inductors (see FIG 2: 12). It was therefore found that the discharge causes both a well-defined frequency change and a quality change of the circuit. As a result, an amplitude and a decay behaviour are observed which depend on whether or not a discharge has been carried out. This embodiment has the advantage that detection can take place based on amplitude, frequency, phase and/or decay time. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the discharge gap 8, 12 is bridged by a resistor in the form of a resistor track",
