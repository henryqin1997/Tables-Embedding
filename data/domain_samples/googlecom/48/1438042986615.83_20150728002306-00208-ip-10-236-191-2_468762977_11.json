The number of platelets collected is typically between 3 to 12\ufffd1011 platelets. Once the platelet concentrate has been collected, the platelet concentrate is resuspended in the manner described below and transferred, in a sterile manner, from the container within the collection chamber to a storage container., 26798=In the AMICUS\u2122 Separator, as described generally in U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,691, which is also incorporated by reference herein, anticoagulated whole blood is introduced into a rotating centrifuge (spinning at approximately 3200 rpm) and is separated (in a first stage) into red and white blood cells on the one hand and platelet-rich plasma on the other hand. The platelet-rich plasma is further separated (in a second stage) into platelet poor plasma and platelet concentrate. The final volume of the platelet concentrate is approximately 5-35 ml (which, as described above, includes a portion that is platelets and the remainder of which is plasma). The number of platelets collected is typically between 3 to 12\ufffd1011 platelets, and more typically, approximately 4\ufffd1011 platelets., 17052=This is a division of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 09/490,191 filed Jan. 24, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,197, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/871,115 filed Jun. 9, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,624., 25559=In the Baxter CS-3000\ufffd Plus, as described generally in U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,172 which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is incorporated by reference herein, anticoagulated whole blood is introduced into a separation chamber within a rotating centrifuge (spinning at approximately 1600 rpm). In the separation chamber, anticoagulated whole blood is separated into red and white cells on the one hand and platelet-rich plasma on the other hand. The platelet-rich plasma is then pumped from the separation chamber into a second collection chamber within the rotating centrifuge. There the platelet-rich plasma is separated into platelet poor plasma and platelet concentrate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above description is intended for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the claims to any of the embodiments described herein. The true scope of the invention is set forth in the appended claims. Based on the foregoing, it is believed that the method of the present invention provides a new, unique, simple and inexpensive method whereby platelets can be completely resuspended and substantially free of aggregates. In addition, use of the alternative, inexpensive salt solutions for platelet resuspension preserves blood plasma for other important end uses. As can be seen, resuspension superior to that of plasma was obtained with several of the solutions tested. For the most part, test solutions that were hypertonic seemed to resuspend the platelets faster and with greater efficiency than plasma or some of the other test solutions. Table I sets forth the Aggregometer test results for donors A-G. All tests were performed in triplicate and mean values and standard deviations are reported. Table II sets forth the Vortex test results. \u201cVortex Mean\u201d values and standard deviations (reported in the last column of Table II) are based on available results obtained for donors A, B, C, E, F and H. Results for donors D and G are not included in the calculation of the \u201cVortex Mean\u201d and standard deviation reported in the last column of Table II. An \u201c*\u201d indicates that there was no resuspension after 2 hours.",
