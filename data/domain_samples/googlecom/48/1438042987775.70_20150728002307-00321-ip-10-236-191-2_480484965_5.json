No. 552,823, filed Feb. 25, 1975, entitled \"Alkali Metals And Ammonium Zirconyl Carbonate Complexes Useful As Antiperspirants\". AZC may be prepared according to several methods, such as described in German patent publication No. 2,251,434, published May 3, 1973 or U.S. Pat. No. 3,418,073 to Blumenthal., 32346=In general, the relative amounts of the zirconium compound and magnesium compound to be reacted together should be as to yield a ZrO2 /MgO ratio of between about 30:1 to 1:1, and preferably 10:1 to 3:1. Although relatively high ratios of zirconium are desirable from the standpoint of antiperspirant efficacy, such ratios are sometimes contraindicated due to the greater cost of zirconium. In addition, large amounts of zirconium usually increase the possibilities of skin irritation, though these may be mitigated by the buffering action of the hydroxyl and amino acid groups, such as those in the above buffers. Further, the MgO content of an aqueous solution of the complex should be at least about 1 and preferably greater than 3 weight percent., 23039=In accordance with the present invention, astringent complexes are prepared by dissolving in aqueous or alcoholic solution controlled proportions of a magnesium compound and an acidic (cationic) or astringent zirconium compound. Solutions containing such complexes of zirconium and magnesium compounds in the weight ratio, determined as their oxides (ZrO2 and MgO), in the range of about 30:1 to 1:1, exhibit excellent antiperspirant activity. That is, at a total concentration in water of 5 to 10 weight percent of total magnesium and zirconium (both expressed as oxides) these compositions are comparable or superior in antiperspirant activity to standard aluminum chlorhydrate solutions. The obtained solutions may be incorporated as such into antiperspirant formulations or dried to form powders for incorporation into various conventional antiperspirant formulations, as will hereinafter appear. The 5 to 15 weight percent, calculated as oxides, aqueous solutions have a pH above 3, preferably about 3 to 5, and the corresponding alcoholic solutions have an apparent pH above 2., 20346=In addition, Rubino copending application Ser. No. 418,712, filed Nov. 23, 1973, entitled \"Aluminum-Zirconium Anti-Perspirant Systems With Salts Of Amino Acids\", and other related copending applications describe other systems in which amino acids have been incorporated in aluminum-zirconium complexes to offset the acidity of the zirconium and aluminum as well as provide other advantages to the antiperspirant. Nevertheless, still more efficient and advantageous methods are being sought to combat the acidity of zirconium while at the same time maintaining or improving antiperspirant efficacy., 28450=Basic zirconium gels, such as basic zirconium carbonates, zirconium hydroxide and basic zirconium-amino acid compounds, including particularly basic zirconium glycinate, and complexes thereof useful as antiperspirants are disclosed in copending patent application Ser. No. 562,300 of Rubino et al., filed Mar. 26, 1975, entitled \"Basic Zirconium Complexes And Methods Of Making And Using In Antiperspirants\". Basic zirconium carbonate gels may be prepared by standard precipitation techniques using sodium carbonate and most any of the usual zirconium oxy or zirconium hydroxy salts previously referred to, such as zirconyl chloride or zirconyl hydroxy chloride. Basic zirconium-amino acid gels may be formed by the usual method of reacting zirconyl chloride or zirconyl hydroxy chloride with the desired amino acid. However, according to application Ser. No. 562,300, such gels are preferably prepared by reacting in aqueous medium a water soluble salt of an amino acid and a water soluble zirconium salt, which results in the precipitation of a basic zirconium-amino acid gel., 49221=Sample E -- A Complex according to my copending application Ser. No. 562,300, filed Mar. 26, 1975, entitled \"Basic Zirconium Complexes and Methods on Making and Using in Antiperspirants\" was prepared by reacting 52 grams of a basic zirconium glycinate gel (9.1% Zr, 2.5% glycine) with 40 grams of AlCl3 solution (2% Al). The mixture was refluxed at 80\ufffd C. until the solution cleared. The resulting solution has a pH of 3.1. The material was dried in an oven at 50\ufffd C. under a vacuum of 45 cm of Hg. The product assayed 4.2% Al, 28.2% Zr and 11.0% glycine (Al/Zr ratio = 0.5:1). A 10% w/w aqueous solution was prepared for testing by dissolving 20 grams of the product in 180 grams of water. The clear solution has a pH of 3.5., 43846=Solutions which are preferred and which conform to the desired pH range include those containing 5 to 15 percent total by weight of zirconium and magnesium compounds (expressed as their oxides, ZrO2 and MgO), and greater than 3 weight percent magnesium, calculated as the oxide. A preferred composition is one comprising an aqueous solution of magnesium glycinate plus zirconium hydroxy chloride wherein the ratio of zirconium to magnesium is in the range of about 10:1 to 3:1 and the total content of magnesium and zirconium is from about 5 to 10 percent both expressed by weight of their oxides. Despite the fact that magnesium compounds in themselves display little or no effective antiperspirant activity, the preferred compositions containing no more than 10 percent of the zirconium and magnesium compounds (as their oxides), have been found to be as effective or superior to standard basic aluminum chloride (aluminum chlorhydrate) solutions., 30637=Other suitable magnesium compounds for use in preparing the complexes of the present invention include magnesium salts of hydroxy carboxylic acids. Suitable hydroxy carboxylic acid salts include salts of hydroxy acids having a hydroxyl group alpha and/or beta to the carboxylic acid radical. Examples of such acids include lactic, citric, tartaric, glycolic, gluconic, trihydroxyglutaric, citryl trigluconic, citryl mono gluconic, citryl digluconic, malic, tetrahydroxy adipic, and citramalic acids, and mixtures thereof. These salts may be obtained commercially or prepared by reacting the desired hydroxy carboxylic acid with magnesium hydroxide, oxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. These salts and complexes thereof useful as antiperspirants are disclosed in my copending application Ser. No. 433,931, filed Jan. 16, 1974 for \"Aluminum-Zirconium Antiperspirant Systems With Hydroxy Carboxylic Compounds\".}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of essential attributes thereof, and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification as indicating the scope of the invention. One of the advantages obtained by the addition of the magnesium compound to the compositions containing the astringent zirconium compound is reduced cost of the composition at the same antiperspirant activity. By replacement of part of the needed amount of zirconium compound by the magnesium compound considerable savings in cost are obtained since the initial cost of the zirconium compound is many times that of the magnesium compound at the same oxide content. A demonstrated sweat inhibition of more than about 20 percent on a repeated application is regarded as substantially effective. The measurement usually considered quite important is the one taken 22 hours after the last application. It is significant that the complex solution of the present invention tested above showed improved antiperspirant efficacy over the 10 percent basic aluminum chloride solutions used as the reference. There was no evidence of axillary irritation during any of the tests. __________________________________________________________________________% Sweat Inhibition__________________________________________________________________________ Means of 22 hrs.1 hr. after 1 hr. after 1 hr. after 1 hr. afterSampleappl'n No. 2 appl'n No. 3 appl'n No. 4 collections last appl'n__________________________________________________________________________R 26.3 \ufffd 9.8 33.8 \ufffd 10.4 -- 30.0 \ufffd 8.6 27.8 \ufffd 10.0E 42.7",
