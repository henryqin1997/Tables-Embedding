No. 6,188,899., 64769=FIG. 2 illustrates the over-the-air activation physical architecture. The mobile station 100 communicates over-the-air with the local base station 102, using the IS-136 standard. This standard is documented in TIA IS-136 Revision A, Mar. 21, 1996. The base station 102, the mobile switching center 104, and the visitor location register 106, are typically co located at a local base station complex. The MSC 104 communicates over the fixed supporting network to the signal transfer point, STP 114, which in turn will forward messages from the MSC 104 to either the home location register, HLR 108, or alternately to the over-the-air activation function processor, OTAF processor 110. The VLR 106 at the base station complex can also directly access a particular HLR 108 in the fixed supporting network. Also shown in FIG. 2 is an activation center 112 which includes business systems and billing systems which are connected in the fixed supporting network to the OTAF processor 110 and to the HLR 108., 67228=In a previously activated mobile station 100, that is a mobile station 100 that has been programmed with a valid mobile identification number MIN, the registration order transmitted over-the-air contains the mobile station's MIN, encoded in an IS-136 mobile station ID (MSID). (See the standard TIA IS-136 revision A, Mar. 21, 1996). The IS-136 standard specifies rules for encoding the MIN into the MSID. The MSID is sent in layer 2 of the registration order which is described in the IS-41 standard. Typically this operation takes place for a previously activated mobile station 100 which is moved into the coverage area of the local mobile switching center 104 and must become registered in the new area before it can conduct normal communication sessions. The registration notification is carried in the mobile application part (MAP) layer of the SS7 transport, as is specified in the IS-41 standard., 68187=Cellular telephone networks use the global title translation (GTT) on the MIN at the signal transfer point 114 in a fixed supporting network, to route IS-41 messages to the home location register, HLR 108, in normal communications sessions. Global title translation (GTT) is described in the standard ANSI T1.112\u20141992, SS7, Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP). The global title indicator type 2 is used, with a translation type value of 3 to specify the \u201cMIN to HLR\u201d translation in the STP 114. The global title address information field contains the ten digit MIN (BCD encoded). For Example, the MSC 104 and the VLR 106 will send the registration notification to the signal transfer point 114, which performs the GTT translation on the MIN to obtain routing information in the form of a point code and subsystem number in the fixed supporting network, to the HLR 108. Thus, in normal communications sessions, the registration notification is routed from the MSC 104 and VLR 106 to the HLR 108 which is responsible for the specified MIN from the requesting mobile station 100., 62844=Turning now to the figures, FIG. 1 shows a network reference model for the over-the-air activation function that controls delivery of the over-the-air activation messages to the mobile station. The mobile station 100 includes the mobile station (MS) and the short message entity (SME). The mobile station 100 communicates over-the-air with the base mobile station interworking function (BMI) which includes the base station BS 102, the mobile switching center MSC I04, and the visitor location register VLR 106. The base station, BS, is connected by means of the link A to the mobile switching center, MSC, which in turn is connected by means of the link B to the visitor location register, VLR. Also shown in FIG. 1 is the home location register, HLR 108, which is assigned to handle the maintenance of location and business records for the specific mobile telephone 100. The home location register 108 is typically located at a geographically remote location from the BMI currently servicing over-the-air communications with the mobile station 100. The HLR is connected by means of the link D to the VLR 106. Also shown in FIG. 1 is the over-the-air activation function OTAF 110\u2032 which is connected by means of a link Q2 to the mobile switching center 104 and is also connected by means of the link D2 to the home location register 108. The OTAF function 110\u2032 performs activation processing in response to a registration order from the mobile station 100 which has not previously been activated, and downloads activation parameters in the form of NAM parameters to the mobile station 100. The links A, B, D, D2, Q2, and UM shown in FIG. 1 are interfaces between network entities, as defined in the standard TIA IS-41, revision C ANSI ballot version, Jan. 3, 1996.}",

Mobile station 100 includes RF transmit and receive circuits, digital circuits, and voice circuits. Mobile station 100 also includes the RAM memory 806 which stores the NAM parameters in the NAM register after they are downloaded over the air from the OTAF processor 110. Mobile station 100 also includes the programmable read only memory (ROM) 808 that is programmed at the time of manufacture with the ESN and with the OTAF ID number 810. In the alternate embodiment of the invention, mobile station 100 alternately includes the programmable ROM 830 (shown in dotted outline in FIG. 8A) that is programmed at the time of manufacture with the ESN and with a sequentially serialized dummy MIN 832.
