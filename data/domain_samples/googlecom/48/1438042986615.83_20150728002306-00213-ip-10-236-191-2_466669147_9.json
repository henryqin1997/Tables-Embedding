FIG. 70 shows a wave-guide 2001 coupled to a radiation source (not shown). The wave-guide 2001 directs radiation into a radiation scattering medium 2007. Attached to the surface of the radiation scattering medium 2007 are multiple radiation sensors 2010-2013, mounted along the axis of scattering medium 2007, for receiving and converting incident radiation into electrical energy. The multiple radiation sensors 2010-2013 are electrically connected in series so that the voltage output of each sensor is additive, thereby producing a total output voltage in excess of what would be achieved from a single sensor.}",

No. 09/921,066, filed on Aug. 2, 2001, entitled \u201cMRI-Resistant Implantable Device\u201d. The entire contents of each of the above noted co-pending U.S. Patent Applications (Ser. Nos. 09/885,867; 09/885,868; 10/037,513; 10/037,720; 09/943,216; 09/964,095; and 09/921,066) are hereby incorporated by reference., 162009=As an alternative to electrodes 1300, the secondary device housing 1200 may include a sensing and stimulation system that includes optical pulsing components to deliver a stimulus of a predetermined duration and power to the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region; a sensing and stimulation system that includes optical pulsing components to deliver a stimulus of a predetermined duration and power to the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region and electrical pulsing components to deliver a stimulus of a predetermined duration and power to the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region; a hydrostatic pressure sensing components to detect physiological signals from the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region; or optical sensing components to detect physiological signals from the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region and electrical sensing components to detect physiological signals from the desired anatomical cardiac tissue region., 191780=On the other hand, the RC time constant should not be so large as to prevent adequate DC current flow from the implanted body tissue into the capacitor between pulses. According to design convention for RC circuits, a period of five time constants is required in order for an RC circuit capacitor to become fully charged. Note that the selected RC time constant of 200 milliseconds satisfies this requirement if the photodiode array is pulsed at 1000 millisecond intervals, which is typical for pacemakers. Thus, there will be approximately five 200 millisecond time constants between every pulse. Stated another way, the RC time constant will be approximately one-fifth of the time interval between successive pulses., 158050=The lead system 1150 may be a fiber optic based communication system wherein the fiber optic communication system contains at least one channel within a multi-fiber optic bundle. The fiber optic based communication system is covered with a biocompatible material wherein the biocompatible material is a non-permeable diffusion resistant biocompatible material., 161243=The shield 1260 may be a metallic sheath, a carbon composite sheath, or a polymer composite sheath to shield the secondary device housing 1200 and any circuits therein from electromagnetic interference. The shield 1260 is further covered with a biocompatible material wherein the biocompatible material may be a non-permeable diffusion resistant biocompatible material., 154356=The primary device housing 1100 includes a power source 1120. The power source 1120 may be a battery power source in combination with a battery power source measuring circuit. In this embodiment, the control circuit 1110 can automatically adjust a value for determining an elective replacement indication condition of a battery power source such that the value is automatically adjusted by the control circuit 1110 in response to a measured level of a state of the battery power source, the measured level generated by the battery power source measuring circuit connected to the battery power source., 159449=The electrical leads maybe unipolar leads, bipolar leads, or a combination of unipolar and bipolar leads. The lead system 1150 may also be a combination of a fiber optic based communication system and electrical leads., 156082=The shield 1160 may be a metallic sheath, a carbon composite sheath, or a polymer composite sheath to shield the primary device housing 1100 and any circuits therein from electromagnetic interference. The shield 1160 is further covered with a biocompatible material wherein the biocompatible material may be a non-permeable diffusion resistant biocompatible material. The primary device housing 1100 may also include a detection circuit (not shown) to detect a phase timing of an external electromagnetic field such that the control circuit 1110 alters its operations to avoid interfering with the detected external electromagnetic field., 155024=The primary device housing 1100 includes an optical emitter 1130, an optical sensor 1140, and an interface 1170 to put the primary device housing 1100 in operative communication with a lead system 1150., 155301=The primary device housing 1100 may also include a switch (not shown), such as a reed switch or solid state switch, to place the control circuit 1110 into a fixed-rate mode of operation and an acoustic sensor (not shown) or near infrared sensor (not shown) to sense a predetermined acoustic signal. The switch places the control circuit 1110 into a fixed-rate mode of operation when the acoustic sensor or near infrared sensor senses the predetermined acoustic signal or the predetermined infrared signal., 184707=In particular, the base side of the transistor 403 is biased through a resister RI and a pair of diodes D1 and D2. The diodes D1 and D2 are connected between the base of the transistor 403 and ground. Each has a conventional diode voltage drop of about 0.7 volts, such that the total voltage drop across the diodes D1 and D2 is about 1.5 volts and is substantially independent of the current through the diodes (at operational current levels). This means that the base of the transistor 403 will be maintained at a relatively constant level of about 1.5 volts notwithstanding changes in the input voltage supplied from the pulse generator. The value of the resistor R1 is selected to be relatively high to reduce the current draw through the base of the transistor 403. By way of example, a value of 2500 ohms may be used for R1. Assuming a supply voltage of about 5 volts, as represented by the input pulse waveform, the current through the resistor R1 will be a negligible 1.4 milliamps., 154006=The primary device housing 1100 is implantable such that the control circuit 1110 can be programmable from a source external of the primary device housing 1100 or the control circuit 1110 can provide physiological diagnostics to a source external of the primary device housing 1100., 160557=The secondary device housing 1200 includes a power source 1220. The power source 1220 may be a battery power source or capacitor or other device for storing. The primary device housing 1200 includes an optical emitter 1230, an optical sensor 1240, and an interface 1270 to put the secondary device housing 1200 in operative communication with the lead system 1150., 225631=The second factor associated with demand pacing is physiologic demand; modern pacemakers are designed with additional sensing and analytical capability that permits the device to monitor physiologic demand associated with physical activity or other forms of stress that would result in an elevated heartbeat in a normal human subject. In response to this heightened physiologic demand, the pacing signal 323 would be generated at an earlier time than the 1000 mS delay indicated in FIG. 31., 159707=The lead system 1150 may also include a detection circuit (not shown) to detect a phase timing of an external electromagnetic field such that the control circuit 1110 alters its operations to avoid interfering with the detected external electromagnetic field., 62453=This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/269,817, filed on Feb. 20, 2001; the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 187812=By way of example, if the batteries produce 3 volts and the desired current through a single diode is 0.5 milliamps, the value of the resistor should be about 2000 ohms. This would be suitable if the diode is a light emitting diode. If the diode were a laser diode, other values and components would be used. For example, a current level on the order of 100 milliamps may be required to produce coherent light output from the diode if it is a laser. The optical conduction pathways 417 and 421 can be implemented as fiber optic bundles 418 and 423, or as single fibers, driving respective arrays of photodiodes., 268286=The radiation scattering medium 2007 and multiple sensors 2010-2013 are mounted such that there is little or no surface of the scattering medium that is not covered by a sensor. Any areas that are not covered by sensors are preferably covered with an internally reflective coating that directs incident radiation back into the scattering medium 2007 for absorption by the sensors 2010-2013. Together these features ensure that the sensors 2010-2013 absorb a maximum amount of radiation., 158450=The lead system 1150 may also be a plurality of electrical leads that have a shield 1180 therearound to prevent the electrical leads from conducting stray electromagnetic interference. This shield 1180 may be a metallic sheath, a carbon composite sheath, or a polymer composite sheath to prevent the electrical leads from conducting stray electromagnetic interference. In addition to the shield 1180 or in lieu of the shield 1180, each electrical lead may include an electrical filter wherein the electrical filter removes stray electromagnetic interference from a signal being received from the electrical lead. The electrical filter may comprise capacitive and inductive filter elements adapted to filter out predetermined frequencies of electromagnetic interference. The shield 1180 is covered with a biocompatible material wherein the biocompatible material is a non-permeable diffusion resistant biocompatible material., 163001=The secondary device housing 1200 may also include a detection circuit (not shown) to detect a phase timing of an external electromagnetic field such that the control circuit 1110 alters its operations to avoid interfering with the detected external electromagnetic field., 161666=The secondary housing 1200 may also include electrodes 1300 for either stimulating a tissue region or sensing biological characteristics or parameters from the tissue region. More details as to the construction of the secondary device are set forth below in the describing of distal end elements., 163320=The secondary device housing 1200 may include sensors to detect a heart signal and to produce a sensor signal therefrom and a modulator to modulate the sensor signal to differentiate the sensor signal from electromagnetic interference. In the alternative, the secondary device housing 1200 may include sensors to detect a heart signal and to produce a sensor signal therefrom, and the primary device housing 1100 may include a sampling circuit to sample the sensor signal multiple times to differentiate the sensor signal from electromagnetic interference, undesirable acoustic signals, large muscle contractions, or extraneous infrared light., 161017=The secondary device housing 1200 has formed around it a shield 1260 to shield the secondary device housing 1200 and any circuits therein from electromagnetic interference., 179308=By way of example, if the batteries 300 produce 3 volts and the desired current through a single diode is 0.5 milliamperes, the value of the resistor should be about 2000 ohms. This would be suitable if the diode is a light emitting diode. If the diode were a laser diode, other values and components would be used. For example, a current level on the order of 100 milliamps may be required to produce coherent light output from the diode if it is a laser. The optical conduction pathway 300 can be implemented as fiber optic bundles 307, or as single fibers, driving respective arrays of photo diodes. The opto-electrical transducer 28 may be implemented with six photodiodes 312-317 that are wired for photovoltaic operation., 155860=The primary device housing 1100 has formed around it a shield 1160 to shield the primary device housing 1100 and any circuits therein from electromagnetic interference.}",
