No. 6,801,938, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/140,005, filed Jun. 18, 1999 and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/185,665, filed Feb. 29, 2000, the contents of which are incorpoareted herein by reference in their entirety., 47086=Data processing application 107 may be implemented using the Orchestrate parallel framework from Torrent Systems; Inc. such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/627,801, filed Mar. 25, 1996 and entitled \u201cApparatuses and Methods for Programmable Parallel Computers,\u201d by Michael J. Beckerle et al.; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/807,040, filed Feb. 24, 1997 and entitled \u201cApparatuses and Methods for Monitoring Performance of Parallel Computing,\u201d by Allen M. Razdow, et al.; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/104,288, filed Jun. 24, 1998 and entitled \u201cComputer System and Process for Checkpointing Operations on Data in a Computer System by Partitioning the Data,\u201d by Michael J. Beckerle, and as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,909,681, issued Jun. 1, 1999 and entitled \u201cA Computer System and Computerized Method for Partitioning Data for Parallel Processing,\u201d by Anthony Passera, et al., 55284=Segmentation of the continuous stream of data 102 also provides a facility through which checkpointing of operations generally may be performed. In particular, a persistent indication of a segment being processed may be saved by an operator 106. When a failure during the processing performed by the operator 106 is detected, any results produced by the operator 106 for the selected segment may be discarded. The segment then may be reprocessed using the saved persistent indication of the segment being processed. If operator 106 completes processing without failure, the outputs produced by operator 106 may be output before the next segment is processed. This use of segments to checkpoint operations enables operations on a continuous stream of data to be checkpointed using transactional semantics which partition the continuous stream of data into segments. The segmentation can be used to define partitions for checkpointing, that may be performed in the manner described in \u201cLoading Databases Using Dataflow Parallelism,\u201d Sigmod Record, Vol. 23, No. 4, pages 72-83, December 1994, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/104,288, filed Jun. 24, 1998 and entitled \u201cComputer System and Process for Checkpointing Operations on Data in a Computer System by Partitioning the Data,\u201d by Michael J. Beckerle. Checkpointing also may be performed using a different partitioning than the segmentation based on transactional semantics.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations For example, prior to segmentation of the continuous stream of data 102, the data may be filtered to eliminate records that do not assist in or that may bias or otherwise impact the analysis of the data. For example, where the continuous stream of data is a log of information to eliminate information about requests issued to a server, the log may be filtered about one or more requests. The kinds of information that may be eliminated include information about requests associated with various entities including computer programs called \u201cspiders,\u201d \u201ccrawlers\u201d or \u201crobots.\u201d Such a program executed by a search engine to access file servers on a computer network and gather files from them for indexing. These requests issued by spiders, crawlers and robots also are logged in the same manner as other requests to a server. These programs have host names and agent names which may be known. The filtering operation may filter any requests from users having names of known spiders, crawlers or robots. A server also may have a file with a predetermined name that specifies what files may be accessed on the server by spiders, crawlers and robots. Accesses to these files may be used to identify the host or agent name of spiders, crawlers or robots, which then may be used to filter out other accesses from these entities. Programs are readily available to detect such spiders, crawlers and robots.",
