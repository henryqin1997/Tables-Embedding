Since the sample flasks vary in volume, the water is varied to correspond to the volume variations. The 2 \u03bcL of water in the 300 ml flask volume is comparable to a 0.25 water activity product at 72\ufffd F. Next, 40 \u03bcL, the permeation ethanol/aromatic working standard or 40 \u03bcL of the naphtha blend working standard prepared according to section 2.2, is injected into the environmental flask. Either of these working standards will produce a 60% relative humidity at 72\ufffd F. with a permeant concentration (parts per million-volume/volume) in the 1200 ml volume flask indicated in Table I. Other humidities or permeant concentrations may be employed in the test method by using psychrometric chart to determine humidity and using the gas loss to calculate permeant concentration. The time is recorded and the permeation cell placed into a thermostatically controlled oven. Samples may be staggered to accommodate GC run time. Three identical permeation devices are prepared. Triplicate analyses are used for QC purposes., 125535=Stock Ethanol/Aromatic Standard solution. Ethanol (0.6030 gram), toluene (0.1722 gram), p-xylene (0.1327 gram), o-xylene (0.0666 gram), trimethylbenzene (0.0375 gram) and naphthalene (0.0400 gram) package in 1 ml sealed glass ampules.

The product PET resin has an intrinsic viscosity (\u03b7) that ranges from about 0.72-0.85 dL/g. Often bottle grade PET resin, during manufacture, is heated under inert ambient atmosphere to promote further polymerization in the resin., 144683=We compounded four experimental polypropylene (Montel 8623) pellets. Three of the compounded pellets contained acetylated \u03b1 cyclodextrin, acetylated \u03b2 cyclodextrin, and a 50%/50% mixture of acetylated \u03b1 and \u03b2 cyclodextrin each at a loading level of 0.75% (wt/wt). The fourth was a control pellet made from the same batch of polypropylene resin and additives (Dynamar FX-9613 processing additive; Irgafos 168 and Irganox 1076 antioxidants) but without cyclodextrin., 95513=The permeation test device FIG. 3 consists of two glass permeation cells or flasks with cavities of 1200 ml (environment cell or feed side) and 300 ml (sample cell or permeating side)., 124667=Glass permeation test cells or flasks. Two glass flasks with cavities of approximately 1200 ml (environment cell or feed side) and 300 ml (sample flask or permeating side) (FIG. 3)., 140493=We produced six experimental high density poyethylene (HDPE) test films. One of the films contained 0.5% (wt/wt) acetylated a cyclodextrin, two contained a acetylated \u03b2 cyclodextrin at 0.5% and 1.0% loading levels, and two contained a mixture of acetylated \u03b1 and \u03b2 cyclodextrin at 0.5% and 1.0% loading levels. The sixth film was a control made from the same batch of HDPE (DOW 640) and additives (Dynamar FX-9613 processing additive; Irgafos 168 and Irganox 1076 antioxidants) but without cyclodextrin. The films were fabricated by blown film extrusion and had a normal thickness of 2 mil., 54018=Biaxially oriented PET plastic carbonated soft drink bottle which is produced from polyethylene terephthalate using methods taught in Wyeth et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,733,309 issued May 15, 1973 and entitled \"Biaxially Oriented Poly (Ethylene Terephthalate) Bottle.\" The majority of the biaxially oriented PET beverage bottles are presently being produced by the so-called two stage \"reheat blow\" method, using a separate machine for each stage. In a first stage injection molding machine, PET parisons or preforms are first injection molded in a cooled mold, at melt temperatures of about 540\ufffd F., which is above the polymers melting point, and then cooled down and removed from the injection molding machine for later use as feed stock to a separate second stage reheat-blow machine, where the biaxially oriented bottle is produced. Upon entering the reheat blow machine, the cold parisons, whose shape resembles that of a test tube having a threaded bottle neck finish at its open ended top, are heated uniformly in an oven to its orientation temperature, which for PET is about 190\ufffd F. to 200\ufffd F. (which is below PET's melting point). The temperature conditioned parisons are then placed within cooled bottle blow molds which clamp the parisons by their necks upon closing off the blow molds. Metal pushrods are then inserted and pushed into the parisons through their open necks, and the parisons, whose initial lengths are shorter than that of the finished bottle, are stretched axially against the bottom of the blow molds to their final lengths, thereby effecting axial or longitudinal orientation. Radial or so-called \"hoop direction\" orientation is next achieved by introducing compressed air inside the axially stretched parisons to expand them outward and into contact with the cooled surfaces of the bottle blow molds. After cooling sufficiently for subsequent handling, the blow molds open and the biaxially oriented bottles are ejected from the machine. While this method is suitable for use with orientable thermoplastic, it requires a substantial capital investment in the injection molding machine and the reheat blow machine and its associated parison transfer equipment and heating ovens. Furthermore, a considerable amount of energy is consumed in reheating the cold parisons in the oven, which adds to the cost of the finished oriented articles., 13101=This is a Continuation of application Ser. No. 08/603,486, filed Feb. 20, 1996, abandoned, which application is a continuation-in-part application of Ser. No. 08/264,771, filed Jun. 23, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,947, which application are incorporated herein by reference., 19558=Wyeth et al., U.S. Pat.

No. 4,223,128 teaches a process for preparing polyethylene terephthalate polymers useful in beverage containers. Bonnebat et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,385,089 teaches a process for preparing biaxially oriented hollow thermoplastic shaped articles in bottles using a biaxial draw and blow molding technique. A preform is blow molded and then maintained in contact with hot walls of a mold to at least partially reduce internal residual stresses in the preform. The preform can be cooled and then blown to the proper size in a second blow molding operation. Gartland et al., U.S. Pat.

No. 4,473,515 teaches an improved injection blow molding apparatus and method. In the method, a parison or preform is formed on a cooled rod from hot thermoplastic material. The preform is cooled and then transformed to a blow molding position. The parison is then stretched, biaxally oriented, cooled and removed from the device. Nilsson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,277 teaches a method for manufacturing a thermoplastic container comprising a laminated thermoplastic film from a preform. The preform has a thermoplastic layer and a barrier layer which is sufficiently transformed from a preformed shape and formed to a container. Jakobsen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,878 teaches a tubular preform used to produce a container. The preform is converted into a bottle. Motill, U.S. Pat. No. 4,368,825; Howard Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,494; Chang, U.S. Pat.

No. 4,370,368 teaches a plastic bottle comprising a thermoplastic comprising vinylidene chloride and an acrylic monomer and other vinyl monomers to obtain improved oxygen, moisture or water vapor barrier properties. The bottle can be made by casting an aqueous latex in a bottle mold, drying the cast latex or coating a preform with the aqueous latex prior to bottle formation. Kuhfuss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,400 teaches a poly(ester-amid) composition useful in a variety of applications including packaging materials. Maruhashi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,393,106 teaches laminated or plastic containers and methods for manufacturing the container. The laminate comprises a moldable plastic material in a coating layer. Smith et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,482,586 teaches a multilayer of polyester article having good oxygen and carbon dioxide barrier properties containing a polyisophthalate polymer. Walles, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,740,258 and 4,615,914 teaches that plastic containers can be treated, to improve barrier properties to the passage of organic materials and gases such as oxygen, by sulfonation of the plastic., 16365=The thermoplastic polyester is a high molecular weight material, but can contain a large variety of relatively low molecular weight compound, substantially less than 500 grams per mole. These compounds can be extractable into beverage within the container. These beverage extractable materials typically comprise impurities in feed streams of the diol or diacid used in making the polyester. Further, the extractable materials can comprise degradation by-products of the polymerization reaction, the preform molding process or the thermoforming blow molding process. Further, the extractable materials can contain residual diester, diol or diacid materials including methanol, ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, dimethyl terephthalic, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and esters or ethers thereof. Relatively low molecular weight oligomeric linear or cyclic diesters, triesters or higher esters made by reacting one mole of ethylene glycol with one mole of terephthalic acid may be present. These relatively low molecular oligomers can comprise two or more moles of diol combined with two or more moles of diacid. Schiono, Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, Vol. 17, pp. 4123-4127 (1979), John Wiley & Sons, Inc. discusses the separation and identification of PET impurities comprising poly(ethylene terephthalate) oligomers by gel permeation chromatography. Bartl et al., \"Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Chromatography for the Determination of Oligomers and Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Films\", Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 63, No. 20, Oct. 15, 1991, pp. 2371-2377, discusses experimental supercritical fluid procedures for separation and identification of a lower oligomer impurity from polyethylene terephthalate films.}",
