In the above-described embodiments, facsimile is transmitted immediately after the registration, for each data set designated by a piece of OMR sheet. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and image of the original may be transmitted each time one page of the original is read. Furthermore, in case of a plurality of groups are to be transmitted each containing an OMR sheet and documents, all groups may be successively registered, so that after the registration of all the groups, facsimile of each group may be separately and sequentially transmitted to a destination designated by the OMR sheet for each group. In this case, at the time of the registration, storage address of each group in storage device 6 and the facsimile number of the destination may be temporarily stored in memory 9, so that at the time of facsimile transmission, data can be directly read from the stored address of storage device 6. Execution of the program having the above-described flow chart in CPU 1 enables transmission of the image signal of the data just registered in storage device 6",
