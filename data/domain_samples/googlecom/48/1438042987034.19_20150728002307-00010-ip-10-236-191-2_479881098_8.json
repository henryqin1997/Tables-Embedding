A Desktop Management Interface (DMI) has been defined by the Desktop Management Task Force, MIS JF2-51, 2111 N.E. 25th Avenue, Hillsboro, Oreg. 97124. DMI is a local interface between management applications that manipulate information on components, e.g., physical or logical entities in a computer system, and the components. For a detailed description of DMI, see the Desktop Management Interface Specification, Version 1.0, Apr. 29, 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 77737=In one embodiment of this invention, as indicated above, the client application is a Windows 3.1 application, and remote RPC command modules 515 and 525 are executable modules while component management APIs 512 and 522 are dynamically linked libraries. The invention was implemented using the EZ-RPC compiler provided by NobleNet, Inc., 337 Turnpike Rd., Southboro, Mass. 01772 and related tools available from NobleNet, Inc. to generate a portion of modules 515 and 525.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The embodiments of the invention described above are only illustrative of the principles of this invention. In view of this disclosure, those skilled in the art can implement a variety of application programming interfaces and the message transfer RPC commands to eliminate the problems associated with using RPCs over heterogeneous networks. The use of the single RPC command over heterogeneous networks eliminates the problems associated with conventional RPCs and a variety of versions of one or more APIs on the heterogeneous network. In one embodiment of this invention, as indicated above, the client application is a Windows 3.1 application, and remote RPC command modules 515 and 525 are executable modules while component management APIs 512 and 522 are dynamically linked libraries. The invention was implemented using the EZ-RPC compiler provided by NobleNet, Inc., 337 Turnpike Rd., Southboro, Mass. 01772 and related tools available from NobleNet, Inc. to generate a portion of modules 515 and 525. In another embodiment, remote RPC command modules 515 and 525 support operations over a plurality of transport stacks within network stacks 516 and 526 for example transport stacks that support the TCP/IP and SPX protocols. This allows client RPC command module 515 to communicate with server RPC command modules on both similar and different network transport protocols. In this embodiment, remote RPC command module 515, for example, includes a particular executable module for each transport protocol stack. Remote client application 511",
