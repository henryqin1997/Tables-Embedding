    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64959=The torsion bars 156, 158, 160 and 162 are thin membrane flexures which are used to connect separate elements. Suitable materials for the twisting flexures would be silicon nitride, polysilicon, or single crystal silicon. The thickness of the flexures may be as small as approximately 1000 \u212b or as large as 100 \u03bcm. The particular choice of thickness depends on the required switching time. Silicon nitride films and polysilicon films are believed to have excellent resistance to cyclic fatigue. Because the torsion bars are only twisted within the elastic limits of the material, a particular movement by the actuators to be described below produces the same mirror position. When the torsion bars are in the relaxed condition, the micromirror 150 lies parallel to the fixed portion of the micromirror substrate 152., 78266=The mover 196 is coupled to the micromirror 190 by a mirror drive rod 206 and a thin membrane flexure 208. Similarly, the mover 198 is connected to the frame 194 by a frame drive rod 210 and a pair of thin membrane flexures 212. The thin membrane flexures 208 and 212 are substantially identical to the torsion bars 156, 158, 160 and 162 described with reference to the embodiment of FIG. 7. The membrane flexures are formed on the upper surfaces of the rods 206 and 210. While not clearly shown in FIG. 13, additional membrane flexures are formed along the lower surfaces of the movers to attach the movers to the drive rods 206 and 210. Again, the material may be silicon nitride or polysilicon having a film thickness of approximately 1000 \u212b. The interlocking pattern of a hinge that connects the frame 194 to a support member 222, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, allows the hinge to be loaded in both compression and tension. That is, forces can be applied to the two sides of the hinge which tend to pull the two sides of the hinge apart, and forces can be applied to the hinge which tend to push the two sides of the hinge together. The illustrated hinge includes a T-shaped protrusion element 218 that operates well when the hinge is loaded under compression and includes a second protrusion element 220 that operates well when the hinge is loaded under tension., 76933=FIGS. 13-16 illustrate another example of a micromirror design that can be used with the invention. In this embodiment, one side of a micromirror 190 is supported relative to a substrate 192 by a frame 194. The structure of the micromirror may be identical to that described above. That is, the micromirror may be formed of single crystal silicon having a thickness of approximately 100 microns, with a thin coating (e.g., 2000 \u212b) of reflective material, such as gold. The micromirror is a dual axis device. The embodiment includes two movers 196 and 198 which move in parallel directions. However, other embodiments are contemplated. For example, the movers may be connected to the micromirror 190 such that the micromirrors follow perpendicular paths. In another embodiment, there is a single mover that can be displaced in perpendicular directions, depending upon the applications of electrostatic forces., 57334=FIG. 4 illustrates a number of relevant characteristics. Most notably, there is a range of module sizes which allow the largest port count. For large spacings between the optical beams (k=8), switch sizes of over 3000\ufffd3000 can be achieved with modules that are between two and seven collimators wide. This geometry allows a three-fold increase in the port count relative to the, geometry shown in FIG. 1. The plots of FIG. 4 also show the importance of packing the beams as close as possible. By reducing the beam spacing to three times the largest waist or approximately 4.2 times the minimum waist, 11000\ufffd11000 port switches appear possible. It also appears that it would be better to use modules that are five to fifteen collimators wide in this case. However, it should be noted that the plots of FIG. 4 are only meant to be approximations and that the plots are dependent on the width of the composite mirrors, the angular range of the micromirrors, and the switch geometry., 65837=In FIG. 8, it can be seen that the micromirror substrate 152 is coupled to a mover substrate 164. The means for coupling the two substrates is not critical to the invention. In FIG. 8, a silicon beam 166 is connected to a pair of intermediate layers 168 and 170. However, other mechanisms for attaching the substrates may be employed. The mirror 150 may have a thickness of approximately 100 microns. As previously noted, the mirror curvature is a significant concern because the beam path lengths are relatively long. For the 1000\ufffd1000 switch, the mirror radius of curvature needs to be greater than 11 m. Such a large radius of curvature is readily achievable because the mirror is relatively thick and is primarily comprised of single crystal silicon. A thin metal layer 172 is coated on the exposed surface of the silicon micromirror 150 to achieve the desired reflective properties. An acceptable metal is a gold film 172 having a maximum thickness of 2000 \u212b, so that the gold stress can be limited to less than 150 MPa for the mirror to have a curvature greater than 11 m. This stress control is straightforward when using many of the known deposition and annealing methods.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Referring again to FIG. 13, the operation of the mover 196 is generally identical to the operation of the mover 198. However, there is some additional complexity. The flexural connection between the mirror drive rod 206 and the micromirror 190 is more difficult, since the connection between the mover 196 and the micromirror 190 must allow some twisting as the micromirror is tilted with respect to the frame 194 and with respect to the substrate 192. A relieved section 232 along the mirror drive rod 206 facilitates bending as the micromirror is tilted. It should be noted that the micromirror rotation by the mover 196 should not be initiated while the frame 194, the micromirror 190 and the frame drive rod 210 are coplanar, as shown in FIG. 15, since the frame drive rod will interfere with movement of the frame 194. Consequently, the micromirror should be tilted before the initial movement of the mover 196. Preferably, the mover 196 is able to rotate the micromirror 190 at least 20\ufffd. More preferably, the rotation is at least 30\ufffd. When the mover 198 is in a rest position, the reflecting surface of the micromirror 190 lies parallel to the top surface of the mover. That is, the frame 194 and the micromirror are in the positions illustrated in FIG. 15. However, when the mover is energized by varying the voltage patterns along either or both of the",
