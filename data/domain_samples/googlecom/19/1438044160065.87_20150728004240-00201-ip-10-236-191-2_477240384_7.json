The system and method of the present invention dedicates one or more channels for transferring MPEG stills and utilizes hyperlinks to enable users to navigate within these stills in a similar manner to an Internet web page. Selections are hyperlinked to respective MPEG compressed video stills which provide further content or information. The MPEG stills may further include interactive programming which provides options for the user to select more information or purchase products as desired. Conclusion In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, interactive television system includes an 8 second latency. In this embodiment, the system stores a possible 400 different images, wherein these images may be assigned, for example, as four pages per advertiser for 100 advertisers. As mentioned above, each compressed video image comprises 20 kilobytes per still image, thus, 4 times 20 kilobytes is 80 kilobytes for each advertiser, times 100 advertisers equals 8 megabytes. In the preferred embodiment, the compressed video stills are preferably MPEG stills, preferably MPEG-2 compressed video stills. Also, in the preferred embodiment, the interactive television system includes a 4 Megabit per second (Mbit/sec) channel and transfer rate, which is equivalent to 0.5 Mbit/sec of data transfer. Each MPEG-2 compressed still image preferably comprises approximately 20 kilobytes. Thus, the interactive television system in the preferred embodiment is capable",
