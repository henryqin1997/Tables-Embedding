Concomitant with the emergence of this new communication medium, digital content providers have proliferated, providing online news, entertainment, games and all sorts of other content. As with other mass mediums, such as television, radio, and print publications, the entities that create such content seek to offset their expenses by selling advertising. With reference to the WWW, online advertising has become a multimillion dollar business, to the amount of approximately $300 million dollars in 1996., 120132=Additional examples of modification to the cursor include rendering the cursor as a baseball bat (on a site with sports information), a pink but otherwise standard-shaped pointer (on a site about the Pink Panther), a witch-on-a-stick to celebrate Halloween, the Statue of Liberty to celebrate the Fourth of July, etc. All of the foregoing cursor images could be enhanced with related animations, such as the bat hitting the ball.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, but that they are merely conceptual in nature. Thus, while there have been shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the disclosed invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto. The foregoing examples are not intended to suggest limited uses for this invention; to the contrary, the examples are intended to illustrate the wide range of uses for this invention. The collective creativity of the online advertising, art, design, commerce, content publishing, and related industries will develop many novel and unforeseen ways to use the present invention. The versatility of the present invention should not be regarded as a limitation on its scope. The present invention allows users to change cursor images; it also allows them to change them back. It may be desirable to revert the pointer to a previous or generic pointer image. Given the Fizzy Cola example above, if the page containing display data changes and there is no longer an advertisement for Fizzy, but rather an advertisement for its rival, Jazzy",
