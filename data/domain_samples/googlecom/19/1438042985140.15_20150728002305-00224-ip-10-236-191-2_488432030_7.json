No. 723,457l, filed Jun. 28, 1991, by Robert M. Wyman for FILTERS FOR LICENSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM., 98261=Some examples will illustrate potential uses for the row selector attribute. A customer may only want to pay for the use of a product during one or two months of the year; the product may be FORTRAN and the reason for this request may be that the company has a fairly stable set of FORTRAN subroutines that are given regular \"annual maintenance\" only during the months of May and June. To handle this customer's needs, the FORTRAN product would generate an application subcontext which would contain a value representing the month of the year. Then, a LURT table would be defined with twelve rows, one for each month of the year. In some column, probably column A, a negative one (-1) would be placed in each month except for May and June. These tow months would contain some positive number. The product use authorization would then have a LURDM field specifying a LURT for use to determine the units requirement, and would name this customer LURT table. The effect would be that the PUA could only be used during the months of May and June since negative one is interpreted by license managers to mean \"use not authorized.\" This mechanism could also be used to do \"time of day\" charging. Perhaps charging fewer units per use at night than during the day. Also, if a subcontext was used that contained a year value, a type of license would be provided that varied in its unit requirements as time passed. For instance, it might start by costing 10-units per use in 1991 but then cost one unit less every year as time passed, eventually getting to the point where the unit requirement was zero., 33669=Ser. No. 697,652, filed May 8, 1991, by Robert M. Wyman, for LICENSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM;, 76858=In the delegation field 48 is true, a license server 10 may distribute license units to multiple servers 13. A time limit may be imposed, i.e., units can be delegated to other hardware systems until they time out. Delegation allows an administrator to distribute units to improve response time and increase the resilience of the system. For example, the communication network 21 may include a satellite link to a remote facility where the local server 13 has a number of clients or users 16, in which case the calls to the server 13 would be completed much quicker than would be the case if calls had to be made to the server 10. Also, delegation may be used as a method of allocating licensed units within a budget for administrative purposes. Usually the delegation authorization is a feature that is priced by the issuer, i.e., a license granting 1000 units with delegation authorization is priced higher than without this authorization., 131415=In reference to the terminology used in describing the management interface, as well as the license management system in general, it is helpful to note that the documentation conventions, data declarations, macro declarations, etc., for the object management used in one embodiment of the invention are according to the standards set forth in OSI Object Management API Specification, Version 2.0, X.400 API Association and X/Open Company Limited, 24 Aug. 1990, a published document., 174607=The license units requirements determination method or LURDM element is shown in syntax diagram in FIG. 34. The combination-permitted field indicates whether conforming license managers are permitted to combine together into a common pool the units from different product use authorizations if those produce use authorizations have the same product record value; for example, if combination is permitted and a single license manager discovers in its database two 500-unit authorizations for the use of DEC Cobol, the license manager would be permitted to combined these two authorizations into a logical grant of 1000 units. The overdraft-limit modifies the behavior of a conforming license management facility in those cases where it is found that there are zero or fewer license units available for use at the time of a request for the allocation or consumption of additional license units. Operation of overdraft is different depending upon whether allocative, or consumptive style is being used. In using with allocative style, an allocation is granted even though the remaining units are zero or less, up to the overdraft-limit. In using with consumptive style, the license is authorized to accumulate a negative balance of license units, up to the overdraft-limit. Overdraft-logging-required indicates whether all license grants which are the result of overdraft use must cause a log record to be generated. When the allocation-size field is non-zero, then all unit allocations and delegations must be made in sizes which are whole number multiples of the allocations-size value. Lurdm-kind identifies the method by which license unit requirements will be calculated once the requirement for an allocation has been discovered, the permitted alternatives being (a) LURT which specifies that license unit requirements are to be determined by lookup in the LURT which is associated with the current license, (b) Constant which specifies that license unit requirements are constant for all platforms on which the licensed product or product feature may run, and (c) Private-LURDM which specifies that license unit requirements are to be determined by the licensed product, not by the license management facility. The named-lurt-id specifies the name of the LURT table to be used in determining license unit requirements if the LURDM-kind is specified as LURT; if the LURDM-kind is specified as LURT and no table is explicitly named, the name of the table to be used is constructed from the issuer name on the product use authorization. Lurdm-value specifies the LURT column to be used when LURDM-kind=LURT; however, when LURDM-kind=Constant, the Lurdm-value field contains the precise number of units to be allocated or consumed. Default-unit-requirement specifies the unit requirement value to be used when the appropriate LURT does not have a row corresponding to the appropriate platform ID; when specified on a product use authorization with Style=Allocative, the context template will change to Process+Product-- Specific and the Duration will change to Transaction in cases of unrecognized Platform ID's., 161015=An issuer delegation is typically issued by a producer 28 and authorizes the named issuer 25 to issue licenses for products produced by the producer. An issuer delegation syntax diagram is shown in FIG. 23. Delegated-issuer-name identifies the name which must appear in the Issuer field of any Product Use Authorization generated using the License Issuer Delegation. Delegated-product-id identifies the products whose licenses the names issuer is authorized to issue. Delegated-units-granted, if specified, indicates that the use of this IssuerDelegation is to be managed in the style of a consumptive license; the value of this attribute gives the number of units for which license documents may be generated (i.e., if granted 1000 units by a Producer, an Issuer can only issue 1000 units.) Template-authorization provides a \"template\" Product Use Authorization whose attribute values must be included on any Product Use Authorization generated using this IssuerDelegation; in the case of attributes which have a scalar value (i.e., Version, Release Date, etc.), the Issuer may issue licenses with more restrictive values than those specified on the Template Authorization. Sub-license-permitted indicates whether the Issuer identified on this IssuerDelegation may issue an Issuer Delegation for the delegated-product-id., 106059=Generally, a license to use a software product is prices according to how much benefit can be gained from using the product, which is related to the capacity of the machine it will run on. A license for unlimited use on a large platform such as a mainframe, where there could be thousands of potential users at terminals, would be priced at a high level. Here the style would be \"allocative\", the context template=\"node\", the duration=\"assignment\" and the LURDM may be \"Column A\"--the units, however, would be large, e.g., 1000. At the other end of the scale would be a license for use on a single personal computer, where the field values would be the same as for the mainframe except the units would be \"1\". If a customer wanted to make the product available on the mainframe but yet limit the cost, he could perhaps get a license that would allow only five users at any given time to use the product; here the fields in the product use authorization would be: units=5; style=allocative; context template=process; duration=transaction; LURDM=constant, 1,-unit. This would still be priced fairly high since a large number of users may actually use the product if a session of use was short. A lower price would probably be available for a personal use license where only five named persons could use the product, these being identified only in the license server 10, not named by the license issuer 25. Here the fields in the product use authorization are: units=5; style=allocative; context template=user name; duration=transaction; LURDM=constant, 1-unit., 183426=The product ID explicitly identifies the product which is the subject of the license data with which it is associated, with the syntax for ProductID being shown in FIG. 40. The version and release date fields provide a mechanism for defining which specific instances of the licensed product are described in the associated license data. The Producer field is a registered name which identifies the producer of the licensed feature; in the case of Group Names, the Producer is always also the Issuer of the group. The Product-name identifies a licensed software feature. The First-version identifies the earliest version of the product whose use is authorized. The Last-version identifies the latest version of the product whose use is authorized. The First-release-date identifies the earliest release of the product whose use is authorized. The Last-release-date identifies the latest release of the product whose use is authorized. Conforming license managers are required to interpret the contents of these fields in the most restrictive way possible. Thus, if a license is issued with Last-version=3,.0 and a Last-release-Date of 1 Jan. 1991, then the use of version 2.0 of the licensed product would be unauthorized if it has a release date of 2 Jan. 1991. If either a First-version or First-release-date is specified without a matching Last-version or Last-release-date, use of the produce is authorized for all versions or release dates following that specified. Similarly, if either a last-version or Last-release-date is specified without a matching First-version or First-release-date, use of the produce is assumed to be authorized for all versions or release dates prior to that specified. Issuers should typically only specify one of either First-version or First-release-date. This is the case since it is anticipated that these fields will typically refer to events which occurred prior to the moment of license data issuance. Thus, it should normally be possible for the issuer to state unambiguously with only one of these two fields which is the oldest implementation of the product that is to be authorized. The architecture does permit, however, both fields to be used in a single product authorization., 33350=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 722,840, filed Jun. 28, 1991, now abandoned.}",

Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well s other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to this description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments as fall within the true scope of the invention. Filters can also used in a request allocation, being specified in a request extension as explained above. That is, a filter is one of the optional items in a request extension. For example, if a user wanted to use a version of WordPerfect with French language extension, and there were version with and without on the network, his request allocation would have a request extension that specified a filter for \"French\" in the token field. In this manner, a product can describe itself more richly. The filter in the request extension can be a Required filter or a Preferred filter, meaning the feature such as \"French\" is either absolutely necessary, or merely the preferred. As an example, FIG. 46 shows how a filter may be constructed to identify \"All Product Use Authorizations issued by Digital for the Product `Amazing Graphics System` which contains a calling authorization for Digital's `Amazing Database` Product\".
