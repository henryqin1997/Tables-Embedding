Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference of Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2001), Utrecht, The Netherlands, October, 2001, 43379=According to a variation, a three-dimensional model of the surface of healthy femur 10 may be used and modified according to the two-dimensional images obtained by ultrasound scanning. An example of a method for deforming a three-dimensional model of the surface of a bone is described in documents \u201cIncorporating a Statistically Based Shape Model into a System for Computer-Assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery\u201d by M. Fleute, S. Lavallee, R. Julliard (Medical Image Analysis. 1999 September, 3(3): 209-222) and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0101966A1, published May 12, 2005. (The above cited documents being incorporated by reference in their entirety). As an example, the contour of femur 10 is determined for each two-dimensional image and the three-dimensional model of the femur is deformed to have it match the contours thus extracted from the two-dimensional images. Such an operation may be automatically performed by a computer. The three-dimensional model may be used to help the identification of the contour of femur 10 on the two-dimensional images, taking the three-dimensional model as a staring point for the search for the femur contour on the two-dimensional images., 25889=The present application claims priority to French Patent Application No. 05/50148 filed Jan. 18, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above mentioned patents, applications, and publications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. The embodiments of the present invention are shown and described for purposes of illustration only and not for purposes of limitation. While there have been shown, described, and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to several embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form and details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Substitutions of elements from one embodiment to another are also fully intended and contemplated. It is also to be understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, but that they are merely conceptual in nature. The invention is defined solely with regard to the claims appended hereto, and equivalents of the recitations therein. In operation, the bone holder having a third locatable element is used to statically position the bone, i.e., the third bone element during the reduction procedure. The advantage of the bone holder is that the third bone model can be generated without having to attach a locatable element to the third bone element. In another embodiment, the present invention provides for a computer assisted system in support of repairing a bone fracture. The system includes a first locatable",
