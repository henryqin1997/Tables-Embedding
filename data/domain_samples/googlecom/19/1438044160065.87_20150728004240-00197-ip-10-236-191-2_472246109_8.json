Further, the information for the laboratory may not necessarily include the trimming information. (ii) The imprinting of the mark m1 (m2) in the film `F` in the aforementioned embodiment is not always necessary. (i) The IC card `B` need not be of the general type, but may have a configuration and a format specially designed for the camera system. Also, the IC card `B` may be of the type incorporating a microcomputer, a battery and a RAM, or may be the EEPROM having no microcomputer nor battery. The present invention further discloses the following embodiments: In the above-described embodiment, the IC card attaching portion X1 is disposed at the inside portion (between the back lid 13 and the film `F`) of the back lid 13. However, the present invention is not limited hereto. For example, as indicated by a broken line in FIG. 1b, an IC card attaching portion X2 may be provided in front of the film `F`, or alternately, an IC card attaching portion X3 may be provided inclinedly downwardly of the attaching portion for the film cartridge 7 in the camera body 1. With the former arrangement the IC card `B` may be detached only after the film `F` is unloaded; whereas, with the latter arrangement, like",
