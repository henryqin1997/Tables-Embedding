    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33400=Unlike the case of the InGaAs/GaAs layers mentioned earlier, the indirect bandgap of Si and Si1-x Gex precludes the use of cathodoluminescence to image misfit dislocations over large areas. It is therefore necessary to use another technique, such as electron beam induced current imaging (EBIC), X-ray topography or plan-view transmission electron microscopy (TEM). EBIC was judged unsuitable for these layers, since it has been shown that misfit dislocations in our films are only weakly electrically active and are very difficult to image using this technique. X-ray topography was also rejected because of the small growth areas involved and the presence of strain due to the oxide pattern. Thus, dislocation densities were measured using plan-view TEM and are the reciprocal of the average spacing between individual misfit dislocations. The dislocation spacings quoted below for the patterned wafer are average values from four TEM specimens with a total viewing area of approximately 200,000 \u03bcm2 split about evenly between large and small areas. Electron-transparent areas (100-150 \u03bcm diameter) were produced with a combination of mechanical thinning and Ar ion milling employing the technique described by Madden [Journal of Electron Microscopy Tech., 11, 161, 1989]. The best samples were carefully milled to transparency without creating a hole. A collage of TEM micrographs taken in an area similar to that shown discussed above was made. This area is at the end of a set of oxide fingers spaced about 10 \u03bcm apart adjacent to a large open area approximately 1 mm in diameter. The misfit dislocation spacing in the large area was noted to vary from 0.25-1.0 \u03bcm, whereas the spacing in the small areas of the selective wafers is greater than 20 \u03bcm. The misfit spacing measured on an unpatterned Si control wafer (same buffer layer and 2000 \u212b thick SiGe film) was close to that measured in the large areas of the selective wafers, 0.5-1.0 \u03bcm. The misfit dislocations are seen to propagate from the large area into the small areas and the fingers. Threading dislocations connecting the misfit segments to the free surface were observed only at one or the other of the two sidewalls. This observation is consistent with the idea that these dislocations nucleated at one sidewall and propagated to the other., 25818=In the case of deposition when nitride is present, there are conditions where Si deposition will be selective and SiGe deposition is non-selective with only the temperature and gases since Si is deposited at a higher temperature than. For example, Si is usually deposited between 800 and 1000 degrees C., and SiGe is usually deposited between 600 and 700 degrees C. For SiGe if a lower temperature is used it is less likely that misfit dislocations will form in., 31565=The Si and Si1-x Gex films in this study were grown by LRP which is a CVD technique that employs rapid changes in wafer temperature to initiate and terminate film growth [Applied Physics Letters, 47,721, 1985]. Wafers with oxide patterns were prepared from <100>-oriented Si substrates covered with 3000 \u212b of thermal oxide. Selective growth of Si and SiGe was achieved using the same growth procedure reported in our previous work for blanket layers grown on unpatterned wafers [3rd Int. Sym. on Si MBE: Alternative Growth Methods, Strasbourg, France, May 30-June 2, 1989]. After a 1200 \ufffd C. hydrogen prebake for 30 seconds, a 1000 \u212b thick Si buffer layer was grown selectively at 1000\ufffd C. using dichlorosilane. This was followed by the in-situ deposition of a Si0.8 Ge0.2 layer approximately 2000 \u212b thick at 625 \ufffd C. using dichlorosilane and germane. Both layers were grown using a hydrogen carrier gas at a pressure of about 6.5 torr. Layer thicknesses and compositions were measured with 2.2 Mev 4 He+ Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) and cross-section transmission electron microscopy (XTEM). The selective growth of pure Si and pure Ge layers using dichlorosilane and germane has been reported previously for a variety of growth temperatures and pressures. For SiGe deposition in the present study, no deposition was observed on the oxide by optical microscopy. In addition, X-ray analysis during plan-view transmission electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy revealed no evidence of Ge on the oxidized portions of the samples. Undercutting of the oxide sidewalls and roughness at the oxide edges resulting from the 1200\ufffd C. H2 prebake may play a role in the nucleation of misfit dislocations in the selective films., 20673=1) each wafer received a standard pre-clean at a pressure of 250 Torr in a H2 atmosphere at 1200 degrees C. for 20 seconds (this is a very high temperature that would not be used in the manufacture of a semiconductor device)., 20929=2) for the selective deposition of epitaxial silicon, that layer is deposited in a reactor with a mixed gas flow of 20 cc/min flow of DCS (diclorosilane) and 5 liters/min of H2 at a pressure of 6.4 Torr and a temperature of 1000 degrees C. for 3 min to deposit about 2500 A of Si., 30304=Recently Fitzgerald, et al.[Journal of Applied Physics,65,2220,1989], in studying InGaAs/GaAs strained layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy, have shown that the misfit dislocation density formed during film growth is reduced when the growth area is reduced. As a result, films can be grown fully strained to much greater thicknesses on small areas than on large areas. The present inventors show that this phenomenon can be used to gain insight into the kinetics of misfit dislocation formation in strained layers. Similar area-dependent reduction in dislocation density was observed in Si0.8 Ge0.2 /Si strained layers grown by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique limited reaction processing (LRP). In contrast to the work of Fitzgerald, et al., whose small areas were created by film deposition on mesas produced by etching trenches in the GaAs substrate, the small areas in this study were produced by the selective deposition of Si and Si1-x Gex in the exposed Si regions on oxide-patterned wafers. For a CVD technique, growth on mesa structures is probably not an effective means of limiting growth area since deposition is expected on the sides, as well as the tops, of the mesas.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The selective deposition of Si and Si0.8 Ge0.2 layers in the exposed Si regions on oxide-patterned <100>-oriented wafers using LRP has been demonstrated. A reduction in dislocation density is evident when growth takes place in small areas defined by the oxide pattern when compared to adjacent large areas. These results may be of practical importance for the production of Si/Si1-x Gex devices and of academic interest as a means to study misfit dislocation formation in CVD-grown strained layers. An area dependent reduction in dislocation density is evident in our Si1-x Gex /Si films, yet there is no obvious dominant nucleation source. Since, <100>-oriented Si substrates are dislocation free, threading defects from the substrate are not responsible for the nucleation of misfit dislocations in these films. Even though there is evidence for heterogeneous nucleation of misfit dislocations associated with the oxide sidewalls, the fact that the unpatterned control wafer has a similar dislocation density to that observed in the large area on the patterned wafer suggests that another nucleation mechanism is dominant. Homogeneous surface half-loop nucleation is unlikely, since the strain in a commensurate Si0.8 Ge0.2 alloy is only 0.9%. This value is well below the theoretical value of 2-6% strain thought to be necessary to initiate such events. Therefore, as yet unidentified nucleation processes, perhaps in combination with dislocation multiplication (via the Hagen-Strunk mechanism), are responsible for misfit dislocation formation in our Si1-x Gex films.
