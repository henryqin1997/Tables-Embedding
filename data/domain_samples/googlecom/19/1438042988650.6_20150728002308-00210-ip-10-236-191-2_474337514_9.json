By total gas is meant the gas which is returned to the reactor to fluidise the bed together with any gas used to assist in the operation of the injection means, e.g. atomising gas., 74375=The droplet size of the liquid is influenced by a number of factors in particular in the gas-induced atomiser nozzles by the ratio of the liquid to atomising gas supplied to the nozzle and the size and configuration of the atomising chamber. A desirable liquid droplet size for a gas-induced atomiser nozzle is from about 50 micron to about 1000 microns. In the case of the liquid spray nozzles the liquid droplet size is influenced primarily by the pressure drop in the nozzle and the size and configuration of the outlets. A desired liquid droplet size for the liquid spray nozzle is from about 2000 microns to about 4000 microns. Such droplets can be generated, for example, by disruption of a liquid jet by the motion of the solid particles forming the bed., 28434=This is a division of application Ser.
