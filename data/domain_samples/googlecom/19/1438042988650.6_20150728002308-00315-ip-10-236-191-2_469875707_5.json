    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22403=Referring now to FIG. 1, it can be seen that the security label 12 comprises a transparent sheet 13 which includes parallel rows of regularly spaced cylindrical lenticules 14 shown greatly enlarged. The spatial frequency of the lenticules 14 is preferably between 1000 and 2000 lines per inch. In registration with the lenticules 14 are rows of colored lines that are not shown. Optical effects such as the pattern designated by the P at 16 are introduced by irregularly spaced rows of lenticules and corresponding colored lines which, when viewed against the surrounding background area having regularly spaced rows of lenticules and corresponding colored lines, provide a means for visually verifying the authenticity of the security label 12. The security label 12 is described in considerable detail in previously mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 262,120., 16660=More recently, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 262,120 filed in May, 1981 in the name of Paul. F. Sullivan and entitled \"Verification Device\", a novel anti-counterfeiting security label that is virtually counterfeit and simulation proof has been provided. The security label in this disclosure comprises a transparent material with parallel lenticules in the form of cylindrical lenses on one side and parallel colored lines on the other. The lenticules and lines are in perfect registration so that there are one or two colored lines behind each lenticule. The spatial frequency of the lenticules ranges between 1,000 and 2,000 lenticules per inch. Customized logos or emblems are produced by shifting the position of the lenticules and thus the colored line or lines relative to each other within the body of the logo. Variation in the spacing of the lenticules provides a means for producing a variety of visual effects that are observable with the naked eye. Although this security label requires no machine verifier, certain aspects of its structure are compatible with machine sensing devices.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The methods inherent in the use of the device 10 of the invention are within the scope of the invention and are particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that other changes may be made in the above-described embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. In the foregoing manner, means have been provided for measuring the angular separation between successive predetermined ones of the principle maxima of the diffraction pattern and for determining the spatial frequency of the lenticules 14 of the security label 12 whereby the authenticity of the security label 12 can be verified by comparing the measured spatial frequency of its lenticules with a predetermined standard spatial frequency. In this manner, intervals between the successive pulses from the photodetector 70 or the frequency of the pulse train can be determined because the optical geometry of the device 10, the laser wavelength and the angular rate of the polygon scanner 50 are all fixed and known. Thus the number displayed by the digital readout is directly correlatable with the spatial frequency of the lenticules 14 on the security label 12. After termination of the pulse count, the output from the one-shot 90 resets",
