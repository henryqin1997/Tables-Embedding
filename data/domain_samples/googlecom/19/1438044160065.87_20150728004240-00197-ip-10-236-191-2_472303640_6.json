    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{123794=Co-Cr-Ta alloy was used for the magnetic layer 22 with a large coercivity, and the magnetic layer 24 was formed of the Fe-M-X alloy. The present inventor formed the Fe-M-X alloy layers of the afore-mentioned combinations between \"M\" and \"X\", Cu-Ag-Me alloy layers of the afore-mentioned combinations between Cu, Ag and \"Me\" and Co-base alloy layers expressed as Co-M-B of the afore-mentioned combinations between Co, B and \"M\". The present inventor evaluated the crystal structure and magnetic properties of the Fe-M-X alloy layers, the Cu-Ag-Me alloy layers and the Co-M-B alloy layers. However, the crystal structure and the magnetic properties were not dependent on the composition of the alloy. For this reason, description is hereinbelow focused on Fe-Ta-C alloy, Cu-Ag-Si alloy and the Co-Zr-B alloy. The Co-Cr-Ta alloy was grown to 100 nanometers thick on substrates at 100 degrees in centigrade, and the coercivity of the Co-Cr-Ta alloy was 12000 oersted., 86223=The present inventor measured the saturation magnetic flux density and the magnetic permeability of the Fe-Ta-C alloy layers treated with heat as described above, and plotted the saturation magnetic flux density and the magnetic permeability in terms of the composition of the Fe-Ta-C alloy layers in FIG. 19. Dots represented the Fe-Ta-C alloy layers having the saturation magnetic flux density equal to or greater than 1.2 teslas and the magnetic permeability equal to or greater than 1000, and the Fe-Ta-C alloy layers represented by open circles were less than 1.2 teslas or less than 1000 in the magnetic permeability., 87897=Dots represented the Fe-Hf-C alloy layers having the saturation magnetic flux density equal to or greater than 1.2 teslas and the magnetic permeability equal to or greater than 1000, and the Fe-Hf-C alloy layers represented by open circles were less than 1.2 teslas or less than 1000 in the magnetic permeability., 38981=Another magnetic superlattice structure has been also reported by D. H. Mosca et. al. in \"Oscillatory interlayer coupling and giant magnetoresistance in Co/Cu multilayers,\" Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, vol. 94, pages L1 to L5, 1991. D. H. Mosca et. al. proposed a magnetic superlattice structure that consisted of ferromagnetic Co thin layers and non-magnetic Cu thin layers. The prior art magnetic superlattice structure also achieved a giant magnetoresistance., 42318=Various approaches have been proposed to fix the magnetization direction in the fixed layer of the spin valve. One of the approaches is to sandwich a non-magnetic spacer layer between two ferromagnetic metallic layers different in coercivities as proposed by A. Chaiken et. al. in \"Low-field spin-valve magnetoresistance in Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches\", Applied Physics Letters, vol. 59, No. 2, pages 240 to 242, 1991. The paper proposes the sandwiched structure consisting of the ferromagnetic layer with a small coercivity (Fe) and the ferromagnetic layer with a large coercivity (Co) intervened by the non-magnetic spacer layer (Cu). The ferromagnetic layer of Fe, the non-magnetic layer of Cu and the ferromagnetic layer of Co form in combination a spin valve., 38307=A magnetic superlattice structure is an attractive candidate for a giant magnetoresistance. A magnetic superlattice structure has been reported by A. Barthelemy et. al. in \"Magnetic and transport properties of Fe/Cr superlattices (invited)\", Journal of Applied Physics, volume 67, No. 9, pages 5908 to 5913, May 1, 1990. Ferromagnetic thin layers of Fe are alternated with non-magnetic thin Cr layers so as to form a magnetic superlattice structure, where each thin layer is several angstroms to tens angstroms thick. The superlattice structure achieves the relative resistance change of rate of ten percent due to the magnetoresistance effect., 41178=In order to overcome the problem inherent in the prior art magnetic superlattice structure, a spin valve has been proposed. The spin valve has been, by way of example, proposed in Japanese Patent Publication of Unexamined Application of Nos. 2-61572, 4-358310 and 6-60336. The spin valve is formed from two magnetic layers isolated from each other by using a non-magnetic spacer layer. The non-magnetic layer is thick enough to prevent the two magnetic layers from the exchange-coupling. The magnetization direction in one of the two ferromagnetic layers is constrained or maintained in its direction, and the magnetization direction of the other ferromagnetic layer is free to rotate in response to an externally applied magnetic field. The former ferromagnetic layer is called as a \"fixed layer\", and the latter ferromagnetic layer as a \"free layer\". The relative angle of the magnetization between two ferromagnetic layers is variable through the turning motion of the magnetization of the free layer, and, accordingly, the variation of the relative angle changes the resistance of the spin valve., 43104=Another approach has been proposed by B. Dieny et. al. in \"Giant magnetoresistance in soft ferromagnetic multilayers\", Physical Review B, vol. 43, No. 1, pages 1297 to 1300, 1991. B. Dieny proposed to form the spin valve by using soft ferromagnetic layers sandwiching a non-magnetic spacer layer, and one of the soft ferromagnetic layers is accompanied with an antiferromagnetic layer. The anti-ferromagnetic layer gives an exchange-biased magnetic field due to unidirectional anisotropy, and the exchange-biased magnetic field fixes the magnetization direction of the soft ferromagnetic layer adjacent to the antiferromagnetic layer. The other soft ferromagnetic layer is isolated magnetically from the fixed ferromagnetic layer by the non-magnetic spacer layer, and the magnetization direction of the other soft ferromagnetic layer can be freely rotated its direction under the application of an external magnetic field., 89240=Dots represented the third samples having the saturation magnetic flux density equal to or greater than 1.2 teslas and the magnetic permeability equal to or greater than 1000, and the third samples represented by open circles were less than 1.2 teslas or less than 1000 in the magnetic permeability., 55569=The Fe-base magnetic alloy expressed as Fe-M-X has a relatively large saturation magnetic flux density, and forms a soft magnetic thin film. Japanese Patent Publication of Unexamined Application No. 3-132004 discloses a Fe-Ta-C soft magnetic layer having a large saturation magnetic flux density. The soft magnetic material used in the multilayered magnetic structure according to the present invention preferably has the saturation magnetic flux density equal to or greater than 1.2 teslas. If the element \"M\" and the element \"X\" are out of the range between 2 percent and 13 percent by atom and the range between 0.5 percent and 18 percent by atom, the saturation magnetic flux density becomes less than 1.2 teslas, and the small saturation magnetic flux density results in a small change rate of magnetoresistance ratio of the order of 5 percent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. When the Co-based magnetic crystalline layers are inserted between the Fe-base soft magnetic crystalline layer or layers and the non-magnetic spacer layer, the magnetoresistance ratio is enlarged. The spin valve type multilayered magnetic structure is not dependent on how the magnetization direction of one of the magnetic layers is fixed. As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the spin-valve type multilayered magnetic structure achieves a large magnetoresistance ratio equal to or greater than 10 percent by virtue of the Fe-base soft magnetic crystalline layer having the saturation magnetic flux density equal to or greater than 1.2 teslas and the mean grain size equal to or less than 30 nanometers.
