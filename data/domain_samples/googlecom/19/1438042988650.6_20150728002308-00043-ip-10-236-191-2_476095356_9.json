    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37591=FIG. 2 is a top view of a two stylet embodiment of an ablation catheter of FIG. 1 used to deliver power from the preferred method and apparatus of the present invention. The flexible catheter 300, attached to handle 302, has a terminal stylet guide 304 with two stylets 306 and 308. The handle has stylet sleeve cap 356 and electrode cap 354. The handle is also connected to a RF power connector 303 to be discussed in detail hereinafter. Also shown is a connection for a thermoconnector 307. The portions of the catheter 300 leading from the handle 302 to the stylet guide 304 can optionally have a graduated stiffness. For example, the catheter can be designed to be more stiff near the handle and more flexible near the tip or any other stiffness profile desired. The catheter can be constructed of an inner slotted stainless steel tube with an outer flexible sleeve such as is described in copending application Ser. No. 790,648 filed Aug. 11, 1991, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. It can also be made of a coiled or braided wire to which an outer sleeve is bonded. The stylet of FIG. 2 is described in the copending application Ser. No. 08/012,370 filed Feb. 2, 1993., 41585=The limits on the operation of the circuitry, aside from operator settings and frequency and power maximums, are determined by sensors 241, 242 and 243 associated with the stylet guide 16 and sensors 37, 38 and 39 associated with the rectal probe 16. The processing of the outputs from the sensors 241, 242, 243 and 37, 38 and 39 are identical as shown by the isolation devices 231 to 236 and the temperature measurements 221-226, respectively. The isolation device 231-236 involves a 1500 voltage isolation circuit which in a preferred embodiment is a Burr-Brown isolation device ISO 122JP. The output from this isolation device 231-236 is fed through cold junction compensators 271-276 to the temperature measurement 221-226 circuits and to temperature cut-off circuits 211-216. Each of the isolation devices 231-236 are identical as are the temperature measurement devices 221-226. Each cold junction compensation structure 271-276 provides absolute temperature measurement readings in degree Celsius. Although the circuitry is the same for each of the temperature cut-off circuits 211-216, each of these cut-off circuits have a different temperature limit or may have a different limit. Based upon physiological evaluation to insure against excess overheating in the environment of the tissue being destroyed and in adjacent organs, the following limits have been set to provide protection to the patient. The sensor cut-off for circuits 211 and 212 correspond to the sensors 241 and 243 and have a setting of 90\ufffd C. as a cut-off To illustrate, a temperature of 60\ufffd C. is sufficient to provide for tissue protein dephasing which provides for the destruction of the tissue. The temperature in the guide 16, as detected by sensor 242 is set by the cut-off circuit 213 and a temperature of 45\ufffd C. This insures that no damage occurs to the urethra in which the guide is placed. In other words, the material inside the urethra will not be destroyed if the temperature is maintained at 45\ufffd or less. It must be noted that if any one of the cutoff circuits operate, then the entire system is automatically shut-off regardless of any operator decisions. Thus, if either the sensors 241 or 243 reach 90\ufffd C. or if sensor 242 reaches 45\ufffd the device will shut off., 18472=This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser. No. 07/929,638 filed Aug. 12, 1992 now abandoned and Ser. No. 08/012,370 filed Feb. 2, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,675 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously, numerous additional variations and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. For purposes of treating BPH the method of treatment using the power delivery system of the FIGS. 3 and 4 involves the operator applying an energy level of between 5 and 7 watts for 3 minutes, followed by repositioning of the stylet or stylets to other areas of treatment and the subsequent reapplication for an additional 3 minutes of the same range of energy. The number of applications is determined by the extent and the location of the tissue to be ablated. During each operation, temperature cut-off limitation circuitry affords the necessary protection due to any unexpected rise in temperature and the temperature limitations assure control of the environment immediately adjacent the tissues being treated as well as the urethra and any adjacent organs. The protection of the adjacent organs with respect to temperature rise is provided by the temperature cut-off limits associated with sensors 37, 38 and 39. Tissue ablation in the desired area of treatment, in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, results from the precise application by way of the stylets of low power substantially constant energy delivery resulting in minimal effect on the adjoining healthy tissue and",
