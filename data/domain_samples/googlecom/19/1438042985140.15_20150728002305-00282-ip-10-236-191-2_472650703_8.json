    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82159=The equations and methods of multi-flux models, including the four-flux and Kubelka-Munk two-flux models may be found in V\ufffdlz, H. G., \u201cIndustrial Color Testing\u201d, VCH, Weinheim Germany, 1995, among others. These models do not incorporate fluorescence or other spectral transformations; they only model absorption and scattering phenomena., 83590=A refinement of (6) was promulgated in 1994, but is not yet in widespread use in industry. Analogous definitions exist for other colorimetric systems, and specialized methods for evaluating color difference exist in specific industries., 33207=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application (s) No(s).: Application No(s).: 60/069,275 filing date Dec. 11, 1997., 286137=The drawing and the related description are only intended to illustrate the inventive concept. The details of the invention may vary within the scope of the claims. Therefore the possible combinations of this invention with prior art are many and varied. For example, the measurement of color or composition profile may be combined with art for separation of MD- and CD-components of variability, such as by deploying measurement devices at each of plural locations across the web, or by employing light pipes from a measurement device to convey light to and from each of plural locations across the web. The directional illumination or directional light detection may be combined with art for illumination or detection in an annulus or in one or more arcs. The characterization of the effect of process changes may be combined with prior art for process model identifications. The measurement of reflected light may be combined with prior art for alternating sample backings of different reflectance. The control of color or composition may be combined with prior art for optimal control, especially using methods for constrained optimization. Furthermore, the control of color or composition according to this invention may be combined with art for control of properties in the cross-machine direction, such as disclosed in WO 98/32916. Similarly, the set of calibration samples shown in FIG. 1 with broken lines used in determining the factors and coefficients for estimating properties from the emissivity and/or transmissivity measurements or from a calculated apparent reflectance and/or transmittance and/or absorbance may be provided within the apparatus for regular recalibration, or may be furnished externally from time to time for intermittent recalibration. Additionally or alternatively, calibration samples may be measured using other means, and those measurements or factors and coefficients determined therefrom may be supplied to the means for determining properties from the emissivity or transmissivity measurements. The samples may be chosen with properties which facilitate the calibration process, for example by optimizing the amount of information which can be deduced by the statistical method used in determining the factors and coefficients. Suitable techniques are given for example in Box, G., and Draper, N., \u201cEmpirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces\u201d, Wiley, New York, 1987, among others. Moreover, similar techniques can be applied to characterizing the effect of manipulating process variables on measured properties, in that optimally selected sets of process disturbances can be used which facilitate the identification and parametrization of said process effects., 141389=Methods whereby source metamerism and observer metamerism can be avoided in non-fluorescent materials are well-known. Most of these involve specifying, measuring, and controlling the reflectance spectrum of the material, rather than merely a set of colorimetric quantities. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,038 uses a least-squares approximation of the reflectance spectrum, while Shakespeare, J. and Shakespeare, T., \u201cAn Optimizing Color Controller\u201d, proc. TAPPI 1997 PCE&l at Birmingham Ala., 127-135, TAPPI Press, Atlanta USA, 1997 use a reflectance model to optimize colorimetric quantities in addition to the reflectance. U.S. Pat. No. 4,565,444 discloses methods whereby measurements of color are made across the entire width of a sheet without scanning by means of light pipes, or by providing illumination and detection across the entire sheet. U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,809 discloses a similar idea to U.S. Pat. No. 4,565,444, but implements it differently. U.S. Pat. No. 5,082,529 also discloses measurement and control of reflectance, adding Kubelka-Munk-type adjustments for infinite stack calculations., 184580=A further advantage is that the measurement of emissivity and transmissivity allows a greater variety of signal processing techniques to be employed than is possible for prior art spectroscopic or spectrophotometric spectral measurements. Obviously, the spectrum measured using a single illumination condition can be subjected to similar techniques as those used in prior art. Equally, the spectrum of measurements at a single detector band made under each illumination condition may be subjected to similar techniques. Since plural such spectra are available for plural illumination conditions and for plural detector elements, more and different information is available compared to prior art measurements. Moreover, these signal processing techniques can be used on one or more apparent reflectance or transmittance or absorbance spectra calculated from the measured emissivity or transmissivity, providing the same information as would be available from said prior art measurements. However, it is also possible to employ image processing techniques or other two-dimensional signal processing methods directly on the emissivity and transmissivity. Any commonly known low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, smoothing, or noise suppression filtering may be used, and these may be either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Also feature enhancement operations such as differentiation in one or both dimensions or convolution with a one- or two-dimensional transform may be used. The measurement of emissivity or transmissivity or a filtered or enhanced measurement may be transformed for feature extraction or other analysis by means of a one- or two-dimensional Fourier or Mellin or Wavelet or Wigner-Ville transformation, among others known to those skilled in the art of signal or image processing, as described for example in Poularikas, A. (ed.) \u201cThe Transforms and Applications Handbook\u201d, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1996, or in Ifeachor, E., and Jervis, B. \u201cDigital Signal Processing\u201d, Addison-Wesley, Wokingham UK, 1993, among others., 224649=Such observer functions and coefficients may be known a priori, or may be derived from measurements of emissivity or transmissivity or absorbance or reflectance or transmittance made on sets of calibration samples for which the properties to be estimated using observer functions are already known, or are measured by other means. Suitable observer functions and coefficients may be derived using chemometric methods such as partial-least-squares regression, as described in H\ufffdskuldsson, A., \u201cPLS Regression Methods\u201d, Journal of Chemometrics, volume 2, pages 211-228, 1988, or using principal components regression or continuum regression or canonical correlation or other statistical techniques, as described for example in Basilevsky, A., \u201cStatistical Factor Analysis and Related Methods\u201d, Wiley, New York, 1994, among others. For example, the proportions of certain constituents of the sheet may be thus inferred from infra-red measurements on the sheet using also a set of reference or calibration measurements. These reference calibration measurements comprise measurements of the emissivity or transmissivity at some or all combinations of illumination and detection wavelengths together with measurements of composition or other properties made by other means for each of several reference or calibration samples.}",
