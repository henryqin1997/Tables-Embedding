The solution was heated to the precipitation temperature of 44\ufffd C., with constant stirring (speed 831 l/min). As soon as this temperature had been attained, Fe(OH)2 was precipitated by pumping in a solution of 45 mol NaOH (=1800 g) dissolved in 6000 ml water (300 g/l=7.5 equivalents per liter) over a period of 40 minutes. The quantity of NaOH was thus 150% of the stoichiometry. On conclusion of the precipitation, the solution was aerated with 525 Nl/h of air. The oxidation time was 248 minutes, which corresponds to a rate of oxidation of 24.2 mol % Fe(III) per hour., 61367=12000 ml NaOH solution with a content of 100 g/l (=2.5 equivalents per liter) was placed in a 30 liter stirred-tank reactor provided with 3-stage cross-arm paddle mixer, aeration via aeration ring below the stirrer of electrical jacket heating, jacket cooling, pH measurement, redox measurement and temperature measurement. The solution was heated to the precipitation temperature of 36\ufffd C., with constant stirring (speed 594 l/min). As soon as this temperature had been attained, Fe(OH)2 was precipitated by pumping in a solution of 10 mol FeCl2 from Example 2 (=1267 g FeCl2) dissolved in 12675 ml water (100 g/l FeCl2=44.1 g/l Fe) over a period of 39 minutes. The quantity of NaOH was thus 150% of the stoichiometry. On conclusion of the precipitation, the solution was aerated with 100 Nl/h of air. The oxidation time was 225 minutes, which corresponds to a rate of oxidation of 26.7 mol % Fe(III)/h., 70391=The rate of oxidation in the first oxidation step was 5.6 mol % Fe(III) formed per hour. The mixture was then heated to 60\ufffd C. and the second oxidation step was started with 36 Nl/h air. As soon as this temperature had been attained, pH-controlled sodium hydroxide solution with a content of 300 g/l (=7.5 equivalents per liter) was pumped in. The pH increased at a rate of 0.2 pH/h; the end point of the rise in pH was pH 3.4. When this pH had been attained, the pH was maintained constant at 3.4+/\u22120.2 by means of sodium hydroxide solution. The rate of oxidation in the second oxidation step was 0.47 mol % Fe(III) formed per hour. The duration of the second oxidation step was 2140 minutes. The circulation performance of the stirrer, based on the final volume of 22 liters, was 13.6 per hour. During the oxidation, samples were withdrawn, filtered, washed and dried and their tristimulus values determined.}",
