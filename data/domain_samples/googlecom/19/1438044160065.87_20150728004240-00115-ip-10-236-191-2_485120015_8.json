For this calculation, a 3-dimensional Wang-Binford edge detector [Yan C H: Measuring changes in local volumetric bone density: new approaches to quantitative computed tomography, Ph.D. thesis, 1998, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University] or the marching cubes algorithm [Lorensen W E, Cline H E. Comput Graph 1987; 21: 163-169] can be used. This surface representation can be imported into a CAD system, which is used to generate a physical model or a cast by means of rapid prototyping techniques., 201335=For the digitized contours that result from the segmentation, smooth derivatives for equation (8) can be obtained by convolution with differentiated Gaussian kernels [Worring M, Smeulders A W M. CVGIP: Image Understanding, 1993. 58(3): p. 366-382].}",

All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. In each of these aspects of the invention it is to be understood that a cartilage degeneration pattern may be, i.a., 2D or 3D thickness map of the cartilage or a biochemical map of the cartilage. (f) a device for transmitting the correlated movement pattern with the cartilage degeneration pattern back to the source of the cartilage degeneration pattern. (e) a device for correlating the movement pattern with the cartilage degeneration pattern; and (d) a device for generating a movement pattern that most closely approximates a movement pattern for the human patient based on the characteristics of the human patient; (c) a database accessible at the remote location for generating a movement pattern for the joint of the human wherein the database includes a collection of movement patterns for human joints, which patterns are organized and can be accessed by reference to characteristics such as type of joint,",
