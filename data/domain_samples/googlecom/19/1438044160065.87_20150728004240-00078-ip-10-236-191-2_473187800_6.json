    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications to the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Accordingly, the present invention is to be limited solely by the scope of the following claims. While the above embodiments of the present invention have not shown a \"caping\" layer for protecting the top electrode, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that such a layer may be desirable. It has been omitted from the drawings to simplify the drawings. If a caping layer is used, it becomes part of the acoustic path, and hence, must be taken into account in setting the thicknesses of the various components so as to arrive at a resonator having the proper resonance frequency. Similarly, it is important that the PZ layer also be deposited in a form which minimizes the stress in the layer. The procedure described above with reference to the Mo layer may also be used to determine the optimum conditions for depositing the PZ material. The stress in the Mo layer may be measured by depositing the layer on a silicon wafer and then determining the degree to which the deposited layer caused the silicon wafer to bow. For example, if the Mo layer is compressively stressed, the wafer will become convexly bowed. The degree of bowing may be determined by optical interference measurements. Such measurements are conventional in the art,",
