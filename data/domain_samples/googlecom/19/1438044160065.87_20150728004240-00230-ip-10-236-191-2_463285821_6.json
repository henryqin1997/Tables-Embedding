No. 60/270,340 filed Feb. 21, 2001., 58661=[0048] The merchant gateway 32 comprises an embodiment of that which is shown in U.S. Utility Patent Application Ser. No. 09/728,471, filed Nov. 30, 2000, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/168,031, filed Nov. 30, 1999, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/205,318, filed May 18, 2000. The merchant gateway comprises a proprietary e-commerce/m-commerce platform whereby authorized users may access participating merchants, including the ability to purchase goods and services from the participating merchants. The gateway 32 detects the identity of the handset in communication with it (via user name and PIN input by the user of the mobile telephone or other means), and allows those who are authorized to use the gateway 32 to purchase goods and services from merchants and others using the mobile telephone. For example, the mobile telephone user may access the gateway to receive web pages that display goods and services for sale, and may select such goods and services to purchase. The gateway provides purchase information to the payment center gateway to allow for settlement of charges and purchases between the mobile telephone user and the merchant from which the user purchases goods and services. The gateway 32 stores the user's address, identification, account numbers, and related information to facilitate purchases, settlement, and shipment, and is in communication with servers that store account information for its users, including the account information for the bundled products., 30720=[0001] This application relates to U.S. Utility patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0061] Various embodiments of the invention have been described in fulfillment of the various objects of the invention. It should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. [0060]FIG. 4 shows a simplified representation of a top-level architecture for one embodiment of the present invention. It shows many of the same (or similar) elements as shown in FIG. 3, and the associated descriptions above provide a description of many of the elements shown. It should be noted that the mobile telephone shown on FIG. 4 includes a smart card (not shown). It should also be noted that the terms \u201cServer,\u201d 60 \u201cChip,\u201d 61 \u201cBluetooth,\u201d 62 and \u201cIrDA\u201d 63 indicate examples of technologies that may be used in conjunction with the mobile telephone in communicating using \u201ccontact-less\u201d technology. For example, the smart card used in the mobile telephone may include an IC Chip as described above (\u201cChip\u201d), radio frequency (RF) broadcasting hardware (e.g., the Bluetooth brand hardware), or infrared data transmitter (e.g., using the IrDA standard). Thus, an embodiment of the present invention may include a smart card having a small RF transmitter for communicating without contact with hardware that includes RF receivers.
