In the window on terminal 152, the nurse types a text message to be communicated. This text message is sent through node computer 131 to controller computer 127 to central server 124, which routes the message to controller computer 126. Controller computer 126 maintains software to convert the text-based message to a signal interpretable by voice synthesizer 192. Controller computer 127 sends the signal to node computer 129 that interfaces with voice synthesizer 192. Voice synthesizer 192 projects an audio message into zone 102 directed to item I4. At about the same time, item I4 also received the page sent by third party pager system 190. Hearing the audio message from synthesizer 192 and receiving the page, item I4 responds by returning to domain 101 with system 120 continuously tracking his movements and locations in the same manner as previously discussed. Simultaneously, item I4 continues to move through domain 100. Item I4 enters point-of way 107 and passes through frequency fields D and C, in that order, as shown by arrow 191. This movement is identified by receiver 143, which picks-up the unique identification transmission from the identification device associated with item I4. Receiver 143 passes the information to node computer 129, which in turn, passes the",
