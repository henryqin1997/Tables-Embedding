A particularly preferred embodiment provides a process wherein the quaternary ammonium salts' (QS) concentration ranges from about 1 ppm to about 1000 ppm., 36739=Table II shows the results of three continuous laboratory cell tests in which brines were fed to a laboratory scale membrane chloralkali electrolyzer. A membrane chlor-alkali electrolyzer has two compartments (an anode compartment and a cathode compartment) separated by a membrane. The brine solution is introduced into the anode compartment, and distilled water is introduced into the cathode compartment, followed by application of electrical current across the membrane electrolyzer. This process electrolyzes the sodium chloride from the brine solution and yields a caustic solution as the liquid product exiting the cathode compartment. Details of this process are given by Curlin, L. C., Bommaraju, T. V., and Hansson, C. B., Alkali and Chlorine Products: Chlorine and Sodium Hydroxide, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Volume 1, pp. 938-1025 (1991).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The presence of caustic foaming was determined by collecting a sample of the liquid exiting the cathode compartment. If the foaming above the sample liquid surface disappeared within about 10 seconds after sampling, then the solution was considered to be non-foaming. If the foam persisted for more than about 10 seconds, then the solution was considered to be foaming.
