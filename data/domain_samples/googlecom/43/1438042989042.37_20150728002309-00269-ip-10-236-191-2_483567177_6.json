One prior art attempt to do so utilizes \u201cspine\u201d routing, such as in the optimal spine routing (OSR) approach disclosed by Das et al. in \u201cRouting in Ad-Hoc Networks using Minimum Connected Dominating Sets,\u201dIEEE Int. Conf. On Commun. (ICC '97), 1997. In this approach, a spine or \u201cvirtual backbone\u201d is defined such that each network node is no more than one hop from a spine node. Global topology (link state) is maintained at each spine node, and a link-state routing algorithm is run at each spine node to produce current routes to every destination., 44414=[0006] Another related approach is clustered spine routing (CSR), which is disclosed by Das et al. in \u201cRouting in Ad-Hoc Networks using a Spine,\u201dIEEE Int. Conf. On Computer Commun. and Networks (IC3N '97), 1997. this approach is intended to extend the applicability of spine routing to larger network sizes by grouping the nodes in clusters and adding a second hierarchical level to the OSR approach. Yet another approach is known as partial knowledge spine routing (PSR) which is disclosed by Sivakumar et al. in \u201cThe Clade Vertebrata: Spines and Routing in Ad-Hoc Networks,\u201dIEEE Symposium On Computer and Commun., 1998., 86677=[0065] In either event, once selected the best route may then be stored in a routing cache or table. By way of example, the path metric used to select the cluster-level route may be which delivery route includes the least number of cluster leader nodes (i.e., which one has includes the least number of clusters 12). Of course, other metrics, such as the QoS metrics noted above, may also be used. One particularly advantageous approach to selecting routes using QoS parameters is described in a co-pending U.S. application entitled \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) ROUTING FOR MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS,\u201d attorney docket number GCSD-1201 (51264), filed Apr. 29, 2002, which is assigned to the present assignee and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Once the source cluster leader node 21 has determined the best cluster level route, it may then be forwarded to the requesting source node 14 in a cluster level route reply (CLRREP) message, at Block 57.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0113] Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications and embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. [0112] As may be seen in FIG. 3, the fourth level 18 includes a single cluster which may advantageously provide a convenient reference for determining a high-level route from the cluster leader node 21 of the source cluster to the cluster leader node 32 of the destination cluster. More particularly, since this single cluster includes the source and destination leader node clusters 21, 32, the high-level route may be determined therebetween using the various steps outlined above. The high-level route may, in turn, be used to determine the cluster-level route for the second hierarchical level. That is, the cluster-level route may include at least the clusters having respective cluster leader nodes along the high-level route, here the cluster leader nodes 21, 24, and 32. [0111] Furthermore, the cluster-level route request may have a different type for each hierarchical cluster level. More particularly, at a specific level the message is sent to the ALN for that level. Additionally, with respect",
