For example, a suitable etching device 109 is the XS300-0100 rev C available from Atlas Corporation. A suitable surface measurement device 111 is the Wafercom 300 available from Lapmaster SFT Corporation. A suitable polishing device 113 is the MICROLINE\u2122 AC 2000-P2 from Peter Wolters GmbH of Germany. A suitable nanotopography measurement device 115 is the NANOMAPPER\ufffd available from ADE Phase Shift. The grinder 101 may be further adjusted based on the measured nanotopography of the polished wafer.}",

When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. As illustrated, processing according to an exemplary method embodying aspects of the invention returns to 903 after the shift parameter is determined at 943, 945, 947, or 951. Likewise, the optimization cycle ends and the method returns to 903 if the processor 105 determines that no adjustment to the grinder 101 is necessary at 925. At 903, the grinder 101 grinds the next wafer according to the determined grinding parameters (e.g., determined shift parameter). At 905, the processor 105 determines whether the next wafer is the first wafer. Since the next wafer is not the first wafer, the processor 105 determines at 961 whether one or more the of follow conditions is true: the B-Ring of the previous wafer is greater than a pre-determined value (e.g., 8 nm); the cassette number is",
