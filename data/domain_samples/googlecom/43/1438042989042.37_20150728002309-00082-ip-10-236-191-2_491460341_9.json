The mixture is heated with an oil bath at 60\ufffd C. After two hours, the reaction is complete, as indicated by the loss of CH2\u2014OH peak at 3.5 ppm (in H-NMR). The content of the flask is stripped under vacuum (<0.4 mmHg) at 80\ufffd C for 2 hours. To the content is then added 3 mg of water and 30 mL of THF. The mixture is heated under reflux until all acid chloride groups have disappeared totally (by IR 1769 cm\u22121). THF is then stripped from the product in a Rotavapor. The residue remaining is then added to 200 mL ether and extracted with 50 mL of water three times. The final residue in ether is dried with magnesium sulfate and then vacuum stripped at 80\ufffd C. for 2 hours., 73649=A prepolymer prepared as described in Example 1, 32 parts, was mixed with 32 parts of N,N-dimethylacrylamide, 36 parts of TRIS, 27 parts of hexanol, and 0.3 part Darocur\ufffd 1173 initiator (Ciba Specialty Chemical).

The reactive polymer precipitates and is collected by vacuum filtration. The solid is placed in a vacuum oven at 30\ufffd C. overnight to remove the ether leaving 66.1 g of reactive polymer (79% yield). The reactive polymer is placed in a desiccator for storage until use., 70293=To a thoroughly dried 500-ml round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser was added bis-\u03b1,\u03c9-hydroxybutyl polydimethylsiloxane (Mn 1624, 30.08 grams, 0.0185 mole) prepared by following a procedure described in Journal of Polymer Science, Part A. 33, 1773 (1995) and fumaryl chloride (MW 152.96, 6.4013 grams, 0.0418 moles) (Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wis.). The reaction mixture was heated with an oil bath at 60\ufffd C. After two hours, the reaction was complete, as indicated by the loss of CH2\u2014OH peak at 3.5 ppm (in H-NMR). The content of the flask was stripped under vacuum (0.4 mmHg) at 80\ufffd C. for 2 hours. To the content was then added 3 mg of water and 30 ml of THF.

The reactive polymer is placed in a desiccator for storage until use., 32259=Various patents disclose the attachment of hydrophilic or otherwise biocompatible polymeric chains to the surface of a contact lens in order to render the lens more biocompatible. For example, U.S. Pat. Pub. No. U.S. 2002/0102415 A1 teaches plasma treatment of a fumarate- or fumaramide-containing substrate followed by reaction with other polymers, such as DMA/VDMO copolymer., 75160=A monomer mix consisting of a prepolymer prepared as described in Example 1, a t-butylfumarate end-capped polydimethylsiloxane of Mn 1600, (F2D20), TRIS, DMA and n-hexanol at a ratio of 15/15/30/40/5 was prepared. This mix was placed between two polypropylene molds and cured under microwave conditions. After releasing from the molds, the lenses were extracted with CO2 super critical fluid. The lenses were then placed in a distilled water solution containing a hydrophilic polymer derived from glycidyl methacrylate, N, N-dimethyl acrylamide and octafluoropentyl methacrylate (prepared as described in Example 9) and then autoclaved for 30 minutes. The lenses were then transferred to clean vials containing borate buffered saline at pH 7.1 and autoclaved. All lenses before and after treatments with polymer coating were characterized for water content and surface analysis (by XPS). The results were as follows:, 55740=The prepolymers of the present invention, when copolymerized, are readily cured to cast shapes by methods such as UV polymerization, use of free radical thermal initiators and heat, or combinations thereof. Representative free radical thermal polymerization initiators are organic peroxides, such as for example acetyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, stearoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl peroxypivalate, peroxydicarbonate, and the commercially available thermal initiators such as LUPERSOL\ufffd 256, 225 (Atofina Chemical, Philadelphia, Pa.) and the like, employed in a concentration of about 0.01 to 2 percent by weight of the total monomer mixture.
