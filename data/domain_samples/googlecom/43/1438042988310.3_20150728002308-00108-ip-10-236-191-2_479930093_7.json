As one preferred mode in such case, the second interlayer insulating film (resin film) 34 a and the semiconductor chip (silicon chip) 20 can be etched continuously under the same conditions by the YAG laser whose oscillation wavelength is 355 nm and whose frequency is 1000 to 5000 Hz. In this case, the etching executed by the laser is also stopped by the connection pad 10 a.}",

By way of example, there is the semiconductor device having such a structure that a plurality of semiconductor chips are three-dimensionally mounted on the wiring substrate while they are buried in the insulating film respectively and that a plurality of semiconductor chips are connected mutually via the via holes formed in the insulating film and the wiring patterns. For example, such semiconductor device is set forth in Patent Application Publication (KOKAI) 2001-196525 (Patent Literature 1), Patent Application Publication (KOKAI) 2001-177045 (Patent Literature 2), and Patent Application Publication (KOKAI) 2000-323645 (Patent Literature 3).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Also, since the connection pads 10 a exposed from the bottom portions of the via holes 36 are utilized as the plating power-supply layer upon forming the third wiring patterns 32 b in the via holes 36 by the electroplating, generation of the voids in the via holes 36 is prevented. As a result, since the reliability of the connection between the connection pads 10 a of the semiconductor chip 20 and the third wiring patterns 32 b can be improved, yield of the production of the electronic parts packaging structure can be improved. Therefore, the man-hour of the RIE step and the electroplating step employing the expensive manufacturing equipment can be reduced rather than the case where the semiconductor chip 20 is mounted after the through electrodes 16 are formed in the semiconductor chip 20, like the first embodiment. As a result, disadvantages such as an increase in production cost, a delay of the appointed date of delivery, etc. can be overcome. Also, in the method of manufacturing the electronic parts packaging structures 1 a, 1 b of the second embodiment, the via holes 36 are formed by etching continuously the second interlayer insulating film 34 a and the semiconductor chip 20 by means of the RIE or the laser. By doing this, the via holes 36 can be formed by the very simple method having the small number of steps. Further,",
