It can be seen, therefore, that the adjustable armrest of the present invention provides for complete adjustability to enhance the use of the armrest for a variety of different situations. The armrest is pivoted at both ends and with its rear end pivoted to a sliding mechanism to adjust the rear end of the armrest along the side of the chair back. The front end of the armrest is coupled to an adjustable length pivot link to a second sliding mechanism along the side of the chair. This simple structure provides for a complete adjustability as to height, angle and fore and aft position for the adjustable armrest of the present invention. FIG. 4 illustrates how the armrest may be swung away to make it easier for a patient to sit or leave the chair. Specifically as shown in FIG. 4 in the dotted position 84, the arm member 44 may be pivoted backward and with the pivot link 48 rotated almost 180\ufffd from the full line position so that the pivot link extends not down from the arm, but rather forward from the top surface of the arm member 44. This is shown by the dotted position 86",
