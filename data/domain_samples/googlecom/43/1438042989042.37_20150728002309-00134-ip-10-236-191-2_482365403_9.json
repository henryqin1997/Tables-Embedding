No. 60/098,178 filed Aug. 26, 1998., 67983=The hindlimb perfusion preparation was adopted from a technique originally designed by Folkow et al., Acta Physiol Scand., 80: 93-106 (1973), as modified by Adams et al., Hypertension 14: 191-202 (1989). The perfusion experiment was performed as described above. Drugs were administered into the mixing chamber via a Harvard Apparatus infusion pump. The rats were anaesthetized (Inactin, 100 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.) and heparinized (1000 IU/kg of body weight, i.v.). Following a midline abdominal incision, the abdominal aorta was cannulated proximal to the iliac bifurcation with a double lumen catheter (Storz, St Louis, Mo., USA), and the catheter was extended down the right common iliac artery. One lumen of the catheter was connected to the perfusion apparatus, while the other was connected to a pressure transducer for arterial pressure recording. The rat was perfused at a constant flow rate (2 mL/min per 100 g of body weight) and the experiments were carried out as described above. The flow rate/perfusion pressure relationship was recorded at flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mL/min per 100 g of body weight. A cumulative \u03b11-adrenoreceptor concentration-response curve to methoxamine (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 g/mL) was then generated. Each concentration of methoxamine was infused for a duration of 5 minutes, at which time a plateau was reached. Subsequently, a bolus injection of a cocktail containing a supramaximal concentration of vasoconstrictors was given as above. At the end of the concentration-response relationship, the iliac artery was cut distal to the catheter, and the flow pressure curve was monitored again., 86814=Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated for 1 or two weeks with either enalapril (30 mg/kg of body weight per day) or hydralazine (45 mg/kg of body weight per day). Following this treatment, structurally-based resistance to blood flow in the perfused penile vascular bed and hindlimb vascular bed models were measured using the methods detailed above. Cumulative \u03b11-adrenoreceptor concentration-response curves in response to methoxamine were measured as described above, and the \u201cyield\u201d point determined, following the achievement of maximal vasoconstriction using the vasopressin, angiotensin-II, methoxamine cocktail described above. The animal hearts were excised and weighed. The data are presented in Table 2 below., 64140=Penile perfusion preparations were made using the procedure established by Banting, J. D., et al., \u201cIsolation and Perfusion of the Pudendal Vasculature in Male Rats. J Urol., 2: 587-590 (1995). A heated chamber served to maintain the ambient temperature and the entire preparation at 37-38\ufffd C. The perfusate was held in a reservoir and passed through a heating and a bubble trapping/mixing chamber connected to a single peristaltic pump (Minipuls 2 Pump, Gilson, Inc., 3000 W. Beltline Highway, Middleton, Wis. USA 53562) . An injection port was located distal to the pump for the introduction of pharmacological agents to minimize dead volume. Drugs were administered via a Harvard Apparatus, Inc. infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Inc., 84 October Hill Road, Holliston, Mass. 01746). The perfusate was a Tyrode-dextran solution consisting of a mixture of 20 mg of KCl, 32.3mg of CaCl2.H2O, 5.1 mg of MgCl2.6H2O, 6.2 mg of NaH2PO4.2H2O, 155 mg of NaHCO3, 100 mg of glucose, and 800 mg of NaCl in each 100 mL of fluid. The solution was maintained at pH 7.4, and a temperature of 37-39\ufffd C., and oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The rats were anaesthetized (sodium pentobarbital 60 mg/kg body weight i.p.) and heparinized (1000 IU/kg, i.v.). The bilateral isolation of penile vasculature was achieved by ligating all of the branching arteries except for the pudendal; then the abdominal aorta was cannulated proximal to the iliac bifurcation with a single lumen catheter. The catheter was connected to the perfusion apparatus via a pressure transducer for arterial pressure recording. After sectioning the vena cava and spinal cord to remove venous resistance and to eliminate neural influences, a flow of perfusate (1 mL/min per kg body weight) through the abdominal cannula was initiated. The perfusion pressure was continuously recorded on a data acquisition system (MacLab, AD Instruments, Houston, Tex.). The perfusate was infused for twenty minutes to flush the penile vasculature of blood and obtain a stable pressure before the beginning of any experiment. Following this, sodium nitroprusside (20 g/mL) was infused to induce maximum vasodilation. The flow rate-perfusion/pressure relationship was determined by measuring the pressure at minimum vascular resistance at flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mL/min per kg of body weight. A cumulative \u03b11-adrenoreceptor concentration-response curve to methoxamine (2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 g/mL was then generated. Each concentration of methoxamine was infused for a duration of 10 minutes, at which time a plateau was reached. Subsequently, a continuous injection of a cocktail containing a supramaximal concentration of vasoconstrictors (vasopressin, 20.5 g/mL, angiotensin-II, 200 ng/mL; methoxamine, 64 g/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., 63178) was given to ensure that maximum constrictor response that was not dependent upon the activation of a single receptor type was achieved. A second injection of the constrictor cocktail was administered to ensure the tissue \u201cyield\u201d was maximum constriction. This \u201cyield\u201d induced by the multi-vasoconstrictor cocktail has been demonstrated to correlate directly with the bulk of medial vascular smooth muscle cells in the resistance vasculature. A typical perfusion pressure tracing from this protocol can be seen in FIG. 1. At the end of the concentration-response relationship, the aorta was cut distal to the catheter, and a baseline flow-pressure curve was recorded again. This was done to ensure that pressure fell to zero and to account for any false pressure readings that may have resulted due to movement of the catheter during the experiment.}",
