Assuming 1 KB cache sectors, 1024 bytes/4 bytes/clock=256 clocks each 3.3 ns equals 853 ns (at least) additional latency which is realistic for minimum 3 B repeating patterns. Using register arrays, 128\ufffd64 b 2 R+2 W ports and minimum 3 B repeat pattern, then what is achieved is 1024/6 bytes/clock=171 clock*3.3 ns equals 570 ns as the worst case. Assuming a unique distribution of addresses during miss within 1024 bytes block, then the penalty for byte 0 is 0 ns and worst penalty for byte 1023 is 570 ns\u20133.3 ns, then the average will be a 285 ns decompression penalty. Since a cache hit ratio of 32+ MB cache will be high (over 97% can be expected), the average penalty is expected to be much less then 8.55 ns., 119946=Therefore, if DRAM cache miss is in any address 0..1023 with equal probability, in 1 out if 16 cases, the system can hit the last 64 bytes, which in frequent cases will be uncompressed (and can be available immediately without sequential decompression). Tail bytes are used in case the number of bytes beyond last data block will fit into this \u201cextension\u201d of the data block, so no new data block needs to be allocated.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention, a method and system are described for implementing transparent compressed memory paging within a computer system, have been presented for purpose of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents. Other optimizations are described below. By placing an index into the first data block, it will be possible to start decompressing data immediately after first memory access for retrieving the index block (and data block too, if merged). From 128 bytes only 23 bytes are header in the worst case, so remaining 105 bytes could be decompressed. Assuming 4 bytes per clock can be processed, then 26 cycles*3.3 ns=86 ns are needed, which is mostly opening and reading the bank of the DRAM. First 32 bytes (16 bytes) does not need to be compressed because it will unlikely produce any benefits, but",
