When no more of the first loaded Step ID's are found in any subsequent loading, that last review of a P-SAVE's data will trigger the end of the manager program's execution and cause a signal to be sent so that recovery can begin 703 at that last checked P-SAVE address. The evaluation program (701) is for managing a memory area (702) (which is illustrated in two pieces because the memory area may be discontinuous) of said computer system for storing any active Step IDs therein, and for generating an initiate recovery signal (703) and terminating its own execution as soon as there are no active Step IDs in the memory area. The evaluation program begins execution (704) by storing all active Step IDs found (705) in a last written P-SAVE record into the memory area (702) and deactivates each said active Step ID as a copy of each said active Step ID is not found in each previously written P-SAVE data block. In FIG. 7, a system 700 for finding the place in the audit trail to begin recovery is shown in heuristic block diagrammatic form. The elements act upon request caused by an automatic notification or manual notification that the computer system supporting the active data base processing has in some way failed and that a recovery is required by",
