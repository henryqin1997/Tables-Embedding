    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It can be seen that the present system provides a wide variety of monitors and control features which can be selectively varied for numerous applications. Thus the description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. Tool Requires Attention\u2014This output is a warning that a condition exists that will immanently shut down a tool 10. This will occur when a tool 10 has been run too many cycles without being re-certified. Tool Operational\u2014This output from the work cell supervisor 16 that indicates the tool 10 is fully operational and capable of running fastening cycles. A lack of this signal will most likely trigger a requirement for a service technician to determine what has caused this tool 10 to become non-operational. Typical causes for this signal to go false are: The tool 10 is not adjusted to the proper torque for this application, the tool 10 has been run too many cycles and has not been calibrated as required, the R-F link between the tool 10 and the work cell supervisor 16 is not operating, etc. Part Complete\u2014This output goes active when the required number of good cycles have been performed on",
