    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59783=FIG. 8 shows a processing performed by processor 5160 and program 5145 in product station 115. CPU 5160 and a program in memory 5165 act to perform the processing shown in FIG. 8. When a person inserts a card into interface slot 4170 a switch (not shown) in interface slot 4170 alerts CPU 5160 that a card has been inserted into the slot. Subsequently, CPU 5160 causes card interface 4170 to reset the card by applying a clock signal to contact 2423. (If the card is a customer card, the card then answers the reset by sending a block of data, including identification data 2467 and authorization data 2468, through card contact 2427. Authorization data 2468 contains a cardtype code indicating a customer card. If the card is a programming card, the card send then answers the reset by sending a data block, including authorization data 2458, through card contact 2427. Authorization data 2458 has a card-type code indicating a programming card.) CPU 5160 then receives then receives the answer-to-reset data block from the card (step 8010)., 69747=If the customer card is not eligible, the station will not send a block of data, step 12015 therefore does not execute, and processing ceases until the customer card is reinserted into a station, at which time the station will reset the card and processing will restart at step 12010., 53892=FIG. 4 is a block diagram of customer card 215, including central processing unit 2450, memory 2460, and battery 2470 for supplying power to interface 2425, processor 2450, and memory 2460. Memory 2460 is a random access, addressable device. Station interface 2425 includes a serial to parallel converter for transferring data signals between contact 2427 and CPU 2450 over parallel bus 2452. Memory 2460 stores a program 2465 executed by processor 2450, customer identification data 2467, and authorization data 2468. Customer identification data 2467 includes a sequence of digits that uniquely identifies the holder of the card. Customer identification data 2467 includes the card holder's social security number. For example, identification data 2467 in customer card 235 uniquely identifies customer 230. Authorization data 2468 includes a sequence of digits that includes a code identifying the store or stores in which the card may be used to obtain a paperless coupon. Authorization data 2468 also includes date data indicating an expiration date for the card. Depending on the card holder's contractual relationship with the card issuer, the card issuer may periodically update this date data to renew the card when the current date data indicates the card is expired. Store authorization data 2468 also contains a field identifying that the card is a customer card (rather than a programming card, which is described below)., 48617=While shopping in store 1000, each of customers 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 270, 280, and 290 carries his or her respective customer card. Customer 210 carries card 215, customer 220 carries card 225, customer 230 carries card 235, customer 240 carries card 245, customer 250 carries card 255, customer 270 carries card 275, customer 280 carries card 285, and customer 290 carries card 295. Each customer tows a shopping cart to hold selected products. Customer 210 tows cart 212, customer 220 tows cart 222, customer 230 tow cart 232, customer 240 tows cart 242, customer 250 tows cart 252, customer 270 tows cart 272, customer 280 tows cart 282, and customer 290 tows care 292. To create an electronic coupon, the customer inserts the card into the product station adjacent to a product the customer wishes to purchase, and the product station then writes an electronic coupon onto the card. In other words, the product station writes an electronic coupon into a memory on the card, in response to a person presenting the card at the product station. The customer then removes the product from the shelf and places the removed product into her cart. The customer thus shops throughout the store collecting electronic coupons for products of interest., 41905=FIGS. 1A and 1B show a grocery store 1000 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 1A and FIG. 1B are each a partial view of store 1000. Customers 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 270, 280, and 290, shop in the store. Before shopping in the store, each of these customers obtained a customer card. For example, customer 230 obtained customer card 235 from a bank, by completing an application for the bank. The application contained questions to collect demographic data, including birth date, income level, past buying patterns, geographic location, size of family, level of education, and job-related data. The bank subsequently wrote customer identification data for customer 230 onto customer card 235, and issued customer card 235 to customer 230, and sent the customer's demographic data to a clearinghouse which then stored the demographic data on disk. Each of customers 210, 220, 240, 250, 270, 280, and 290 obtains a respective customer card in a similar manner. In other words, for each customer the preferred method writes demographic data for the customer onto a disk in the clearinghouse, and writes personal identification data for the customer onto a respective card for the customer., 70051=Alternatively, if the block contains a station-type code indicating a checkout station (step 12070), the customer card then sends list 2345 to the checkout station (step 12080). In other words, CPU 2450 reads list 2435 from memory 2460, in response to a customer inserting card 215 into checkout station 715, and sends a signal corresponding to the list 2345 to the checkout station (step 12080)., 76515=FIG. 16 shows customer card 216 in accordance with the alternative embodiment of the present invention. Customer card 216 is similar to customer card 215 described above, except that customer card 216 has program 2466 in memory 2460.e, 65412=FIG. 11 shows a processing performed by CPU 750 and program 722 in checkout counter 700, when a customer checks out of store 1000. When a customer, such as customer 290, inserts customer card 295 into interface slot 714, a switch (not shown) in interface slot 714 alerts CPU 750 that a card has been inserted into the slot. When a customer card is in interface slot 714, conductive contacts (not shown) inside interface slot 714 touch each card contact 2420. Subsequently, CPU 750 causes card interface 725 to reset the card by applying a clock signal to card contact 2423. (If the card is a customer card, the card then answers the reset by sending a block of data, including identification data 2467 and authorization data 2468, through card contact 2427.) CPU 750 then receives the answer-to-reset from the card (step 11002). CPU 750 then sends a data block containing a station-type code indicating a checkout station (step 11004). CPU 750 then receives the contents of table 2435 in memory 2460 of the customer card, and temporarily stores these table contents in memory 720 of the checkout station (step 11005). During step 10005, CPU 750 also causes customer card 295 to remove all entries from list 2435, so that the electronic coupons in the list cannot be redeemed again. When the checkout clerk (not shown) moves a product past UPC reader 710, UPC reader 710 detects the UPC code on the product and sends the UPC code to CPU 750 (step 11010). CPU 750 searches the received table contents to determine whether the product scanned is identified in the table (step 11020). If the product is in the received table, CPU 750 subtracts the discount, as determined by the discount data stored in the received table, from a product reference price read from disk 725 (step 11030), and displays the resulting price of the product on display 717 (step 11040)., 55346=Memory 2460 also stores product data received from one or more of the product stations. This product data includes a list of product discounts 2435. When a customer inserts a customer card into one of the product stations, processor 2450 receives an identification code for the product from the station and adds the code to the list., 55828=Programming card 55 has the same hardware structure as customer card 215. FIG. 20A shows a plan view of programming card 55, and FIG. 20B shows a side view of card 55. Card 55 is 8.5 cm by 5.4 cm, the length and width of a typical financial credit card. Card 55 is slightly thicker than a typical financial credit card. Card 55 includes interface contacts 2420 for communication with the product stations and the checkout station, and embossed area 2430 for displaying information about the card., 80600=FIG. 18 shows a block diagram of a programming card 55 in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Programming card 55 is similar to customer card 215, except that programming card has program 2455, authorization data 2458, and new discount data 2555 in addressable, random access memory 2460. Authorization data 2458 and new discount data 2555 are each a type of signal., 81017=FIG. 19 shows a processing performed by CPU 2450 and program 2455 in program card 55. After programming card 55 is reset through contacts 2420, programming card 55 sends authorization data 2458 in an answer-to-reset data block in accordance with the ISO standard ISO/IEC 7816-3: 1989(E), cited above (step 19010). Authorization data 2458 has a card-type code indicating that the card is a programming card. Programming card 55 then receives a block of data through contact 2427 (step 19015). If the block contains a station-type code indicating a product station (step 19020), the programming card 55 card then sends discount data 2555 (step 19030)., 67442=In other words, the preferred retail system 1000 includes product areas 110, 120, 130, 140, 160, 170, 180, and 190; product stations 115, 125, 135, 145, 165, 175, 185, and 195 acting as a plurality of first communication ports each adjacent to a respective one of the product areas, a plurality of customer cards each having a memory, and a checkout counter 700 having checkout station 715 acting as a second communication port. A method of operating system 1000 comprises the steps of writing a first signal into memory 2460 of a card in the plurality of cards, in response to a person inserting the card into the interface slot of one of the product stations, the first signal identifying a product in the product area adjacent to the one of the first communication ports; reading the first signal from memory 2460, in response to a person inserting the card into the interface slot of the checkout station; receiving a second signal, from UPC reader 710, identifying a product; and determining a price for the product depending on whether the product identified by the first signal, read in the reading step, corresponds to the product identified by the second signal., 76769=FIG. 17 shows a processing performed by CPU 2450 and program 2466. After the card is \\reset through contacts 2420, the customer card sends an \"answer to reset\" data block in accordance with the ISO standard ISO/IEC 7816-3: 1989(E), cited above. The customer card also sends data identifying the card (step 17010). The customer card then receives a block of data through contact 2427 (step 17015). If the block contains a station-type code indicating a product station (step 17020), the customer card then adds product coupon information, from a certain locataion in the block, to the list 2345 (step 17030). Alternatively, if the block contains a station-type code indicating a checkout station (step 17070), the customer card then receives another block from the station (step 17080). If the first word in the block is non-zero, there is a UPC code stored in the block (step 17090). The card searches list 2345 for this UPC code, sends the station a block containing a zero in the first word if the UPC code is not in table 2345, or sends the station a block containing the discount format and discount quantity data corresponding to the UPC code if the UPC code is in table 2345. Processing then returns to step 17080., 68931=FIG. 12 shows a processing performed by one of the customer cards, such as customer card 215, in the preferred retail system. After the card is reset through contacts 2420, the customer card sends an \"answer to reset\" data block in accordance with the ISO standard ISO/IEC 7816-3: 1989(E), cited above. The customer card sends identification data 2467 and authorization data 2468 in the answer-to-reset data block (step 12010). If the station then sends a block of data to the customer card, the customer card then receives the block of data through contact 2427 (step 12015). If the block contains a station-type code indicating a product station (step 12020), the customer card then adds product coupon information, from a certain location in the block, to the list 2345 (step 12030)., 57602=FIG. 5 shows product station 115, including green light 4155, red light 4160, and interface slot 4170. Station 115 also has an optional liquid crystal display (LCD) for displaying product promotional messages. Interface slot 4170 has a width sufficient to accommodate the width of one of the customer cards. When a customer card is in interface slot 4170, conductive contact 4177 inside interface slot 4170 touches contact 2427 on the customer card. Interface slot 4170 has other contacts (not shown) for touching the other card contacts 2420., 43730=Store 1000 includes shelves 10, 20, and 30, defining aisles between the shelves. The supermarket has a plurality of product areas, each corresponding to a respective product. Product Area 110 has Acme brand ammonia. Product Area 120 has Delta brand dish detergent. Product Area 130 has Lighthouse brand light bulbs., 63876=CPU 5160 determines that the card is a programming card if the card-type code in the received authorization data indicates a programming card. If the card is not a an eligible customer card but is instead a programming card meaning that the authorization data is authorization data 2458 (step 8070), CPU 5160 sends to a block containing a station-type code indicating a product station (step 8075), and CPU 5160 receives additional data from the card (step 8080) and changes product data 5135 by writing the additional data to locations 250-275 (step 8085), thereby changing the electronic coupon dispensed by the product station., 52823=FIG. 3C shows interface contacts 2420 in more detail. Interface contacts 2420 are configured in accordance with 1807816-2: 1988(E), Identification cards--Integrated circuit (s) cards with contact--Part 2: Dimensions and locations of the contacts, promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and available from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 West 42nd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. According to ISO 7816-2, contact 2421 is assigned to VCC (supply voltage), contact 2422 is assigned to RST (reset signal), contact 2423 is assigned to CLK (clock signal), contact 2424 is reserved for future use, contact 2425 is assigned to GND (ground), contact 2426 is assigned to VPP (program and voltage), contact 2427 is assigned to I/O (data input/output), and contact 2428 is reserved for future use. Card 215 communicates with the product stations and the checkout stations through contact 2427 using a half duplex scheme, meaning that contact 2427 is for communicating data signals either to or from the card., 60845=The communication protocol between product station 115 and a customer card is described in more detail in ISO/IEC 7816-3: 1989 (E), Identification cards--Integrated circuit(s) cards with contacts--Part 3: Electronic signals and transmission protocols; and ISO/IEC 7816-3: 1989/Amd.1: 1992 (E), Part 3: Electronic signals and transmission protocols, AMENDMENT 1: Protocol type T=1, asynchronous half duplex block transmission protocol. Both of these standards are promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and distributed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)., 32996=Discount coupons are a popular means to stimulate sales of products such as grocery store items. In 1992, approximately 310 billion coupons were distributed and 7.7 billion coupons were redeemed, saving customers $4 billion. It has been estimated that in-store couponing coupled with advertising increases sales by 544%., 52101=FIG. 3A shows a plan view of customer card 215 carried by customers 210, and FIG. 3B shows a side view of card 215. Card 215 is 8.5 cm by 5.4 cm, the length and width of a typical financial credit card. Card 215 is slightly thicker than a typical financial credit card. Card 215 includes a magnetic stripe 2410, interface contacts 2420 for communication with the product stations and the checkout station, and embossed area 2430 for displaying the card owner's name. Magnetic stripe 2410 allows a conventional credit card stripe reader to read basic data from the card. Magnetic stripe 2410 is not necessary to the operation of the preferred embodiment of the invention, described in more detail below., 57387=Other features of the preferred system are the subject of copending application No. 08/468,816 of KEN R. POWELL for RETAIL SYSTEM, filed concurrently with the instant application on Jun. 6, 1995., 67291=Product data 5135, customer identification data 2467, authorization data 2468, and the data in list 2435 are each a type of signal., 56344=FIG. 20C shows interface contacts 2420 in more detail. Interface contacts 2420 are configured in accordance with ISO7816-2: 1988(E), Identification cards--Integrated circuit (s) cards with contact--Part 2: Dimensions and locations of the contacts, promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and available from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 West 42nd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. According to ISO 7816-2, contact 2421 is assigned to VCC (supply voltage), contact 2422 is assigned to RST (reset signal), contact 2423 is assigned to CLK (clock signal), contact 2424 is reserved for future use, contact 2425 is assigned to GND (ground), contact 2426 is assigned to VPP (program and voltage), contact 2427 is assigned to I/O (data input/output), and contact 2428 is reserved for future use. Card 55 communicates with the product stations through contact 2427 using a half duplex scheme, meaning that contact 2427 is for communicating data signals either to or from the card., 62933=FIG. 9A shows some the contents list 2435 in starting at location 30 memory 2460 of customer card 215, before CPU 5160 of the product station executes step 8040. An electronic coupon is represented by three rows in list 2435: a 12 digit UPC product code in the first row, discount format data in the second row (\"1\" signifying cents, \"2\" signifying percentage), and discount quantity data in the third row. In FIG. 9A, the customer card is storing two electronic coupons in a list starting at location 30 in memory 2460, reflecting the fact that customer 210 has received electronic coupons from two product stations during her current visit to store 1000. After CPU 5160 executes step 8040 (thereby sending an electronic coupon to the customer card), CPU 2450 in customer card 215 receives the data and adds the data to list 2435, resulting in three electronic coupons in list 2435 as shown in FIG. 9B., 71217=Each row in table 1 records a redemption transaction. Each customer ID number is a copy of data 2467 from a customer card. Each UPC code is a copy of product data 5135 from one of the product stations., 61468=CPU 5160 analyzes the authorization data in the received answer-to-reset block to determine whether the card is a customer card that is eligible to receive paperless coupons in store 1000 (step 8020). CPU 5160 determines that the card is a customer card if the received authorization data contains a card-type code indicating a customer card. If the card is a customer card, meaning that the authorization data is authorization data 2468, CPU 5160 determines if the card is eligible to receive paperless coupons in store 1000 if authorization data 2468 contains a store code indicating store 1000, and the current time and date (as indicated by a date-time clock inside processor 4160) is not later than the date data in authorization data 2468. If the card is an eligible customer card, CPU 5160 sends to the customer card a block containing a station-type code indicating a product station, and product coupon data 5135 from locations 250-275 (step 8040). Product coupon data 5135 includes an identification code for the product currently being promoted by the product station (bottles of ammonia 112) and the discount currently being offered for that product. CPU 5160 then rams on green light 4160 to indicate to the customer that an electronic coupon has successfully been transferred to her customer card (step 8060), thereby allowing the customer to conveniently verify whether she is eligible for a discount before selecting the product., 73580=In other words, the system shown in FIG. 13, and the corresponding product stations, perform a method of determining retail buying patterns. The method writes demographic data, obtained from a customer application questionnaires described above, into memory 925. The method writes personal identification data 2467 onto customer cards. Subsequently, one or more product stations writes a product identification data, corresponding to a selected product, onto certain ones of the cards. Subsequently, a checkout station reads the personal identification data 2467 from certain ones of the cards to generate a first read signals, and reads the product identification data from certain ones of the cards to generate second read signals. These first and second signals are sent to clearinghouse 900, which generates a report using the first and second signals. Clearinghouse 900 generates the report by accessing the demographic data, using the first signal, to generate a demographic signal; and by correlating the demographic signal (indicating age) with the second signal (purchases of ammonia)., 43529=Alternatively, a customer may have obtained a customer card from a store, such as store 1000, by completing a check cashing application having questions to collect demographic data.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The invention in its broader aspects is therefore not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus, and illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures may be made from such details without departing from the spirit or the scope of Applicants' general inventive concept. The invention is defined in the following claims. Although the preferred system employs a programming card, having an interface compatible with the customer card interface on each product station, the invention may be practiced with other types of programming interfaces, disengaged from the product station except when programming is performed. For example, instead of a programming card, a service worker may carry a portable computer that temporarily connects to the product station with a cable. With this cable scheme, the service worker creates a signal path to the product station by plugging the cable into the product station. The portable computer then changes the selected product by sending a programming signal through the cable to the product station. Subsequently, the service worker breaks the signal path by disconnecting the cable from the product station. Although the illustrated portable customer card and portable programming card are each 8.5 cm long by 5.4 cm wide, the invention may be practices with other portable card dimensions. Preferably the portable card dimension is less than 15 cm long by 10 cm wide. Demographic data",
