One suitable implementation of a wake-up packet is described in \u201cMagic Packet Technology Application in Hardware and Software\u201d published in March 1996 by Advanced Micro Devices and hereby incorporated by reference. The source of the triggering activity may alternatively come from a local mechanism (i.e. a switch or sensor of any kind such as a power switch, a reset switch, a pressable key, a pressure sensor, a mouse, a joystick, a touch pad, a microphone, a motion sensor, or a biometric device (e.g. fingerprint reader)), or the trigger source may be remote and perhaps communicated to the computer system by a network, serial bus, modem, or some other communications link., 38884=Turning now to the figures, FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a configuration of various computer components that may be found in a representative computer system. It is noted that many other representative configurations exist and that this embodiment is described for illustrative purposes. The computer system of FIG. 1 includes a CPU 102 coupled to a bridge logic device 106 via a CPU bus. The bridge logic device 106 is sometimes referred to as a \u201cNorth bridge\u201d for no other reason than it often is depicted at the upper end of a computer system drawing. The North bridge 106 also couples to a main memory array 104 by a memory bus, and may further couple to a graphics controller 108 via an advanced graphics processor (AGP) bus. The North bridge 106 couples CPU 102, memory 104, and graphics controller 108 to the other peripheral devices in the system through a primary expansion bus (BUS A) such as a PCI bus or an EISA bus. Various components that understand the bus protocol of BUS A may reside on this bus, such as an audio device 114, a IEEE 1394 interface device 116, and a network interface card (NIC) 118. The system may include more than one network interface, as indicated by NIC 119. These components may be integrated onto the motherboard, as suggested by FIG. 1, or they may be plugged into expansion slots 110 that are connected to BUS A., 51155=The remote-boot trigger is not necessarily limited to remote triggers. In one embodiment, the remote-boot trigger may be a local trigger which causes the computer to try booting from the network before trying to boot from local boot devices. For example, use of a biometrics device (i.e. pressing a finger against a fingerprint scanner, or placing an eye proximate to a retinal scanner) could cause a computer to boot to a secure network server, validate the identity of an individual, and automatically log into a corresponding individual account. A suitable biometrics device is described in a co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/149,400 filed Sep. 8, 1998 by inventors Manuel Novoa and Adrian Crisan. This is only one of many exemplary applications for a computer system having a dynamically reconfigurable boot order.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Hence, a method for dynamically reconfiguring a boot order has been disclosed which may advantageously provide desirable system features. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. For example, other temporary boot orders are contemplated, including simply adding a network drive as a first entry before the existing boot table, and implementing a flag to indicate that the network drive has already been attempted to prevent a second attempt if the network drive appears again later in the boot table. Also, more than one network interface may be present in the system, in which case the BIOS may be configured to test each network interface for the reception of a wake-up data packet. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications. The remote-boot trigger is not necessarily limited to remote triggers. In one embodiment, the remote-boot trigger may be a local trigger which causes the computer to try booting from the network before trying to boot from local boot devices. For example, use of a biometrics device (i.e. pressing a finger against a fingerprint scanner, or placing an eye proximate to a retinal scanner) could cause a computer to boot to a secure network server, validate the identity of an individual, and automatically log into a corresponding individual account.
