A typical thickness, of second layer 14 is ranging from about 50 \u03bcm to about 1000 \u03bcm. In addition, the predetermined porosity of second layer 14 is preferably larger than the predetermined porosity of first layer 12. A porous structure is known to promote ingrowth of surrounding tissues, which is extremely important for fast integration and long-term patency of the vascular prosthesis. An example of the porous structure of second layer 14 is shown in FIG. 2.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24690=Attempts have also been made to provide grafts characterized by both high compliance and high porosity, by the utilization of fiber polyurethanes. However, many polyurethanes, including those based on polycarbonate soft segments, have insufficient long-term biostability. Recently, siloxane-based aromatic polyurethanes have been developed, which have acceptable biostability even for thin fibers [In Vivo Degradation of Polyurethanes: Transmission FTIR Microscopic Characterization of Polyurethanes Sectioned by Cryomicroscopy. MaCarthy S. J. at al., Biomaterials 18, 1387 (1997); Polydimethylsiloxane (polyether-mixed macrodiol-based polymethane elastomers) biostability, Martin D. J. et al., Biomaterials, 21, 1021-1029 (2000); PCTAU 91/00270; PCT/AU 99/00236; PCTAU 98/00497; PP 9917]., 73269=A silicon polycarbonate urethane copolymer CarboSil 20 was purchased from Polymer Technology Group Incorporated, and was used for graft manufacturing. This polymer has satisfactory fiber-generation abilities, it is biocompatibilty and is capable of lipophilic drug incorporation. A mixture of dimethylformamide and toluene of ratio ranging from 1:1 to 1:2 was used as a solvent in all experiments. For the formation of adhesive sublayers, polycarbonate urethane Chronoflex 80A was used., 19068=This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/433,622, filed Jun. 18, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,220, which is a national phase application of PCT/IL01/01172, filed Dec. 17, 2001, now expired, which claims priority of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/256,323, filed Dec. 19, 2000 and 60/276,956, filed Mar. 20, 2001, both now expired, and of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/982,017, filed Oct. 19, 2001, now abandoned., 78383=The heating of the mandrel after the formation of the inner layer resulted in a residual solvent drop from approximately 1200 ppm to 20 ppm. Low mass gain during the process ensured equal temperature of the mandrel- and the outer layer. The heating process increased the porosity, the dynamic compliance and the antikinking resistance. The mechanical parameters of the graft according to the ISO were: general porosity of 78%, kinking diameter of 16 mm and dynamic compliance of 14%., 80506=CarboSil 20 polyuurethane solution was used to form the inner layer, the thickness of which was 80 \u03bcm. The viscosity of the solution was 450 cP and conductivity was 0.45 \u03bcS. Once the inner layer was formed, a 16 \u03bcm first intermediate layer of low hardness, highly elastic polyurethane Chronoflex 80A was applied. Then, a 0.3 mm polypropylene surgical thread was passed through a bath of Chronoflex 80A solution of 1500 cP viscosity, thereby forming a semi-solid polyurethane filament with a thickness of about 1 mm. Subsequently, the coated filament was wound around the intermediate layer, at a winding rate of 4.4 m/min, winding tension of 2 N and winding pitch of 1.1 mm., 21861=In a natural arterial tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel may vary up to 15% as a function of blood pressure. This characteristic of natural blood vessels, named compliance, is of crucial importance when manufacturing an artificial blood vessel. A compliant wall should act as an elastic reservoir, absorbing energy during systole and releasing energy during diastole. A rigid vessel wall diminishes the pulsatile component of the diastolic recoil, thereby reducing the energy available for distal perfusion. It has been demonstrated experimentally that incompatible compliance of a vascular graft and the host artery is detrimental to graft performance [Baird R. N., Abbott W. M. \u201cPulsatile blood-flow in arterial grafts\u201d, The Lancet, 1976; 30; 948-9; Abbott W. M., Megerman J. M. et al. \u201cEffect of compliance mismatch upon vascular graft patency\u201d, J. Vasc. Surg. 1987, 5; 376-82]., 75805=The mechanical parameters of the graft according to ISO 7198:1998 (E), were: general porosity of 68%, kinking diameter of 30 mm and dynamic compliance of 9%.}",
