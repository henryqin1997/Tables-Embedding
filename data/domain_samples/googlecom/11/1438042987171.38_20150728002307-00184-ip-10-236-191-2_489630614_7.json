Therefore, what is described in the following claims is given by way of general description and not of limitation, and what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is: It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that this invention finds great utility in the field of digital magnetic recordings or analog magnetic recordings where high density recording and read back systems are contemplated and where extremely accurate servo control of the position of the read back head or sensor is desired. Numerous applications of this type exist in a wide variety of technical fields as will be readily understood. APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, the servo control technique described together with the apparatus as shown can be used equally well to track narrow channel analog recordings since the output signal could be used directly without the logic and demodulator in such systems. Thus, enhanced tracking for audio recordings of the analog sort are also made possible by this",
