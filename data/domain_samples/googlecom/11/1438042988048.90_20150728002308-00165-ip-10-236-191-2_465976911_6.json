    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing, it is to be noted that the terms \"top\", \"bottom\", \"side\", \"vertically\", \"upper\", \"lower\", \"lowest\" and so forth are to be understood in this connection as conveniently indicating relative positions only and not that the element necessarily lies in any particular plane. Except for the above, this embodiment is substantially similar to the previous embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 6 and can produce substantially the same effect. This embodiment is further advantageous since the small ridges and grooves of the originally roughly flat filtering medium 42 can serve as spacers for defining spaces between the top and bottom sections 21a, 21b. More specifically, by the above coiling or winding, the subassembly of originally roughly flat filtering medium 42 and pleated filtering medium 21 are formed into a frustoconical shape. This is because the circumferential length of the subassembly does not substantially change at the front but reduces at the rear due to the fact that the apexes of the top sections 21a are caused to come nearer by the coiling. In this instance, by the effect of the small ridges and grooves, the originally roughly flat filtering medium 42 expands a little at the front and contracts at the rear, whereby to make it possible to attain the rolling of the unit of filtering mediums 21, 42 with ease. The tendency of being formed into the frustoconical shape can be reduced by bonding",
