Fine particles, such as biological cells or the like, within the sample are individually separated by a sheath flow method within a flow unit having a minute rectangular cross section of about 250 \u03bcm \ufffd 250 \u03bcm in a central portion of flow cell. Laser light is projected upon the flowing fine particles, and scattered light, fluorescence and the like which are thereby produced are subjected to photometry for each particle. The particles are measured at a high speed of 1000-5000 particles per second. A substance to be inspected is analyzed by statistically processing measured data of scattered light and fluorescence obtained about a large number of particles using a computer., 28908=A latex agglutination measuring method has also been known. In this method, a reagent prepared by sensitizing the surfaces of a large number of carrier fine particles, such as latex particles or the like, with monoclonal antibodies is mixed with a sample, such as serum or the like. If there exist desired antigens within the sample, latex particles combine with one another to form aggregates by the combining function of an antigen-antibody reaction. By introducing this reacted liquid into the flow cytometer, and performing measurement, an agglutinated state is discriminated to perform qualitative or quantitative measurement for the desired antigens. This method is specifically described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 304,236, filed Jan. 31, 1989.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations When the sample test tube 10 is mounted on the sample aspiration tube 5, the operator may mount the sample test tube 5 every time the tube is mounted. However, if an autosampler mechanism as illustrated in FIG. 7 is provided to successively and serially supply a plurality of samples, and a mechanical automatic mounting operation is thereby performed, it is possible to further increase efficiency when a large amount of samples are measured. In FIG. 7, a large number of test tube mounting portions 41 are provided along the direction of the outer circumference of a rotating turret 40, and sample test tubes 42 containing sample liquids are mounted thereon. A test tube is drawn out from a predetermined portion of the turret, 40 and is moved to the position of the sample aspiration tube 5 by a mechanism (not shown) as shown by a broken line. After the sample liquid has been aspirated within the apparatus from the sample aspiration tube 5, the vacant test tube is returned to its original position on the turret 40. The turret 40 then rotates by one step, and the next test tube is processed in the same manner. Although, in the above-described embodiments, the syringes 1 and 2 are used as pressurizing means for performing the extruding and aspirating operation of the sample liquid, the liquid may be extruded and aspirated by controlling air pressure within a",
