During the closing of the die, the slide 4.1\u2032 and the housing D19.6, connected fixedly to the latter, of the counterstay cylinder D19 are moved downward via the infeed cylinders G19. During this infeed movement, relative movement takes place between the piston rods and the cylinder housings of the working cylinders A19, of the knife-edged ring cylinder C19 and of the counterstay cylinder D19. The pressure medium is transferred from the upper cylinder spaces into the lower cylinder spaces. The operating mode of the double-acting cylinders is described in FIG. 1. A precision blanking press, as described in FIG. 17, is illustrated, the movable and fixed machine components having been reversed. The slide plate 1\u2032 is connected fixedly to the machine stand, and the function of the press slide is performed by the movable slide 4.1\u2032. The slide plate 1\u2032, crossmember A19.1 and plates 3\u2032 are connected fixedly to one another and together form the stand of the precision blanking press. Plates 3\u2032 are lengthened downward via the slide plates 1\u2032 and, in the region 3.2\u2032, form the foot of the stand. The housings of the two working cylinders A19 and the housing of the knife-edged ring cylinder C19 are connected fixedly to the stand by means of the crossmember A19.1. The two",
