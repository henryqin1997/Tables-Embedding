A 3210 gram amount of southern bleached kraft binder (NB-416, supplied by Weyerhaeuser Company) is air entrained in a blenderlike mixing device and sprayed with 2128 grams of a polyvinyl acetate latex (PN-3666H, supplied by H.B. Fuller of Minneapolis, Minn.). While still mixing, 4073 grams of a water swellable polyacrylate hydrogel (IM 1000-60, supplied by Hoechst-Celanese of Portsmouth, Va.) is added and the resulting mixture is then sprayed with 1160 grams of a 50% solution of polypropylene glycol (supplied by Union Carbide of Danbury, Conn.). The blender is then stopped and the mixture was shunted into a flash tube dryer. The dried product is then airlaid as a 16 inch wide web on a Danweb airlay machine, pressed to a density of approximately 0.15 g/cc, and thermobonded at 140\ufffd C. for thirty seconds. The resulting web would have 40% bound SAP and improved tensile strength (as compared to untreated fluff with SAP)., 113344=A 321 gram amount of NB-416 southern bleached kraft fluff obtained from Weyerhaeuser Company may be air-entrained in a blender-like mixing device and 100 grams of poly(caprolactone) diol (average molecular weight 2000, supplied by Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, Wis.) dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water may be sprayed onto the fluff as a binder. Then 435 grams of starch graft polyacrylate hydrogel fines (IM 1000F; supplied by Hoechst-Celanese of Portsmouth, Va.) may be added and mixed. The product may then be removed from the blender, and spread out in a fume hood to air dry overnight. The resulting product may then be airlaid on a small airlay line, from M & J Machines (of Horsens, Denmark) and thermobonded at 140\ufffd C. for one minute to produce a web containing 40% superabsorbent particles (SAP) attached to the individualized fibers. This binder has a low melting point, hence raising the temperature to 140\ufffd C. melted the binder and allows it to flow over the fibers and particles to enhance hydrogen bonding interactions and provide mechanical encapsulation that further binds the fibers and particles. This is an example of activating a solid binder by heating it, without liquid addition. A polypropylene glycol/polyethylene glycol copolymer binder would also behave in this manner., 73669=Superabsorbent particles are available commercially, for example starch graft polyacrylate hydrogel fines (IM 1000F) from Hoechst-Celanese of Portsmouth, Va., or larger particles such as granules. Other superabsorbent particles are marketed under the trademarks SANWET (supplied by Sanyo Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha), SUMIKA GEL (supplied by Sumitomo Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha and which is emulsion polymerized and spherical as opposed to solution polymerized ground particles), FAVOR (supplied by Stockhausen of Greensboro, N.C.), and NORSOCRYL (supplied by Atochem). The superabsorbent particles come in a variety of sizes and morphologies, for example IM 1000 and IM 1000F. The 1000F is finer and will pass through a 200 mesh screen whereas IM 1000 has particles that will not pass through a 60 mesh screen. Another type of superabsorbent particle is IM 5600 (agglomerated fines). Superabsorbent particulate hydrophilic polymers are also described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,340, which is incorporated herein by reference. That incorporated patent discloses hydrocolloid absorbent materials such as cross-linked polyacrylamides., 159747=Production of high bulk fibers with intrafiber crosslinks is known in the art. Processes for making such fibers are described in EP 440 472 A1; EP 427 317 A2; EP 427 316 A2; and EP 429 112 A2, as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/607,268 filed Oct. 31, 1990 and its published European counterpart, all of which are incorporated by reference. These high bulk fibers may be used in the present invention, with particles bound to them by the binders disclosed herein. Since methods of making high bulk fibers are known, only a brief description of one such process is given below., 175387=The treated fiber mats were fed at the rate of 8 meters/min. to the attrition device 32. The specific attrition device used in this example was equipped with six mat inlets and a rotor having 16 rows of hammers as described above around the circumference of the rotor. The rotor had a diameter of 30 inches and was rotated at an angular velocity of 1200 rpm by an electric motor. Other rpm rates have also been tested and have proven satisfactory, including extremely high rpm rates., 196050=The shown fiber 600 is elongated, and has an aspect ratio (ratio of length to width) of about 10:1 to 5:1, preferably about 10:1., 60643=The present invention includes a method of binding particles to fibers, and the product produced by that method. In particularly preferred embodiments, the product is a cellulosic or synthetic fiber to which superabsorbent hydrogel polymer particles are adhered by a binder, and absorbent products made therefrom. Suitable fibers include wood pulp fibers, which can be obtained from well known chemical processes such as the kraft and sulfite processes. In these processes, the best starting material is prepared from long fiber coniferous wood species, such as pine, douglas fir, spruce and hemlock. Wood pulp fibers can also be obtained from mechanical processes, such as ground wood, mechanical, thermomechanical, chemimechanical, and chemithermomechanical pulp processes. The fibers are preferably elongated, for example having a length to width ratio of about 10:1 to 5:1., 140214=Examination of that subtraction spectrum indicated several infrared bands that were obviously associated with the ascorbic acid. They were evident at 1755, 1690 (shifted slightly from 1660-1670), 868, 821, and 756 wavenumbers (cm-1). However, several other bands that were prominent in the ascorbic acid spectrum were absent in that subtraction spectrum. They included the following: 3525, 3410, 3318, 1319, 1119, and 1026 cm-1., 54297=In one preferred embodiment, an absorbent product comprises a fibrous cellulosic mat that contains superabsorbent hydrogel particles in particulate form. The superabsorbent particles form hydrogen bonds or coordinate covalent bonds with the binder, depending upon the binder, while the binder in turn forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose fibers. These noncovalent, relatively flexible bonds between the binder and particles maintain the particles in contact with the fibers, and resist dislodgement of the particles by mechanical forces applied to the mat during manufacture, storage or use. The binder may suitably be present in an amount of from about 3 to 80 percent of the total weight of the product, while the particles bound by the binder of the present invention (via hydrogen/coordinate covalent bonds) may suitably be present in an amount of 0.05 to 80 percent, preferably 1 to 80 percent or 5 to 80 percent, or more than 5 percent by weight. An especially suitable range of binder is 3 to 40 percent by weight, or 3 to 25 percent by weight, while a particularly suitable range of particles is 5 to 40 percent by weight. A preferred weight ratio of particle to binder is 2:1 to 4:1. An example of a suitable particle is a superabsorbent polymer such as a starch graft polyacrylate hydrogel fine or larger size particle such as a granule, which forms hydrogen bonds with the binder. The binder also forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose, thereby securely attaching the superabsorbent particles to the fibers., 190805=A 50 gram amount of polypropylene glycol is diluted with 50 grams deionized water. The resulting solution is sprayed on 321 grams of an intrafiber crosslinked cellulose fluff (HBA from Weyerhaeuser Company of Tacoma, Wash.) that was air entrained in a blender like mixing device. While the HBA fiber is still damp, 438 grams of IM 1000F (supplied by Hoechst-Celanese, of Portsmouth, Va.) is added to the mixture. The resultant mixture is then vacuumed from the blender and spread on a counter to dry overnight. Then 550 gram/square meter handsheets, six inches in diameter, are made in a laboratory padformer. Those pads are then pressed at 2000 and 3000 psi (or 60 and 90 pli in a calendar roll), respectively, to yield sheets with densities of 0.3 and 0.5 g/cc. Alternatively, pads of untreated HBA blended with 45% IM 1000F would require heating to 100\ufffd C. and pressures between 8,000 and 11,000 psi to produce pads of similar densities., 119849=A 3171 gram amount of southern bleached kraft fluff was air-entrained in a blender-like mixing device and 1000 grams of glycerin (96%, USP; supplied by Dow Chemical Co. of Midland, Mich.) diluted with 300 ml of deionized water was sprayed onto the fluff. Then 4348 grams of starch graft polyacrylate hydrogel fines (IM 1000F; supplied by Hoechst-Celanese of Portsmouth, Va.) was added to the mixing device and mixed with the fluff and binder. The material was then shunted into a flash tube dryer at 142\ufffd F., blown into a cyclone and fed into a Danweb airlay machine to form a web containing bound 40% IM 1000F that is substantially immobile in the web because the particles are bound to the fibers instead of mechanically entrapped by the matrix., 140684=The higher frequency bands (3300-3600 cm-1) in ascorbic acid are indicative of bonded OH groups. The infrared bands at 1319, 1119, and 1026 cm-1 may also be associated with OH vibrations. Consequently, the IR suggested that the subtraction spectrum reflected primarily a loss of the OH groups that were attached directly to the ring. A likely possibility is that the OH groups were replaced by sodium. The only other major band in the subtraction spectrum was located at 1589 cm-1. This was probably due to the superabsorber C\u2550O which had shifted to a slightly higher frequency (from 1562 cm-1).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having illustrated and described the principles of the invention in many preferred embodiments, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. We claim all modifications coming within the spirit and scope of the following claims. U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,889 discloses a process for adhering absorbent particles to pulp fibers using syrup, honey, and other polysaccharides such as dextrins. An essential requirement of these adhesive agents is that they must possess the property of being permanently pliable, and not rigidifying into a brittle film. The binders of the present invention, in contrast, are capable of functioning as a binder after solidifying into a rigid crystalline material. Even the binders of the present invention that do not rigidify into a solid (such as glycerin, low molecular weight PEG (below about 4000 g/mole) and PPG) are very hygroscopic, and can be present on fibers having a total water content of no more than 15%, or even 12%. This is in contrast to the adhesives such as honey and corn syrup disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,889 that are not hygroscopic. Polysaccharides (such as corn syrup, honey and dextrins) are excluded as binders from some embodiments of the invention because they are a fertile substrate for microbial growth. The polysaccharide polymers are also excluded from nonpolymeric embodiments of the binder. Moreover, monosaccharides and",
