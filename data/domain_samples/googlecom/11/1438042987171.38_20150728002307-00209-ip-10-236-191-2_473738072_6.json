    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42169=Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, there is illustrated therein the charge/discharge behavior of the hyperbranched carbon which were prepared at final treatment temperatures of 500\ufffd C. and 700\ufffd C. respectively, without addition of the lithium salt. Conversely, FIG. 5 illustrates the charge/discharge behavior of the hyperbranched carbon which was first prepared at 500\ufffd C., then treated with LiNO3 at 700\ufffd C. A perusal of FIG. 5 shows that the first cycle charge capacity was approximately 510 milliamps per hour per gram (mAh/g), with a reversal discharge capacity of 335 mAh/g. This is equivalent only if first cycle loss of 34%. Referring back to FIGS. 3 and 4, the corresponding first cycle charge capacities are 1475 and 720 mAh/g respectively, with discharge capacities of 475 and 400 mAh/g. The corresponding first cycle losses are thus 68% and 45% respectively. Thus, the surface treatment resulted in carbon products with improved first cycle efficiency. The implication of this is that when used as the negative component in an electrochemical cell, a lower amount of active material will have to be used in the positive electrode to compensate for this initial loss of capacity. The resulting consequence is a cell with improved gravimetric energy density., 26930=Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated therein a schematic representation of an electrochemical cell 10 such as a battery or an electrochemical capacitor, and including a carbon-based or amorphous carbon electrode fabricated in accordance with the instant invention. The electrochemical cell includes a positive electrode or cathode 20, a negative electrode or anode 30 and an electrolyte 40 disposed therebetween. The cell negative electrode 30 is fabricated of an amorphous carbon or carbon-based material such as that described in greater detail hereinbelow. The positive electrode 20 of the cell 10 may be fabricated from a lithiated transition metal oxide such as are well known in the art. Alternatively, the positive electrode material may be fabricated of a material such as that described in commonly assigned, co-pending patent application Ser.

Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Referring now to FIG. 6, there is illustrated therein the first ten charge/discharge cycles of the coin cell described in this Example II. Based on active anode material, lithium intercalation capacity of the hyperbranched carbon was calculated to be approximately 270 milliamperes per gram. FIG. 6 thus illustrates that a full conventional cell can be assembled and manufactured with modified carbon of the present invention. The cell is capable of charge/discharge cycling without considerable loss in capacity as experienced in the prior art. A second test cell was fabricated accordingly to this invention in a coin cell configuration with hyperbranched carbon as the anode and LiCoO2 as the cathode. The electrolyte was as that described hereinabove with respect to FIG. 1, with glass mat used as the separator. There was approximately 13.0 mg of active anode material and 31.8 mg of active cathode material. The area of the electrodes in this Example II was about 1.5 cm2. The coin cell was cycled between 2.5 and 4.2 volts with a current of 0.4 milliamperes. Example II An additional benefit may",
