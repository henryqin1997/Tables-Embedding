    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0032] In the FIG. 4 embodiment air from the base member passes along the periphery of the intermediate cartridge without being treated and into the main cartridge. At its return through the intermediate cartridge to the base member it passes through a cleaning and/or drying medium and an outlet filter. [0031] In the FIG. 3 embodiment the air from the base member passes the annular outer compartment through a filter and a cleaning and/or drying medium, before it enters the main cartridge. After having passed there through, it again enters the central compartment of the intermediate cartridge containing in this case only an outlet filter and returns to the base member. [0030] It is again to be emphasized that the contents and internal design of the intermediate cartridge may vary according to the specific requirements and the contents of the main cartridge. Two further embodiments are illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, which lack reference numerals for the sake of clarity. [0029] In this context, it may first be observed that the shown and described embodiment utilizes assembly based on thread engagement, which may be constructed in different ways. Other assembly means are equally feasible, such as a mounting ring cooperating with a lower flange of the main cartridge and attached by means of screw joints to the base member, as is well known in",
