    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55714=When the host computer 104 is not performing processing other than administration of photocopiers, the host computer 104 is generally in a state of waiting for reception signals from the modem 103 (step 1301). In the event there is reception, a password check is performed (step 1302). i.e., the ID sent from the communication control device is used for searching the ID and password table within the hard disk 1202 and judging from which communication control device the reception has been made, following which the corresponding password is sent to the communication control device. In the event that a signal indicating a failure is received from the communication control device (step 1303), the line is disconnected (step 1310), and in the event that a signal indicating OK is received (step 1303), jam data is received (step 1304). Once the data is received, the line is disconnected (step 1305), and the jam data is stored in the hard disk 1202 (step 1306). Subsequently, diagnosis processing is performed based on the jam data (step 1307). In the event that the diagnosis results reach a warning level, a warning is displayed on the display 1204, calling attention to the operator (steps 1308 and 1309)., 53660=In order to send data, the sending task is initiated, and first makes a telephone call to the host computer 104 at the administrative site (step 1101). Subsequently, a check is made whether or not proper connection has been made with the host computer 104 at the administrative site (step 1102). In the event that the attempt to connect fails, up to five retries are made following a certain amount of time. In the event attempt to connect fails even after five retries, the process is ended (steps 1107, 1108, 1109). In the event that a proper connection is made, a password check is performed (step 1103). i.e., the ID of the communication control device 101 is sent to the host computer 104, and comparison is made between the password sent from the host computer 104 and the password held by the communication control device 101 (step 1104). In the event that the passwords do not match, a signal is sent indicating a failure, and line cut-off processing is performed (step 1106). In the event that the passwords match, an OK signal is sent, and the contents of the jam recording table are sent to the host computer 104 (step 1105). Following sending of data, line cut-off processing is performed (1106), and the present task thus is completed., 61203=Next, as shown in FIG. 20 in step 2004, each individual risk is weighted, subjected to calculating, thus obtaining a single risk graph. In the example shown in FIG. 20, weighting is calculated with the following expression (2):, 59438=Next, the risk graph obtained in step 1403 is used for risk judgment (step 1404). Here, three types of warnings are set, namely, red, yellow, and green, with membership functions being used for judgment of each. This is illustrated in FIG. 19, with risk as the horizontal axis and the degree of match with each warning as the vertical axis. In the Figure, with the risk to the count value Ct at the present point as St, the yellow level is Yt, and the red level is Rt. In the event that the risk St exceeds the \"user visit\" level set beforehand, a \"user visit\" message is output onto the display 1204 (step 1405)., 50193=FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a jam code. The jam code is comprised of a cause 1601 and sensor No. 602, thus indicating the cause (delayed jam or stalled jam) regarding the No. sensor which has detected the jam., 61927=Also, an arraignment may be employed wherein past data regarding the frequency of maintenance requests from users is stored in the host computer, and this data is used to perform correction of the risk judgment threshold for each user. This is illustrated in FIG. 22. In the Figure, (a) indicates a case where the notification frequency is high, and (b) indicates a case where the notification frequency is low. In the event that the past frequency of notification from the user is high, the \"user visit\" level is set at a low value. In the event that the past frequency of notification from the user is low, the \"user visit\" level is set at a high value. Thus, even more appropriate jamming risk judgment can be made by optimizing the risk judgment threshold value in the above steps S1404 and S2005, thereby provided maintenance service according to each user., 55493=FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating the processing of the host computer 104. The processing routine illustrated in FIG. 13 is executed by the CPU 1200 following control programs stored in the RAM 1201., 58656=Next, fuzzy processing is performed to the filter output graph obtained in step 1402, thereby calculating risk (step 1403). This is illustrated in FIG. 18. In order to calculate the risk, a membership function with the filter value as the horizontal axis and risk as the vertical axis is created. Herein, 0 represents a safe value, 1 represents a danger value, and risk can be represented between 0 and 1. Using this membership function, calculating processing is performed regarding the aforementioned filter output graph, thus obtaining a risk graph with the counter value as the horizontal axis and risk as the vertical axis. In the state of the counter value being Cx, the filter value is represented by Fx, and the risk regarding the counter value Cx is Sx., 61794=Steps S2005 and S2006 are the same as steps S1404 and S1405, and accordingly description thereof will be omitted., 54928=FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of the host computer 104. 1200 denotes a CPU, controlling the overall computer. 1201 denotes RAM storing programs and data necessary for the CPU 1200 to perform data processing. 1202 denotes a hard disk for saving received data, the jam data all being saved here. 1203 denotes a keyboard for the operator to issue instructions from. 1204 denotes a display device for outputting information of the host computer 104. 1205 denotes a serial port for sending and receiving data with the modem 103., 57424=First, based on the jam data stored in the hard disk 1202, an accumulated jam curve such as shown in FIG. 16 is created for each jam code, with the counter value as the horizontal axis and with the accumulated number of jams as the vertical axis (step 1401)., 60853=Step S2001 is the same as step S1401, and accordingly description thereof will be omitted. Regarding steps S2002 and S2003, the processing performed in steps S1402 and S1403 is performed regarding a plurality of FIR filters (3,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000) with differing lengths, and individual risk graphs are calculated for each., 62829=Also, an arrangement may be employed wherein, based on mistaken warning/missing warning data 2310, correction of membership functions for the degree of matching is performed according to the results thereof. This is illustrated in FIG. 23. In the Figure, (a) illustrates a case where there has been a mistaken warning, and (b) illustrates a case where there has been a missing warning. Here, the term \"mistaken warning\" means a false warning, i.e., the above steps S1404 and S2305 yielded risk judgment results of \"user visit\", but an actual visit revealed no problems with the photocopier 100. Also, the term \"missing warning\" means failure to issue a warranted warning, i.e., a case where the user calls in for maintenance even though a \"user visit\" warning has not been issued. This mistaken warning/missing warning data is input to the host computer 104 from the keyboard 1203, so as to provide feedback to the risk judgment processing in the above steps S1404 and S2305, thereby performing optimizing of the threshold value. In the event that a mistaken warning occurs, correction is made to the membership function so that \"user visit\" is not output until a higher level of risk is reached. On the other hand, in the event that a missing warning occurs, correction is made to the membership function so that \"user visit\" is output until at the present level of risk. Consequently, mistaken warnings/missing warnings decrease, and judgment of jamming risk can be made in a more appropriate manner., 57117=In step 1307, the jam data stored in the hard disk 1202, comprised four pieces of data, namely, date, time, jam code, and counter value, as shown in FIG. 15, is classified by a photocopier under administration of the communication control device 101, and is stored in the hard disk 1202.}",
