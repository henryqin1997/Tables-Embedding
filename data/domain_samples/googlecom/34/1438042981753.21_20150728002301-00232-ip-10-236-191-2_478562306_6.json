Accordingly, all such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. In addition, the LAN bridge apparatus as described above can be utilized for a so called transparent bridge in the ring type LANs for carrying out the stripping function to strip off those packets which are transmitted into the ring type LAN and circulated through that ring type LAN once around. In this case, the DA detector 31 and the DA register 33 used in the embodiment described above are replaced by an SA detector and the SA register for obtaining the SA from each packet transmitting in the ring type LAN, while the address learning circuit 34 obtains the SA of each packet transmitted into the ring type LAN, and registering the FAT data with the obtained SA as the FA 51 in one of the entries of the FAT memory 37 specified by the FAT memory address generated by the FAT memory address generator 38 from the SA of that each packet. Then, the comparator 42 compares the FA 51 of the FAT data 50 registered in one of the entries of the FAT memory 37 specified by the FAT memory",
