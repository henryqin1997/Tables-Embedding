In order to allow the introduction of the head 217 in the interior volume V203 of the component 203, the opening 233 is provided with a widened zone 234 made in the vicinity of one of its ends and of which the width l234 is greater than the length L217. In order to guarantee that the head 217 is retained in the volume V203, the ring 232 is provided with two heels 238 and 238\u2032 intended to come into abutment against the exposed face 212 a of the metaphyseal part 212 when the component 201 is in place in the humerus, this blocking the ring 232 in the configuration of FIGS. 11 and 12 and avoiding a displacement of the head 217 in the direction of arrow F1 in FIG. 12, thus preventing an alignment of this head with the opening 204 and, consequently, the withdrawal of the head 217 from the volume V203. In this way, when the head 217 has been introduced in the volume 11203, it participates in the resistance of the assembly of the prosthesis P.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The characteristics of the different forms of embodiment may be combined together. In particular, the prosthesis of the second embodiment may be adapted to the shoulder, while the prostheses of the first and third embodiments may be adapted to the hip. The invention has been shown when used in total shoulder and hip prostheses. However, it is applicable with a shoulder prosthesis not having a glenoidal component, the anatomical surface of articulation of the glenoid cavity being used instead of the surface S2 represented in the Figures. Similarly, in the case of a hip prosthesis, the natural acetabular cavity may be used. As in the first embodiment, the surface S\u20321 is defined between the edges parallel to direction Y3 forming a slideway and between which the flange 218 may be introduced. Similarly, the surfaces S1 and S\u20321 may be portions of a sphere or of a cylinder, and even of other surfaces of adapted shape. The width l233 is slightly greater than the diameter d216 of the stem 216. According to another variant of the invention (not shown), elements in relief with the same function as the heels 238 and 238\u2032 may be provided on the face 212 a, and even on both components 201 and 203. .
