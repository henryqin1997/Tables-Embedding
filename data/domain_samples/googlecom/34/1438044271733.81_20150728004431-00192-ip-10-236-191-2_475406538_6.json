It is important toznote that the heat sink tab 24 extends on the opposite side of the circuit board 40 from the conductors of the printed circuit board 40, reducing the chance of short circuits between the circuit board conductors and the panel 50. Thus, it can be easily understood that the present invention avoids the costly requirements of additional heat sinks and provides an economical machine wired and single-bolt mounted electrical assembly. Due to this abutment of the heat sink tab 24 with the back surface 54 of the panel 50, the entire panel 50 acts as a heat sink to conduct the heat generated during operation away from the integrated circuit module 20. Referring to FIG. 2, the single mounting bolt feature of the present invention can be described. A hole 52, the diameter of which is slightly larger than the diameter of the threaded bushing 16, is drilled through the user's front instrument panel 50. Subsequently, the spindle 12 and threaded bushing 16, extending outward from the soldered assembly, are inserted through the hole 52 from the back surface 54 of the user's panel 50. The threaded bushing 16 must be sufficient in length to extend",
