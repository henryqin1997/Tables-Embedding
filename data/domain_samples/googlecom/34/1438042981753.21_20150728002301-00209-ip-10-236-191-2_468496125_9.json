    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. As an example of such another criterion, where residual space is available in one of the spaces p which can be filled by a filed, that residual space is used instead of allocating according to Qp. In this way, the unused space on a nearly full space is minimised and available space maximised in the other space(s) p. It is desirable to use the spaces p efficiently to maximise the data storage capacity. Thus in a preferred embodiments the allocation means, in addition to allocating data sets to the spaces p in accordance with the said factors Qp, allocates the data sets in accordance with at least one other criterion. The allocation of data using Qp spreads the data across the spaces p. The usage indices indicate whether a space p is capable of storing the data at the time of allocation. Where both Qp and usage indices are needed, Qp may be determined before or after the usage indices are determined to allocate a file to a storage space. The",
