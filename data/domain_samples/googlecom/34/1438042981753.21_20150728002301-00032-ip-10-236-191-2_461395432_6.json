Slit valve opening 44 allows transfer of a wafer (not shown) between processing chamber 16 and the exterior of system 10. Any conventional wafer transfer device (not shown) may achieve the aforementioned transfer. An example of a conventional wafer transfer device is described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,601, issued Aug. 20, 1990 to Maydan, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 47909=[0002] Additionally, this application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/798,251, entitled \u201cLid Assembly for a Processing System to Facilitate Sequential Deposition Techniques\u201d filed on Mar. 2, 2001, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/798,258, entitled \u201cProcessing Chamber and Method of Distributing Process Fluids Therein to Facilitate Sequential Deposition of Films\u201d filed on Mar. 2, 2001, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/605,596, entitled \u201cBifurcated Deposition Process For Depositing Refractory Metal Layer Employing Atomic Layer Deposition And Chemical Vapor Deposition\u201d filed on Jun. 28, 2000, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/678,266, entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus For Depositing Refractory Metal Layers Employing Sequential Deposition Techniques To Form Nucleation Layers\u201d filed on Oct. 3, 2000, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 58820=[0026]FIG. 2 is a top perspective view of one embodiment of a vacuum lid assembly 20. The vacuum lid assembly 20 includes a lid 20 a and a process fluid injection assembly 30 to deliver reactive, carrier, purge, cleaning and/or other fluids into the processing chamber 16. The fluid injection assembly 30 includes a gas manifold 34 mounting a plurality of control valves, 32 a, 32 b and 32 c, and a baffle plate 36 (shown in FIG. 3). Valves 32 a, 32 b and 32 c provide rapid and precise gas flow with valve open and close cycles of less than about one second, and in one embodiment, of less than about 0.1 second. In one embodiment, the valves 32 a, 32 b and 32 c are surface mounted, electronically controlled valves. One valve that may be utilized is available from Fujikin of Japan as part number FR-21-6.35 UGF-APD. Other valves that operate at substantially the same speed and precision may also be used., 75433=[0042] Referring to FIG. 9, disposed within processing chamber 16 is a heater/lift assembly 46 that includes a wafer support pedestal 48 connected to a support shaft 48 a. The support pedestal 48 is positioned between the shaft 48 a and the vacuum lid assembly 20 when the vacuum lid assembly 20 is in the closed position. The support shaft 48 a extends from the wafer support pedestal 48 away from vacuum lid assembly 20 through a passage formed in the housing 14. A bellows 50 is attached to a portion of the housing 14 disposed opposite to the lid assembly 20 to prevent leakage into the chamber 16 from between the support shaft 48 a and housing 14. The heater/lift assembly 46 may be moved vertically within the chamber 16 so that a distance between support pedestal 48 and vacuum lid assembly 20 may be controlled. A sensor (not shown) provides information concerning the position of support pedestal 48 within processing chamber 16. An example of a lifting mechanism for the support pedestal 48 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,776, issued Sep. 14, 1999 to Selyutin et al., entitled \u201cSelf-Aligning Lift Mechanism\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in it entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0051] Although the invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments, one skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications may be made that are within the scope of the present invention. For example, although three valves are shown, any number of valves may be provided, depending upon the number of differing process fluids employed to deposit a film. Therefore, the scope of the invention should not be based upon the foregoing description. Rather, the scope of the invention should be determined based upon the claims recited herein, including the full scope of equivalents thereof. [0050] One cycle of the sequential deposition technique in accordance with the present invention includes flowing the purge fluid, Ar, into the processing chamber 16 during time t1, before B2H6 is flowed into the processing chamber 16. During time t2, the process fluid B2H6 is flowed into the processing chamber 16 along with a carrier fluid, which in this example is Ar. After the flow of B2H6 terminates, the flow of Ar continues during time t3, purging the processing chamber 16 of B2H6. During time t4, the processing chamber 16 is pumped so as to remove all process fluids. After pumping of the processing chamber 16, the carrier fluid Ar is introduced during time t5, after which time the process fluid WF6 is introduced into the processing chamber 16, along with the carrier fluid",
