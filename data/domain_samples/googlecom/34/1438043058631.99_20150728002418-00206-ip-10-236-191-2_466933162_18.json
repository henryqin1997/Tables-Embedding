    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6172=The samples were prepared for analysis by first solvating the polymers in 100 milliliters of 0.05 Molar sodium nitrate. The polymer solutions were then stirred at 800 RPM and at 40\ufffd C. for a period of twenty-four hours in order to ensure sufficient hydration of the polymers. After solvation the solutions were ready for injection into the HPLC-GPC. The instrument consists of a Waters 2690 HPLC separation unit equipped with a Viscotek G600PWxL and GMPWxL separation columns and Viscotek T60 and LR40 detectors; the carrier eluent utilized is 0.05M sodium nitrate. Table 1 contains the data obtained for the Aqualon LMW guar and the GW-4 reference sample. The average molecular weight that was determined for the submitted LMW Guar was 270,000 daltons.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82827=In addition, enzymatic breakers may also be used in place of or in addition to a non-enzymatic breaker. Examples of suitable enzymatic breakers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,597 and No. 5,067,566. A breaking agent or breaker may be used as is or be encapsulated and activated by a variety of mechanisms including crushing by formation closure or dissolution by formation fluids. Such techniques are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,734; No. 4,741,401; No. 5,110,486; and No. 3,163,219. In some embodiments, an inorganic breaking agent is selected from alkaline earth metal or transition metal-based oxidizing agents, such as magnesium peroxides, zinc peroxides, and calcium peroxides. Other suitable breakers include the ester compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2002-0125012 A1, published Sep. 12, 2002., 42848=U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030045708 A1 (published Mar. 6, 2003) suggests methods for depolymerizing galactomannan and its derivatives. Compositions containing the depolymerized galactomannans are also described having particular polydispersity indices, weight average molecular weights (Mw), and viscosities. The compositions are suggested to be useful as a component of a hydraulic fracturing fluid., 42598=U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,436 (issued May 9, 2000) proposes the use of borate ion crosslinked galactomannan gums in fracturing fluids. The crosslinking is delayed by release of borate ions from a polyol complex., 104673=Higher combined concentrations inherently crosslink more rapidly. These data illustrate that although the crosslink times for a higher combined concentration of a given ratio of high MW: low MW mixture are faster the for lower combined concentrations, that higher ratios of the lower MW guar in bimodal blends are much slower. For example, a 50 pound 50:50 blend crosslinks more quickly than a 40 pound 50:50 bimodal blend, but much more slowly than a 50 pound 100% high MW guar., 42093=U.S. Pat. No. 6,017,855 (issued Jan. 25, 2000) suggests methods for fracturing subterranean formations using fluids having reduced polymer loadings. The fluids contain modified polymers having randomly distributed anionic substituents. The polymers can be crosslinked to form viscous gels that are stable at low polymer concentrations. Modification of the polymers lead to lowered C* concentrations (the concentration necessary to cause polymer chain overlap)., 61363=The polymer (or combined polymers if more than one is present) may be present in the fluid in concentrations ranging from about 0.05% to about 5.0% by weight of the liquid. The polymer can be present at about 0.1%, about 0.2%, about 0.3%, about 0.4%, about 0.5%, about 0.6%, about 0.7%, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 4%, about 5%, or at any range between any two of these values. Suitable ranges for the polymer include from about 0.20% to about 0.80% by weight or from about 0.12% to about 0.24% by weight. In some embodiments, about 20 pounds or less of a polymer is mixed with 1000 gallons of an aqueous fluid (2.4 kg per 1000 liters). For example, about 5, about 10, or about 15 pounds of a polymer may be mixed with 1000 gallons of an aqueous fluid (0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 kg per 1000 liters). Under certain circumstances, it is more advantageous to have reduced polymer loading (i.e., a polymer concentration of 0.24 wt. % or less or 20 ppt or less). This is because less damage would occur to a formation if a reduced level of polymers is used in a fracturing fluid. An additional benefit of reduced polymer loading may be increased fracture conductivity. Although it may be beneficial to employ polymers at a reduced level, a fracturing fluid may be formulated at a higher polymer level. For example, about 20 pounds or higher of a polymer may be mixed with 1000 gallons of an aqueous fluid (2.4 kg per 1000 liters). Specifically, about 25 pounds, about 30 pounds, about 35 pounds, about 40 pounds, about 45 pounds, about 50 pounds, about 55 pounds, or about 60 pounds of a polymer may be mixed with 1000 gallons of an aqueous fluid (3, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, 5.4, 6, 6.6, or 7.2 kg per 1000 liters). In some embodiments, about 65 pounds or more of a polymer may be mixed with 1000 gallons of an aqueous fluid (7.8 kg per 1000 liters)., 40251=U.S. Pat. No. 4,477,360 (issued Oct. 16, 1984) suggests the use of an aqueous gel containing a zirconium salt and a polyhydroxyl-containing compound. The gel is suggested for use in fracturing fluids, and has a high viscosity. The polyhydroxyl compounds have 3 to 7 carbon atoms, and a preferred compound is glycerol. Gelling agents include various polysaccharides., 40946=U.S. Pat. No. 5,305,832 (issued Apr. 26, 1994) proposes methods for using crosslinked guar polymers at a pH such that the cationic charge density of the polymer is at its maximum. The pH is chosen to minimize thermal degradation and to minimize polymer gel loading. The pH varied depending on the polymer used, but were typically in the range of about 10 to about 12., 40661=U.S. Pat. No. 4,635,727 (issued Jan. 13, 1987) offers methods of fracturing a subterranean formation using a base guar gum gel and a crosslinking system. A preferred crosslinking system includes zirconium lactate and aluminum chlorohydrate., 41762=U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,850 (issued Oct. 26, 1999) offers an aqueous metal hydrated galactomannan gum buffered to pH 9 to 11, and methods for its use in fracturing a subterranean formation. Metal ions suggested to crosslink the galactomannan gum include boron, zirconium, and titanium ions., 41358=U.S. Pat. No. 5,547,026 (issued Aug. 20, 1996) offers a blocking gel formed by blending a hydrated polymer solution with a selected polymer in an unhydrated particulate form. The gel can also contain a crosslinking agent and a breaking agent. The blocking gel is attractive, as it allows mixing and pumping at low viscosity which minimizes friction pressures.}",

High Performance Liquid Chromatography, occasionally referred to as High Pressure Liquid Chromatography in older texts, Gel Permeation Chromatography is a separation and detection technique. A sample, either liquid or a solid dissolved in a suitable solvent, is injected through micro-porous columns under pressure. The sample separates based on the affinity of the chemical components for the eluent/column and its physical size as it passes through the column packing material. The separated sample then passes through a series of detectors where the analysis is done, in this way",
