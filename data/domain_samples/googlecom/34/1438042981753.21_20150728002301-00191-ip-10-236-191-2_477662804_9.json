    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29566=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/581,002, filed Jun. 18, 2004. This application is a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. No. 10/961,352, now abandoned, filed Oct. 8, 2004 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE OF A BIOSENSOR TEST STRIP.\u201d This application is also related to application Ser. No. 10/871,937 filed Jun. 18, 2004, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 51494=Many methods are available for preparing test strips having multiple electrodes, such as carbon ink printing, silver paste silk-screening, scribing metalized plastic, electroplating, chemical plating, and photo-chemical etching, by way of non-limiting example. One method of preparing a test strip having additional electrode sense lines as described herein is by the use of laser ablation techniques. Examples of the use of these techniques in preparing electrodes for biosensors are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/866,030, \u201cBiosensors with Laser Ablation Electrodes with a Continuous Coverlay Channel\u201d filed May 25, 2001, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/411,940, entitled \u201cLaser Defined Features for Patterned Laminates and Electrode,\u201d filed Oct. 4, 1999, both disclosures incorporated herein by reference. Laser ablation is useful in preparing test strips according to the present invention because it allows conductive areas having extremely small feature sizes to be accurately manufactured in a repeatable manner. Laser ablation provides a means for adding the extra sense lines of the present invention to a test strip without increasing the size of the test strip.}",

If a defect is found, it can be compensated for or it can be indicated and the test strip 1200 can be disposed of and a new one used. This helps to eliminate errors in the measurement of the desired characteristic of the fluid sample. FIG. 12 , the design in FIG. 11 . The test strip 1200 includes a working sense line 826 and a counter sense line 224 that have respective points 1206, 1208 where they intersect respective electrodes 814 a, 216 a. Working sense line 826 and counter sense line 224 are conductive traces formed on substrate 12.
