Numerous modifications and changes will be obvious to those skilled in the art. Therefore, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and process shown and described herein, and accordingly, all modifications and equivalents which utilize a user accessible switch which limits a computer's access to its peripheral devices fall within the scope of this invention. Although the description above contains many embodiments and precise examples, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but merely provide illustrations of some of the principle ways in which the invention can be implemented. Once disclosed, customizing of this process to suit the individual needs of users and service providers will be obvious to one skilled in the art.
