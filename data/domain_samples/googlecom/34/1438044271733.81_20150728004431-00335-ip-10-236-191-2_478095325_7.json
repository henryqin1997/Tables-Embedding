It will be noted that there are 36 leads, 18 of which can supply 10 amps of current to any particular component of a unit under test while 18 return the current to the source. It is possible however to test more than 18 components at a given time. For example, 24 lines may feed 24 separate components with the remaining 12 lines serving as return conduits when appropriately bussed together. Referring to FIG. 12, the daughter board DB is specifically dedicated to the particular unit or component of the unit under test. The component or components are mounted on the daughter board and electrically connected by printed circuit to one of the contacts 132 on the lower edge of the board. When the daughter board is fully inserted into one of the ZIF connectors on the mother board, contact is made with the appropriate contacts 105, 106 in the ZIF connector to select the desired test voltage, in this instance 10 amps at 5 volts. The current returns along another line out of the daughter board DB into the mother board and thence back through the power interface assembly 80 to the source in the electronic test equipment unit. The current path is split, passing along parallel wires 90a and 90b to the connector ZIF 86 on the",
