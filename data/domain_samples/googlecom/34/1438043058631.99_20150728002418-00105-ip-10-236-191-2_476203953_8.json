    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56747=The station gear 1093 transmits the driving force from the motor 102 to a driving system for moving a photographic lens barrel 122 back and forth along the optical axis. A pair of screw gears 121a and 121b is interposed between the station gear 1093, and a gear 120 (see FIG. 2) formed on a rotary ring disposed round the periphery of the lens barrel 122. The rotational axes of the screw gears 121a and 121b are differentiated by 90\ufffd from each other. The speed-reduction ratio between the screw gears 121a and 121b is set to a value required for performing zooming operation. Under the state in which the planetary gear 106 is in engagement with the station gear 1093, when the planetary gear 106 rotates clockwise on its axis, zooming operation is switched from telescopic side to wide side, whereas when the planetary gear 106 rotates counterclockwise on its axis, zooming operation is switched from the wide side to the telescopic side as shown in FIGS. 6 or 7. In any case, a locking lever 1111 or 1112 prevents the rotation of the carrier 107 so as to prevent the planetary gear 106 from rotating round the sun gear 105, as will be described later., 73076=The magnet 115 functions as a stopper to the cam 113 when the rotational direction of the carrier 107 is reversed. When switching from one station gear to another, the magnet 115 is energized to attract the projection 113a or 113b of the cam 113 thereto and to prevent the rotation of the cam 113. As a result, the locking levers 1111, 1112 do not change their positions with respect to the cam 113. Accordingly, when the rotational direction of the motor 102 is reversed in this state, the carrier 107 is permitted to rotate in the direction that the locking projection 110 parts from the locking lever 1111 or 1112 which controls the orbital movement of the locking projection 110. In accordance with this motion of the carrier 107, the planetary gear 106 moves from one station gear to another. When the rotational direction of the motor 102 is reversed, the planetary gear 106 starts to rotate round the sun gear 105 behind time corresponding to the \"play\"., 72326=As described above, the sun gear 105 is connected to the output shaft 104 with the \"play\" provided. Therefore, when the rotational direction of the planetary gear 106 is reversed with respect to the same station gear, the cam 113 starts to rotate before the sun gear 105 does. Consequently, switching the locking levers 1111, 1112 is performed before the carrier 107 starts to rotate. The operation of reversing the rotational direction of the planetary gear 106 relative to the same station gear can be easily done by reversing the rotational direction of the motor 102., 61608=Referring to FIGS. 11 through 13, the spool locking mechanism comprises the carrier 107, a wedge-shaped cam surface 107a constituting of an inclined surface and a flat lower surface, and a spool locking lever 117 to be pressed downward in engagement with the cam surface 107a and urged by a spring (not shown) so that the spool locking lever 117 moves upward in disengagement from the cam surface 107a. A rack portion 117a formed at an end of the spool locking lever 117 engages the station gear 1094 due to the upward movement of the spool locking lever 117, thus preventing the rotation of the station gear 1094. The spool locking lever 117 is pivotally mounted on a shaft 117b, perpendicular to the shaft of the spool 101, located at the end thereof opposite the rack portion 117a. A pin 117c which moves on the cam surface 107a projects from the center of the spool locking lever 117. A pair of cam surfaces 107a are provided at locations on the carrier 107 so that the pin 117c faces either of the cam surfaces 107a when the planetary gear 106 engages the station gear 1091 or 1094. That is, when the planetary gear 106 is in engagement with the station gear 1094 or 1094, the spool locking lever 117 is pressed downward by the cam surface 107a, and hence the rack portion 117a of the spool locking lever 117 does not engage the station gear 1094. When the planetary gear 106 is not in engagement with the station gear 1091 or 1094, the spool locking lever 117 is not pressed downward by the cam surface 107a, and hence the rack portion 117a of the spool locking lever 117 engages the station gear 1094. As a result of the engagement between the rack portion 117a and the station gear 1094, the rotation of the station gear 1094 and the rotation of the spool 101 is thus prevented. In this manner, the spool 101 is prevented from being rotated by the speed reduction system 103 accommodated therein when the planetary gear 106 is revolving round the sun gear 105 or in engagement with the station gear 1093. Although, in FIG. 10, the pin 117c looks like it is being disposed on the flat cam surface 107a, the pin 117c is actually in engagement with the inclined surface thereof. With this state that the rack portion 117 partially engages the station gear 1094, the rotation of the station gear 1094 is prevented. The rack portion 117a, the shaft 117b, the pin 117c and the cam surface 107a are shown in only FIG. 1, not shown in FIGS. 3 through 10, for simplicity., 59946=As described above, the ring gear 101b of the speed-reduction system 103 is a rotatable gear disposed on the inner peripheral surface of the spool 101. Here, the spool 101 is in a floating state if this spool 101 is not restricted in motion except when the driving force of the motor 102 is transmitted to the spool gear 101a via the sun gear 105, the planetary gear 106, and each of the station gears 1091 -1094. With such a situation that-the spool 101 is in a floating state, the spool 101 is carelessly rotated when the film wound around the spool 101 is loosened, or when the planetary gears of the speed-reduction system 103 revolve or rotate on their respective axes. Therefore, in order to prevent the spool 101 from being in the floating state when the driving force from the motor 102 is not transmitted to the spool with the planetary gear 106 engaging the station gear 1093 as shown in FIGS. 6 or 7, or when planetary gear 106 moves around the sun gear 105 between the station gears 109 and 1094, as shown in FIGS. 8, 9 or 10, the actuating mechanism is constructed in such a way that the internal ring gear 101b acts as a fixed gear by stopping the rotation of the station gear 1094. That is, only when the planetary gear 106 is in engagement with the station gear 1091 or 1094 (see FIGS. 3 through 5), the rotation of the spool 101 is permitted; and, the rotation of the spool 101 is prevented in other situations (see FIGS. 6 through 10) with the provision of a spool locking mechanism which prevents the rotation of the station gear 1094., 80471=An actuating mechanism according to a second embodiment is described below with reference to FIGS. 15 through 25. Similarly to the first embodiment, stations can be switched from one to the other and the rotational direction of a planetary gear can be reversed with the mechanism comprising the output shaft of a reduction system connected to a sun gear with a \"play\" provided therebetween, a carrier having locking projections, locking levers driven by a cam and preventing the rotation of the carrier, namely, the rotation of the planetary gear around the sun gear, and a magnet serving as the stopper of the cam and performing attracting operation. Here, the mechanisms of the second embodiment having the same construction and operation as those of the first embodiment are not described. Unlike the first embodiment in which the magnet 115 having attracting portions at both ends thereof is used to allow the planetary gear 106 to rotate round the sun gear 105 clockwise and counterclockwise in switching the stations from one to the other, a magnet 215 according to the second embodiment has an attracting portion at one end thereof. Accordingly, the position of a projection 213a of a cam 213 is determined by being attracted to the magnet 215 in switching stations from one to the other. That is, the postures of locking levers 2111 and 2112 are kept constant when the projection 213a is attracted to the magnet 215, and thus the carrier 207 is rotatable in only one direction. Accordingly, the planetary gear 206 is allowed to rotate only clockwise in switching the stations from one to the other as shown in FIG. 15. The cam 213 is allowed to rotate in the range in which the projection 213a is rotatable between the magnet 215 and a stopper pin 230. The locking lever 2112 is pivoted by the cam 213, whereas the locking lever 2111 functions as a ratchet claw permitting the carrier 207 to rotate clockwise and preventing the carrier 207 from rotating counterclockwise. The locking lever 2111 acts an actuator for turning on a switch 231 each time the locking lever 2111 is pressed radially outwardly by a locking projection 2101-3 of the carrier 207. The switch 231 outputs signals each time the switch 231 is turned on, thus counting the number of stations through which the planetary gear 206 has passed., 57976=In the actuating mechanism, according to the embodiment, adopted in a camera of a type in which zooming operation is performed, backlash is eliminated by rotating the planetary gear 106 in the same direction before stopping in zooming operation. More specifically, for example, if it is constructed such that the lens barrel is moved from the wide side to the telescopic side, prevent the lens barrel movement from the telescopic side to the wide side, the planetary gear 106 is rotated a little bit in such a rotational direction that the lens barrel is moved from the wide side to the telescopic side before stopping. Similarly, if it is constructed such that the lens barrel is moved from the telescopic side to the wide side, prevent the lens barrel movement from the wide side to the telescopic side, the planetary gear 106 is rotated a little bit in such a rotational direction that the lens barrel is moved from the telescopic side to the wide side before stopping. In any case, when zooming operation is completed, the positional relationship between the planetary gear 106 and the station gear 1093 is as shown in FIG. 7. In this state, the film can be wound at any time. That is, in winding the film at a high speed after the shutter is released, the positional relationship between the planetary gear 106 and the station gear 1093 is changed from the state shown in FIG. 7 to that shown in FIG. 3 via the states shown in FIGS. 9 and 5. In winding the film at a low speed after the shutter is released, the positional relationship between the planetary gear 106 and the station gear 1093 is changed from the state shown in FIG. 7 to that shown in FIG. 4 via the states shown in FIGS. 6 and 10. In any case, FIGS. 5 and 6 show transitional states necessary only for the switchover, and the actual transmission of the driving force from the motor 102 to the driving force transmitting system is not performed., 77009=As described above, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the planetary gear 106 can be rotated round the sun gear 105 in both clockwise and counterclockwise direction to switch the driving force transmitting system, and the planetary gear 106 can also be rotated on its axis in both direction so that the rotations in both directions from the motor 102 can be transmitted to any one of the station gears 1091 -1094. In particular, the magnet can be constructed smaller than conventional plungers and constructed more inexpensively. A small force sufficed for disengaging the locking lever from the locking projection, because the locking projection to disengage never fails to part from the locking lever, thus making the force to drive the cam considerably smaller. That is, a greater force is not required to overcome the frictional force exerting between the locking lever and the locking portion according to the conventional art. By using the magnets, it is possible to make the actuating mechanism smaller and compact., 83345=In the second embodiment, as shown in FIG. 32, a spool gear 201a is formed on the peripheral surface of the upper end of the spool 201. A spool-driving gear 235 engages a gear 234 formed on the upper end of a shaft 233 extending vertically upward from the station gear 2093 and having a configuration similar to the station gear 2093. The spool-driving gear 235 engages the spool gear 201a. In winding the film, the state of the actuating mechanism is as shown in FIG. 17. Referring to FIG. 17, the sun gear 205 rotates counterclockwise while the planetary gear 206 does not rotate round the sun gear 205 but rotates on its axis in engagement with the station gear 2093, thus transmitting the driving force from the motor 202 to the station gear 2093 because the rotation of the carrier 207 is prevented by the locking lever 2111. The lens barrel 222 is driven by a worm gear 223 provided on the shaft 233. As shown in FIG. 36, a gear train of the film-rewinding system extends from the station gear 2092 along the bottom surface of the camera body. Referring to FIG. 36, reference numeral 240 shows a film cartridge and 241 shows a gear, connected with a fork (not shown), for driving the spool of the film cartridge 240., 85376=In switching film-winding operation to zooming operation, the rotational direction of the motor 202 is reversed and the magnet 215 is energized as shown in FIG. 17 so that the magnet 215 attracts the projection 213a of the cam 213 thereto. As a result, as shown in FIG. 18, the locking levers 2111 and 2112 allow the carrier 207 to rotate clockwise. That is, the planetary gear 206 disengages from the station gear 2093 and rotates counterclockwise round the sun gear 205, thus approaching a position adjacent the station gear 2091. At this time, the locking projection 2103 pushes the locking lever 2111 radially outwardly and the switch 231 is turned on, thus outputting a signal and the magnet de-energized. Consequently, the projection 213a is released from the magnet 215, the cam 213 rotates together with the carrier 207, and the projection 213a is moved into contact with the stopper pin 230 with the locking lever 2112 engaging the locking projection 2103. As a result, the rotation of the carrier 207 is stopped and the rotation of the planetary gear 206 around the sun gear 205 is stopped (see FIG. 19). When the motor 202 keeps rotating with the sun gear 205 rotating clockwise, the planetary gear 206 (see FIG. 19) rotates counterclockwise on its axis, thus transmitting the driving force from the motor 202 to the station gear 2091. At this time, the zooming operation is switched from the telescopic side to the wide side. When the rotational direction of the motor 202 is reversed, the cam 213 rotates counterclockwise while the sun gear 205 and the planetary gear 206 rest for a predetermined period of time corresponding to the \"play\", thus moving the projection 213a into contact with the magnet 215 (see FIG. 20). At this time, the locking lever 2112 disengages from the projection 2103 while the locking lever 2111 prevents the carrier 207 from rotating counterclockwise. Therefore, the planetary gear 206 starts to rotate clockwise on its axis, thus transmitting the driving force from the motor 202 to the station gear 2091. At this time, the zooming operation is switched from the wide side to the telescopic side. Similarly to the first embodiment, backlash is removed in the zooming operation in the second embodiment. When the zooming operation is completed, the actuating mechanism is set in the state, as shown in FIG. 20, for preparing the switch-over to the station gear 2093., 91606=FIGS. 22 through 25 show a transitional state of the actuating mechanism at each time when the station gear is switched from one to the other. FIG. 22 shows a switch-over preparation state with the magnet 215 energized through which the state of the actuating mechanism shown in FIG. 21 is switched to the state thereof shown in FIG. 17 or FIG. 19. FIG. 23 shows a state of the actuating mechanism in which when the planetary gear 206 passes-the station gear 2091, the switch 231 is turned on due to the operation of the locking lever 2111. FIG. 24 shows a state thereof in which when the planetary gear 206 passes the station gear 2092, the switch 231 is turned on due to the operation of the locking lever 2111. FIG. 25 shows another state thereof subsequent to the state shown in FIG. 17., 87967=FIGS. 19 or 20 shows the state immediately before the zooming operation is switched to the film-winding operation. When the state of the zooming operation is as shown in FIG. 19, the rotational direction of the motor 202 is reversed to obtain the state shown in FIG. 20 before the switching operation is started. When the magnet 215 is energized with the state shown in FIG. 20, the projection 213a is attracted to the magnet 215 and hence, the cam 213 is held at the position shown in FIG. 20. When the rotational direction of the motor 202 is switched from the counterclockwise direction to the clockwise direction, the carrier 207 starts to rotate and thus the planetary gear 206 starts to rotate clockwise round the sun gear 205 (see FIG. 18). When the planetary gear 206 continues to rotate clockwise round the sun gear 205, the locking lever 2111 passes over the locking projections 2102 and 2101 sequentially (from state shown in FIG. 20 to state shown in FIG. 24 via state shown in FIGS. 23 and 22). During this period of time, the switch 231 is turned on twice. When the switch 231 outputs a second signal, the magnet 215 is de-energized. As a result, the projection 213a is released from the magnet 215 and thus the cam 213 rotates together with the carrier 207, and the projection 213a is brought into contact with the stopper pin 230. Consequently, the locking lever 2112 engages the locking projection 2101. Thereafter, the carrier 207 stops rotation, and thus the planetary gear 206 stops rotating round the sun gear 205, thus engaging the station gear 2093. When the rotational direction of the motor 202 is reversed, the cam 213 rotates counterclockwise while the sun gear 205 and the planetary gear 206 rest for the period of time corresponding to the \"play\", and the projection 213a is brought into contact with the magnet 215. When the motor 202 continues to rotate further, the film-winding operation is performed in the state shown in FIG. 17., 69717=The operation due to the above mentioned construction is described below. That is, when the rotational direction of the motor 102 is switched reverse in order to reverse the rotational direction of the planetary gear 106 at the same station, the cam 113 starts to rotate instantly together with the output shaft 104 in the same direction. The sun gear 105, however, rests for the predetermined period of time corresponding to the \"play\", and when the \"play\" is up, the sun gear 105 starts rotating. And, during the time when the sun gear 105 stops, only the cam 113 rotates to drive the locking levers 1111, 1112. The time lag due to the \"play\" is so slight that a user can not notice. Owing to the \"play\", the switching of the locking levers 1111, 1112 is carried out reliably. The switching of the rotational direction of the motor 102 is described below with reference to FIGS. 3 and 5. In the state shown in FIG. 5, the sun gear 105 is rotating counterclockwise, and the planetary gear 106 is rotating clockwise on its axis in engagement with the station gear 1091. The force for rotating the planetary gear 106 round the sun gear 105 is checked by the locking lever 1111. At this time, the film is being rewound. When the rotational direction of the motor 102 is reversed, the sun gear 105 rests for the predetermined period of time during which the cam 113 rotates clockwise, thus allowing the projection 113a to contact the magnet 115 as shown in FIG. 3 and stopping, the rotation of the cam 113. As a result of the rotation of the cam 113, the locking lever 1111 disengages from the locking projection 1102, whereas the locking lever 1112 engages the locking projection 1102 as shown in FIG. 3. During the time of switching the locking levers 1111, 1112, the sun gear 105 rests. Consequently, the planetary gear 106 and the carrier 107 also rest. As a result of further rotation of the motor 102, the sun gear 105 starts to rotate clockwise after the predetermined period of time, corresponding to the \"play\" passing. The carrier 107 is prevented from rotating clockwise because the locking lever 1112 is in engagement with the locking projection 1102. Thus, the planetary gear 106 remains at the same position shown in FIG. 5, and it rotates on its axis counterclockwise, accepting the rotation of the motor 102. At this time, the film is wound at a normal speed (see FIG. 3)., 82895=A station gear 2091 is an input gear for transmitting the driving force from a motor 202 to a system for driving a photographic lens barrel 222 in zooming operation. A station gear 2092 is an input gear for transmitting the driving force from a motor 202 to a film-rewinding system. A station gear 2093 is an input gear for transmitting the driving force from a motor 202 to a film-winding system., 51163=This camera has the actuating mechanism in which the spool 101 can be rotated in a low speed driving mode and a normal speed driving (high speed) mode. The low speed mode thereof is selected when it is necessary to transmit the driving force of the motor 102 to the spool 101 at a large speed-reduction ratio. This low speed mode is selected in winding the film, for example, when the output voltage of the power source driving the motor 102 starts dropping down, when temperature is low, or when it is necessary to feed out the film from a film cartridge with a bigger fiction force. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the driving force from the motor 102 is transmitted via the station gear 1091 or 1094 to a spool gear 101a formed on the peripheral surface of the lower end portion of the spool 101. The station gear 1091 is a first spool-driving gear for rotating the spool 101 at a high speed, whereas the station gear 1094 is a second spool-driving gear for rotating the spool 101 at a low speed. The station gear 1094 is constructed to be a double-gear for speed reduction. In this construction, the planetary gear 106 engages its larger gear of the station gear 1094 or disengages therefrom, and a smaller gear of the station gear 1094 is always in engagement with the spool gear 101a. The station gears 1091 and 1094 are disposed at both ends of the group gears 1091 -1094 around the sun gear 105 as shown in FIG. 1., 74869=For example, in case that the planetary gear 106 changes its position from the state, in which the film is being rewound, shown in FIG. 5 to the state, in which the driving force from the motor 102 is transmitted to the station gear 1093, shown in FIG. 7 via the state shown in FIG. 8, the magnet 115 is energized, thus attracting the projection 113b thereto. Accordingly, the locking levers 1111 and 1112 keep their state shown in FIG. 5. When the rotational direction of the motor 102 is reversed with the positional state shown in FIG. 5 being kept, the sun gear 105 starts to rotate clockwise behind time corresponding to the \"play\", and the planetary gear 106 starts rotating round the sun gear 105 in the direction that the planetary gear 106 disengages and parts from the station gears 1091 and 1092 (see FIG. 8). When the magnet 115 is deenergized just before the arrival of the planetary gear 106 at a position corresponding to the station gear 1093, the cam 113 is free to move. As a result, the rotation of the output shaft 104 is transmitted to the cam 113 via the friction spring 114, and the attracted portion 113b of the cam 113 starts parting from the magnet 115, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 7. In accordance with the rotation of the carrier 107, the locking projection 1101 formed on the carrier 107 moves in between the locking lever 1111 and 1112, the locking lever 1111 is pressed radially outwardly by the cam 113, and the locking projection 110 is stopped by the locking lever 1112 with the locking lever 1112 being moved radially inwardly as shown in FIG. 7. This position corresponds to the position where the planetary gear 106 engages the station gear 1093 and the driving force from the motor 102 is transmitted thereto. As described previously, the spool locking lever 117 prevents the rotation of the station gear 1094 and the spool 101 after the planetary gear 106 parts from the station gears 1094 and 1092., 50705=Station gears 1091 -1094 are disposed along the orbit of the planetary gear 106 so that the station gears 1091 -1094 serve as input terminals for transmitting the driving force from the motor 102 via the sun gear 105 and the planetary gear 106 to a mechanism for winding a film, a mechanism for rewinding the film, a mechanism for moving photographing lens back and forth, and other mechanisms., 79316=On the other hand, if one wants to reverse the rotational direction of the planetary gear 106 around the sun gear 105, switching from one station gear to another can be performed after reversing the control direction by the locking levers 1111 and 1112. In this case, if the rotational direction of the motor 102 is reversed a bit, and if the rotated amount thereof is detected from the position of the cam 113, it is possible to freely select the attracted portion 113a, 113b to be attracted by the magnet 115. In this construction, it is free to choose the direction of rotation of the planetary gear around the sun gear in order to switch from one station gear to another., 54184=The station gear 1092 transmits the driving force from the motor 102 to a film-rewinding system 124. In the state that the planetary gear 106 engages the station gear 1092, the planetary gear 106 also engages the station gear 1091. As a result, the spool 101 is driven at a high speed both in film-winding and film-rewinding directions. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 5, a clutch mechanism constructed from another planetary gear mechanism PG is installed in the camera, by which only when the film is rewound, i.e., when the planetary gear 106 rotates clockwise on its axis, the driving force from the motor 102 is transmitted to the film-rewinding system 124. The gear train of the film-rewinding system 124 is shown in FIGS. 34 and 35. Reference numeral 140 denotes a film cartridge, and 141 denotes a gear connected with a fork (not shown) for driving the spool of the cartridge 140., 74111=The magnet 115 is de-energized in correspondence with the timing when the planetary gear 106 arrives at the position corresponding to any desired station gear. As a result, the cam 113 starts to rotate, switching the locking levers 1111, 1112 is performed, and the carrier 107 is locked by the locking lever 1111 or 1112 so that the planetary gear 106 is stopped at a desired station gear. A code indicating the rotational position of the carrier 107 is provided thereon. A photoreflector 116 is positioned to face the code so as to read it. This positional detection mechanism comprising the code and the photoreflector 116 allows the location of the planetary gear 106 to be always monitored., 90027=When the roll of film is completely taken up around the spool 201, the film is forcibly stopped. Then, the state of the actuating mechanism shown in FIG. 17 changes to the state thereof shown in FIGS. 21 via the states shown in FIGS. 18 and 23. When the planetary gear 206 approaches to a position immediately before the station gear 2091, the locking projection 2103 presses the locking lever 2111 radially outwardly, thus turning on the switch 231. When the planetary 10 gear 206 approaches to a position immediately before the station gear 2092, the switch 231 is turned on again, thus outputting a second signal due to the operation of the locking projection 2102 as shown in FIG. 23. When the switch 231 outputs the second signal, the magnet 215 is de-energized. As a result, the projection 213a is released from the magnet 215 and thus the cam 213 rotates together with the carrier 207, and the projection 213a is brought into contact with the stopper pin 230. Consequently, the locking lever 2112 engages the locking projection 2101. Thereafter, the carrier 207 stops rotation, and the planetary gear 206 stops rotating round the sun gear 205 (see FIG. 21). When the motor 202 continues to rotate further with the sun gear 205 rotating clockwise, the planetary gear 206 rotates counterclockwise on its axis with the state shown in FIG. 21 maintained, thus transmitting the driving force of the motor 202 to the station gear 2092. At this time, the film is rewound., 52722=In the gear mechanism for driving the spool 101, the driving force from the motor 102 is transmitted to the spool gear 101a via the sun gear 105 installed on the output shaft 104 of the speed-reduction system 103, the planetary gear 106, and the station gear 1091 or 1094. As shown in FIG. 2, an internal ring gear 101b is formed on the inner surface of the lower end of the spool 101. This functions as a peripheral side gear of the speed-reduction system 103 with respect to three planetary gears disposed vertically in triple-stair. That is, the internal ring gear 101b is not a gear fixed, but a gear rotatable. The speed-reduction system 103 thus comprising the planetary gear train and rotatable ring gear is able to provide a greater speed-reduction ratio than a speed-reduction gear system comprising gears having the same number of teeth and a fixed ring gear. In addition, the speed-reduction system 103 can be accommodated inside the spool 101, thus allowing the camera to be shorter and compact. In a conventional speed-reduction gear system having a fixed ring gear, in order to accommodate the fixed ring gear inside a spool, it is required to make the diameter of the fixed ring gear smaller than that of the rotatable ring gear according to the present embodiment by the thickness of the fixed ring gear, namely, to make the speed-reduction gear ratio smaller or to make the diameter of the spool larger., 78503=Providing a means for detecting the rotational position of the cam 113 makes it possible to carry out the following control. That is, for example, in case the planetary gear 106 changes its position from one state so that the planetary gear 106 engages one station gear 1093 to another state that the planetary gear 106 engages another station gear, the planetary gear 106 has two directions to rotate around the sun gear 105. Here, one of the attracted portions 113a, 113b of the cam 113 contacts the magnet 115 in accordance with a rotational direction of the motor 102; therefore, the planetary gear 106 can be allowed to rotate only in one direction in order to switch from one station gear to another with the attracted portion of the cam 113 being attracted to the magnet 115., 34334=This application is a continuation, of application Ser. No. 08/175 307, filed Dec. 29 1993., 64504=As regards the mechanism for preventing the planetary gear 106 from rotating round the sun gear 105, the substantially circular carrier 107 is rotatably installed on the output shaft 104 of the speed-reduction system 103 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The planetary gear 106 is frictionally installed on one side of the carrier 107 via the spring 108 in between them. A pair of gear-tooth-shaped locking projections 1101 and 1102 are formed on the carrier 107 at locations substantially opposite the planetary gear 106. A pair of locking levers 1111 and 1112 each of which has a leading end portion able to engage the locking projection 1101 and 1102 and to disengage therefrom are formed at positions facing the locking projections 1101 and 1102. The base portion of each locking levers 1111, 1112 is pivotally mounted on the camera body, and the locking levers 1111 and 1112 are biased by a spring 112 at an intermediate portion therebetween in such a direction as the leading end of each locking lever 1111, 1112 engages the locking projection 1101, 1102. The locking lever 1111 engages the locking projection 1101 or 1102, thus preventing the carrier 107 from rotating counterclockwise, namely, the counterclockwise rotation of the planetary gear 106 round the sun gear 105. The locking lever 1112 engages the locking projection 1101, 1102, thus preventing the carrier 107 from rotating clockwise, namely, the--clockwise rotation of the planetary gear 106 round the sun gear 105. A cam 113 for allowing the engagement of the locking levers 1111, 1112 with the locking projection 1101, 1102 and the disengagement thereof from the locking projection 1101, 1102 is frictionally installed on an end of the output shaft 104 of the speed-reduction system 103 via a spring 114. The substantially circular cam 113 has a concave formed at a portion of the periphery thereof, thus forming a cam profile. The cam 113 allows one of the locking levers 1111, 1112 to engage one of the locking projections 1101, 1102 and allows the other of the locking levers 1112, 111, to disengage from the same locking projections 1102, 1101. Accordingly, when the carrier 107 rotates in one direction, it is prevented from rotating in the other direction by the cam 113. Each cam follower 111a, 111a which moves along the cam profile is integrated with the locking lever 1111, 1112, respectively. The cam 113 rotates with the output shaft 104, and the amount of its rotation is limited to a predetermined range at which the planetary gear 106 is allowed or is not allowed to rotate round the sun gear 105. As shown in FIG. 1, the cam 113 has a pair of attracted portions 113a and 113b projecting therefrom, while a magnet 115 having attracting ends is installed tends is installed therebetween. The rotatable angle of the cam 113 is limited to a predetermined degree so that when the cam 113 rotates in one direction, one of the projections 113a, 113b is brought into contact with one of the attracting portions of the magnet 115; and when the cam 113 rotates in the opposite direction, the other of the projections 113b, 113a is brought into contact with the other of the attracting portions of the magnetic 115. In other words, the magnet 115 acts as the stopper of the cam, thus limiting the rotatable range of the cam 113. The magnet 115 is switched on when switching one station gear to another, the operation of which is described later. Even though the motor 102 keeps rotating with the attracted portion 113a, 113b bumping the attracting portion of the magnet 115, the cam 113 keeps stopping because the cam 113 keeps slipping against the output shaft 104 via the spring 114.}",

Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom. Station gears 4091 and 4092 sandwiching two idle gears in between them are rotated in opposite rotational directions by a common driving system, and they allow zooming operation to be performed from the telescopic side to the wide side or vice versa. It is also possible to adopt a one-direction clutch mechanism having a known construction instead of a ratchet mechanism having a locking lever 411. In each embodiment described above, the station gears can be rotated in two rotational directions. If it is desired that each station gear is rotated only in one rotational direction, the actuating mechanism can be made simple in construction. That is, the actuating mechanism can be constructed such that one locking lever 411 provided therein acts as a ratchet claw which allows the planetary carrier 407 to rotate only in one rotational direction, as shown in FIG. 31. In an example shown in FIG. 31, even if the sun gear 405 rotates clockwise, the rotation of the planetary carrier 407 is prevented by the",
