In the cross-sectional view of FIG. 4, it can be seen that the shown trench 28 has a bottom periphery with a horizontally-extending width \u201cW\u201d. Such width can be, for example, at least about 50 \u212b; in some cases from about 50 \u212b to about 5000 \u212b; from about 50 \u212b to about 1000 \u212b; or from about 50 \u212b to about 500 \u212b. Also in the shown cross-sectional view, the trench has a pair of facets 32 on opposing sides of the trench relative to one another. The facet on the shown left side of the trench has a horizontally-extending width \u201cX\u201d, and the facet on the right side of the trench has a horizontally extending width \u201cY\u201d. Dimensions of the horizontally extending widths X and Y can be from about 10% to about 400% of the dimension of horizontally extending width \u201cW\u201d, and can be, for example, from about 10% to about 50% of the horizontally-extending width \u201cW\u201d, or in particular aspects can be from about 15% to about 25% of the horizontally-extending width \u201cW\u201d. In some aspects, each of the widths \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d can be from about 50 \u212b to about 300 \u212b, and in particular aspects can be from about 100 \u212b to about 300 \u212b.}",

Trenches 28 can be initially formed to a total depth \u201cD\u201d of from about 1000 \u212b to about 6000 \u212b, and the remaining depth \u201cR\u201d after reduction of the height of bitline material 46/48/50 can be from about 5000 \u212b to about 3000 \u212b. The remaining depth \u201cR\u201d is typically from about 750 \u212b to about 1250 \u212b, with a common dimension being about 1000 \u212b., 39046=This patent resulted from a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser.
