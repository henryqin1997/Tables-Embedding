FIG. 5 shows the completed assemblage. After encapsulant 52 has cured, flap 14 is wrapped around electrodes 20, 22 and 24. Completely enclosing and electrically shielding the electrodes, flap 14 may be closed upon itself and held with a medical adhesive or may be held using sutures 54 as shown. FIG. 4 shows the electrode assembly during implantation. Tube 10 is held parallel to the nerve 50. Electrodes 20, 22 and 24 are wrapped about nerve 50. The interelectrode spacing may be readily adjusted. The electrodes (i.e., electrodes 20, 22 and 24) are wrapped sufficiently tightly around nerve 50 so that contact is made around the entire circumference. The conductive polymer gel provides electrical contact but is soft enough to prevent trauma. When electrodes 20, 22 and 24 are in the desired position, rapidly curing encapsulant 52 is applied to fixedly attach electrodes 20, 22 and 24 to nerve 50. A common medical adhesive may be used for encapsulant 52 which must be a dielectric. FIG. 3 is an end sectional view of tube 10. Shield 12 is directly connected to conducting shielding material 38. Preferably, conducting shielding material 38 is merely an extension of shield 12. Dielectric material 36 is shown in the preferred configuration wherein it is simply",
