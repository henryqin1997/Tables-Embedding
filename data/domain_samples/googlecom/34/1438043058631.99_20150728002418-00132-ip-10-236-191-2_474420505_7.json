Therefore, it will be seen that the apparatus 10 for enhancing the performance of a heat pump 11 provides a fully dependable and practical means for producing conditioned air which has preselected temperature parameters during periods of environmental ambient air temperatures which have heretofore inhibited efficient heat pump operation, and which further reduces to an absolute minimum the possibility of inhibited heat pump operation which would be attributed to the formation of ice or frost on the outside oil 280 during periods of extremely low environmental temperatures, and which is both of sturdy and dependable construction and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and maintain. As earlier discussed, when the temperature of the refrigerant falls below 40\ufffd Fahrenheit, the second temperature control 390 is operable to create a closed electrical condition whereby 110 volt power 301 reaches the first quartz heater 191 thereby energizing it. The quartz heater in turn, is operable to heat the refrigerant coursing through the first auxiliary coil 180 thereby raising its temperature with the attendant benefits earlier discussed. Further when the temperature of the refrigerant falls below 32\ufffd Fahrenheit, the first temperature control 353 is",
