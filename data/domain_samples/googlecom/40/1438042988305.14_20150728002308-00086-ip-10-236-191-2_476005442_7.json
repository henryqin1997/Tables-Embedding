    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As shown, the paired modular redundant architecture of the invention allows for varying levels of fault resilience and fault tolerance through use of CEs that operate asynchronously in real time and are controlled by IOPs to operate synchronously in meta time. This architecture is simple and cost-effective, and can be expanded or upgraded with minimal difficulty. Referring to FIG. 10, one embodiment of a disaster tolerant system 260 includes two fault tolerant systems 230 located in remote locations and connected by communications link 262, such as Ethernet or fiber, and operating in meta time lockstep with each other. To obtain meta time lockstep, all IPI packets are transmitted between fault tolerant systems 230. Like system 220, system 260 allows for hardware and software upgrades without service interruption. If one row and both columns have mismatch indicators, then the IOP 202 corresponding to the mismatched row has faulted. Depending on the operating mode of system 200, the other IOP 202 either disables the faulty IOP 202 or shuts down system 200. If one row and one column have mismatch indicators, then the path between the IOP 202 corresponding to the mismatched row and the CE 204 corresponding to the mismatched column has failed. Depending on the operating mode of system 200, IOPs 202 either account for the failed path in future processing or shut down system 200. It both rows and neither column have mismatch indicators, then",
