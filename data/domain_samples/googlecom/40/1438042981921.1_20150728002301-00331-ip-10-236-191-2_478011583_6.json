    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{106674=[0085] The same concept of the performance testing feedback loop implemented in the fifth embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 7 may also be applied to the first three embodiments of the invention, as shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 8 shows an apparatus 1000 which is comprised of a commercial transition modification device 1030, a targeted automated commercial detection device 1050, and a performance testing decision device 1070. Device 1030 may be similar to devices 170, 270 and 370 as shown in FIGS. 1-3, respectively. Devices 1050 and 1070 may be similar to devices 950 and 970 of FIG. 7, respectively. The commercial transition modification device 1030 is connected by a bus 1030 a to the targeted automated commercial detection device 1050. Device 1030 is connected to bus 1000 a, for receiving a video signal and a commercial transition indication signal, similar to the busses 170 a, 270 a, and 370 a of FIGS. 1-3, respectively. Device 1030 also is connected to a bus 1030 a for outputting an interim modified video signal to the targeted automated commercial detection device 1050. Device 1050 supplies the automated commercial detection results via bus 1050 a to performance testing decision device 1070. The performance testing decision device 1070 is connected back to the commercial transition modification device 1030 via a feedback bus 1070 a. Device 1070 is also connected to a bus 1000 b for outputting the final modified video signal with proven undetectable commercial transitions., 108525=[0086] In operation, a first modified video signal on bus 1030 a, which is similar to the buses 170 b, 270 b and 370 b as shown in FIGS. 1-3, will be fed into a targeted automated commercial detection device 1050, similar to the device 950 in FIG. 7. The targeted automated commercial detection device 1050 tries to detect commercials from a first modified video signal. The commercial detection results are then fed into performance testing decision device 1070 similar to the device 970 shown in FIG. 7 that determines if the first modified commercial transitions in the first modified video signal are still detectable. If a modified commercial transition is still detectable, the performance testing decision device 1070 will send a first modified video signal back to the commercial transition modification device 1030 and request via a control signal a new modified commercial transition to be generated for replacing the detectable one and thus a new modified video signal. The control signal may indicate which transitions have been detected and therefore need to be modified. The commercial transition modification device 1030 will generate further modified commercial transitions based on the feedback signal and replace the detectable first modified commercial transitions with them. A second modified video signal with second modified commercial transitions will then be tested again. Only when all modified commercial transitions in a particular modified video signal are no longer detectable, the device 1070 will break the performance testing feedback loop and output the final modified video signal with the proven undetectable commercial transitions for broadcasting on bus 1000 b.}",
