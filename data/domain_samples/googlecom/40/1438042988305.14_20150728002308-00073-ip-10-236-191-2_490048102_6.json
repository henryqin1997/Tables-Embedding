Vacuum induced healing of open wounds has recently been popularized by Kinetic Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Tex., by its commercially available V.A.C.\ufffd product line. The vacuum induced healing process has been described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,880 issued on Nov. 13, 1990 to Zamierowski, as well as its continuations and continuations in part, U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,396, issued on Mar. 31, 1992, U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,893, issued Nov. 16, 1993, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,293, issued Jun. 18, 1996, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by this reference. Further improvements and modifications of the vacuum induced healing process are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,267, issued on Jun. 6, 2000 to Zamierowski and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,636,643 and 5,645,081 issued to Argenta et al. on Jun. 10, 1997 and Jul. 8, 1997 respectively, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Additional improvements have also been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,142,982, issued on May 13, 1998 to Hunt, et al., 26015=[0001] This application is a continuation of co-pending U.S. patent application No. 10/085,321, which is a continuation-in-part, of U.S. patent application No. 09/579,755, entitled \u201cTranscutaneous Blood Gas Monitoring with Vacuum Pefusion,\u201d filed on May 26, 2000, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0032] While the foregoing description is exemplary of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts will recognize the many variations, alterations, modifications, substitutions and the like as are readily possible, especially in light of this description and the accompanying drawings. For example, a membrane or other like switch pad 26 may be implemented for user control of the transcutaneous blood gas monitor 10 and/or a display, printer or other output device 27 may be provided for monitoring and/or recording of estimated partial pressures. Likewise, a pressure transducer 28 may be, and preferably is, provided for monitoring and control of the vacuum applied to the patient 14. In any case, because the scope of the present invention is much broader than any particular embodiment, the foregoing detailed description should not be construed as a limitation of the scope of the present invention, which is limited only by the claims that may be drawn hereto. What is claimed is: [0031] In an alternate embodiment, not shown, a separate vacuum source may be utilized to provide negative pressure to the wound site 30 and another vacuum source utilized to provide vacuum perfusion to the blood gas transducer 13. [0030] Referring now to FIG. 3, a collection canister 34 may be interposed between the vacuum source 12 and the screen 32. As suction is applied,",
