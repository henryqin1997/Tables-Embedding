No. 09/156,355, filed Sep. 18, 1998, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ASSIGNING A CONFIDENCE LEVEL TO A TERM WITHIN A USER KNOWLEDGE PROFILE, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,377,949., 129789=FIG. 15B illustrates an exemplary method 260/262, according to one embodiment of the present invention, of storing a term in either a public or private portion of a user knowledge profile. Specifically, a respective term is added to a notification list at step 1264, following the determination made at decision box 258, as illustrated in FIG. 15A. At decision box 1268, a determination is made as to whether a predetermined number of terms have been accumulated within the notification list, or whether a predetermined time period has passed. If these conditions are not met, the method waits for additional terms to be added to the notification list, or for further time to pass, at step 1266, before looping back to the step 1264. On the other hand, should a condition within the decision box 1268 have been met, the method proceeds to step 1270, where the notification list, that includes a predetermined number of terms that are to be added to the user knowledge profile, is displayed to a user. The notification list may be provided to the user in the form of an e-mail message, or alternatively the user may be directed to a web site (e.g., by a URL included within e-mail message) that displays the notification list. In yet a further embodiment, the notification list may be displayed on a web or intranet page that is frequently accessed by the user, such as a home page. At step 1272, the user then selects terms that are to be included in the public portion of the user knowledge profile. For example, the user may select appropriate buttons displayed alongside the various terms within the notification list to identify terms for either the public or private portions of the user knowledge profile. At step 1274, private flags, such as those contained within the \u201cprivate flag\u201d column 119 of the user-term table 112 as shown in FIG. 16B, may be set to a logical zero \u201c0\u201d to indicate that the terms selected by the user are included within the public portion. Similarly, private flags may be set to a logical one \u201c1\u201d to indicate terms that were not selected by the user for inclusion within the public portion are by default included within the private portion. It will of course be appreciated that the user may, at step 1272, select terms to be included within the private portion, in which case un-selected terms will by default be included within the public portion. The method then ends at step 1280., 109454=FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a high-level method 148, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, by which terms may be extracted from an electronic document, and by which confidence level values may be assigned such terms. The method 148 comprises two primary operations, namely a term extraction operation indicated at 152, and a confidence level value assigning operation, indicated at a 154. The method 148 implements one methodology by which the step 148 shown in FIG. 7 may be accomplished. The method 148 begins at step 160, and then proceeds to step 162, where an electronic document, such as for example an e-mail, a database query, a HTML document and or a database query, is received at the knowledge site management server 27 via the mail system interface 42. For the purposes of explanation, the present example will assume that an e-mail message, addressed to the KS mailbox 25, is received at the knowledge site management server 27 via the mail system interface 42, from the e-mail server 23. At step 164, terms and associated information are extracted from the electronic document. Specifically, the e-mail message is propagated from the mail system interface 42 to the term extractor 46, which then extracts terms in the form of, for example, grammar terms, noun phrases, word collections or single words from the e-mail message. The term extractor 46 may further parse a header portion of the e-mail to extract information therefrom that is required for the maintenance of both the repository and user databases 56B and 56A. For example, the term extractor 46 will identify the date of transmission of the e-mail, and all addressees. The term extractor 46 will additionally determine further information regarding the electronic document and terms therein. For example, the term extractor 46 will determine the total number of words comprising the electronic document, the density of recurring words within the document, the length of each term (i.e., the number of words that constitute the term), the part of speech that each word within the document constitutes, and a word type (e.g., whether the word is a lexicon term). To this end, the term extractor 46 is shown in FIG. 2 to have access to a database 49 of lexicon terms, which may identify both universal lexicon terms and environment lexicon terms specific to an environment within which the knowledge site management server 27 is being employed. For example, within a manufacturing environment, the collection of environment lexicon terms will clearly differ from the lexicon terms within an accounting environment., 118784=At step 192, an initial confidence level values for the term is then determined based on the summed adjusted counts and the term weight, as determined above with reference to the weight table 210 shown in FIG. 11. To this end, FIG. 13 illustrates a confidence level table 230, which includes various initial confidence level values for various summed adjusted count/weight value combinations that may have been determined for a term. For example, a term having a summed adjusted count of 0.125, and a weight value of 300, may be allocated an initial confidence level value of 11.5. Following the determination of an initial confidence level value, confidence level values for various terms may be grouped into \u201cclasses\u201d, which still retain cardinal meaning, but which standardize the confidence levels into a finite number of \u201cconfidence bands\u201d. FIG. 14 illustrates a modified table 240, derived from the confidence level table 230, wherein the initial confidence levels assigned are either rounded up or rounded down to certain values. By grouping into classes by rounding, applications (like e-mail addressing), can make use of the classes without specific knowledge/dependence on the numerical values. These can then be tuned without impact to the applications. The modified confidence level values included within the table 240 may have significance in a number of applications. For example, users may request that terms with a confidence level of greater than 1000 automatically be published in a \u201cpublic\u201d portion of their user knowledge profile. Further, e-mail addressees for a particular e-mail may be suggested based on a match between a term in the e-mail and a term within the user knowledge profile having a confidence level value of greater than, merely for example, 600.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, a method and apparatus for assigning a confidence level to a term within a user knowledge profile have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. FIG. 23 is a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the form of computer system 600 within which software, in the form of a series of machine-readable instructions, for performing any one of the methods discussed above may be executed. The computer system 600 includes a processor 602, a main memory 603 and a static memory 604, which communicate via a bus 606. The computer system 600 is further shown to include a video display unit 608 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)). The computer system 600 also includes an alphanumeric input device 610 (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device 612 (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit 614, a signal generation device 616 (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device 618. The disk drive unit 614 accommodates a machine-readable medium 615 on which software 620 embodying any one of the methods described above is stored. The software 620 is shown",
