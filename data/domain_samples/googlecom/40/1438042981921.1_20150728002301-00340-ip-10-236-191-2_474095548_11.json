    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{164084=In FIGS. 12(a) and 12(b), the functional operation of the multimedia presentation in the interface 34 of each gaming machine is shown. The functional flow chart starts at stage 1200. When the interface, which may include a microprocessor-based or personal computer-based system, enters the default mode 1210, a determination is made whether to cycle between default graphics in stage 1212 for display in display D and activation of speakers 24 or to enter stage 1220. In stage 1220 which is an attract mode, attract graphics are displayed in stage 1222 in display D and suitable sounds in speaker 24. If the gaming machine G is eligible E but not in the bonus mode stage, then 1230 is entered. Display graphics are displayed in stage 1234 which would, for example, correspond to textual material 200 shown in FIG. 2a in display D. If the system is in the bonus mode, then stage 1240 is entered. Once in the bonus mode, if in stage 1250, the machine is not eligible, then in stage 1252 the hands down 20 a of FIG. 2b are displayed. If the gaming machine is eligible, then stage 1261 is entered to display hands up 20 b eligibility and stage 1260 is entered. If gaming machine is selected S, then stage 1262 is entered showing the display of FIG. 2d and a potato C being caught by the hands 20 c. This display continues in stage 1264 until the end of the game. At the end of the game, stage 1270 is entered and, if it is a win, then a display win celebration is set forth in stage 1272 and in stage 1274 a payout occurs and the underlying game is unfrozen. If the outcome of the game is a loss, then stage 1282 is entered in which a display loss media presentation is set forth in speaker 24 and display D in stage 1282 and then in stage 1284 the game is unfrozen. Should an eligible machine not catch a potato in stage 1260, then start 1200 is re-entered., 160007=In FIG. 11, the system 10 of the present invention has entered the start bonus mode in stage 1040. A transition mode is entered in stage 1100 in which the display D for a period of time such as five seconds (or any other suitable time) provides transition animation. Then the system enters stage 1110 wherein the eligible machines E are identified and are internally made ready to catch the potato (i.e., receive a bonus opportunity BO). In the event secondary eligibility is required, then stage 1120 is entered. This is discussed with respect to FIG. 4. As long as a player maintains secondary eligibility 1120, if required, he/she receives in stage 1130 a display in display D that shows eligibility. In the preferred embodiment, there are six bonus rounds BR and, therefore, a different multimedia presentation or still image for each bonus round BR can be displayed in display D indicating eligibility. If a player is not able to maintain secondary eligibility in stage 1120, the system enters stage 1140 and displays in display D hands down 20 a. The player, however, in one variation of the present invention can regain eligibility as discussed for the next bonus round by continuing to play. When the bonus mode is detected to be over in stage 1150, then that machine re-enters the start stage 1000 of FIG. 10., 167749=It is commonly accepted that such interface boards 34 are used in the gaming industry to aid in the process of interfacing games G to one common network. In many cases, gaming machines G supporting different communications protocols are linked to one common controller 30. In such cases, it is conventional to support suitable software in ROM 1320 within the interface board 34 that converts each gaming machine's specific protocols into one common network protocol to simplify controller design and operation., 79572=The system 10 is financed as in the conventionally available MONEYTIME system and as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 08/957,076, filed Oct 24, 1997 and 09/052,047, filed Mar. 30, 1998. That is, a bonus pool is preferably created from a contribution of all coins wagered at gaming machines G. Furthermore, two limits are set, a low limit and a high limit. The controller 30 randomly chooses a secret number between these two limits after completion of a bonus mode time period. When the bonus pool reaches or first exceeds the secret number through such contributions, the bonus mode of the present invention triggers (i.e., commences). The bonus pool is used to finance all bonus jackpot payoffs made during the bonus mode time period. Depletion of the bonus pool below the low level (such as zero) triggers an end to the bonus mode. Also, the bonus pool is allowed to go negative to regulate expected volatility of payments made in each bonus mode of the present invention. The teachings contained herein can use bonus pools funded by other conventional approaches such as, but not limited to, separate wagers, hidden pools, casino contributions, etc., 161450=Returning to stage 1130 where the controller 30 has determined that secondary eligibility has been maintained, the decision is made in stage 1160 whether or not the gaming machines E has been randomly selected S to get a potato (i.e., to receive a bonus opportunity BO). If the machine E has not been randomly selected, then stage 1130 is re-entered. If the gaming machine has been randomly selected, then stage 1170 is entered. For each game start signal (i.e., at TGS), the determination of random selection for the gaming machine is made. Hence, even though a player starting a particular game is not randomly selected, it is entirely possible that that player will be selected the next game. The selected gaming machine S then receives in its display FIG. 2(d) and the player knows it has caught the potato. Whether or not the selected gaming machine S wins a jackpot bonus payoff is dependent upon the outcome of the game. Hence, in stage 1180, when the outcome is a win, then stage 1190 is entered and a suitable win celebration multimedia presentation is made in display D. At the end of this multimedia display presentation, for example, the display D can show a hand throwing the potato back. The win celebration can also display the bonus multiples BM such as 2\ufffd, 3\ufffd, etc. In the event there is not a win in stage 1180, the system returns the selected machine to stage 1110. Stage 1194 is the stage in which the system determines the game count or whether or not any more potatoes (i.e., bonus opportunities BO) are to be delivered in this round. Stage 1198 determines which bonus round BR the system is in., 167292=To connect each gaming machine G to the controller 30, it is commonly accepted that an interface board 34 may be employed The interface board 34 supports a suitable interface 1340 connection to the controller 30 via the controller communications network 32. Also, the interface board 34 supports a suitable interface 1310 for connecting the interface board to the gaming machine G., 166245=In FIG. 13, the details of a preferred embodiment for an interface card 34 are set forth. A micro controller 1300 is shown interconnected to machine serial interface 1310, read only memory (ROM) 1320, a controller network serial interface 1340, and random access memory (RAM) 1330. All of these components are conventionally available. The micro controller 1300 can be any central processing unit and communicates with the gaming machine G over conventional serial transmit line 1312 and receives signals over a conventional serial receive line 1314. The micro controller 1300 also receives programming commands over line 1302 from ROM 1320. Likewise, the micro controller 1300 receives serial signals from the controller 30 over lines 1306 and transmits serial signals to the controller 30 over lines 1304. Finally, the micro controller has two-way communication over lines 1308 with RAM 1330., 103282=The maximum payout cap works as follows. For example, if the payout cap is set to $1000, then the maximum amount of money that can be contributed to the jackpot bonus by the controller is $1000. For example, a $100 standard game payoff resulting at game end in the underlying gaming machine during a 15 times bonus mode (BM=15\ufffd) results in a (15\u22121)\ufffd$1000=$1400 theoretical bonus jackpot payoff, but because of the cap, the bonus system will only pay $1000, thereby creating a total payment of $1100 to the player (i.e., $100 from the game payoff and $1000 from the bonus jackpot payoff). The bonus pool is debited $1000., 158555=In FIG. 10, when the system of the present invention is not in the bonus mode, the games G are played conventionally. The system is started in stage 1000 and in stage 1010 a default mode presentation is made in display D. This may be one or a number of still images with or preferably without sound. Occasionally, from time to time stage 1020 is entered which is a timed attract mode stage wherein animation is graphically displayed in the display D with or, in the preferred embodiment, without sound. Finally, in stage 1030 a still image indicating eligibility preferably with sound occurs. This enables a player to easily ascertain whether or not they have met the eligibility requirements, examples of which are set forth in FIG. 4., 45753=This application claims priority to two provisional patent applications, Ser. No. 60/101,051 filed Sep. 18, 1998 and Ser. No. 60/101,504 filed Sep. 23, 1998, both entitled \u201cCONTROLLER-BASED LINKED GAMING MACHINE BONUS SYSTEM.\u201d, 163189=Hence, in FIG. 11, the various multimedia presentations in display D are set forth for the teachings of the present invention. Graphical displays are made at the gaming machine so that a player can readily determine whether or not they have maintained eligibility during the bonus mode time period (stages 1130 and 1140), whether or not the machine is selected in stage 1170, and whether or not a win occurs in stage 1190. Each new round 1198 enters stage 1199 and brings up different multimedia presentations to add excitement to the game and to inform the players which bonus round BR (i.e., 2\ufffd, 3\ufffd, 4\ufffd, etc.) the bonus mode time period is in. A similar functional flow chart exists for the overhead display 70 and sound system 60. If the bonus rounds are over in stage 1198, then start 1000 is entered., 159346=When the bonus mode starts, stage 1040 is entered. It is to be expressly understood that any of a number of suitable multimedia displays could occur in display D in each gaming machine. A player quickly ascertains that they have achieved \u201celigibility.\u201d The multimedia presentation to the player at stage 1030 occurs so that that player knows they are eligible to participate in the bonus mode when it occurs. When a player is not in an eligibility mode or when a machine is simply idle and not being played, stage 1010 and 1020 are entered. Also, a player sees that they have caught a potato before the game ends., 168307=Furthermore, the complex process of polling and communicating to both the controller network 32 and gaming machine G require additional software support in ROM 1320 within the interface board. It is common that when the controller 30 sends a command to a particular gaming machine G, by means of example to command that a gaming machine pay a bonus, that such command will be received by the interface board 34, temporarily stored in its RAM 1330, and then resent to the gaming machine G in a suitable protocol understood by the gaming machine G.}",
