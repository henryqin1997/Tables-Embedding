Exemplary radionuclides include Y-90, Re-188, At-211, Bi-212 and the like. Other reactor-produced radionuclides are useful in the practice of these embodiments of the present invention, if they are able to bind in amounts delivering a therapeutically effective amount of radiation to the target. A therapeutically effective amount of radiation ranges from about 1500 to about 10,000 cGy depending upon several factors known to nuclear medicine practitioners., 250420=Biotin-asialoorosomucoid was evaluated for the ability to couple with circulating LU-10-StrAv conjugate in vivo and to remove it from the blood. Female BALB/c mice (20-25 g) were injected i.v. with 200 \u03bcg LU-10-StrAv conjugate. Clearing agent (200 \u03bcl PBS--group 1; 400 \u03bcg non-biotinylated asialoorosomucoid--group 2; 400 \u03bcg biotinylated asialoorosomucoid--group 3; and 200 \u03bcg biotinylated asialoorosomucoid--group 4) was administered at 25 hours following conjugate administration. A fifth group received PIP-I-131-LU-10-StrAv conjugate which had been saturated prior to injection with biotin--group 5. The 400 \u03bcg dose constituted a 10:1 molar excess of clearing agent over the initial dose of LU-10-StrAv conjugate, while the 200 \u03bcg dose constituted a 5:1 molar excess. The saturated PIP-I-131-LU-10-StrAv conjugate was produced by addition of a 10-fold molar excess of D-biotin to 2 mg of LU-10-StrAv followed by size exclusion purification on a G-25 PD-10 column., 305304=H-NMR (D2 O): 1.30-1.80 (m, 6H), 2.40, 2.55 (2 t's, 2H, CH2 CO), 2.70-4.2 (complex multiplet), 4.35 (m, CHN), 4.55 (m, CHN), 7.30 (m, 2H, benzene hydrogens), 7.40 (m, 2H, benzene hydrogens)., 108882=Drug-biotin conjugates which structurally resemble biotinyl peptides are potential substrates for cleavage by plasma biotinidase. Poor in vivo stability therefore limits the use of drug-biotin conjugates in therapeutic applications. The use of peptide surrogates to overcome poor stability of peptide therapeutic agents has been an area of intense research effort. See, for example, Spatola, Peptide Backbone Modification: A Structure-Activity Analysis of Peptide Containing Amide Bond Surrogates, \"Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins,\" vol. 7, Weinstein, ed., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1983; and Kim et al., \"A New Peptide Bond Surrogate: 2-Isoxazoline in Pseudodipeptide Chemistry,\" Tetrahedron Letters, 45: 6811-14, 1991., 255153=A set of female nude mice, implanted subcutaneously with LS-180 human colon carcinoma xenografts as described above, were randomized into groups of 4 animals/timepoint. The mice were intravenously injected with 200 \u03bcg of 1:1 mol/mol NR-LU-10 monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to streptavidin (MAB-STRPT), with the conjugate formed as described in Example XI above. The streptavidin portion of the conjugate was radiolabeled with paraiodophenyl (PIP) I-125, as described in Example IV above. Groups of mice were sacrificed at 26, 30, 48, 96 and 144 hours post-conjugate injection. Tissues were isolated, weighed and counted with respect to iodine radionuclide content using conventional procedures therefor., 129629=Synthetic routes to an intermediate of the DOTA-biotin conjugates depicted above, nitrobenzyl-DOTA, have been proposed. These proposed synthetic routes produce the intermediate compound in suboptimal yield, however. For example, Renn and Meares, \"Large Scale Synthesis of Bifunctional Chelating Agent Q-(p-nitrobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N'N\"N'\"-tetra acetic acid, and the Determination of its Enantiomeric Purity by Chiral Chromatography,\" Bioconj. Chem., 3: 563-9, 1992, describe a nine-step synthesis of nitrobenzyl-DOTA, including reaction steps that either proceed in low yield or involve cumbersome transformations or purifications. More specifically, the sixth step proceeds in only 26% yield, and the product must be purified by preparative HPLC. Additionally, step eight proceeds in good yield, but the process involves copious volumes of the coreactants., 242407=5. In vivo studies are useful to characterize the reaction product, which studies include, for example, serum clearance profiles, ability of the conjugate to target antigen-positive tumors, tumor retention of the conjugate over time and the ability of a biotinylated molecule to bind streptavidin conjugate at the tumor. These data facilitate determination that the synthesis resulted in the formation of a 1:1 streptavidin-NR-LU-10 whole antibody conjugate that exhibits blood clearance properties similar to native NR-LU-10 whole antibody, and tumor uptake and retention properties at least equal to native NR-LU-10., 240581=For small scale reactions, monosubstituted conjugate was obtained using HPLC Zorbax (preparative) size exclusion chromatography. The desired monosubstituted conjugate product eluted at 14.0-14.5 min (3.0 ml/min flow rate), while unreacted NR-LU-10 eluted at 14.5-15 min and unreacted derivitized streptavidin eluted at 19-20 min., 68935=An example of an annexin useful in the practice of the present invention is Annexin V which was isolated by Bohn in 1979 from human placenta, a rich source of annexins, and termed Placenta Protein 4 (PP4). Annexin V consists of four domains, with each made up of five alpha helices wherein the alpha helices serve as connecting elements between the domains. From the side, the molecule appears crown-like with five calcium binding sites on its convex surface, through which annexin-phospholipid interactions are mediated. Other annexins having the characteristics described above are also useful in the practice of the present invention. Annexin V has been expressed in E. coli., 193140=1 H NMR: (CD3 OD, 200 MHz Varian): 1.25-1.95 (m, 24H), 2.15-2.25 (broad t, 4H), 2.65-3.05 (m, 4H), 3.30-3.45 (dd, 2H), 3.50-3.65 (ddd, 2H), 3.95 (broad s, 2H) , 4.00-4.15 (m, 1H) , 4.25-4.35 (m, 1H), 4.45-4.55 (m, 1H), 4.7-5.05 (m overlapping with HOD)., 287529=The synthesis of aminobenzyl-DOTA was conducted substantially in accordance with the procedure of McMurry et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 3: 108-117, 1992. The critical step in the prior art synthesis is the intermolecular cyclization between disuccinimidyl N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)iminodiacetate and N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-nitrophenyl alaninamide to prepare 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(4-nitrobenzyl)-3,6,11-trioxo-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane. In other words, the critical step is the intermolecular cyclization between the bis-NHS ester and the diamine to give the cyclized dodecane. McMurry et al. conducted the cyclization step on a 30 mmol scale, dissolving each of the reagents in 100 ml DMF and adding via a syringe pump over 48 hours to a reaction pot containing 4 liters dioxane., 302100=6. Preparation of N,N-bis-(6-hexanoylamidobenzyl-DOTA)-biotinamide. To a mixture of 15 mg of DOTA-benzylamine and 6.0 mg of N',N'-bis-(N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 6-hexanoyl)-biotinamide in 1.0 ml of dry dimethylformamide was added 0.5 ml of dry pyridine. The mixture was stirred at 45\ufffd-50\ufffd C. for 4.5 hours and at 15\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 12 hours. The mixture was concentrated and the residue chromatographed on a 2.1\ufffd2.5 cm octadecylsilyl (ODS) reverse-phase preparative HPLC column eluting with a--20 minute gradient profile of 0.1:95:5 to 0.1:40:60 trifluoroacetic acid:water:acetonitrile at 13 ml/minute to afford the desired product. The retention time was 15.97 minutes using the aforementioned gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute on a 4.6 mm\ufffd25 cm ODS analytical HPLC column., 279984=This conjugation was generally performed in 6.2 mM sodium borate buffer (0.5M, pH 8), containing the antibody stabilizer molecusol at 1% wt/vol. The NHS-derivatized trichothecene dissolved in 100% DMSO was added dropwise to a stirred solution of antibody at a final antibody concentration of 1.0 mg/ml reaction solution. To achieve a trichothecene loading of 6-9/antibody, NHS-derivatized trichothecene was offered at a 30:1 trichothecene:antibody molar ratio at a final concentration of 25% DMSO vol/vol. The reaction mixture was incubated with continuous stirring at room temperature for 1 hour prior to purification by size exclusion chromatography, extensive dialysis, concentration via membrane centrifugation and sterile filtration. Conjugates thus prepared were stored refrigerated (e.g., at 5\ufffd-10\ufffd C.) or quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -70\ufffd C. until use)., 131346=This problem is overcome in the aforementioned alternative synthesis scheme of the present invention by reacting the tetra-amine alcohol with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Trifluoroacetates, being much poorer leaving groups than toluenesulfonates, are not vulnerable to analogous side reactions. In fact, the easy hydrolysis of trifluoroacetate groups, as reported in Greene and Wuts, \"Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis,\" John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, p. 94, 1991., suggests that addition of methanol to the reaction mixture following consumption of all amines should afford the tetra-fluoroacetamide alcohol as a substantially exclusive product. Conversion of the tetra-fluoroacetamide alcohol to the corresponding toluenesulfonate provides a material which is expected to cyclize analogously to the tetra-toluenesulfonamide toluenesulfonate of the prior art. The cyclic tetraamide product of the cyclization of the toluenesulfonate of tetra-fluoroacetamide alcohol, in methanolic sodium hydroxide at 15\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 1 hour, should afford nitro-benzyl-DOTA as a substantially exclusive product. As a result, the use of trifluoracetamide protecting groups circumvents the difficulties associated with cleavage of the very stable toluenesulfonamide protecting group, which involves heating with a large excess of sulfuric acid followed by neutralization with copious volumes of barium hydroxide., 92877=An exemplary clearing agent of the protein-based/galactose-bearing variety is the asialoorosomucoid derivative of human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid, molecular weight=41,000 Dal, isoelectric point=1.8-2.7). The rapid clearance from the blood of asialoorosomucoid has been documented by Galli, et al., J. of Nucl. Med. Allied Sci. 32(2): 110-16, 1988., 264446=Polylysine (approximately 10,000 Dal. molecular weight, available from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and dextran (lysine fixable, available from Sigma Chemical Co.) were derivitized with SPDP and purified from unreacted SPDP using size exclusion chromatography (using a PD-10 column available from Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). The resultant SPDP-derivitized adducts were reduced with DTT in pH 4.7 0.2M NaOAc buffer to generate free reactive thiols. Reduced Tc-99m, generated from stannous gluconate as described, for example, by Carlsson et al., Biochem. J., 173: 723-737, 1978, was added. A 90% incorporation of Tc-99m was obtained for the polylysine adduct within 15 min, as measured by ITLC. 96% of the radioactivity coeluted with the dextran using size exclusion (PD-10) chromatography. These results are indicative of chelation., 308700=A solution of 3.0 mg biotin-dextran, lysine fixable (BDLF, available from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., 70,000 dalton molecular weight with approximately 18 biotins/molecule) in 0.3 ml PBS and 0.15 ml 1M sodium carbonate, pH 9.25, was added to a dried residue (1.87 mCi) of N-succinimidyl p-I-125-iodobenzoate prepared in accordance with Wilbur, et al., J. Nucl. Med., 30: 216-226, 1989., 57575=In a fourth aspect of the invention, methods for radiolabeling biotin with technetium-99m, rhenium-186 and rhenium-188 are disclosed. Previously, biotin derivatives were radiolabeled with indium-111 for use in pretargeted immunoscintigraphy (for instance, Virzi et al., Nucl. Med. Biol. 18:719-26, 1991; Kalofonos et al., J. Nucl. Med. 31: 1791-96, 1990; Paganelli et al., Canc. Res. 51:5960-66, 1991). However, 99m Tc is a particularly preferred radionuclide for immunoscintigraphy due to (i) low cost, (ii) convenient supply and (iii) favorable nuclear properties. Rhenium-186 displays chelating chemistry very similar to 99m Tc, and is considered to be an excellent therapeutic radionuclide (i.e., a 3.7 day half-life and 1.07 MeV maximum particle that is similar to 131 I). Therefore, the claimed methods for technetium and rhenium radiolabeling of biotin provide numerous advantages., 299621=H-NMR (DMSO) 8.62 (2H, m) 3.58 (6H, s), 2.82 (4H, m) 2.30 (4H, t), 1.67-1.45 (8H, m) and 1.38-1.22 ppm (4H, m)., 297555=H-NMR (DMSO) 3.58 (3H, s), 3.51 (2H, t), 2.29 (2H, t), 1.78 (2H, pentet), and 1.62-1.27 ppm (4H, m)., 84009=Thus, covalent streptavidin-antibody conjugation is preferred, but high molecular weight byproducts are often obtained. The degree of crosslinking and aggregate formation is dependent upon several factors, including the level of protein derivitization using heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents. Sheldon et al., Appl. Radiat. Isot. 43: 1399-1402, 1992, discuss preparation of covalent thioether conjugates by reacting succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC)-derivitized antibody and iminothiolane-derivitized streptavidin., 219082=Preparation of 1 was generally according to Wilbur et al., J. Nucl. Med. 30:216-26, 1989, using a tributyltin intermediate. Water soluble carbodiimide was used in the above-depicted reaction, since the NHS ester 1 formed intractable mixtures with DCU. The NHS ester was not compatible with chromatography; it was insoluble in organic and aqueous solvents and did not react with biocytin in DMF or in buffered aqueous acetonitrile. The reaction between 1 and biocytin or 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine was sensitive to base. When the reaction of 1 and biocytin or the pentylamine was performed in the presence of triethylamine in hot DMSO, formation of more than one biotinylated product resulted. In contrast, the reaction was extremely clean and complete when a suspension of 1 and biocytin (4 mg/ml) or the pentylamine (4 mg/ml) was heated in DMSO at 117\ufffd C. for about 5 to about 10 min. The resultant 125 I-biotin derivatives were obtained in 94% radiochemical yield. Optionally, the radioiodinated products may be purified using C-18 HPLC and a reverse phase hydrophobic column. Hereinafter, the resultant radioiodinated products 2 are referred to as PIP-biocytin (R=COOH) and PIP-pentylamine (R=H)., 266327=Dry triethylamine (3.76 g, 37.2 mmol) was added to a solution of 8.00 g (37.2 mmol) of 3-(2-pyridinyldithio)propanoic acid in 100 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). The mixture was cooled in an ice bath followed by the addition of 5.08 g (37.2 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate. The mixture was stirred for 5-10 minutes, and 4.92 g (37.2 mmol) of tert-butyl carbazate was added. The resultant mixture was stirred at 15\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 1 hour and then Concentrated. The residue was diluted with 200 ml of methylene chloride and washed with water (2\ufffd100 ml). The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in ice-cold trifluoroacetic acid (160 ml) and stirred for 10 minutes after dissolution was complete. The mixture was concentrated, and the residue was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 85:14:1 chloroform?methanol/ammonium hydroxide, to afford 4.25 g of the product as a pale yellow solid (50%): TLC-Rf 0.55 (85:15:1 chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide)., 30637=This application is a continuation of pending PCT Application No. PCT/US93/05406 filed Jun. 7, 1993, which is, in turn, a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. Nos. 07/995,381 and 08/122,979, 07/995,383 filed Dec. 23, 1992, both applications now abandoned, which are, in turn, continuation-in-parts of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/895,588 filed Jun. 9, 1992 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,342)., 304375=H-NMR (DMSO): 1.18-1.25 (m, 6H, (CH2)3), 2.15, 2.35 (2 t's, 2H, CH2 CO), 2.75 (m, 2H, SCH2), 2.80, 3.00 (2 s's, 3H, NCH3), 3.05-3.15 (m, 1H, SCH), 3.95, 4.05 (2 s's, 2H, CH2 N), 4.15, 4.32 (2 m's, 2H, 2CHN's), 6.35 (s, NH), 6.45 (s, NH)., 72188=There are two broad classes of trichothecenes: those that have only a central sesquiterpenoid structure and those that have an additional macrocyclic ring (simple and macrocyclic trichothecenes, respectively). The simple trichothecenes may be subdivided into three groups (i.e., Group A, B, and C) as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,744,981 and 4,906,452 (incorporated herein by reference). Representative examples of Group A simple trichothecenes include: Scirpene, Roridin C, dihydrotrichothecene, Scirpen-4, 8-diol, Verrucarol, Scirpentriol, T-2 tetraol, pentahydroxyscirpene, 4-deacetylneosolaniol, trichodermin, deacetylcalonectrin, calonectrin, diacetylverrucarol, 4-monoacetoxyscirpenol, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol, 7-hydroxydiacetoxyscirpenol, 8-hydroxydiacetoxy-scirpenol (Neosolaniol), 7,8-dihydroxydiacetoxyscirpenol, 7-hydroxy-8-acetyldiacetoxyscirpenol, 8-acetylneosolaniol, NT-1, NT-2, HT-2, T-2, and acetyl T-2 toxin. Representative examples of Group B simple trichothecenes include: Trichothecolone, Trichothecin, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 5-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol, Nivalenol, 4-acetylnivalenol (Fusarenon-X), 4,15-idacetylnivalenol, 4,7,15-triacetylnivalenol, and tetra-acetylnivalenol. Representative examples of Group C simple trichothecenes include: Crotocol and Crotocin. Representative macrocyclic trichothecenes include Verrucarin A, Verrucarin B, Verrucarin J (Satratoxin C), Roridin A, Roridin D, Roridin E (Satratoxin D), Roridin H, Satratoxin F, Satratoxin G, Satratoxin H, Vertisporin, Mytoxin A, Mytoxin C, Mytoxin B, Myrotoxin A, Myrotoxin B, Myrotoxin C, Myrotoxin D, Roritoxin A, Roritoxin B, and Roritoxin D. In addition, the general \"trichothecene\" sesquiterpenoid ring structure is also present in compounds termed \"baccharins\" isolated from the higher plant Baccharis megapotamica, and these are described in the literature, for instance as disclosed by Jarvis et al. (Chemistry of Alleopathy, ACS Symposium Series No. 268: ed. A. C. Thompson, 1984, pp. 149-159)., 301839=H-NMR (DMSO) 6.39 (1H, s), 6.32 (1H, s), 4,29 (1H, m), 4,12 (1H, m), 3.30-3.03 (5H, m), 2.81 (9H, dd and s), 2.67 (4H, m), 2.57 (1H, d), 2.25 (2H, t), 1.75-1.20 (18H, m); TLC-Rf 0.37 (0.1:20:80 acetic acid/methanol/ethyl acetate)., 284629=assessment of serum clearance in mice. Biotinylated dextran having a molecular weight of 70,000 daltons, with 18 moles of biotin covalently bound thereto and 18 additional lysine epsilon amino groups, was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). To radiolabel the material, 4 mC of I-125 PIP NHS.ester of specific activity of 2200 mCi/mmole (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) in acetonitrile in a 2 ml glass vial was blown down to dryness in a nitrogen stream. 10 mg of biotinylated, lysine-derivatized dextran lyophilizate, reconstituted with 0.650 ml of 1.0M sodium borate, pH 9.0, was added to the iodinating compound and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Following reaction, the radioiodinated dextran moiety was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline (i.e., 6.2M sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH.7.2) containing 1% molecusol (Pharmatec, Alachua, Fla.). The biotin-dextran* eluted from the column in the 2.4-4.8 ml fractions at a specific activity of 0.2 mCi/mg and a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml., 258445=In another liver study, female nude mice xenografted with xenografted with LS-180 tumor cells, as discussed above, and were intravenously injected with 200 \u03bcg of 1:1 mol/mol NR-LU-10 monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to streptavidin, prepared as described in Example XI above. The antibody portion of the conjugate was radiolabeled with paraiodophenyl (PIP-I-125). Twenty four hours later, the mice received an injection of 0.5 \u03bcg of paraiodophenyl (PIP 1-131) biocytin. Mice were sacrificed at 28, 48, 120 and 168 hours post-conjugate injection. Tissues were isolated, weighed and counted with respect to the content of each iodine radionuclide using conventional procedures therefor., 311303=Tumored mice injected with MAb-StrAv at time 0 as above; 50 micrograms of AO-Bt at time 22 hours; and 545 microcuries of I-131-PIP-biocytin at time 25 hours. Whole body radiation was measured and compared to that of animals that had not received clearing agent. 50 micrograms of AO-Bt was efficient in allowing the injected radioactivity to clear from the animals unimpeded by binding to circulating MAb-StrAv conjugate. Tumor uptake of I-131-PIP-biocytin was preserved at the 50 microgram clearing agent dose, with AUC tumor/AUC blood of 30:1 which is approximately 15-fold better than the AUC tumor/AUC blood achieved in conventional antibody-radioisotope therapy using this model., 300283=H-NMR (CDCl3) 5.71 (1H, s), 5.22 (1H, s), 4.52 (1H, m), 4.33 (1H, m), 3.60 (3H, s), 3.58 (3H, s), 3.34-3.13 (5H, m), 2.92 (1H, dd), 2.75 (1H, d), 2.33 (6H, m) and 1.82-1.22 ppm (18H, m); TLC-Rf 0.39 (20:80 methanol/ethyl acetate)., 301101=H-NMR (DMSO) 6.42 (1H, s), 6.33 (1H, s), 4.29 (1H, m), 4.12 (1H, m), 3.29-3.04 (5H, m), 2.82 (1H, dd), 2.57 (1H, d), 2.21 (6H, m) and 1.70-1.10 ppm (18H, m)., 204588=In the animals that received avidin intravenously at 24 h, the biotinylated antibody (lysine) was cleared (to a level of 5% of injected dose) within 15 min of avidin administration (avidin: biotin=10:1). With the biotinylated antibody (thiol), avidin administration (10:1 or 25:1) reduced the circulating antibody level to about 35% of injected dose after two hours. Residual radiolabeled antibody activity in the circulation after avidin administration was examined in vitro using immobilized biotin. This analysis revealed that 85% of the biotinylated antibody was complexed with avidin. These data suggest that the biotinylated antibody (thiol)-avidin complexes that were formed were insufficiently crosslinked to be cleared by the RES., 253865=A subsequent experiment was executed to evaluate lower doses of asialoorosomucoid-biotin. In the same animal model, doses of 50, 20 and 10 \u03bcg asialoorosomucoid-biotin were injected at 24 hours following administration of the LU-10-StrAv conjugate. Data from animals serially bled are shown in FIG. 10, and data from animals sacrificed two hours after clearing agent administration are shown in FIGS. 11A (blood clearance) and 11B (serum biotin-binding), respectively. Doses of 50 and 20 \u03bcg asialoorosomucoid-biotin effectively reduced circulating LU-10-StrAv conjugate levels by about 65% (FIG. 11A) and, after correction for binding to immobilized biotin, left only 3% of the injected dose in circulation that possessed biotin-binding capacity, compared with about 25% of the injected dose in control animals (FIG. 11B). Even at low doses (approaching 1:1 stoichiometry with circulating LU-10-StrAv conjugate), asialoorosomucoid-biotin was highly effective at reducing blood levels of circulating streptavidin-containing conjugate by an in vivo complexation that was dependent upon biotin-avidin interaction., 89384=When avidin-targeting moiety conjugates are employed, poly-biotinylated transferrin has been used to form relatively large aggregated species that are cleared by RES uptake. See, for example, Goodwin, J. Nucl. Med. 33(10):1816-18, 1992). Poly-biotinylated transferrin also has the potential for cross-linking and internalizing tumor-bound avidinylated-targeting moiety, however. In addition, both \"chase\" methodologies involve the prolonged presence of aggregated moieties of intermediate, rather than large, size (which are not cleared as quickly as large size particles by RES uptake), thereby resulting in serum retention of subsequently administered ligand-active agent or anti-ligand-active agent. Such serum retention unfavorably impacts the target cell-to-blood targeting ratio., 230087=Preferred lactic acid/glycolic acid polymer containing matrix particulates of the present invention are prepared by emulsion-based processes, that constitute modified solvent extraction processes such as those described by Cowsat et al., \"Poly(Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microcapsules for Controlled Release of Steroids,\" Methods Enzymology, 212:101-116, 1985 (steroid entrapment in microparticulates); Eldridge et al., \"Biodegradable and Biocompatible Poly(DL-Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microspheres as an Adjuvant for Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B Toxoid Which Enhances the Level of Toxin-Neutralizing Antibodies,\" Infection and Immunity, 59:2978-2986, 1991 (toxoid entrapment); Cohen et al., \"Controlled Delivery Systems for Proteins Based on Poly(Lactic/Glycolic Acid) Microspheres,\" Pharmaceutical Research, 8(6):713-720, 1991 (enzyme entrapment); and Sanders et al., \"Controlled Release of a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analogue from Poly(D,L-Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microspheres,\" J. Pharmaceutical Science, 73(9):1294-1297, 1984 (peptide entrapment)., 217834=Radioiodinated biotin derivatives prepared by exposure of poly-L-lysine to excess NHS-LC-biotin and then to Bolton-Hunter N-hydroxysuccinimide esters in DMSO has been reported. After purification, this product was radiolabeled by the iodogen method (see, for instance, Del Rosario et al., J. Nucl. Med. 32:5, 1991, 993 (abstr.)). Because of the high molecular weight of the resultant radioiodinated biotin derivative, only limited characterization of product (i.e., radio-HPLC and binding to immobilized streptavidin) was possible., 71100=Preferred drugs suitable for use herein include conventional chemotherapeutics, such as vinblastine, doxorubicin, bleomycin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and cis-platinum, as well as other conventional chemotherapeutics as described in Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology, 2d ed., V. T. DeVita, Jr., S. Hellman, S. A. Rosenberg, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, Pa., 1985, Chapter 14. A particularly preferred drug within the present invention is a trichothecene., 74263=Experimental drugs, such as mercaptopurine, N-methylformamide, 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, melphalan, hexamethylmelamine, gallium nitrate, 3% thymidine, dichloromethotrexate, mitoguazone, suramin, bromodeoxyuridine, iododeoxyuridine, semustine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidyl)-1-nitrosourea, N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide, azacitidine, dibromodulcitol, Erwinia asparaginase, ifosfamide, 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate, teniposide, taxol, 3-deazauridine, soluble Baker's antifol, homoharringtonine, cyclocytidine, acivicin, ICRF-187, spiromustine, levamisole, chlorozotocin, aziridinyl benzoquinone, spirogermanium, aclarubicin, pentostatin, PALA, carboplatin, amsacrine, caracemide, iproplatin, misonidazole, dihydro-5-azacytidine, 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin, menogaril, triciribine phosphate, fazarabine, tiazofurin, teroxirone, ethiofos, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-1-acetamide, mitoxantrone, acodazole, amonafide, fludarabine phosphate, pibenzimol, didemnin B, merbarone, dihydrolenperone, flavone-8-acetic acid, oxantrazole, ipomeanol, trimetrexate, deoxyspergualin, echinomycin, and dideoxycytidine (see NCI Investigational Drugs, Pharmaceutical Data 1987, NIH Publication No. 88-2141, Revised November 1987) are also preferred., 223918=A NR-LU-13-avidin conjugate is prepared as follows. Initially, avidin is derivitized with N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). SMCC-derived avidin is then incubated with NR-LU-13 in a 1:1 molar ratio at pH 8.5 for 16 h. Unreacted NR-LU-13 and SMCC-derived avidin are removed from the mixture using preparative size exclusion HPLC. Two conjugates are obtained as products--the desired 1:1 NR-LU-13-avidin conjugate as the major product; and an incompletely characterized component as the minor product., 199405=The impact of lysine biotinylation on antibody immunoreactivity was examined. As the molar offering of biotin: antibody increased from 5:1 to 40:1, biotin incorporation increased as expected (measured using the HABA assay and pronase-digested product) (Table 2, below). Percent of biotinylated antibody immunoreactivity as compared to native antibody was assessed in a limiting antigen ELISA assay. The immunoreactivity percentage dropped below 70% at a measured derivitization of 11.1:1; however, at this level of derivitization, no decrease was observed in antigen-positive cell binding (performed with LS-180 tumor cells at antigen excess). Subsequent experiments used antibody derivitized at a biotin: antibody ratio of 10:1., 313311=HSA-biotin was then derivatized with from 12 to 15 galactoses/molecule. Galactose derivatization of the biotinylated HSA was performed according to the procedure of Lee, et al., Biochemistry, 15: 3956, 1976. More specifically, a 0.1M methanolic solution of cyanomethyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-thio-D-galactopyranoside was prepared and reacted with a 10% v/v 0.1M NaOMe in methanol for 12 hours to generate the reactive galactosyl thioimidate. The galactosylation of biotinylated HSA began by initial evaporation of the anhydrous methanol from a 300 fold molar excess of reactive thioimidate. Biotinylated HSA in PBS, buffered with 10% v/v 0.5M sodium borate, was added to the oily residue. After stirring at room temperature for 2 hours, the mixture was stored at 4\ufffd C. for 12 hours. The galactosylated HSA-biotin was then purified by G-25 size exclusion chromatography or by buffer exchange to yield the desired product. The same chemistry is exploitable to galactosylating dextran. The incorporation efficiency of galactose on HSA is approximately 10%., 201909=As shown in Table 3, at a 50:1 or greater biotin: antibody molar offering, only 6 biotins per antibody were incorporated. No significant impact on immunoreactivity was observed., 110863=The difference in serum stability between DOTA-LC-biotin and DOTA-SC-biotin might be explained by the fact that the SC derivative contains an aromatic amide linkage in contrast to the aliphatic amide linkage of the LC derivative, with the aliphatic amide linkage being more readily recognized by enzymes as a substrate therefor. This argument cannot apply to biotinidase, however, because biotinidase very efficiently cleaves aromatic amides. In fact, it is recognized that the simplest and most commonly employed biotinidase activity measuring method uses N-(d-biotinyl)-4-aminobenzoate (BPABA) as a substrate, with the hydrolysis of BPABA resulting in the liberation of biotin and 4-aminobenzoate (PABA). See, for example, B. Wolf, et al., \"Methods in Enzymology,\" pp. 103-111, Academic Press Inc., 1990. Consequently, one would predict that DOTA-SC-biotin, like its LC counterpart, would be a biotinidase substrate. Since DOTA-SC-biotin exhibits serum stability, biotinidase activity alone does not adequately explain why some conjugates are serum stable while others are not. A series of DOTA-biotin conjugates was therefore synthesized by the present inventors to determine which structural features conferred serum stability to the conjugates., 63358=Monoclonal antibodies useful in the practice of the present invention include whole antibody and fragments thereof. Such monoclonal antibodies and fragments are producible in accordance with conventional techniques, such as hybridoma synthesis, recombinant DNA techniques and protein synthesis. Useful monoclonal antibodies and fragments may be derived from any species (including humans) or may be formed as chimeric proteins which employ sequences from more than one species. See, generally, Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256: 495-97, 1975; Eur. J. Immunol., 6: 511-19, 1976., 270562=3. Preparation of 2'-dehydro-Roridin A. 5 ml of 3:1:1 acetic acid:THF:water was added to a 10 ml round bottom flask, charged with 62 mg (0.096 mmol) of 2'-dehydro-13\"-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-Roridin A. The mixture was stirred at 45\ufffd-50\ufffd C. for 4.5 hours, cooled and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 5% methanol/methylene chloride, to afford 36 mg of the product as a foamy white solid (70%): TLC-Rf 0.48 (5% methanol/methylene chloride)., 282334=In conjugation of 2-pyridinyl-dithio-derivatized trichothecenes, NR-LU-10 disulfides were first reduced by incubating NR-LU-10 at 5-10 mg in 1 ml of PBS containing 10-15 mM dithiothreitol for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reduced product was purified over a PD-10 column that had been equilibrated in degassed 0.1M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.1M NaCl, 1% molecusol wt/vol and. 0.2 mM EDTA (Na salt). Immediately after reduced-disulfide NR-LU-10 purification, dropwise addition of 2-pyrldinyl-dithio-derivatized trichothecene dissolved in DMSO (0.40 ml of DMSO, containing 432 micrograms of 3-(2-pyridinyldithio)propionate hydrazide 2'-Roridin A hydrazone or containing 337 micrograms of 3-(2-pyridinyldithio)propionate hydrazide 3-anguidine hydrazone or containing 459 micrograms of 3-(2-pyridinyldithio)propionate hydrazide 2'-acetyl-13'-Roridin A hydrazone) to 2 mg of the reduced disulfide NR-LU-10 solution (a 44:1 trichothecene:antibody molar offering ratio) was conducted with stirring. Generally in conducting the conjugation, the reaction concentration of antibody was 0.8 -1.2 mg/ml, DMSO was 16-25% vol/vol, and trichothecene to antibody molar offering ranged from 40:1 to 50:1 (in order to achieve a loading of approximately 6 trichothecenes per antibody). After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, purification proceeded analogously to the purification scheme described in Example XVII(A) above. Conjugates thus prepared were stored refrigerated (e.g., at 5\ufffd-10\ufffd C.) or quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -70\ufffd C. until use)., 295080=4. Preparation of methyl 6-(N-methylcaproylamido-biotin. N-hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin (398 mg, 1.16 mmol) was added to a solution of methyl 6-(N-methyl)aminocaproate hydrochloride (250 mg, 1.28 mmol) in DMF (4.0 ml) and triethylamine (0.18 ml, 1.28 mmol). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 100\ufffd C. for 10 minutes. The solution was evaporated, acidified with glacial acetic acid and evaporated again. The residue was chromatographed on a 25 mm flash chromatography column manufactured by Ace Glass packed with 50 g silica (EM Science, Gibbstown, N.J., particle size 0.40-0.63 mm) eluting with 15% MeOH/EtOAc. The product was obtained as a yellow oil (390 mg) in 79% yield., 285769=To derivatize the biotin-dextran* with trichothecene, 0.9 ml of biotin-dextran* was diluted with 1.3 ml of sodium borate buffer, 0.3M, Ph 8.5, containing 1% molecusol followed by addition, with stirring of 1.2 ml of DMSO containing 1.2 mg of 2'-Desoxy-2'-alpha-(N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-3-dithiopropanoic acid)-Roridin A (i.e., 2:1 drug to available lysine molar ratio). After incubation for 1.5 hours at room temperature, each 1 ml aliquot of reaction mixture was purified as noted above with a PD-10 column equilibrated in PBS. Yields exceeded 85%., 314874=A commercially available form of dextran, molecular weight of 70,000 daltons, pre-derivatized with approximately 18 biotins/molecule and having an equivalent number of free primary amines was studied. The primary amine moieties were derivatized with a galactosylating reagent, substantially in accordance with the procedure therefor described above in the discussion of HSA-based clearing agents, at a level of about 9 galactoses/molecule. The molar equivalence offering ratio of galactose to HSA was about 300:1, with about one-third of the galactose being converted to active form. 40 Micrograms of galactose-dextran-biotin (GAL-DEX-BT) was then injected i.v. into one group of mice which had received 200 micrograms MAb-StrAv conjugate intravenously 24 hours earlier, while 80 micrograms of GAL-DEX-BT was injected into other such mice. GAL-DEX-BT was rapid and efficient at clearing StrAv-MAb conjugate, removing over 66% of circulating conjugate in less than 4 hours after clearing agent administration. An equivalent effect was seen at both clearing agent doses, which correspond to 1.6 (40 micrograms) and 3.2 (80 micrograms) times the stoichiometric amount of circulating StrAv conjugate present., 278453=6. Preparation of 2'-desoxy-2'-alpha-(N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-3-dithiopropanoic acid)-Roridin A. To a solution of 22 mg (0.0337 mmol) of 2'-desoxy-2'-alpha-(3-dithiopropanoic acid)-Roridin A in 2 ml of dry THF was added 12 mg (0.104 mmol) of N-hydroxysuccinimide followed by 18 mg (0.087 mmol) of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. The mixture was stirred at 15\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 4 hours and then 20 microliters of acetic acid was added. The mixture was stirred an additional 30 minutes and then filtered through a plug of glass wool. The solids were washed with 3 ml of THF. The filtrates were combined and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting first with 0.1:50:50 acetic acid:ethyl acetate:hexane and then with 0.1% acetic acid/ethyl acetate, to afford 18 mg of the product as a white solid (71%): TLC-Rf 0.69 (ethyl acetate)., 280887=Specifically for succinimidyl-2'-Roridin A 3-dithiopropionate conjugation to antibody, 0.40 ml of 6.2 mM sodium borate buffer (0.5M, pH 8.0) and 0.20 ml of 100 mg molecusol/ml H2 O were added to 1.0 ml of 2.0 mg NR-LU-10/ml in PBS (i.e., 6.2 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2). 0.50 ml of DMSO having 290 micrograms of succinimidyl-2'-Roridin A 3-dithiopropionate dissolved therein (for a 30:1 trichothecene:antibody molar offering ratio) was added dropwise and with stirring over a 10 second time period. To purify the resultant product, 1 ml aliquots of reaction solution were applied to PD-10 Sephadex columns (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in PBS containing 1% molecusol wt/vol. The eluted conjugate was collected in the 2.4-4.8 ml fraction. The PD-10 purified aliquots were then pooled, exhaustively dialyzed against PBS containing 1% molecusol (wt/vol) using Spectra/POR molecular porous membrane tubing (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Los Angeles, Calif.), concentrated on a Centricon PM-30 Microconcentrator (Amicon Div., W. R. Grace & Co., Beverly, Mass.), and sterile filtered using a 2.2 micron Acrodisc (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, Mich.). Conjugates thus prepared were stored refrigerated (e.g., at 5\ufffd-10.\ufffd C.) or quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -70\ufffd C. until use)., 154661=The invention exploits one attribute of antibodies--possession of isotype- and/or subclass-specific functions. For example, murine IgG3 and human/mouse chimeric antibodies having human IgG1 or IgG3 constant portions are generally considered superior to other immunoglobulins of murine or murine/human nature for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated inflammation (ADCC) or complement-dependent cellular toxicity. Antibodies or other moieties effective in mediating target-site complement-dependent cytotoxicity must be capable of utilizing the serum complement native to the ultimate recipient having confirmed or potential target sites. Consequently, human antibodies are expected to be capable of utilizing human serum. Antibodies of other types are therefore tested for this ability when administration to human recipients is contemplated. Exemplary moieties known to mediate dependent cytotoxicity are NR-CO-04, a murine IgG3 antibody directed to colon carcinoma; NR-LU-13, a murine/human chimeric antibody featuring a human constant region and murine variable region of NR-LU-10, an antibody directed to a 37-40 kilodalton pancarcinoma glycoprotein; NR-LU-03, an IgG3 antibody generated by immune complex immunization with NR-LU-10; R24, an IgG3 antibody directed against. GD3 disclosed by Houghton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA), 82:1242-1246, 1985; antibody 3F8, a mouse IgG3 directed against GD2 disclosed by Munn et al., Cancer Res., 47:6600-6605, 1987 and Cheung et al., J. Clin. Invest., 81:1122-1128, 1988; and the like., 108497=It appears that the cleavage results from the action of serum biotinidase. Biotinidase is a hydrolytic enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biotinyl peptides. See, for example, Evangelatos, et al., \"Biotinidase Radioassay Using an I-125-Biotin Derivative, Avidin, and Polyethylene Glycol Reagents,\" Analytical Biochemistry, 196: 385-89, 1991., 174902=In embodiments of the present invention employing radionuclide therapeutic agents, the rapid clearance of nontargeted therapeutic agent decreases the exposure of non-target organs, such as bone marrow, to the therapeutic agent. Consequently, higher doses of radiation can be administered absent dose limiting bone marrow toxicity. In addition, pretargeting methods of the present invention optionally include administration of short duration bone marrow protecting agents, such as WR 2721. As a result, even higher doses of radiation can be given, absent dose limiting bone marrow toxicity., 275712=2. Preparation of 2'-desoxy-2'-beta-iodo-Roridin A. To 95 mg (0.126 mmol) of 2'-desoxy-2'-beta-iodo13'-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-Roridin A was added 5 ml of 3:1:1 acetic acid:THF:water. The mixture was stirred at 60\ufffd-65\ufffd C. for 4 hours and then concentrated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 60% ethyl acetate/hexane, to afford 67 mg of the product as a foamy white solid (83%).}",
