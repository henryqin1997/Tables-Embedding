Since the casings of the devices may naturally not exceed certain maximum dimensions, and also the costs for larger batteries are greater than for smaller batteries, only a limited operating time of the devices is possible. After the battery is exhausted an alarm is no longer triggered. If the operating life of the devices with one set of batteries is only very short, then the statistical probability for a used battery is higher than for devices with a longer operating time. The solution to this problem is suggested according to the invention in that the device is provided with a timing circuit which outputs at defined intervals, e.g. once per second, switch-on signals which \"wake up\" the other active parts of the device by switching on their power supply, while in the intervals between these signals these active parts \"sleep\". The length of the \"awake phase\" is preferably selected longer for the RF alarm part than for the monitoring of the security element, since during the \"awake\" phase at least one complete code signal, consisting of several bits, must be received in any case, while a single bit is sufficient so to speak for the monitoring of the conductive security element. In this manner the device can be operated, for example, with a 1:9 ratio between active and \"sleeping\" state which leads to considerable savings for power and hence to a considerable extension of the life of the battery. In addition, a clock signal can be generated for the decoder via the timing circuit if the timing circuit (which preferably contains a quartz oscillator) is synchronized with the receive RF code signals.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the above description, various assemblies of the device according to the invention were described in various combinations. The individual combinations of the single assemblies are however also part of the inventive idea or are claimed in themselves as essential features of the invention. This applies in particular to the various coding measures and the arrangement of the timing circuit 40 to save power. In this preferred embodiment of the invention, a counter 39 is further provided, the reset input of which is connected to the Res terminal of the decoder 20 (for example according to FIGS. 3 or 4) and the counting input (Count) of which lies on the point A of the timing circuit 40. The supply terminal Vcc is permanently connected to the battery 45. The output of the counter 39, where a logical \"1\" appears when the counter exceeds the limit, is placed at a further input of the OR gate 24. This arrangement functions in such a manner that the counter is incremented by 1 each time the arrangement is \"woken up\", that is when all active components are supplied with power. Each time a clear code is transmitted when the circuit is activated, the counter 39 is reset, therefore if a sufficient number of clear codes are present it can never expire and trigger an alarm. However, as soon as the clear code, in accordance with the counter construction, has",
