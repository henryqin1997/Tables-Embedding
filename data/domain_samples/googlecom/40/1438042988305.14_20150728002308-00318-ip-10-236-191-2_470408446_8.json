    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In structures in which the cooling demands are relatively minimal, the Peltier junctions need not be attached along the length of the actuator but simply be provided at one or both ends of the actuator. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, flexible connectors are employed to accomodate the movement of the memory metal actuator. Alternately, the cooling system could be designed so that the elements are fixed and come into contact with the actuator only when the actuator assumes its hot-formed shape. As an alternative to the parallel Peltier circuit shown in FIG. 5, a series circuit as shown in FIG. 6 may be employed. In this arrangement, a plurality of first metal strips 88 and second metal strips 90 are employed. These strips are flexible strips which are located to form first Peltier junctions 92 adjacent the actuating element 94 and second Peltier junctions 96 adjacent a heat sink 98. Current is applied by means of a voltage supply 100 through a switch 102. Heat will be transferred from the junctions 92 to the junctions 96, where the heat will be dissipated by the heat sink 98. Since all dissimilar metals act as thermocouples, the memory metal itself may be used as one of the plates of the Peltier junction. In such a case, the strip 70 in FIG. 5 would not be used and the extension 74 would be connected directly",
