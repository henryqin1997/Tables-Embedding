For example, a complete conversation could be had between two individuals speaking two different languages on-line utilizing only a pair of video screen/keyboards 210/310 instead of telephones 202/302, or the translation system of the present invention may be used to translate technical or otherwise specialized documents based on the use of the topical dictionary. Additionally, as the individual speaks into telephone 202/302 during the step 604, the input words are displayed on video screen/keyboard 210/310 (once processor 106 receives them in a parsed state). The individual is thereby provided with the opportunity to interrupt processor 106 in order to revise the input message as necessary (e.g., if errors are detected in the voice recognition processing). At the same time as the words are synthesized in the target language, the recipient may also view the translated message on video screen/keyboard 210/310 and provide instant feedback if the translation is not understood. For example, if most of a sentence is understood, but one or two words are not, the individual could select the unclear words on video screen/keyboard 210/310 (e.g., by using a mouse or via a touch-screen input system (not shown)).
