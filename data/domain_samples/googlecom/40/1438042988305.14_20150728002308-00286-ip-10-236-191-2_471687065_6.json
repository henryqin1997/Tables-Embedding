    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6407=The capability of providing a time-dependent spatial variation of the net impact/energy profile of the air impingement may also be applied to overcome or alleviate the inefficiency arising from the water steam carrying away thermal energy from the food product starting at the temperature of 212\ufffd F. as described in the Background section. For example, referring to FIGS. 1 and 4A-C, the air modulating cover 125 is first positioned as illustrated in FIG. 4A so that the net energy of the air impingement is concentrated in the proximity of the surface of the left side of the food product 114. This configuration is maintained until the left side of the food product 114 reaches a temperature slightly under 212\ufffd F. Next, the air modulating cover 125 is positioned as illustrated in FIG. 4B, causing the net energy of the air impingement to be generally concentrated in the middle of the food product 114. When the surface of the middle portion of the food product 114 reaches a temperature slightly under 212\ufffd F., then the air modulating cover 125 rotationally slides further to the right as illustrated in FIG. 4C, causing the net energy of the air impingement to be concentrated in the proximity of the surface of the right side of the food product 114. This configuration is maintained until the temperature of the surface of the right side of the food product 114 reaches slightly under 212\ufffd F. Meanwhile, the heat energies previously transferred to the surfaces of the left side and the middle portion of the food product 114 are dispersed downward below the surface to heat up the inner mass of the food product 114. The above air modulating steps may be repeated, periodically in time, until the internal temperature of the food product 114 in the cooking chamber 101 reaches a desired level.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{99491=It is also found that the effective length of the air plume or air impingement generally increases with the increase in the ratio of the area of the nozzle inlet orifice 117 to the area of the nozzle exit orifice 118. Accordingly, the ratio needs to be taken into account when optimizing the efficiency of the air impingement and the overall cooking efficiency of the oven 100. For a nozzle having the height of 3 inches, it is found that the optimal ratio of the nozzle inlet orifice 117 area to the nozzle exit orifice 118 area is roughly 4:1. While a ratio greater than this optimal ratio still leads to a greater effective length in the air plume, a diminished return appears to result from any additional increase in the ratio., 28970=This application is a divisional of, and claims the benefit of, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/803,787, filed on May 15, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Classifications While this invention has been described in conjunction with exemplary embodiments outlined above and illustrated in the drawings, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative, not limiting, and the spirit and scope of the present invention is to be construed broadly and limited only by the appended claims, and not by the foregoing specification. The above-described features and improvements in accordance with the present invention enable a high-speed cooking oven based on a combination of hot air impingement and microwave to deliver optimal cooking efficiency. Tangible benefits of this improvement in the cooking efficiency in the high-speed cooking technology are the reduction in the cooking time at a given electrical power supply, and alternatively, the reduction in the electrical power required to operate a high-speed cooking oven for a given cooking capacity (i.e., given cooking time). As noted in the Background section, because of their sub-optimal cooking efficiency, the conventional high-speed cooking ovens must operate on an electrical power supply based on 220 volts or greater. By further improving and optimizing the cooking efficiency under the present invention, the high-speed cooking technology based on a combination of air impingement and microwave may now be extended with more productive results to ovens operating on an electrical power",
