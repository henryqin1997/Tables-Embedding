No. 10/192,488, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PAYMENT USING RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION IN CONTACT AND CONTACTLESS TRANSACTIONS,\u201d filed on Jul. 9, 2002 (which itself claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/304,216, filed Jul. 10, 2001); to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/340,352, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INCENTING PAYMENT USING RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION IN CONTACT AND CONTACTLESS TRANSACTIONS,\u201d filed Jan. 10, 2003 (which itself claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/396,577, filed Jul. 16, 2002); to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/708,569, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD SECURING SENSITIVE INFORMATION DURING COMPLETION OF A TRANSACTION,\u201d filed Mar. 11, 2004; and to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/865,878, entitled \u201cRECURRENT BILLING MAINTENANCE SYSTEM,\u201d filed May 25, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 85580=Where required, the system user interacts with the system via any input device such as, a keypad, keyboard, mouse, biometric device, kiosk, personal digital assistant, a magnetic stripe card, handheld computer (e.g., Palm Pilot\ufffd, Blackberry\ufffd), cellular phone and/or the like. Similarly, the invention could be used in conjunction with any type of personal computer, network computer, work station, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like, running any operating system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris, or the like. Moreover, it should be understood that the invention could be implemented using TCP/IP communications protocol, SNA, IPX, Appletalk, IPte, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of communications protocols. Moreover, the transactions discussed herein include or result in the use, sale, or distribution of any goods, services or information over any network having similar functionality described herein., 51468=It should be noted that RFID reader 104 and RFID transaction device 102 engages in mutual authentication prior to transferring any transaction device 102 data to RFID reader 104. For a detailed explanation of a suitable mutual authentication process for use with the invention, see commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/340,352, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Incenting Payment Using Radio Frequency Identification in Contact and Contactless Transactions,\u201d filed Jan. 10, 2003, incorporated by reference in its entirety., 65319=Transaction device 102 user then provides the proxy code to merchant system 101 during the completion of a transaction request (step 208). The manner in which the user provides the transaction account proxy code to the user system may vary in accordance with the form factor in which the proxy is embodied. For example, where the proxy code is embodied in the magnetic stripe of a conventional transaction card, the user provides the proxy code to the merchant by \u201cswiping\u201d the magnetic stripe at a suitable reader as is found in the prior art. Alternatively, the proxy code is embodied in a transponder system associated with a key fob. A suitable method for loading a fob with an account number, such as, the proxy code, is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/708,385, filed Mar. 12, 2004, incorporated herein by reference. In this instance the user provides the account number to the merchant system by waiving the key fob in proximity to a suitable transponder reader. The reader provides an interrogation signal to the transponder system to facilitate operation of the transponder system and the transponder reader provides the proxy code to the merchant system for processing., 60749=In another embodiment, RFID reader 104, POS 106 and/or merchant system 101 generate a proxy code prior to, during or after receiving sensitive information. In this embodiment, RFID reader 104 deletes the sensitive information, and only transmits the proxy code to complete the transaction. For more information on securing transactions by providing a proxy code to a merchant system during a transaction instead of providing sensitive transaction account information, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/708,569, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SECURING SENSITIVE INFORMATION DURING COMPLETION OF A TRANSACTION,\u201d filed Mar. 11, 2004 and incorporated herein by reference., 94185=It should be further noted that conventional components of RFID transaction devices are not discussed herein for brevity. For example, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the RFID transaction device and the RFID reader disclosed herein include traditional transponders, antennas, protocol sequence controllers, modulators/demodulators and the like, necessary for proper RFID data transmission. A suitable RFID transaction device and RFID reader which is used with this invention are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/192,488, filed Jul. 9, 2002. As such, those components are contemplated to be included in the scope of the invention.}",
