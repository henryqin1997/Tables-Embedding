It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that a person understanding this invention may conceive of changes or other embodiments or variations, which utilize the principles of this invention without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. All are considered within the sphere, spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, therefore, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited except as may be necessary in view of the appended claims or their equivalents, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter applicant regards as its invention. If at Step S710, reader 22 determines that the inputted media is a gaming coupon 54, reader 22 reads bar code 58 from the coupon 54 and transfers numerical sequence 68 to central processing system 12 in Step S750. Upon receiving numerical sequence 68 from bar code 58, in Step S760 central processing system 12 determines if numerical sequence 68 is a valid code. If numerical sequence 68 is valid, change machine 30, 32 distributes currency in the amount equal to value field 64 in Step",
