Obviously, it is possible to modify these embodiments while remaining within the scope of the following claims. Therefore, within the scope of the claims one may practice the invention otherwise than as the description and drawings specifically show and describe. [0109] The specific features of any single embodiment discussed herein and shown in all the appending FIGS. are applicable and interchangeable to any and all of the embodiments shown herein. [0108] According to this aspect of the invention, further embodiments may include tear seams 26D, 26D\u2032 provided by pre-weakening of the instrument panel assembly in general, and the fabric outer layer 32D in particular, according to any of the methodologies or mechanisms described hereinabove. Such pre-weakening may include weakening of the fabric layer from the front side of the instrument panel, weakening the fabric layer from the back side of the instrument panel, or weakening the fabric layer internally. Methods of pre-weakening the fabric layer 32D along the tear seam 26D\u2032, and corresponding structures, have been thoroughly described above. [0107] Referring to FIG. 24, a similar construction for a knitted fabric is shown including a stronger reinforcing yarn 202\u2032 and a weaker yarn",
