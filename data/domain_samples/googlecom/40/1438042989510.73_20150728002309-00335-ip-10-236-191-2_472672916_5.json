The housing may be connected to a vacuum source to allow mixing under vacuum pressure., 50527=The brochure \"Stryker\ufffd Mix Evac\ufffd\" (copyright August 1978) discloses a disposable enclosed housing which comprises a mixing vessel within a housing, a cover for the housing and a mixing element operable through the cover. The housing may be connected to a vacuum supply to draw air through the cover and out through the housing thus preventing monomer vapors from being released to the operating room atmosphere., 41744=This is a continuation-in-part of Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The mixing system disclosed in the present invention may be provided in the form of a kit comprising a double vacuum packed cartridge mixer filled with a first predetermined amount of a solid, powdery bone cement component, an ampoule containing a second predetermined amount of a liquid bone cement component, an injector for transfer of the liquid bone cement component to the cartridge mixer and a polyethylene ball for insertion in the ampoule prior to insertion in the injector so as to provide a positive sealing action to prevent air ingress into the cartridge mixer upon passage of the predetermined quantity of monomer thereto. Throughout the specification, reference has been made to the air-impermeability of certain materials of construction which are utilized in the present invention. It should be noted that this terminology does not require perfect air-impermeability, however, it does require a degree of air-impermeability sufficient to prevent any significant loss of vacuum pressure through the material over the expected storage life of the vacuum packed materials, e.g. six months. In the case of a long tubular bone canal, some type of plug as shown in FIG. 11 must be lodged in the canal to create a closed space to prevent the extension of bone cement beyond the point where it is useful and to facilitate more complete filling and pressurization of the canal. Various means of plugging the canal have been advocated, including plugs",
