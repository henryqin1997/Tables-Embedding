    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. According to the present invention, the reflection of external light off the second barrier rib 124 b can be prevented by forming a dummy phosphor layer 132 on at least a part of an upper region of the second barrier rib 124 b and forming a connector phosphor layer 133 between the dummy phosphor layer 132 and a main phosphor layer 131. The reflection of external light can be remarkably reduced by the inclusion of the dummy and the connector phosphor layers because phosphor reflects less light than the barrier rib. Accordingly, brightness of light reflected by the PDP can be reduced and contrast can be improved due to the reduction of reflected external light. The operation of the PDP 100 will now be briefly described. First, an address discharge occurs when an address discharge voltage is applied between the address electrodes 122 and the Y electrodes 114. Then, a predetermined wall charge accumulates in the discharge cells 125. In this state, a sustain discharge occurs when a sustain discharge voltage is applied between the X electrodes",
