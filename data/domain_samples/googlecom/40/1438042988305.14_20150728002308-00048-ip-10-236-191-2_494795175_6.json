(hereinafter \u201cHoganson\u201d), which discloses a covered stent 10 in which the elongated portions or sections 24 of the ends 20 a and 20 b extend beyond the marginal edges of the cover 22. See Hoganson at FIGS. 1, 3, 9, 11 a, 11 b, 12 a, 12 b, and 13. However, these extending exposed edges are triangular, with sharp apices pointing both upstream and downstream with regard to a graft placement location. Such a configuration of the exposed stent 20 a, 20 b increases the possibility of puncturing the vessel. In various embodiments shown in FIGS. 6 a, 6 b, 6 c, 10, 14 a, Hoganson teaches completely covering the extended stent and, therefore, the absence of a stent extending from the cover 22. It is noted that the Hoganson stent is implanted by inflation of a balloon catheter.}",

Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The stent graft 1 is, now, securely placed within the vessel and the entire portion 630, 650, 660 of the assembly 600 may be removed from the patient. . FIG. 10 , the proximal handle 678 is, then, substantially at or near the third position (deployment position) shown in FIG. 23 When the stent graft 1 is entirely free from the inner sheath 652 as shown in Simply put, the apex capture device 634 provides support for load placed on the stent graft 1 during advancement A of the inner sheath 652 and during withdrawal of the inner sheath 652 (i.e., during deployment D). Such a configuration benefits the apposition of the bare stent 30 by releasing the bare stent 30 after the entire graft sleeve 10 has been deployed, thus reducing the potential for vessel perforation at the point of initial deployment. . As can be seen, tapers on the distal outer surfaces of the proximal apex body 638 further assist",
