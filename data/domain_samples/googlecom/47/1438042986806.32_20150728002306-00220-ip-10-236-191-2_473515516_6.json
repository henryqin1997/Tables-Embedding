Whittier, Calif. a corporation of California [54] SLANT DRILLING TOOLS FOR OIL WELLS 5 Claims, 8 Drawing Figs., 24123=In FIGS. 7 and 8 there is illustrated a modification wherein movable ribs 66 can be used in the sleeve 32 in place of the fixed ribs 34 of FIGS. 1,2 and 4. The ribs are seated in longitudinally extending pistonlike elements 68 provided with suitable packing 70 which fits in a vertical slot 72 in the wall of sleeve 32 to provide a sliding seal between the piston and the sleeve 32. The details of means for shutting off hydraulic pressure to the inside of the sleeve 32 and the rear or working faces of the pistons 68 are not shown since they are well known in the art.
