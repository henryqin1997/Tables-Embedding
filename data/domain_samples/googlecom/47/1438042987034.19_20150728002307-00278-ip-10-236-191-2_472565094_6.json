For example, a recordable CD player or a DVD player or the like could be mounted in a personal computer or the like, a computer program with the pit art recording function described above is installed on the personal computer or the like to write pit art onto a write once disc or a re-writable disc of the present invention inserted in the recordable CD player or DVD player or the like, by using the personal computer or the like to execute the computer program. The explanation above described the case where pit art writing is performed using an audio device 11 with a pit art writing function, but the present invention is not limited thereto. The same pit art recording function as the aforementioned audio device 11 could also be realized with a computer program. In this manner, by using the audio device 11, a user can write any desired pit art, thereby enabling the disc to be readily identified and organized. .
