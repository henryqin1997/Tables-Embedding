    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{84891=As discussed above, applicants have found that the density of the electrically conducting liquid at the distal tips of the active electrodes should be less than a critical value to form a suitable vapor layer. For aqueous solutions, such as water or isotonic saline, this upper density limit is approximately 1020 atoms/cm3, which corresponds to about 3\ufffd10\u22123 grams/cm3. Applicant's also believe that once the density in the vapor layer reaches a critical value (e.g., approximately 1020 atoms/cm3 for aqueous solutions), electron avalanche occurs. The growth of this avalanche is retarded when the space charge generated fields are on the order of the external field. Spatial extent of this region should be larger than the distance required for an electron avalanche to become critical and for an ionization front to develop. This ionization front develops and propagates across the vapor layer via a sequence of processes occurring the region ahead of the front, viz, heat by electron injection, lowering of the local liquid density below the critical value and avalanche growth of the charged particle concentration., 42376=The present invention is a division of application Ser.

Most electrosurgical devices rely on creation of an electric arc between the treating electrode and the tissue being cut or ablated to cause the desired localized heating. Such arcs, however, often create very high temperatures causing a depth of necrosis greater than 500 \u03bcm, frequently greater than 800 \u03bcm, and sometimes as great as 1700 \u03bcm. The inability to control such depth of necrosis is a significant disadvantage in using electrosurgical techniques for tissue ablation, particularly in arthroscopic procedures for ablating and/or reshaping fibrocartilage, articular cartilage, meniscal tissue, and the like., 101639=In an exemplary embodiment as shown in FIG. 1, electrosurgical probe 10 includes an elongated shaft 13 which may be flexible or rigid, with flexible shafts optionally including support cannulas or other structures (not shown). Probe 10 includes a connector 19 at its proximal end and an array 12 of electrode terminals 58 disposed on the distal tip of shaft 13. A connecting cable 34 has a handle 22 with a connector 20 which can be removably connected to connector 19 of probe 10. The proximal portion of cable 34 has a connector 26 to couple probe 11 to power supply 28. The electrode terminals 58 are electrically isolated from each other and each of the terminals 58 is connected to an active or passive control network within power supply 28 by means of a plurality of individually insulated conductors 42 (see FIG. 2C). Power supply 28 has a selection means 30 to change the applied voltage level. Power supply 28 also includes means for energizing the electrodes 58 of probe 10 through the depression of a pedal 39 in a foot pedal 37 positioned close to the user. The foot pedal 37 may also include a second pedal (not shown) for remotely adjusting the energy level applied to electrodes 58. The specific design of a power supply which may be used with the electrosurgical probe of the present invention is described in parent application PCT US 94/051168, the full disclosure of which has previously been incorporated herein by reference., 67637=In addition, the present invention is particularly useful in procedures where the tissue site is flooded or submerged with an electrically conducting fluid, such as isotonic saline. Such procedures, e.g., arthroscopic surgery and the like, are described in detail in co-pending PCT International Application, U.S. National Phase Ser. No. PCT/US94/05168, filed on May 10, 1994, the complete disclosure of which has been incorporated herein by reference., 133052=In both of the above embodiments, the present invention provides localized ablation or disintegration of heart tissue to form a revascularization channel 214 of controlled diameter and depth. Usually, the diameter will be in the range of 0.5 mm to 3 mm. Preferably, the radio frequency voltage will be in the range of 400 to 1400 volts peak-to-peak to provide controlled rates of tissue ablation and hemostasis while minimizing the depth of necrosis of tissue surrounding the desired channel. This voltage will typically be applied continuously throughout the procedure until the desired length of the channel 214 is completely formed. However, the heartbeat may be monitored and the voltage applied in pulses that are suitably timed with the contractions (systole) of the heart., 89325=The voltage applied between the common electrode and the electrode array will be at high or radio frequency, typically between about 5 kHz and 20 MHz, usually being between about 30 kHz and 2.5 MHz, and preferably being between about 50 kHz and 400 kHz. The RMS (root mean square) voltage applied will usually be in the range from about 5 volts to 1000 volts, preferably being in the range from about 50 volts to 800 volts, and more preferably being in the range from about 100 volts to 400 volts. These frequencies and voltages will result in peak-to-peak voltages and current that are sufficient to vaporize the electrically conductive liquid and, in turn, create the conditions within the vaporized region which result in high electric fields and emission of energetic photons and/or electrons to ablate tissue. Typically, the peak-to-peak voltage will be in the range of 200 to 2000 volts and preferably in the range of 300 to 1400 volts and more preferably in the range of 700 to 900 volts., 81070=The necessary conditions for forming a vapor layer near the active electrode tip(s), ionizing the atom or atoms within the vapor layer and inducing the discharge of energy from plasma within the vapor layer will depend on a variety of factors, such as: the number of electrode terminals; electrode size and spacing; electrode surface area; asperities and sharp edges on the electrode surfaces; electrode materials; applied voltage and power; current limiting means, such as inductors; electrical conductivity of the fluid in contact with the electrodes; density of the fluid; and other factors. Based on initial experiments, applicants believe that the ionization of atoms within the vapor layer produced in isotonic saline (containing sodium chloride) leads to the generation of energetic photons having wavelengths, by way of example, in the range of 306 to 315 nanometers (ultraviolet spectrum) and 588 to 590 nanometers (visible spectrum). In addition, the free electrons within the ionized vapor layer are accelerated in the high electric fields near the electrode tip(s). When the density of the vapor layer (or within a bubble formed in the electrically conducting liquid) becomes sufficiently low (i.e., less than approximately 1020 atoms/cm3 for aqueous solutions), the electron mean free path increases to enable subsequently injected electrons to cause impact ionization within these regions of low density (i.e., vapor layers or bubbles). Energy evolved by the energetic electrons (e.g., 4 to 5 eV) can subsequently bombard a molecule and break its bonds, dissociating a molecule into free radicals, which then combine into final gaseous or liquid species.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The system and method of the present invention may also be useful to efficaciously ablate (i.e., disintegrate) cancer cells and tissue containing cancer cells, such as cancer on the surface of the epidermis, eye, colon, bladder, cervix, uterus and the like. The present invention's ability to completely disintegrate the target tissue can be advantageous in this application because simply vaporizing cancerous tissue may lead to spreading of viable cancer cells (i.e., seeding) to other portions of the patient's body or to the surgical team in close proximity to the target tissue. In addition, the cancerous tissue can be removed to a precise depth while minimizing necrosis of the underlying tissue. It should be noted that the above embodiment is merely representative and is not intended to limit the invention. For example, the electrosurgical probe can be used to effect a myocardial revascularization channel from the exterior of the heart into the ventricular cavity. In this procedure, the probe will be introduced into the thoracic cavity and positioned adjacent the epicardial layer of one of the ventricular walls via one of a variety of conventional manners. The above electrosurgical procedure will then be performed as the electrode is translated towards the heart until a channel is formed to the ventricular cavity. In both of the above embodiments, the present invention provides localized ablation or disintegration of heart tissue to form a revascularization channel 214 of controlled diameter",
