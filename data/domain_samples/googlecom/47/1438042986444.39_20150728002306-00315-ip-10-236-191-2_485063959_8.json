No. 09/769,014, filed Jan. 19, 2001, now pending., 113621=[0127] Mix part A and part B of Hysol OS0100 Epoxy in a 1:1 ratio at room temperature until obtaining a homogenous/clear solution.

Add an equal weight of RP-6420 isocyanate hardener to the polyol component (hardener to polyol ratio\u20141:1 by weight). Mix all components until obtaining a homogenous/clear solution. Pour the clear solution in the test mold and cure at 80\ufffd C. for 16 hours., 112777=[0124] Mix part A and part B of Hysol OS0100 Epoxy supplied by the Henkel KgaA Company (formerly provided by Dexter) of D\ufffdsseldorf, Germany in a 1:1 ratio at room temperature until obtaining a homogenous/clear solution. Pour the clear solution in the test mold and cure at 130\ufffd C. for 4 hours., 53351=[0035] FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a method and system for fabricating articles made from thermoset resins using an organic phosphate acid as the mold release agent. The system in the present invention uses a mold having a metal oxide surface which will enhance the release characteristics of an ionic mold release agent. In one actual embodiment, the mold is a glass mold constructed from float glass which has had a thin metal oxide coating formed on the inner face mold surface. Preferably, the metal oxide is deposited onto the \u201cair-side\u201d of the float glass substrate for highest durability. The thin metal oxide coating can be applied in any number of methods known in the thin metal coating art, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), including vacuum deposition and sputter deposition. The thin metal oxide coating can have a thickness of about 1 nm to about 10000 nm, preferably the thickness is in the range of about 50 to about 2000 nm, and 100-500 nm is most preferred. FIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of a suitable method and apparatus for forming a thin metal oxide coating on a substrate. While a thin metal oxide coating formed on a glass substrate is preferred, other alternates of the present invention can have the mold constructed from a metal substrate. In this manner, the metal substrate can form the metal oxide coating upon exposure to air. A representative example of an apparatus for forming the thin metal coating includes a chamber 100 having a substrate holder 102 for holding the mold substrate 104 in a preferred orientation while it is coated with a preferred compound. The chamber 100 includes an outlet 114 to a vacuum pump to evacuate the chamber 100 of air. The chamber 100 also includes an ion gun 110 with gas inlet 112. The ion gun can be augmented or replaced by an internal heating system. The substrate is heated to enhance the metal oxide film density and durability. An electron beam source 108 evaporates the compound 106 that is to be deposited onto the substrate 104.}",
