The word \u201ccomprising\u201d does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps than those listed in a claim. The invention can be implemented by means of hardware comprising several distinct elements, and by means of a suitably programmed computer. In the device claim enumerating several means, several of these means can be embodied by one and the same item of hardware. It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. The sequencers may be implemented in a state machine using memory elements other than D-type flip-flops. The state machine may be implemented in a software algorithm. It may than be required to store successive transition instants of the video signal to lower the speed of operation of the software algorithm. The sequencers may influence each other in another configuration as shown in FIG. 2. To summarize, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the invention, the solution described in this application proposes the examination of the analog video content of the R, G and B signals in their mutual variations in the crossing of a prefixed analog threshold (both in the raising and in the falling direction) and the subsequent",
