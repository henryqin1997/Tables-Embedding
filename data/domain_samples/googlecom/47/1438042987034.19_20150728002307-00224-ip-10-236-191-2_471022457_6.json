    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that many of the simple, mechanical structures described in the preferred embodiment may have many alternatives which achieve the same result. For example, the correction roller in the preferred embodiment is controlled by a drive motor mechanically connected in combination with a clutch and a brake. In this instance, the speed of the correction roller is controlled by the electrical supply to the clutch and brake which causes the drive system to either overdrive or brake the roller. However, other suitable variable speed drives may be used. Similarly, the preferred registration controller may be replaced by other misregistration detection and control systems using other types of sensors and circuitry well-known in the arts. The particular embodiments shown herein are for purposes of illustration and are but one method of carrying out the invention. There may be other modifications and changes obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art which fall within the scope of the present invention which should be limited only by the following claims and their legal equivalents. As above described, when the sensors detect either advanced or retarded condition of the laminating web, the required corrections are performed and the system becomes self-correcting. Electrical current to the clutch and changes to the roller actuator pressure are the variables regulated by the controller to achieve these results. Precise registration between the",
