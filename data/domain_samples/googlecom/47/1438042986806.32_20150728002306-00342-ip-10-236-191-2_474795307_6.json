    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments and various changes and modifications could be effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims. The present invention uses an exposure control signal magnetically or optically recorded between an edge of the photographic film and an effective exposure area of the photographic film. This signal can be used not only by the processor but also by the individual user, so that the individual can print using a relatively simple printer system according to the present invention. This simple home system can be combined with a computer system or a television for display. Also, an exposure control signal of the present invention may include an auxiliary signal for controlling a printer system or indicating certain features to the user. Thus, the present invention as described above can be used for many applications because it avoids using the punched in notch required in previously proposed systems. The above two embodiments of the photographic image system relate to an automatic printer in which the photosensitive paper is replaced by a CCD. These two embodiments use an exposure control signal magnetically or optically recorded between an edge of the photographic film and an effective exposure area",
