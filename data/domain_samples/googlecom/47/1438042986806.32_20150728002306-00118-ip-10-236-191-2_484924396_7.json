The instrument sensitivity were decreased proportionately from FIG. 5A to FIG. 5B to FIG. 5C to record the spectra so that the center peak (Mo) would be shown to have similar peak height., 111633=Nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulin may be prepared by specific labelling of the immunoglobulin itself or by covalently labelling at a hapten-binding site. To avoid clearance of the nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulin as part of the body's natural immune response, one may use immunoglobulin fragments, for example, (Fab)2 produced by cleaving the immunoglobulin according to known techniques with non-specific-labelling, a preferred molar ratio of nitroxide:immunoglobulin is up to 60:1., 92774=1. the rapid phase appears to involve the free radical (e.g. superoxide) oxidation of the nitroxide to its oxoammonium cation intermediate followed by the reduction of the oxoammonium cation to its stable hydroxylamine derivative of the nitroxide. Such reduction involves the participation of either one or two reducing equivalents (e.g. NADH) present in the vascular compartment. The reduction of nitroxide to its hydroxylamine would lead to a rapid reduction in ESR signal intensity, in the case of 8:1 molar ratio of 4-(2-bromoacetamido)-TEMPO-labelled HBOC represents approximately 25% of the 4-(2-bromoacetamido)-TEMPO on the HBOC. This phase involves both small molecule and macromolecular nitroxide., 24848=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/291,590, filed on Aug. 15, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,710, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/107,543, filed on Aug. 16, 1993, which was abandoned., 61026=A number of methods for isolating and purifying hemoglobin solutions such that they are physiologically compatible are known to those skilled in the art. Typically, purified hemoglobin compositions contain at least 99% hemoglobin by weight of total protein, a total phospholipid content of less than about 3 ug/ml, less than 1 ug/ml of either phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine and an inactive heme pigment of less than 6%. The purified hemoglobin solutions which are useful in this invention can be prepared using a variety of conventional techniques, including but are not limited to, those disclosed in Cheung et. al., Anal Biochem 137:481-484 (1984), De Venuto et. al., J. Lab. Clin. fled. 89:509-516 (1977), and Lee, et. al., Vith International Symposium on Blood Substitutes, San Diego, Calif. Mar. 17-20 Abstract H51 (1993)., 83818=Using a hemoglobin-to-nitroxide ratio of 1:2, greater than 90% of the nitroxide is covalently attached to the DBBF-Hb. DBBF-Hb may also be covalently labelled with a spacer group (e.g., an extra methyl group) between the maleimido and PROXYL moieties (i.e., 3-maleimidomethyl-PROXYL) which would exhibit a resonance spectrum similar to that of FIG. 3B. It is noteworthy that other nitroxides may be covalently attached to specific amino-groups in the DPG binding site (e.g., \u03b2-Val-1 \u03b2-Lys-82 and \u03b1-Lys-99) or may be attached to the remaining 40-plus surface lysine \u03b5-amino groups on hemoglobin. Isothiocyanate derivatives of the TEMPO and PROXYL nitroxides are also reactive with the amino group. For example, 4-isothiocyanate-TEMPO may be added to hemoglobin at a molar ratio of approximately 10:1. Resonance spectrum (not shown) of hemoglobin labelled with this nitroxide at other sites is similar to that shown in FIG. 3A., 89066=The separation of the resonance peaks permits the simultaneous monitoring of free radical or enzyme mimic activities involving the small molecular weight nitroxide (TEMPOL) and its macromolecular conjugate in both in vitro and in vivo (murine) reactions. For example, the in vivo plasma half-life of the two nitroxides was compared by referring to the unique spectral characteristics of the different nitroxides. Specifically, the in vivo ESR studies of hemoglobin-based solutions, on the mouse were performed using a nitroxide to hemoglobin ratio of 8:1 (see FIG. 5C) to take advantage of its high ESR signal intensity. First, the approximate plasma half-life of a small molecular weight nitroxide (15 ND17 -TEMPOL see FIG. 4C) and a large molecular weight 4-(2-bromoacetamido)-TEMPOL-labelled HBOC (see FIG. 4B) are determined by preparing a mixture of the two and adjusting the ESR signal intensity to be approximately the same (see FIG. 6). 0.5 ml of the mixture was injected under anesthesia into a distended mouse tail vein under a heat lamp. The mouse tail was inserted into an ESR cavity and the spectrum was recorded within 10 min. after injection (see FIG. 7A)., 101757=Also, any purified hemoglobin may be encapsulated with a liposome comprised of nitroxide-labelled fatty acids (e.g., 7-DOXYL-stearate, 12-DOXYL-stearic acid, and 16-DOXYL-stearate), cholestane, an analogue of cholesterol (e.g., 3-DOXYL-cholestane), or phospholipid (e.g., 12-DOXYL-stearate-labelled phosphatidylcholine). The preparation of hemoglobin encapsulated in a liposome comprised of 3-DOXYL-cholestane labelled may be prepared by a method analogous to that described in Tabushi et. al., (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106:219 (1984)). A 5 ml chloroform solution containing lipid compositions, including DOXYL labelled stearic acid and/or cholestane, as specified below were first dried in a stream of nitrogen to remove the solvent. Next, the residues were dried in vacuo and the resulting film was suspended in 2 ml of hemoglobin (24 g/dl) in a Lactated Ringers solution. The lipid concentration in the dispersion is 100 mM. The liposome encapsulated hemoglobin is then rotated and incubated preferably at 37\ufffd C. until all lipids are dispersed to form multilamellar vesicles. The resulting solution containing multilamellar liposome encapsulated hemoglobin and free unencapsulated hemoglobin is then forced through a microfluidizer to form 0.2 micron liposomes according to the procedure of Cook et. al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,254). The molar ratio of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcoline: cholesterol: dipalmitidyl phosphatidic acid: 3-DOXYL-cholestane in the liposome is 0.5:0.4:0.02:0.07. The resonance spectrum of the resulting 3-DOXYL-cholestane labelled liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin is shown in FIG. 10A. In this configuration, the nitroxide is intercalated into the liposome membrane and can be found at both the inner and outer surface of the lipid bilayer water interface. Substituting the 3-DOXYL-cholestane with 16-DOXYL-stearic acid in the lipid composition shown in FIG. 10A results in an electron resonance spectrum shown in FIG. 10B. The mobility of the nitroxide as reflected from the resonance spectrum is consistent with the interpretation that the DOXYL-moiety of the stearic acid is located predominately in the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer. With the addition of both the 3-DOXYL-cholestane and 16-DOXYL-stearate to the lipid composition at the same molar ratio, the resonance spectrum of the double nitroxide labelled liposome encapsulated hemoglobin is shown in FIG. 10C. The resonance spectrum of FIG. 10C is a composite of FIGS. 10A and 10B because the nitroxides in this embodiment are located at both the membrane-water interface and its hydrophobic lipid bilayer interior. By placing the nitroxide in both locations, this embodiment provides the oxygen detoxification function at both the lipid bilayer hydrophobic interior and the membrane-water interface thus providing the added benefit of an additional reserve of oxygen-detoxification capacity for the encapsulated hemoglobin., 27433=A Research Advisory Committee of the United States Navy issued a report in August 1992 outlining the efforts by several groups to produce a blood substitute, assessing the status of those efforts, and generally describing the toxicity problems encountered. The Naval Research Advisory Committee Report reflects the current consensus in the scientific community that even though the existing blood substitute products, often termed \"hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers\" (HBOC), have demonstrated efficacy in oxygen transport, certain toxicity issues are unresolved. The adverse transfusion reactions that have been observed in clinical studies of existing hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) include systemic hypertension and vasoconstriction. These adverse reactions have forced a number of pharmaceutical companies to abandon their clinical trials or to proceed at low dosage levels., 105717=4-Amino-TEMPO labelled dextran conjugated hemoglobin is prepared in accord with the procedure described by Tam et. al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 73:2128 (1976)). Initially, an 8% hemoglobin solution in 0.15M NaCl and 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 is conjugated to periodate-oxidized dextran to form a Schiff-base intermediate. Twenty molar equivalents of 4-amino-TEMPO is added to hemoglobin to form the Schiff-base between the nitroxide and the remaining reactive aldehyde groups on the dextran. After a 30 minute of incubation at 4\ufffd C., a 50 molar equivalent of dimethylamine borane in water is added. The solution is incubated for a further 2 hours at 4\ufffd C. Afterwards, the solution is dialyzed, reconstituted with Lactate Ringers buffer and sterile filtered with Filtron membrane filtration units (Filtron Technology Co.). The electron spin resonance spectrum of the 4-amino-TEMPO labelled dextran-conjugated hemoglobin is a sharp asymmetric triplet reflecting a high degree of motional freedom (See FIG. 11). The increased mobility of the TEMPO covalently attached to the Dextran is consistent with the nitroxide linked to a flexible polysaccharide dextran chain as compared to that of a tightly folded hemoglobin molecule (See FIGS. 3A and 3B). Thus, resonance spectrum in FIG. 11 demonstrates that a novel nitroxide labelled dextran conjugated hemoglobin has been prepared., 54673=FIGS. 8A-8B show a plasma half-life of a mixture of 4-(2-bromoacetamido)-TEMPO-labelled HBOC (8 g/dl of Hb and 8:1 TEMPO to Hb) and 15 ND17 TEMPOL (0.5 ml in a 32 g. mouse) recorded from the mouse tail with a cannula for immediate recording of the infused nitroxides. The ESR spectrum of the sample prior to injection is shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 8A is a series of 5 ESR spectrum recorded at 0.5 minute intervals, the magnetic field strength was increased by 2 Gauss in between each scan to display the decrease in signal intensity as a function of time. FIG. 8B is the continuation from FIG. 8A of repeated recording of a series of 6 ESR spectrum at the same time intervals except that the magnetic field strength was decreased by 2 Gauss in between each scan.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been illustrated by the specific embodiments described above, due to variety of forms of physiologically compatible hemoglobin and the structural diversity of the stable nitroxide-free radicals, a number of variations on the above embodiments are possible without departing from the basic spirit of the invention as described by the following claims. Nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulin may be prepared by specific labelling of the immunoglobulin itself or by covalently labelling at a hapten-binding site. To avoid clearance of the nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulin as part of the body's natural immune response, one may use immunoglobulin fragments, for example, (Fab)2 produced by cleaving the immunoglobulin according to known techniques with non-specific-labelling, a preferred molar ratio of nitroxide:immunoglobulin is up to 60:1. Nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulins may be used in vivo to provide protection against cellular damage by reactive oxygen species. Nitroxide-immunoglobulin may be used either alone or in combination with a low molecular weight nitroxide compound to provide extended antioxidant activity with an extended plasma half-life. As with the above-embodiment describing nitroxide-labelled albumin, the nitroxide-labelling technology demonstrated above in the example of nitroxide-HBOC is readily applied to the production of nitroxide-labelled immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are a class of plasma proteins produced in the B-cells of the immune system and which are characterized by two specific ligand binding sites (the antigen-binding sites). Nitroxides have been used in the past as probes in research on hapten-binding specificity and affinity of immunoglobulins during the",
