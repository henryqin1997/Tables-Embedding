    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39699=FIG. 4 shows courses of concentration of the ammonia adsorbed in the sensor material 34 as measured by means of the sensor 4, as a function of a penetration depth \u03b4 in the sensor material 34, for times t1 through t6. The penetration depth \u03b4 is measured in the positive z direction of FIGS. 1 and 3. On the left side of the diagram, at \u03b4=0, the measured concentration should therefore always be equal to that in the adjacent gas space. The ammonia-free sensor 4 at the time tO initially only relatively slowly fills with ammonia adsorbed from the exhaust gas 36 (compare the curves for the times t1 and t2). At the time t3, more ammonia is adsorbed in the sensor material 34 than is consumed by the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia, and as a result there is a local minimum in the concentration of adsorbed ammonia at a penetration depth of approximately 100 \u03bcm. As a result of a further metering of ammonia exceeding the concentration of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas 36, up to the respective times t4, t5 and t6, the quantities of ammonia adsorbed in the sensor material 34 downstream of a reaction zone (compare the local minimums) increase up to a saturation value Cs, which is approximately 1019 molecules of ammonia per cm3 for the sensor material 34 that is temperature-stabilized to 400\ufffd C. An ammonia metering that further remains constant and extends past the time t6 would cause an \"over-flow\" of the sensor 4. In other words, no further ammonia would be adsorbed in the catalyst, and consequently excess ammonia would leave the catalyst. This would lead to ammonia leakage, which must absolutely be avoided when a CDC is involved. This leakage also rises if the temperature of a catalyst, including the sensor material 34 that is likely filled with ammonia, for instance, rises, particularly at rising exhaust gas temperatures. The specific adsorption capability of the sensor material 34 for ammonia decreases as the temperature rises, and therefore with CDC use the catalyst should never be filled with ammonia up to the capacity limit.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations However, the sensors 4, 46 introduced in this case are also equally suitable for all other catalytic processes in which at least one reagent of a liquid or gaseous flow medium must be present in adsorbed form at the catalyst. The sensor 46, which is considerably simpler in structure and considerably simpler to produce as compared with the sensor 4 of FIG. 3, naturally operates by the same principle as the sensor 4. Due to the variously high coating thickness, once again in this case as well it is possible to make a statement as to the adsorbed quantity of a substance adsorbed from a flow medium at the sensor material 54 at the particular depth layer. Moreover, in this sensor 46 as well, it can be ascertained by means of the contact pair 62e what quantities of the adsorbed substance, such as ammonia occur at the surface after passing through a certain defined layer thickness, after a pulsed heating of the sensor material 54 by means of the heating devices 70. Thus given suitable following evaluation means, such as an on-board diagnosis system, this sensor 46 likewise assures extensive catalytic conversion of the nitrogen oxides with negligible ammonia leakage. In a departure from the concept on which the sensor 4 of FIGS. 1 and 3 is based, in this case the individual pairs of contacts 62a-62e are variously thickly coated with the sensor material 34",
