These materials are obtained by a process in which a salt A3 (Y3)p and a salt M'(Z3)n are dissolved in a copolymer of the present invention, in proportions such that the relationship z+y-nx=p is satisfied and that they permit the coexistence, in finite quantities, of the complex anion [M'(Z3)n (Y3)p ]p- and of a species chosen from the group consisting of the anion (Z3)-, the anion (Y3)-, the complex anion M'(Z3)n (Y3)p+1 ].sup.(p+1)- and the neutral species M'(Z3)n., 53868=The polymer obtained has a melting temperature Tm =12.7\ufffd C., intermediate between the melting temperature of POE 1000 and that of POE 400. This low melting temperature makes it possible to obtain polymer-salt complexes which are amorphous even at low salt concentrations., 60144=1,6-Dihydroxy-2,4-hexadiene was prepared by reduction of trans,trans-muconic acid (marketed by Aldrich under reference M9000-3) with the borane-THF complex. The diol thus obtained was converted into a halogen derivative (ClCH2 CH\u2550CH--)2 by treatment with thionyl chloride SOCl2 and purified by distillation at reduced pressure. An amount of 8 g of poly(oxyethylene) glycol of mass 1500 (marketed by Aldrich under reference 20243-6), 0.82 g of 1,6-dichloro-2,4-hexadiene and 5 ml of THF were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing and a dropping funnel. The mixture was heated to 40\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 1 g of finely ground commercial potassium hydroxide (containing 85% of KOH) was then added. After 16 hours of reaction, the product was diluted in THF, and filtered to remove the remaining KOH and the KCl formed. After evaporation of the THF, the product was taken up in water and the remaining KOH was neutralized by adding a Dowex 50X2 acidic resin marketed by Dow Chemical. The water was then evaporated off., 43399=When the group E is R3 --, the monomers (1) are obtained from the sulfonylacetic acid fluoride by a three-stage process. During a first stage, the sulfonylacetic acid fluoride is treated with water; this resulting in a hydrolysis followed by a decarboxylation. The compound obtained has a proton exhibiting an acidic character on the \u03b1 carbon, making possible the formation of a carbanion which, during a second stage, gives rise to a nucleophilic substitution reaction in the presence of a base. During a third stage, the compound obtained is reacted with the appropriate reactant to replace the fluorine of the SO2 F group with an ionic group. Such monomers are described in FR-A-2,687,671, filed on Feb. 21, 1992, to which reference will be made for further details., 52829=An amount of 2 g of poly(oxyethylene)diol of mass 400 (POE 400) (marketed by Aldrich under reference 20,239-8), 5 g of poly(oxyethylene)diol of mass 1000 (POE 1000) (marketed by Aldrich under reference 20,242-8) and 1.24 g of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing. The mixture was heated to 40\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 3 g of finely ground potassium hydroxide were then added. After 10 hours of reaction, a product was obtained, of mass Mw=72,000 and Mn=34,000, as polystyrene equivalent. The product was dissolved in THF to remove the remaining KOH and the KCl formed. After evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran (THF), the product was dissolved in water and the remaining KOH was neutralized by adding an Amberlite IR118 acidic resin marketed by Rohm & Haas. The mixture was then filtered to remove the resin, the water was distilled off and drying was completed in a vacuum desiccator at 50\ufffd C. for 48 hours., 47597=An amount of 5 g of poly(oxyethylene) glycol of mass 1000 (marketed by Aldrich under reference 20,242-8) and 0.57 g of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing and a dropping funnel. The mixture was heated to 40\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 1.35 g of finely ground potassium hydroxide were then added. After 16 hours of reaction, the product was taken up in THF and filtered to remove the remaining KOH and the KCl formed. After evaporation of the solvent, the product was taken up in water. The remaining traces of KOH were removed with a Dowex 50X2 acidic resin (marketed by Dow Chemical) until a neutral pH was obtained. The water was then evaporated off. The molecular masses, given by steric exclusion chromatography analysis are: Mw=103,000 and Mn=46,000, as polystyrene equivalent., 51424=An amount of 5 g of poly(oxypropylene) glycol of mass 1025 (marketed by Aldrich under reference 20,232-0) and 0.42 cm3 of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing. The mixture was heated to 40\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 1.3 g of finely ground potassium hydroxide was then added. After 10 hours of reaction, the product was dissolved in water. The aqueous solution was filtered through ultrafiltration cells (cutoff threshold 1000) to remove the remaining KOH and the KCl formed. The water was then evaporated off. The molecular masses, given by steric exclusion chromatography analysis, are: (Mw according to 200-1000 A columns)=55,000 and (Mn according to 200-1000 A columns)=23,000, as polystyrene equivalent., 66526=An amount of 2.2 g of the abovementioned coupling agent and 0.8 g of finely ground commercial potassium hydroxide (85% of KOH) were added to 10 g of poly(ethylene glycol) of mass 2000 and 5 ml of THF. After 16 hours of reaction, the product was diluted in THF and filtered to remove excess KOH and KCH3 \u03a6SO3 formed by the polycondensation reaction. The solvent was evaporated off and the product was taken up in water and washed by ultrafiltration (cutoff M\u22675000). The polymer obtained can be spontaneously crosslinked after incorporation of LiTFSI (O/Li=14/1) by heating to 180\ufffd C. for 10 minutes., 56274=An amount of 7.8 g of finely ground KOH and 5 g of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were added to a mixture of 10 g of poly(oxyethylene) glycol of mass 1000 and 1.2 g of 1,6-hexanediol. The mixture was heated to 70\ufffd C. in a three-necked round bottom flask fitted with mechanical stirring, a reflux condenser and an argon delivery. Analysis of the reaction mixture after 24 hours of reaction, carried out by steric exclusion chromatography performed on two Ultrastyragel 100 A columns--a technique which allows good separation of the oligomers and of monomers [cf. J. Y. Sanchez et al., Analysis, 18,577-81 (1990)] shows the complete consumption of the polyethylene glycol and of approximately 85% of the hexanediol. After a treatment which is identical with that of Example 7, mass analysis gives Mw=22,000 and Mn=9,600., 67233=An amount of 0.5 g of 1,6-hexanediol and 0.4 cm3 of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing. The mixture was heated to 40\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 1.2 g of finely ground potassium hydroxide were then added. After 8 hours of reaction, the product was dissolved in THF. The solution was filtered to remove the inorganic salts (KOH and KCl). The THF was removed. The product was then taken up in water and neutralized with the aid of a Dowex 50X2 acidic resin marketed by Dow Chemical. The resin was removed by filtration and the water by evaporation. Molecular masses given by steric exclusion chromatography analysis are: Mn=2500 and Mw=4000, as polystyrene equivalent., 63901=An amount of 6 g of poly(oxyethylene)triol (POE triol) of mass 2000, marketed by the company Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku, 1.8 g of polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether of mass 600 and 0.75 g of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were introduced into a two-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing. The mixture was heated to 45\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring and 10 ml of THF and 1.8 g of finely ground commercial potassium hydroxide were then added. After 10 hours of reaction, the product was dissolved in water. The aqueous solution was filtered through ultrafiltration cells (cutoff threshold 5000) to remove the remaining KOH and the KCl formed. The water was then evaporated off., 18658=This is a Division of application Ser. No. 08/105,807 filed on Aug. 13, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,393,847., 45961=An amount of 20 g of poly(oxyethylene) glycol of mass 2000 (marketed by Aldrich under reference 29,590-6) and 2.4 g of finely ground sodium hydroxide were introduced into a three-necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer bearing, an argon delivery and a dropping funnel. The mixture was heated to 45\ufffd C. with vigorous mechanical stirring. After a viscous mixture was obtained, 1.25 g (102 mol) of 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene were added slowly. After 8 hours of reaction, the product was taken up in CH2 Cl2 and the inorganic precipitate was separated off by filtration. After evaporation of the solvent, a viscous liquid was obtained. The molecular masses, given by steric exclusion chromatography analysis are: Mw=69,000 and Mn=27,000, as polystyrene equivalent., 34823=The salt may also be chosen from the salts corresponding to the formula (1/nM)+ [(RF SO2)2 CY1 ]- in which Y1 denotes an electron-withdrawing group chosen from --C.tbd.N and the groups R\"Z1 -- in which Z1 denotes a carbonyl group, a sulfonyl group or a phosphonyl group and R\" denotes a monovalent organic group optionally containing a functional group capable of being crosslinked by a radical route or by a Diels-Alder reaction, M and RF having the meaning given above. Such compounds can be prepared by reaction of a compound (1/nM)+ [(RF SO2)2 CH]- with a compound Y1 X1 in the presence of a nucleophilic aprotic base Nu, X1 denoting a halogen or a pseudohalogen. Lithium salts are particularly preferred, more especially (CF3 SO2)2 N- Li+ and (CF3 SO2)3 C- Li+. Mixtures of salts can be employed. These salts and the process for preparing them are described in FR-A-2,683,254, filed on Nov. 8, 1991, to which reference will be made for further details.}",
