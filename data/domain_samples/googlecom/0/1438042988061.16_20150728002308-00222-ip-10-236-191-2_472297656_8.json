    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70180=Another modification of an automatic retractable safety penetrating instrument according to the present invention is illustrated at 230 in FIG. 12. The retracting member 258 and the locking and releasing mechanism 280 for the instrument 230 are similar to that shown in FIG. 7 except that the trigger member 288 is formed of a cam having opposing legs 289 and 291, the trigger member being rotatable or pivotably mounted on a pin 293 extending between side walls of the hub 236 or of a case as disclosed in applicant's co-pending patent application Ser. No. 07/848,838 filed Mar. 10, 1992, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. The cannula 234 has a distal end 292 configured to form a smooth profile with the needle 232 in the operative state and a proximal end mounted in or formed with a front wall of the hub 236. The distal portion 235 of the cannula 234 is joined to the cannula body 237 by an axial length of a circumferentially or peripherally continuous flexible balloon, membrane or tube 239. The balloon 239 is normally disposed in a contracted, non-inflated or non-expanded state substantially continuous with the circumference of the distal portion 235 and body 237 as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. A passage 241 is formed in the wall of the cannula body 237 to extend longitudinally, axially from the balloon 239 to the hub 236, the passage 241 opening into the interior of the hub through the front wall thereof. A valve or seal 243 is mounted on a forward face of the retraction plate 256 to close off and seal the passage from the interior of the hub when the retraction plate is held against the front wall via the locking and releasing mechanism 280, as shown in FIG. 12. A valve 297 is provided in a wall of the hub 236 to control flow of fluid and, therefore, pressurization, in the interior of the hub., 83685=Another embodiment of an automatic retractable safety penetrating instrument is illustrated in FIG. 19 at 730 and includes a cannula 734 formed with or connected to a front wall of the hub 736, a needle 732 disposed within the cannula and a safety probe 765 disposed within the lumen of the needle. The safety probe 765 terminates proximally at an end flange 773, with the tube 750 extending distally through a rear wall of the hub 736 and through an opening in the end flange 773 into the hollow proximal end of the safety probe. An annular rim 779 is disposed on an end of the tube 750 within the proximal end of the safety probe, and a helical coil spring 777 is connected between the rim 779 and the end flange 775 to bias the safety probe distally to an extended position with the blunt distal end 767 of the safety probe protruding beyond and protecting the sharp tip 740 of the needle. The needle terminates proximally at an operating member or flange 748 disposed within the hub, with the needle extending through an opening in a retraction plate 756 held against the front wall of the hub by a locking and releasing mechanism 780. An operating spring 754 is disposed concentrically around the needle and connected between the retraction plate 756 and the operating flange 748 to bias the needle distally to an extended position with the trailing edge 744 disposed beyond the distal end 792 of the cannula 734. A retracting spring 760 is connected between the retraction plate 756 and the rear wall of the hub and, if desired, a guide rod 761 can be provided to ensure axial alignment of the spring 760. A locking and releasing mechanism 780 similar to the locking and releasing mechanism 2130 of FIG. 12 is disposed in the hub 736 to actuate the retraction mechanism., 20673=This application is a divisional application of application Ser. No. 07/868,578, filed Apr. 15, 1992 which is a continuation-in-part of patent application Ser. No. 07/805,506, filed Dec. 6, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,432. The specifications of patent applications Ser. No. 07/800,507, filed Nov. 27, 1991, abandoned, Ser. No. 07/805,506, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,432 and Ser. No. 07/808,325, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,268, filed Dec. 16, 1991, and Ser. No. 07/848,838, filed Mar. 10, 1992, all naming InBae Yoon as inventor are incorporated herein by reference., 42779=A retracting mechanism engages the proximal end of the needle 32 and includes the retracting plate 56 and the retracting spring 60, and the retracting mechanism is actuated by a locking and releasing or trigger mechanism 80 formed of a latch or locking spring having a substantially flat base 82 secured to a wall of hub 36 with an arm 84 bent inwardly therefrom and extending angularly distally in the direction of the longitudinal axis. A bent locking finger or member 86 is carried on a distal end of arm 84 to engage retraction plate 56 and hold the plate against the front wall of the hub to prevent movement thereof when the locking spring is in its normal position as illustrated in FIG. 3. The trigger mechanism 80 has a releasing or trigger member 88 extending rearwardly or proximally from arm 84 at an angle to allow movement of operating flange 48 thereby in a proximal direction without causing bending of arm 84. The retracting spring or bias device 60 defines a shoulder 90 acting as a positive stop or abutment member to limit proximal movement of the needle by abutment with operating flange 48, and trigger 88 is positioned distally of shoulder 90 by a distance corresponding to the distal movement desired of the operating member or flange prior to automatic retraction, as will be explained in more detail hereinafter. The locking and releasing or trigger mechanism can be mounted at any suitable location on the hub and provided with any required configuration to act as a stop or abutment to prevent proximal movement of the retracting plate and to be actuated or released by the distally moving operating member. The locking and releasing mechanism can be made as one piece or multiple pieces dependent upon the hub construction and the operating member utilized to actuate the trigger, flange 48 in the embodiment of FIG. 1. As shown, locking member 86 and trigger 88 are unitarily, integrally formed of a single strip of resilient, spring material such as metal or plastic. The locking and releasing mechanism as well as the retraction mechanism can be formed as a module to simplify assembly in the hub as explained in applicant's co-pending patent application Ser. No. 07/848,838, filed Mar. 10, 1992, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Inasmuch as the present invention is subject to many variations, modifications and changes in detail, it is intended that all subject matter discussed above or shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative only and not be taken in a limiting sense. Automatic retractable safety penetrating instruments according to the present invention can be formed of two, three or more cylindrical or tubular members, and the members can be flexible, rigid, semi-rigid as well as transparent, opaque or radio-opaque. The locking and releasing mechanism chosen for the automatic retractable safety penetrating instruments will depend on ease of manufacture and assembly, holding or locking forces required and releasing forces required. The spacing of the trigger from the operating member during tissue penetration will determine the distal movement required of the operating member prior to automatic retraction. The configuration of the trigger will depend on the bias force on the operating member and the amount of movement required of the locking member to release the retraction member. Resilient, elastic, rubber or sponge members can be used as bias devices, and the resilient, elastic, rubber or sponge members can be formed to define a stop or abutment limiting proximal movement of the operating member to assure alignment at a distal end of the instrument. The automatic retractable safety penetrating instrument can have parts thereof, such as the knob or the tube, connected with a source of electric current",
