It is intended that all such modifications falls within the scope of the appended claims. After completion of the mobile terminal function, the mobile terminal may by default return to the inactive mode of the keypad or automatically transition to the active mode or present the user with a choice. The present invention provides voice activated functions, such as calling, at reduced cost and complexity compared to the prior art requiring additional keys, such as dedicated keys, to be added in phones of reduced size. The invention avoids the addition of keys beyond the conventional soft keys to initiate mobile terminal functions which additions are expensive and present spatial problems. With the invention, at least one soft key is used to provide the user with a selection of at least one mobile terminal function with a minimal amount of user interaction with the user interface directly from the inactive mode of the keypad without requiring exiting thereof as in the prior art. may be, without limitation, GPS. The mobile terminal function which is activated, selected or completed is responsive to the location information input and is dependent thereon so that the particular mobile terminal function is determined from the",
