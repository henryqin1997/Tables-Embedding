For instance, a digital TV may be capable of decoding high-resolution content streams, e.g., DVB MPEG-2 streams, while mobile phones may only be able to decode low-resolution content streams, e.g., MPEG-4 movies transmitted via UMTS. In addition to heterogeneity in content rendering capabilities, the home networking capabilities of CE devices may also differ. For example, a TV may be equipped with a high bit rate IEEE 1394 interface, a PDA may be equipped with a moderate bit rate IEEE 802.11b wireless interface, and a mobile phone may be equipped with a low bit rate Bluetooth interface., 70814=The consumer environment 12 includes a network 18 and one or more clusters 20. A cluster 20 is a group of consumer electronic (CE) devices associated with a particular location (e.g., a room or a portion of a room) within the consumer environment 12. Certain CE devices within the one or more clusters 20 are in communication with each other via the network 18. The network 18 may use any wired or wireless communication protocol (e.g., IEEE 1394, Ethernet, IEEE 802.11b, Bluetooth, etc.) capable of transporting content compatible with the surrounding networked devices. The network 18 may also be a hybrid combination of networks utilizing a combination of protocols and a combination of wired and wireless technologies (i.e., wired, fiber optic, low-level RF, IR).}",

Accordingly, the embodiments of the invention in the preceding description are intended to be illustrative, rather than limiting, of the spirit and scope of the invention. More specifically, it is intended that the invention embrace all alternatives, modifications, and variations of the exemplary embodiments described herein that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. , another example of an end-to-end communication path 160 in the consumer environment 12 shows a simplified realized graph for a video conference. Here, the source of audio-video content is another consumer environment 12 via a content/service provider 16. An external communication resource 32 in the consumer environment 12 receives the audio-video content and provides it to a particular cluster 20. A processing resource 26 in the cluster 20 conditions audio-video streams from the external consumer environment 12 for two sink resources 22 (i.e., a video display and audio speakers). For example, the processing device 26 may be responsible for converting audio-video streams from/to H.323. Two source resources 24 (i.e., a camera and a microphone) provide audio-video content to the processing resource 26. The processing resource 26 conditions the audio-video stream from the source resources 24 and audio-video content is communicated back",
