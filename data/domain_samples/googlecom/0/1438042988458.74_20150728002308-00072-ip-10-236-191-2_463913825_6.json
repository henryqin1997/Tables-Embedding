The exemplary sheet receiving and delivering devices may be of the type shown in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/390,929 filed Sep. 7, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The sheet delivering and receiving devices may enable receiving and storing sheets in selected compartments as well as selectively delivering sheets from the various compartments. As can be appreciated from the incorporated disclosure, some of the note handling mechanisms may receive and store notes only, others may dispense notes only and some may both receive and dispense notes. Other mechanisms may process sheets of types other than notes. Machine 10 further includes an envelope depository schematically indicated 40. Depository 40 is a device configured to accept and hold relatively thick sheet-like deposit envelopes deposited by customers in the machine., 109744=Exemplary embodiments may operate to assure operation in accordance with the principles of U.S. application Ser.
