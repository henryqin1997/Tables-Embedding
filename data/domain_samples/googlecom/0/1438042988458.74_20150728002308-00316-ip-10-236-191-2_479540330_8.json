Accordingly, the apparatus and method of the present invention, wherein the concavely contoured surface portion of the forming surface has side walls with angles of from about 45\ufffd to 68\ufffd, provides a high degree of releasability of the laid fibrous article from the forming surface, consistent with the objective of imparting a raised surface of high basis weight. The readily removable character of the laid fibrous article from the concavely contoured surface portions of the forming surface of the present invention renders such forming surface highly attractive in automated high-speed commercial operation for the manufacture of fibrous web articles. The Run A design failed to release in 11 of the 61 trials, with three trials exhibiting failure to release in the rear, two exhibiting failure to release in the front, and six failing to release on the sides, yielding an efficiency of 82% (50 successful trials out of 61). In contrast, Run B, representative of the present invention, yielded 100% release efficiency with complete release in 61 out of the 61 trials. A second test (Run B) was conducted, using a forming section having a concavely",
