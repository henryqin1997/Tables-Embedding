    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof. According to the invention, a selector is disposed in a macro block to switch and collect bit lines. Since ways are switched from one to another outside a memory array, the layout of an output data bus will not be complicated. The same bits of different ways may be collected into a group to share a single sense amplifier. Such group may be repeatedly prepared, to remarkably simplify a fabrication of memory cell arrays. Since each sense amplifier is shared by different ways according to the invention, it is not necessary to arrange each sense amplifier within a bit pitch. This may simplify layout designing of the sense amplifiers. Another cache memory according to the invention employs an s-way set-associative mapping system (s being an integer larger than 2). In this cache memory, one sense amplifier is shared by different ways, to reduce the number of sense amplifiers as well as cutting down power consumption of the cache memory to, for example, one fourth of the prior art. In summary, a cache memory according to the invention activates, in a read operation, sense amplifiers according to hit signals from tag memories. The sense amplifiers are activated only when a hit occurs. If a cache miss is detected, or if no cache",
