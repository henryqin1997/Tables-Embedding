That reference discloses a hard and lubricous thin film of amorphous carbon-hydrogen-silicon and a process for producing the film by heating in a vacuum at 600\ufffd C. The disclosed film is applied to an iron-base metallic material, thereby forming a hard coating of low friction. However, at such temperatures, there may be a tendency to melt the substrate, and if the substrate is made of steel, to detemper it. Additionally, there may be a loss of net shape.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, there has been provided in accordance with the present invention an improved powertrain component and its method of preparation. The component includes one or more coating systems of films and interlayers having a composition gradient which impart the characteristics of low friction and wear resistance to the component. As a result, the average service intervals required by the component tend to be prolonged and therefore less frequent. When it is desired to deposit hydrogenated carbon films on ferrous alloys, a difficulty tends to arise because carbon has a high solubility in ferrous alloys. In such cases, the interposition of the adherent interlayer may serve as an effective barrier between the substrate and the film. Suitable substrates may include aluminum, an aluminum-silicon alloy, an aluminum-copper-silicon alloy, steel and other ferrous alloys, magnesium, magnesium alloys, aluminum nitride, titanium, Ti-Al alloys, ceramics, and mixtures thereof. The disclosed films may be usefully applied to various components, such as engine and journal bearings, besides a valve stem and a valve guide. Other applications include the use of hydrogenated carbon films or doped amorphous hydrogenated carbon films at the piston-cylinder interface, and on swash plates used in compressors. Precursors for silicon and most metals are available, but almost all are toxic, corrosive, and/or explosive. The inventors have found that diethylsilane (SiH2)(C2 H3)2 as supplied by Schumacher Chemicals, Inc., is a safe source of silicon for deposition of Si-doped amorphous hydrogenated carbon.",
