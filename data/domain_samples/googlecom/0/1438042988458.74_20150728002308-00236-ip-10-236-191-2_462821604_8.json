    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although a best mode of practicing the invention has been disclosed by reference to certain preferred embodiments and methods, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the foregoing description, that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention shall be limited only by the appended claims and the rules and principles of applicable law. The three layer structure can be produced with a composite thickness of less than 60 \u03bcm. The stainless steel core or base metal wall 15 may be fabricated in a thickness of approximately 35 \u03bcm, which offers sufficient mechanical strength to resist the natural recoil of the blood vessel wall following deployment of the stent. The noble metal or alloy intermediate layer 50 is applied in a preferably 5 \u03bcm thickness to all exposed surfaces of the base layer, giving a total additional thickness of 10 \u03bcm to the structure, and serving to avoid a galvanic potential. The outermost IROX layer or oxide, hydroxide or nitrate of noble metal is applied to a thickness of up to about 1.5 \u03bcm atop the intermediate layer as a biocompatible surface for the overall stent. The virus transfer is performed by incorporating the gene therapy agent\u2014a viral vector or virus of the above-mentioned type that contains the viral genetic information desired to be",
