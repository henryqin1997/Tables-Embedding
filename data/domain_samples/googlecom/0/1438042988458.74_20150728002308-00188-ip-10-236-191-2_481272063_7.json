Referring now to FIGS. 20c and 20 d, a user may press the option button 72 to access the Calendar category 176. The date indicated in the alphanumeric information window 110 reflects the present date by default. The total number of alarms that are scheduled from the current date and time are indicated by the alarm numbering indicator 106, in this case indicating thirty such alarms. The user may press and hold the edit button 74 to change the starting date to one in the past or the future using the previously described day/date entry procedures. As is indicated in FIG. 20d, changing the starting date to a previous date will indicate to the user all of the alarms and messages (i.e., all records) that have a date/time stamp that post date the selected starting date. In an example shown in FIG. 20c, a total of thirty alarms have been scheduled from the displayed date of Tuesday, Feb. 20, 1996. By changing the starting date to Monday, Feb. 5, 1996, a total of fifty alarms and messages have been scheduled from this new starting date, as indicated by the number indicator 106 and the message and alarm indicators 104 b and 104 c., 69603=The CPU 120 is coupled to an LCD/interface driver 126 by way of an internal bus 128. The LCD/interface driver 126 drives both a keypad 130 provided on the housing 41, as well as the LCD interface display panel 44. It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the keyboard 130 and the LCD interface display panel 44 may be controlled by independent interface and LCD drivers, respectively. A suitable LCD/interface driver is model KS57C2616 manufactured by Samsung Electronics Corporation., 68115=Referring to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a system block diagram of various components comprising the portable audio database device 40 in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. FIGS. 5-7 illustrate in schematic form the embodiment of the portable audio database device 40 illustrated in FIG. 4. The central processing unit (CPU) 120 communicates with an internal flash memory 122 which is configured to store various types of information, including voice and audio information, text information, and graphical information. It is noted that graphical icons may be stored in the flash memory 122, in a ROM memory of the CPU 120, or other non-volatile memory of the portable audio database device 40. As will be discussed in detail hereinbelow, a unique object-oriented memory management scheme may be employed to efficiently manage different types of information, and to manage associations or links between various types of information. It is to be understood that various types of non-volatile memories other than flash memory may be employed. Non-volatility, programmability, and low-power consumption are desirable characteristics that make flash memory particularly well-suited for use in the portable audio database device 40. The system memory 122 preferably includes one or more model KM29V040 or KM29V1600 type flash memory devices manufactured by Samsung Electronics Corporation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will, of course, be understood that various modifications and additions can be made to the embodiments discussed hereinabove without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the particular embodiments listed above, but should be defined only by the claims set forth below. An alternative embodiment of a docking station is illustrated in FIG. 31. The docking station 900 includes an IR interface 910 and a communication line 912 for coupling the docking station 900 to a personal computer or other peripheral device. A coupling slot 904 is provided on the housing 902 to couple a portable audio database device 40 to the docking station 900. Information may then be communicated between the external computer or peripheral device and the portable audio database device 40. It is noted that a software program that emulates the operating system and functionality of the portable audio database device 40 may be operating on a personal computer coupled to the docking station 900. A personal computer configured with a virtual copy of the portable audio database device software may enhance the communication of information between the portable audio database device 40 and the computer, as well as the transferring of applications and databases between the two systems. It is noted that any number of portable audio database device applications may be stored on external memory",
