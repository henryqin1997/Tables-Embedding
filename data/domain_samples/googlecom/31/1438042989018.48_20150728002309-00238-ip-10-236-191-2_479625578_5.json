The computational software in EPROM 74 also instructs CPU 78 to determine the pulse rate from the signal period tp. Displays 20 then provide visible and audible outputs of the oxygen saturation and pulse rate in a manner conveniently used by the operator of oximeter 10. Pursuant to that method, independently derived data associating ROS with the oxygen saturation is obtained, a mathematical expression between the two can be derived from a plot of the curve. The basic formula and the coefficients of the formula's variables are then stored in EPROM 74. When a value for ROS is measured, CPU 78 extracts the coefficients from EPROM 74 and computes a value for the oxygen saturation. This technique allows information completely identifying the entire calibration curve, or a family of such curves, to be stored within a relatively small amount of EPROM 74 space. With sufficiently large space in EPROM 74, enough points along the calibration curve can be stored in a look-up table to allow CPU 78 to extract an accurate indication of oxygen saturation from the value of ROS input to EPROM 74.
