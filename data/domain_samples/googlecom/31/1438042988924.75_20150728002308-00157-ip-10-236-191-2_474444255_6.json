After the water had been removed in vacuo, the reaction time was 3 hours at 150\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was worked up as in a). 1205 g (85% of the theoretical) of amine C5 were obtained as the end product. The amine value of the product was 76.5 (calc. 78.8)., 37288=So far as the terminal alkyl chains are concerned, the amines may be both individual products and also mixtures. Mixtures will generally be present when natural, renewable raw materials, such as oils and fats, are used as the source for these alkyl groups. Thus, amines containing a mixture of cetyl and stearyl groups, in a ratio of 1:4 to 2:1, as the alkyl groups, of the type obtainable for example from vegetable or animal tallow, show very good stabilizing properties. Accordingly, particularly preferred amines for the purposes of the present invention are, for example,, 50539=In an autoclave, 746 g triethanolamine were reacted with 440 g ethylene oxide in the presence of 2.9 g sodium methylate solution as catalyst at a temperature of 150\ufffd C. and under a pressure of 5 bar in the same way as in c2). A total of 1446 g (4.22 moles) LANETTE\ufffdE and 169 g (4.22 moles) NaOH were added in portions in equivalent quantities to 500 g (2.11 moles) of the product at 150 to 175\ufffd C. The product formed thereafter served as solvent, so that the reaction mixture remained stirrable. After the last portion of LANETTE\ufffdE and NaOH had been added, the after-reaction time was 3 hours at 175\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was then worked up as in a). Amine C4 was obtained as the end product in a yield of 85% of the theoretical. The amine value of the product was 83.1 (calc. 82.1)., 35533=It is known to one skilled in the art that alkoxylation reactions, such as for example the addition of n moles ethylene oxide onto 1 mole of a compound containing an active hydrogen atom by known ethoxylation processes, do not give an individual adduct, but instead a mixture of residual quantities of free starting compound and a number of homologous (oligomeric) adducts of 1, 2, 3, . . .n, n+1, n+2 . . . etc. molecules of ethylene oxide per molecule of starting compound. The average degree of ethoxylation (n) is defined by the starting quantities of compound containing an active hydrogen atom and ethylene oxide. The distribution curve of the homolog mixture generally has a maximum in the range from n-3 to n+3. More detailed information on these points can be found, for example, in the journal Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, January 1988, page 34.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations After mixing 1 part by weight of formulations 1 to 3 with 1 part by weight of 6% by weight hydrogen peroxide solution, only formulations 2 and 3 showed entirely satisfactory adhesion to hair. In addition, the synergistic effect obtained where these amines are combined with amines of formula (D) is clearly apparent. The results clearly reflect the stabilizing effect obtained by using amines (C) according to the invention as a result of the buildup of viscosity. Corresponding formulations which contained neither amine (C) nor amine (D) were not stable.

These hair dye preparations are low-viscosity to medium-viscosity liquids of which the viscosities were determined with a Haake-Rotovisko RV 12 viscosimeter at 20\ufffd C.
