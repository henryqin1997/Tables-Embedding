For example, certain components may be installed into the door jamb such as the position magnets. As will be evident to those skilled in the art in construction of a building, the doors are preferably not installed until most of the building is complete to protect the finished surfaces of the doors from becoming damaged. The doors are then transported to the installation location in step 150 for installation. The door jambs may be installed during construction of the walls. At the site, the hinges are aligned with the other half of the hinges on the door jamb. In step 152, the power source is coupled to the door. In step 154, the door is coupled to the network. In actuality, steps 152 and 154 may be performed simultaneously since it is preferred that a single connector be used for network access and a coupling to the power source. The other doors of the network are also configured in the same manner. A number of doors may be loaded with configuration information and tested simultaneously. After the door is configured with the various electronic components including the integrated door unit 102, inputs 106 and outputs 108, the system",
