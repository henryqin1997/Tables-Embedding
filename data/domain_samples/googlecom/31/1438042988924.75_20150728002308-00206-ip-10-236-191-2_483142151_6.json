The display terminal of FIG. 1 communicates with the network through the communications adapter 34. Since many of the aspects of the present invention involve access via networks, some background with respect to networks would be appropriate at this point. We will not go into great detail in describing the networks to which the present invention is applicable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,244, Dev et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,399, Kuwamoto et al., adequately detail conventional networks to which the present invention would be applicable, including appropriate network management and display terminal access to such networks. Reference has also been made to the applicability of the present invention to a global network such as the Internet. For details on Internet nodes, objects and links, reference is made to the text, \"Mastering the Internet\", G. H. Cady et al., published by Sybex Inc., Alameda, Calif., 1996.}",

One of the preferred implementations of the present invention is as an application program 40 made up of programming steps or instructions resident in RAM 14, FIG. 1, during computer operations. Until required by the computer system, the program instructions may be stored in another readable medium, e.g in disk drive 20, or in a removable memory such as an optical disk for use in a CD-ROM computer input, or in a floppy disk for use in a floppy disk drive computer input. Further, the program instructions may be stored in the memory of another computer prior to use in the system of the present invention and transmitted over a LAN or a WAN, such as the Internet, when required by the user of the present invention. One skilled in the art should appreciate that the processes controlling the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of computer readable media of a variety of forms. The running of the process will now be described with respect to FIG. 10. First, step 110, a determination is made as to whether there is an initial, next page or screen to be displayed.
