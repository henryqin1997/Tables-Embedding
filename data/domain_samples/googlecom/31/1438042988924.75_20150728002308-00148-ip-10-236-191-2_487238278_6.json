Nos. 3,971,751, 3,979,384 and 4,323,488 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 36319/1970, 12154/1971 and 32673/1974, and Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 156599/1975, 73561/1976, 6096/1979, 82123/1980, 123620/1980, 125121/1980, 131022/1980, 135135/1980 and 137129/1980. The oxyalkylene base polymers are also cured by crosslinking them at room temperature to provide an elastomeric cured material having good elongation properties., 67769=To the resin mixture (100 parts), #910 (2.0 parts) as the component (E), A-1120 (2.0 parts) or MTS-31 (3.0 parts) as the component (C) and KBM202 (5.0 parts) or KBM602 (2.0 parts) as the component (D) were added to prepare a one-pot type adhesive, which was subjected to the following adhesion test., 21314=Polymers of alkyl (meth)acrylates having at least one silicon-containing group to the silicon atom of which a hydroxy group or a hydrolyzable group is bonded and which is cross linkable through formation of a siloxane bond (hereinafter referred to as a \"silicon-containing reactive group\") are disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 36395/1979 and the like. Such polymers are cured by crosslinking the silicon-containing reactive group particularly with moisture in the air to provide a cured material having good weather resistance and water resistance., 28463=The weight ratio of the repeating units (I) to the repeating units (II) is preferably from 95:5 to 40:60, more preferably from 90:10 to 60:40., 23847=To adjust elongation or strength at break of the cured material of the composition comprising the above two polymers, it is possible to add a silicon-containing compound having a hydrolyzable group bonded to the silicon atom (cf. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 187,140 filed Apr. 28, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,255). The silicon-containing compound also serves for improving storage stability of the composition and prevents gelation or viscosity increase of the composition. However, the silicon-containing compound which can sufficiently improve the storage stability of the composition decreases the elongation of the cured material of the composition. Accordingly, when the decrease of elongation of the cured material is undesirable, it is difficult to provide a composition having good storage stability., 42644=Typical examples of the oxyalkylene base polymer having a silicon-containing reactive group (hereinafter referred to as \"polymer (B)\") are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,971,751, 3,979,384 and 4,323,488 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 36319/1970, 12154/1971 and 32673/1974, and Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 156599/1975, 73561/1976, 6096/1979, 82123/1980, 123620/1980, 125121/1980, 131022/1980, 135135/1980 and 137129/1980., 23460=To improve the defects of the alkyl (meth)acrylate base polymer having the silicon-containing reactive group or those of the oxyalkylene base polymer having the silicon-containing reactive group, a composition comprising these two polymers is proposed (cf. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,593,068 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 246,102, filed Sep. 19, 1988 and now abandoned).}",

The canvas sheet having the coated adhesive composition as used in the T-form peel test as described above is laminated on the aluminum plate with the surfaces having the adhesive layer facing each other and pressed with the hand roller in the same manner as above. A surface of an aluminum plate (A-1050P aluminum plate defined by JIS H 4000) of 100 mm\ufffd25 mm\ufffd2 mm is gently wiped with acetone.
