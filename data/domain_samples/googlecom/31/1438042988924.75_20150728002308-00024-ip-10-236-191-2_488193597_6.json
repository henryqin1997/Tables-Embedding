    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will thus be understood from the foregoing description that according to this invention, a high-quality compressed image can be displayed in frozen state with high vertical resolution. Also, a pseudo compressed image sequence can be displayed without using a multiplicity of small-capacity image memories. As described above, according to this embodiment, a pseudo image sequence display of 16 mutually asynchronous video signals is accomplished without using a multiplicity of small-capacity image memory units. Also, a high temporal resolution is achieved as compared with the configuration in which 16 video signals are switched and written in the image memory unit of one system. Furthermore, a field of video signal is skipped by one half in vertical direction of the image and decomposed into two fields for freeze display. The vertical resolution, therefore, is higher than in a simple field freeze operation in which lines are skipped to one fourth in vertical direction. In the case where the switching output is unstable during the period before and after the switching of the video signal or in the case where a noise is generated in the sync signal 11Y output from the sync separator circuit 11, the circuit of FIG. 16 is altered in such a manner that the pulse width of the write suspension signal 77F is lengthened or the period of the control pulse signals 76A to 76D of the image select signal generating circuit 76",
