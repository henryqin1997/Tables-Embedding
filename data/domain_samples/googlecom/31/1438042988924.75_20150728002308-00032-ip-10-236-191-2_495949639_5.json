    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A light-fired thyristor has been provided having improved di/dt performance. The method of firing by the illumination of widely separated light-receiving areas increases the initial turned-on area of the thyristor. Additional alternative thyristor constructions would occur to those skilled in the art. Alternative methods of forming the thyristors could be employed. For example, the thyristor could be of a reverse configuration with a P-type emitter and an N-type base. Thyristor devices having more than four alternative zones could also employ the multigate feature of the invention. Alternate thyristor configurations are possible within the scope of the invention. For example, additional amplifying stages can be provided in the first embodiment. The amplifying stage of the first embodiment could include a large central emitter area encompassing all the light-receiving regions. Several large emitters could each encompass a plurality of light-receiving regions. The openings in the light-responsive emitters of the first embodiment could be eliminated, and the light permitted to penetrate to the base as in the alternative embodiment. It is preferred that each light-receiving region be encompassed or surrounded by an emitter to allow for a radially outward spread of the turn-on area, although alternative non-encompassing configurations are possible. Furthermore, there is no limitation on the number of light-receiving regions other than the practical limit on the number of light fibers which can be conveniently handled. In both embodiments of the invention, thyristor turn-on occurs at a plurality",
