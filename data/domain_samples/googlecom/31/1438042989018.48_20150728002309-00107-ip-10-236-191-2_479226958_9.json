    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29524=(1) The processor 103 may measure a Lyapunov exponent of the PPP. The Lyapunov exponent of the PPP is a measure of the degree to which nearby paths of the PPP diverge. The Lyapunov exponent is well-known in chaos theory and may be measured with available software. See, e.g., Wolf et al., \"Determining Lyapunov exponents from a time series\", Physica D 1985;16:285-317., 49284=In an experiment, EKGs of quinidine intoxicated dogs were analyzed by frequency spectra, phase plane plots, Poincare sections, return maps and Lyapunov exponents. In the control state and at therapeutic doses, PPPs were uniformly thick and showed no gaps, indicating that cycle-to-cycle variation was due to normal biological \"noise\". But as the quinidine dose was increased to intermediate levels (40-50 mg/kg), PPPs showed clear non-uniform thickening, indicating sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and also showed marked banding (densely filled regions separated by divisions or gaps). At these intermediate doses, Lyapunov exponents became positive and Poincare return maps also indicated nonrandom chaos. At still higher doses, PPPs became more complex. In two dogs that did exhibit VF (and not in another) there was a significant change in the PPP at the last pre-fibrillatory dose: the development of a \"funnel\", a classic mechanism of chaos. Frequency spectra at all pre-fibrillatory doses were discrete, with peaks at a fundamental frequency and multiple harmonics. It was concluded that chaos does occur during progressive quinidine intoxication, and that PPPs, and graphic and numeric analysis based on the PPPs, are better indicators of chaos than frequency spectra., 50681=In an experiment, quinidine toxicity in dogs was analyzed using PPPs generated from APA and APD data. EKG recordings were made at various driving rates from 1000 to 500 msec. Increase in the driving rate from 1000 to 500 msec caused the progressive appearance of higher order periodicities (period 3 and 4). Phase locking was seen with a stimulus (S) response (R) pattern repeating periodically in all 4 preparations at S:R ratios of 2:1, 5:3, 3:2. At faster drive rates aperiodic variations in APA and APD were observed. A number of intermediate stages that presage chaos were also seen in the quinidine intoxicated fibers. These results further demonstrate the usefulness of the methods of the present invention to detect both quinidine intoxication and precursor stages to intoxication., 51561=In an experiment, quinidine toxicity in dogs was analyzed using PPPs generated from APA and APD data. Electrical stimuli were used to drive cardiac tissue at various rates from 2000 to under 300 msec. These stimuli caused steady alternants (bifurcation) in APD and APA of 108\ufffd36 msec and 12\ufffd9 millivolts respectively. Further increase in driving rates gave rise to irregular dynamics. This transition was preceded by various repeating stimulus-response ratios (phase-locking) for up to fifty consecutive beats. No such dynamics could be induced in three non treated (control) tissues. The APD restitution curve had significantly (p<0.05) steeper slope than six control fibers. Stimulus-response latency remained constant at 6-9 msec. PPPs of the APDs during the irregular dynamics showed sensitive dependence on initial conditions and forbidden zones consistent with chaos theory. These results further demonstrate the usefulness of the methods of the present invention to detect both quinidine intoxication and precursor stages to intoxication., 53801=One conclusion which may be drawn from the research cited herein is that the analytical value of each of the aspects of the invention may be enhanced through combination with one or more of the other aspects of the invention. A preferred embodiment of the present invention may include a combination of the aspects of the invention described herein. One preferred embodiment may comprise multiphasic analysis of a PPP (e.g., visually with a display, graphically with Poincare sections, and numerically with Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimension), frequency spectral analysis, and mathematical analysis of an APD restitution curve., 52701=An experiment used spectral analysis, PPPs, Poincare sections, Lyapunov Exponents and dimension analysis to analyze computer simulated waveforms including sine waves, modulated sine waves, square waves, saw toothed waves, and triangular waves. The researchers added random noise to the waveforms at 1%, 10% and 20%. The experiment further used the same analytical techniques on EKG data from anesthetized dogs in which VF was precipitated by five different interventions: quinidine intoxication; premature electrical stimulation followed by quinidine intoxication; coronary occlusion; reperfusion of acutely ischemic myocardium; and global hypothermia. The preliminary results showed that PPPs and Poincare sections in dogs undergoing ventricular fibrillation were consistent with chaos, while spectral analysis was not suggestive of chaos. The researchers concluded in part that VF can be described as chaotic electrophysiological behavior, but that single methods of analysis are not sufficient to detect such behavior., 14920=This is a Division application of Ser. No. 08/191,099 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,555,889 filed Feb. 4, 1994 which in turn is a continuation of application Ser. Nos. 07/701,753 filed on May 17, 1991 and 07/716,665, filed Jun. 4, 1991, respectively a continuation-in-part and a divisional of Ser. No. 07/541,881 filed on Jun. 20, 1990) abandoned. This application declares its priority from these applications which are also incorporated by reference. This application combines the disclosures of these applications., 31240=The fractal dimension may also be measured with correlation dimension techniques such as shown in FIG. 10 and appendix pp. 29-30. In this process after the EKG is sensed 1001 and the phase-plane plot constructed 1002 the processor of FIG. 1 applies a modified Grossberger-Procaccia algorithm 1003. The correlation dimension is then evaluated for convergence 1004. In the event of convergence the propensity for ventricular fibrillation is registered 1005., 19228=In a preferred embodiment, the PPP's degree of deterministic chaos may be measured by a processor, such as by graphic and numeric analysis. (1) The processor may measure a Lyapunov exponent or a fractal dimension of the PPP. (2) The processor may determine a Poincare section of the PPP and examine that Poincare section for indicators of deterministic chaos. Also, the processed PPP and Poincare sections may be reviewed by a human operator. The processed PPP and Poincare sections may indicate the propensity for fibrillation.}",
