Each I/O processor is associated with a queue, and each main processing unit is associated with a queue shared with the I/O processors. Each I/O processor may continue processing queued I/O requests after completing processing an earlier request. A threshold value indicates the minimum number of completed I/O requests required before an interrupt request is generated to the main processing unit.
