A water supply path, through which water recovered from combustion exhaust gas having passed through the regenerator is supplied to at least the humidifier of the group of the spraying apparatus and the humidifier, may be provided together with or in place of the above water supplying apparatus 15. With this configuration, it is possible to realize a high moisture gas turbine installation capable of enhancing combustion stability while ensuring desired output power and power generating efficiency. Such a gas turbine installation exhibits the same effect as that obtained in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1. If necessary, an after-cooler 13 is provided for cooling the compressed air to be supplied to the humidifier 7 by using water to be supplied to the humidifier 7 as a cold heat source. Further, a supplied water heater 6 is provided for heating water to be supplied to the humidifier 7 by using exhaust gas having passed through the regenerator 5 as a heat source. A water supply apparatus 15 is also provided for supplying water to the spraying apparatus 11 and the humidifier 7. An efficiency increasing apparatus including a spraying apparatus 11, a humidifier (moisture adding apparatus) 7, and a regenerator 5 is provided in the above existing gas turbine power generating installation.
