This relates to the tristimulus theory of color perception, that states that the human retina has 3 kinds of cones with peak sensitivities to 580 nm (\u201cred\u201d), 545 nm (\u201cgreen\u201d) and 440 nm (\u201cblue\u201d).>>[5] However, <<The XYZ and RGB systems are far from exhibiting perceptual uniformity . . . So, in 1976 the CIE standardized L*u*v* system, sometimes referenced as CIE LUV.>>[5] Prior to continuance of the description, it is necessary to explain the term perceptual uniformity. <<A system is perceptually uniform if a small perturbation to a component value is approximately equally perceptible across the range of that value. The volume control on a radio is designed to be perceptually uniform: rotating the knob ten degrees produces approximately the same perceptual increment in volume anywhere across the range of the control.>>[5] CIE LUV color space has the following properties: it is device-independent; there is a simple formula to get perceptual difference between its values; it is perceptually uniform; brightness and chomaticity (colorfulness) are separated into different coordinates. Due to such benefits, CIE LUV is state of the art, the best modem science can offer for computerized color analysis.}",

However, certain changes may be made, where mentioned in the description, without departing from scope of the invention. Accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. The server permanently scans the Internet indexing images, maintains and updates index database. The server conducts search through its database and returns results in a form of URLs list addressing where relevant images reside. Thumbnails of said images can also be presented to the user to help him verify accuracy of the results immediately; Created compact index is being transferred to the search server via the Internet; Searchable index is to be calculated on local computer, as computational demand of the method is within capabilities of modern PCs; User working with Internet browser selects an image or a part of image as subject of search; One of the applications\u2014the Internet search will be described. Nowadays, the Internet search servers gained significant importance and popularity. Giants of Internet industry such as Yahoo, Lycos, Infoseek, and many minors, do business by searching and compiling textual information in the Internet. However, the research [3]. shows that images now constitute 78.7 % of the Internet traffic. Users demand as simple and powerful search tools for images as they already have for textual information. They want to form a query in QBPE format or,",
