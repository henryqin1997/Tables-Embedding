Examples of digital meters may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,884,021, issued Nov. 28, 1989, to Hammond, et al., entitled \u201cDigital Power Metering\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,735, issued Jun. 16, 1992, to Porter, et al., also entitled \u201cDigital Power Metering,\u201d commonly assigned with the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Digital meters can measure these characteristics instantaneously or over a period of time, allowing electricity providers to track peak electricity usage and to better plan generator capacity. Electricity providers may then allow consumers to reduce costs by avoiding peak usage periods. Overall, digital meters have brought about more accurate measurement and billing and, in some cases, have resulted in more cost-effective use on the consumer's part., 23538=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/769,838 filed on Jan. 25, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,713 entitled \u201cAntenna For Electric Meter And Method of Manufacture Thereof\u201d to Lawrence R. Porter, et al., incorporated herein by reference, which was a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/040,113, filed on Mar. 17, 1998, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,181,294 B1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art should understand that they can make various changes, substitutions and alterations herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form. , illustrated is a planar view of a wireless metering communications device 300 that permits information to be communicated between an electric meter 310 and a communications circuit 320 (not shown) housed within a communications chassis 330. Coupled to the communications circuit 320 is a data port 340. The illustrated communications device 300 shows a communications cable 350 coupling the data port 340 on the communications circuit 320 with the electric meter 310. When thus coupled, communication between the meter 310 and the communications circuit 320 is possible. The meter 310 is able to transmit data, such as power usage, through the cable 350 to the communications circuit 320. The communications device 300 can then wirelessly transmit such data to a remote location, such as a data network of a power utility. In turn, a power utility can use the communications device 300 to transmit data to the meter 310. In one embodiment of the invention, the data port 340 provides a serial interface connection while in another a parallel interface connection is provided. Those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art will understand that any type of connection between the meter 310 and the",
