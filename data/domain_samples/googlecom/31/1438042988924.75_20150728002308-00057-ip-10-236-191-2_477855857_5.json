A preferred group of these optically active homopolyesters are those of inherent viscosity greater than 0.7. These extremely high molecular weight, synthetic, optically active alpha-bydroxypropionic acid homopolyesters are easily prepared in film and fiber form by normally used film casting and wet and dry spinning ice techniques. They are outstandingly more hydrolytically stable and, when drawn, much more crystalline and more highly oriented and/or stiffer, higher softening, and stronger than other alpha-hydroxy acid polyesters and copolyesters, even including the previously outstanding synthetic, optically inactive, polymeric alpha-hydroxypropicnic acid, i. e., polylactide., 21528=Example IV A mixture of 3 parts of L-lactide (M. P. 9395 C. and exhibiting an optical rotation of 303) and 0.01 part of litharge (0.3%) was heated in the manner described previously at 160 C. for 15 hours in a sealed, evacuated reactor. There was thus obtained a clear, colorless sample of poly-L-lactide, exhibiting an inherent viscosity of 0.76 and a tack point of C. This poly- L-lactide was used in the preparation of clear, self-supporting, orientable films by melt-pressing C./ 1000 lbs/sq. in.) and solvent-casting techniques. It is to be noted that poly-DL-lactide of essentially an equivalent inherent viscosity exhibits a tack point of approximately 100 C. This example illustrates the fact that even in the lower molecular weight ranges obtained by shorter heating cycles at lower temperatures, the optically active alpha-hydroxypropionic acid polymers of this invention are appreciably more outstanding in physical properties than the corresponding optically inactive ones., 15421=Example IPai't A The theoretical amount of water corresponding to concentration and dehydration was removed from 208 parts or\" a 45% aqueous solution of L-lactic acid by distillation over a period of two hours at 80 C. under a pressure corresponding to 25 mm. of Hg. The remaining concentrate was heated to 230-235 C. (pot temperature) at atmospheric pressure. Vvhen this temperature was reached, the pressure or\" the system was reduced to 26 mm. of Hg. Under this pressure as heating was continued, several parts of a liquid syrup distilled at 110-120 C. This product is believed to be the open chain L- lactyl-L-lactate and exhibits a very low optical rotation. As the distillation was continued, another (solid) fraction was obtained at 136-137 C. which upon condensing solidified. This solid material (25 parts32% ot' theory) was recrystallized twice from a /10 ether/ethyl acetate mixture. There was thus obtained pure L-lactide as sharp, colorless needles melting at 95-96 C. in contrast to the more cubical mesolactide melting at 125- 126 C. (See the copending application of Schneider, Ser. No. 230,079, filed June 5, 1951.) This particular sample of L-lactide exhibited an optical rotation of 280., 9229=corporation of Delaware No Drawing. Application June 5', 1952, Serial No. 291,967 3 Claims. (Cl. 2607.3, 10693=Recently, as described in the copending applications of Higgins, Ser. No. 190,877, filed October 18, 1950, and Ser. No. 192,137, filed October 25, 1950, there have been discovered high molecular weight, orientable, filmand fiber-forming polyesters of hydroxyaeetic acid and co polyesters thereof with other monohydroxymonocarboxylic acids and processes for obtaining such polyesters. More recently there has been discovered, as described in the copending application of Schneider, Ser. No. 230,079, filed June 5, 1951, a new class of high molecular Weight orientable filrnand fiber-forming polyesters of alphahydroxypropionic acid. However, even these improved alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids are not as hydrolytically insensitive as is desired and for many applications their stiffness and degree of crystallinity is not as great as is desired., 17836=Example IPart B A mixture of 3 parts of the L-lactide described in Example I, Part A, and about 0.01 part of litharge (0.3% based on the lactide) was placed in a polymerization reactor and the reactor then evacuated and sealed. The reactor and its contents were heated at 140-150 C. for 42 hours and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The poly-L-lactide thus obtained was a clear resin, exhibiting a tack point of 165-170 C. from which clear, strong, orientable (200% at 55 C.) films can be obtained by solvent-casting (e. g., acetone, benzene) or melt-pressing (190 C./ 1000 lbs./sq. in.) techniques. This example illustrates the preparation of clear, strong, optically active polymer in the lower temperature ranges. However, optically active polymers prepared in the higher temperature range such as illustrated in Example II are clearer and more soluble., 38684=Watson, Lactic Acid Polymers, Ind. Eng.
