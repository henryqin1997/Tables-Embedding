Again in this case, a noise preventing effect can be obtained for the same reason as that set forth with respect to the embodiment shown in FIG. 11. In the aforedescribed embodiments of the present invention, the deep grooves 1B, 1B1, the cut-aways 4B, 4A, the teeth 1D, 1D1, the holes 1J, 1J1 and the projections 1K, 1K1 are provided over the full periphery of the resilient member 1, the vibration insulating member 4 or the like, whereas these noise preventing or noise suppressing means need not always be provided over the full periphery of the resilient member 1, the vibration insulating member 4 or the like, but where the vibration wave which produces noise is only one mode, e.g. 3rd-order mode vibration wave, two of the aforedescribed noise preventing or suppressing means may be provided at locations spaced apart by 60\ufffd from each other as shown in FIG. 11, and where as in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the vibration waves which produce noise are vibration waves of two or more modes, e.g., 3rd-order mode and 5th-order mode, only three of the aforedescribed noise preventing or suppressing means may be provided, that is, for example, in the embodiment of FIG. 15, only the three deep grooves 1BA, 1BB and 1BC clearly shown in FIG. 15 will do, and in the case of vibration waves of three modes, i.e., 3rd-order, 5th-order and 7th-order modes, only four of the aforedescribed noise preventing or suppressing means will do. By adopting such simple structure, the members constituting the vibration wave motor can be manufactured inexpensively, and this in turn leads to the advantage that the vibration wave device can be manufactured inexpensively., 41203=This application is a continuation of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above embodiments have been shown as circular ring-like vibration wave motors, whereas the present invention can be applied not only to such vibration wave motors, but also to a vibration wave motor in which the resilient member is of a disk-like shape or an elliptical shape, as well as to a vibration wave motor of the type in which the resilient member 1 itself is moved by a travelling vibration wave. FIG. 45 shows another embodiment of the resilient member 1 shown in FIG. 44. This embodiment is one in which some of the teeth 1C shown in the embodiment of FIG. 44, i.e., some of the teeth 1C provided at locations corresponding to ##EQU13## of the wavelength \u03bb of the 3rd-order mode vibration wave which may produce noise, are planed to form teeth 1D of smaller height, thereby making the dynamic rigidity of the resilient member 1 partly non-uniform. A measure similar to the measure taken for the insulating member 4 shown in FIG. 44 may be taken for the output transmitting member 25 shown in FIG. 2. Saying in addition, the non-uniform portions as previously described may be provided at predetermined locations on a constituent of the vibration wave motor or a constituent of a device connected to the motor, i.e., locations corresponding to ##EQU12## of the wavelengths \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bbn of vibration waves which may produce noise, whereby noise can be",
