    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30592=It has been found through an extensive series of empirical tests that a preferred tone mapping exists for reproduced images that provides the viewer with the perception that the reproduced image is a faithful reproduction of the original scene wherein this tone mapping matches neither the theoretical 1:1 relationship described by Hunt in the aforementioned publication nor the actual tone mapping relationship that is achieved with conventional image reproduction systems. Data developed in these tests have led to the conclusion that the best images are produced for most of a variety of scene types when the perceived densities of the reproduced image are related to the viewed densities of the original scene by an approximately linear function of instantaneous gamma over a large part of the scene density range. A comparison of representative conventional tone mappings with one example of a preferred tone mapping according to the invention is illustrated in FIG. 3 which shows a series of D-logE curves 10d-13d and corresponding instantaneous gamma curves 10g-13g for a variety of different film/paper hardcopy image reproduction systems. Curve pairs 10d,10g-12d,12 g were generated from conventionally available negative film/print paper photographic systems while curve pair 13d,13g, which illustrates the preferred tone mapping, was generated using conventional negative film optoelectronically scanned to develop pixel signals which were then image-processed and printed on color print paper. The general techniques of optoelectronic image scanning, digital signal processing and digital color printing are well known and do not, of themselves require detailed discussion herein. However, the particular image transformation function employed in the digital image processing was adapted in accordance with a feature of the invention to introduce a transformation that resulted in the perceived tone mapping characteristic shown by curves 13d,13g in FIG. 3. It will be appreciated that each of the curve pairs 10d,10g through 13d,13g represent different system-dependent reproduction characteristics in which the resultant output tone mapping relative to scene input information is dependent on the functional characteristics of the materials employed in the scene reproduction process. It will also be noted that for the three systems represented by curve pairs 10d,10g through 12d,12g, the instantaneous gamma curves 10g-12g are substantially bell-shaped in the mid-tone rage with significant variation between the maximum and minimum values of the curves within the mid-tone range. The mid-tone range, for this purpose can be seen to extend from about 0.6 to about 1.45 relative to a zero density, 100% diffuse reflector in the original scene. This reference reflector is represented in the graph of FIG. 3 by point 18 at the intersection of zero exposure density and 1.0 image reproduction density gradient and is commonly referred to in the art as a reference of 100% white in the scene. By comparison with the conventional systems, however, the instantaneous gamma curve 13g for the system of the invention is more flat, without the bell-shaped characteristic, approaching that having a nearly horizontal, linear segment in this same mid-tone range of scene exposure densities of from about 0.6 to about 1.45 relative to 100% white in the scene. While a single system according to the invention, as represented by curves 13d,13g, is illustrated in FIG. 3, it has been found through the aforesaid empirical tests that perceived natural image reproduction is achieved by systems that exhibit values of instantaneous gamma falling within a range of output densities, albeit fairly limited in extent, as is graphically indicated in FIG. 3 by trapezoidal outline 15. This graphically illustrated range of instantaneous gamma values can be described in quantitative terms as being a range of values of viewed reproduction density gradient relative to density of the original scene which are greater than 1.0 and less than 1.0 plus 0.35 times scene exposure density over a scene exposure density range of from about 0.60 to about 1.45 as measured relative to a zero density, 100% diffuse reflector in the original scene. In FIG. 4, a number of instantaneous gamma functions according to the invention are shown which fall within this described range and which have been found to give preferred perceived image reproduction for a wide variety of scene types., 20041=This is a divisional of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to a presently preferred embodiment, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. To test the tone reproduction of video images or projected images viewed in darkened environments, the targets are captured and measured as described above. The images are then reproduced as the intended video or projected images and then measured with a radiometer as described above except using the viewing environment typical for image viewing for the system being tested with no additional lighting. Correction are then applied for the display hardware field non-uniformity using the photographed (captured) gray target. Plotting and analysis of the resulting D-LogE and instantaneous gamma functions then proceeds as described above except comparison to the parameter of the invention are made using the equivalent adjusted boundary conditions and 100% scene white point as described earlier. The reproduced prints are uniformly illuminated with lighting system 103 at a 45\ufffd angle of incidence and the visual step densities are measured with the very low flare radiometer 116. It will be appreciated that the targets and reproductions preferably are illuminated and measured under identical conditions. After correcting the measured step densities on the target 102 for any target illumination non-uniformity using the target 100 densities in the same location as the target 102 steps and",
