In the pointing device of FIG. 16 it is advantageous to have in connection with the positions O, P, Q, R, S and T of the pointing elements 42; 42 a, 42 b, 42 c a magnetic element 51; 51 a, 51 b, 51 c, 51 d, 51 e, 51 f such as a permanent or electromagnet in the mounting recess 45, installed in the same manner as in the embodiments of FIGS. 12A (or 12B) and 14B. An advantage of the magnetic elements 51; 51 a, 51 b, 51 c. 51 d, 51 e, 51 f is that they keep the pointing elements in the selected positions O, P, Q, R, S and T. The magnetic elements 51 are attached to the mounting recess 45 in the housing 46 or corresponding body. A twelfth pointing device according to the invention is shown in FIG. 16. This pointing device comprises a plurality of pointing elements 42; 42 a, 42 b, 42 c and detectors 43; 43 a, 43 b, 43 c, 43 d, 43 e and 43 f. The pointing elements 42 are fitted to a spindle 44 an the rotation axis N\u2014N in such a manner that the pointing elements on the spindle 44 are separately movable in",
