If desired, the sterile enclosure may include a laminar flow source as described in the above-mentioned co-pending patent application. Preferably, the transport system through the module is substantially linear, and includes a guide 2010 defining an axially elongated aperture 2014 extending therethrough. As shown in FIGS. 39 and 40, the axially extending aperture 2014 is dimensioned to slidable receive therein the mid-portions of the diabolo-shaped vials, to support on the upper opposing surfaces of the guide 2010 the relatively larger diameter upper portion of each vial, and if desired, to support against the opposing lower surfaces of the guide the relatively larger diameter base portion of each vial. In one embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 43, the transport system comprises a screw-type drive including a lead screw 2015 defining a helical groove 2017 forming the recesses for receiving the vials 610. A motor 2019 is drivingly connected to one end of the lead screw and rotatably drives the screw as indicated by the arrow \u201cb\u201d to, in turn, axially drive the vials 610 through the manifold 2000. The motor 2019 is electrically connected to a control unit (not shown) to precisely control the starting, stopping and speed of the screw, and to coordinate same with the actuation of the needle manifold and laser sources. As may be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art based on the teachings herein, the transport system may include any of numerous different structures for driving the vials through the manifold, including, for example, other types of conveyors, that are currently, or later become known, for performing this function.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{49999=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/515,162, filed Sep. 1, 2006, entitled \u201cSealed Containers and Methods of Making and Filling Same\u201d, which is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 6,684,916, entitled \u201cMedicament Vial Having A Heat-Sealable Cap, And Apparatus and Method For Filling The Vial\u201d, which is a divisional of similarly titled U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/781,846, filed Feb. 12, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,561, issued Aug. 12, 2003, which, in turn, claims the benefit of similarly titled U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/182,139, filed on Feb. 11, 2000, and further, this application claims priority on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/408,068, filed Sep. 3, 2002, entitled \u201cSealed Containers And Methods Of Making And Filling Same\u201d, each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference as part of the present disclosure., 96196=The resealable portion 126 is preferably made of a resilient polymeric material, such as a blend of a first polymeric material sold under the registered trademark KRATON\ufffd or DYNAFLEX\ufffd and a second material in the form of a low-density polyethylene, such as the polyethylene sold by Dow Chemical Co. under the trademarks ENGAGE\u2122 or EXACT\u2122. In some embodiments, the first and second materials are blended within a range of about 50:50 by weight to about 90:10 by weight (i.e., first material: second material). In one embodiment, the blend of the first and second materials is about 50:50 by weight. The benefits of the preferred blend over the first material by itself are improved water or vapor barrier properties, and thus improved product shelf life; improved heat sealability; a reduced coefficient of friction; improved moldability or mold flow rates; and a reduction in hysteresis losses. As may be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art, these numbers and materials are only exemplary, however, and may be changed if desired or otherwise required., 187260=As described above, each laser source transmits a predetermined wavelength of laser radiation at about 980 nm, and the predetermined power of each laser is preferably less than about 30 Watts, and preferably less than or equal to about 10 Watts, or within the range of about 8 to about 10 Watts. In the illustrated embodiment, each laser source is a semi-conductor diode laser that outputs at about 15 Watts, and is fiber-optically coupled through a fiber-optic cable to respective collimating lens mounted over the vials within the interior of the filling unit. The laser and IR sensor manifold 1054 includes a tinted enclosure 1072 including a plurality of tinted glass or translucent or transparent plastic panels that surround the lasers on four sides to filter out potentially harmful radiation generated by the laser beams. Capacitor sensors (not shown) also may be provided along the periphery of the star wheel 1010, downstream of the needle fill manifold 1016 in order to sense whether each vial received the medicament or other substance to be contained therein and to reject the vial if defective., 213521=As can be seen, the locking ring 2250 defines a peripheral flange forming the neck 2216 and further defines on its interior edge an annular recess 2268 for receiving therein an annular protuberance 2266 formed on the tamper-resistant cover 2250. The interior edge of the annular flange 2216 leading into the recess 2268 may define a chamfered surface, and the leading edge of the annular protuberance 2266 of the cover also may be chamfered to allow the protuberance to be snapped into, or otherwise fixedly received within the recess, but to prevent removal of the cover therefrom. Similarly, the locking ring 2250 defines on its inner diameter an annular protuberance 2221 that is snapped into, or otherwise fixedly received within a corresponding annular recess 2223 formed on the exterior of the vial body 2210 to fixedly secure the locking ring 2250 to the vial body. In this embodiment, the base 2214 of the vial body 2210 is formed integral with the remainder of the vial body in order to reduce the number of parts; however, if desired, the base 2214 can be made as a separate part that is snap-fit or otherwise attached to the vial body., 205775=Also during the dwell, and following withdrawal of the needles from the resealable stoppers, the laser optic assemblies 2056-2063 deliver laser energy to the resealable stoppers on the vials to reseal the stoppers. As the resealable stoppers are heated by the laser energy, the IR sensors 2064-2071 detect the temperature of each stopper, so as to be able to determine whether each stopper was heated sufficient to cause resealing. After the dwell, the process is repeated, i.e., the lead screw indexes another five positions and then dwells again so that the next five vials can be filled and resealed., 128610=Alternatively, the thermoplastic material of the resealable stoppers may take the form of a styrene block copolymer sold by GLS Corporation of McHenry, Ill. under the designation LC 254-071. This type of styrene block copolymer compound exhibits approximately the following physical properties: (i) Shore A Hardness: about 28-29; (ii) Specific Gravity: about 0.89 g/cm3; (iii) Color: approximately grey to dark grey; (iv) 300% Modulus, flow direction: about 181-211 psi; (v) Tensile Strength at Break, flow direction: about 429-498 psi; (vi) Elongation at Break, flow direction: about 675%-708%; and (vii) Tear Strength, flow direction: about 78-81 lbf/in. In one embodiment, the predetermined color and opacity of the thermoplastic is defined by a grey colorant that is provided in an approximately 3% color concentrate (i.e., there is an approximately 33:1 ratio of the concentrate to the natural resin or TPE). The color concentrate contains about 88.83% carrier or base resin, and the remainder is pigment. In one embodiment, the pigment is grey carbon black. Thus, the pigment is about 0.34% by weight of the resulting thermoplastic., 135817=Heat-resealable portion 370 is also inserted into the mouth 320 of storage vial 310 and preferably completely overlies stopper member 330. As described above with respect to the other embodiments of the resealable stopper, heat-resealable portion 370 is preferably made of a resilient polymeric material, such as a blend of a first polymeric material sold by Shell Oil Co. under the registered trademark KRATON\ufffd or DYNAFLEX\ufffd, and a second material in the form of a low-density polyethylene, such as the polyethylene sold by Dow Chemical Co. under the trademarks ENGAGE\u2122 or EXACT\u2122. In one embodiment, the first and second materials are blended within a range of about 50:50 by weight to about 90:10 by weight (i.e., first material: second material). In another embodiment, the blend of the first and second materials is about 50:50 by weight. The benefits of the preferred blend over the first material by itself are improved water or vapor barrier properties, and thus improved product shelf life; improved heat sealability; a reduced coefficient of friction; improved moldability or mold flow rates; and a reduction in hysteresis losses. As may be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art, these numbers and materials are only exemplary, however, and may be changed if desired or otherwise required in a particular system., 127620=In addition to the thermoplastic materials described above, the thermoplastic material may be a blend of a first material that is preferably a styrene block copolymer, such as the materials sold under either the trademarks KRATON or DYNAFLEX, such as DYNAFLEX G2706-10000-00, and a second material that is preferably an olefin, such as the materials sold under either the trademarks ENGAGE or EXACT, such as EXACT 8203. In some embodiments of the invention, the first and second materials are blended within the range of about 50:50 by weight to preferably about 90:10 by weight, and most preferably about 90:5 by weight (i.e., first material:second material). The benefits of the preferred blend over the first material by itself are improved water or vapor barrier properties, and thus improved product shelf life; improved heat sealability; a reduced coefficient of friction; improved moldability or mold flow rates; and a reduction in hysteresis losses., 219829=As may be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art based on the teachings herein, numerous changes and modifications may be made to the above-described and other embodiments of the present application without departing from the inventive aspects disclosed herein. For example, the resealable portion may be integrally molded with a base such as by insert molding, the resealable portion may be fused or otherwise melted to a base, or the resealable portion may be sequentially molded to a base. Alternatively, the resealable stopper may be formed of only one material, i.e., the resealable portion with the infusible base or other infusible layer, may be formed with multiple layers, wherein some or all of the layers are thermally resealable. Thus, the resealable stopper may be made of any of numerous different materials which are currently known, or later become known for performing the functions of the resealable portion or stopper described herein, such as any of numerous different thermoplastic and/or elastomeric materials. In addition, the vials may be made of any of numerous different materials that are currently or later become known for forming vials, such as medicament vials, including any of numerous different types of glass or plastic, or combinations of glass and plastic. For example, the vial body can be formed of glass, and the base, locking ring and/or tamper-resistant cover can be formed of plastic, and can be joined to the body or to each other in accordance with any of numerous different joining mechanisms that are currently, or later become known, such as by over-molding, mechanical snap-fit or other interlocking engagements, by adhesively joining glass to plastic, or by ultrasonically welding or otherwise welding plastic to plastic. In addition, the needles used to fill the vials may take the form of any of the needles disclosed in British patent application no. GB 0308705.2, filed Apr. 28, 2003, entitled \u201cNovel Device\u201d, the vial closure may take any of the forms of the closures disclosed in British patent application no. GB0304268.6, filed Feb. 26, 2003, entitled \u201cNovel Device\u201d, the conveyor system and/or the components thereof may take any of the forms as shown in British patent application no. GB0221510.1, filed Sep. 17, 2002, entitled \u201cNovel Device\u201d, and the needle filling and/or processing stations may take any of the forms shown in British patent application no. GB0221511.9, filed Sep. 17, 2002, entitled \u201cNovel Device\u201d, each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety as part of the present disclosure. Accordingly, this detailed description of the preferred embodiments is to be taken in an illustrative, as opposed to a limiting sense., 201930=As described above, each laser source transmits a predetermined wavelength of laser radiation at about 980 nm, and the predetermined power of each laser is preferably less than about 30 Watts, and preferably less than or equal to about 10 Watts, or within the range of about 8 to about 10 Watts. In the illustrated embodiment, each laser source is a semi-conductor diode laser that outputs at about 15 Watts, and is fiber-optically coupled through a fiber-optic cable to a collimating lens of the respective laser optic assembly. If desired, the module 2000 can be enclosed, or partially enclosed within a tinted enclosure (not shown) including a plurality of tinted glass or translucent or transparent plastic panels that surround the laser optic assemblies on four sides to filter out potentially harmful radiation generated by the laser beams. In addition, capacitor sensors (not shown) may be provided downstream of the module 2000 in order to sense whether each vial received the medicament or other substance to be contained therein and to reject the vial if defective., 190391=Also during the dwell, the four laser optic assemblies 1056-1062 deliver laser energy to the resealable stoppers on the four vials beneath the laser and IR manifold to reseal the stoppers. As the resealable stoppers are heated by the laser energy, the four IR sensors 1064-1070 detect the temperature of each stopper, so as to be able to determine whether each stopper was heated sufficient to cause resealing. After the dwell, the process is repeated, i.e., the star wheels index another four positions and then dwell again so that the next four vials are filled and four more vials are resealed.}",
