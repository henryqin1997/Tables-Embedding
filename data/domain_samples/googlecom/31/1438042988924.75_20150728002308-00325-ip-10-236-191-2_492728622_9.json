No. 09/389,788, filed on Sep. 3, 1999; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/085,391, filed on May 27, 1998; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/047,739, filed May 27, 1997., 17820=This patent application is a divisional application of the co-pending U.S. pat. application Ser. No. 09/704,642, filed Nov. 1, 2000, and titled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPERCRITICAL PROCESSING OF MULTIPLE WORKPIECES,\u201d which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Pat. application Ser. No. 60/163,121, filed Nov. 2, 1999, and titled \u201cA HIGH THROUGHPUT CLUSTER TOOL FOR CLEANING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES USING SUPERCRITICAL CO2.\u201d The U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 09/704,642, filed Nov. 1, 2000, and titled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPERCRITICAL PROCESSING OF A WORKPIECE,\u201d is hereby incorporated by reference., 22103=Nishikawa et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,944,837, issued on Jul. 31, 1990, recite a prior art method of removing a resist using liquidized or supercritical gas. A substrate with the resist is placed into a pressure vessel, which also contains the liquidized or supercritical gas. After a predetermined time lapse, the liquidized or supercritical gas is rapidly expanded, which removes the resist., 24101=Smith, Jr. et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,705, issued on Jan. 3, 1995, teach a system for cleaning contaminants from a workpiece. The contaminants include organic, particulate, and ionic contaminants. The system includes a pressurizable cleaning vessel, a liquid CO2 storage container, a pump, a solvent delivery system, a separator, a condenser, and various valves. The pump transfers CO2 gas and solvent to the cleaning vessel and pressurizes the CO2 gas to supercritical CO2. The supercritical CO2 and the solvent remove the contaminants from the workpiece. A valve allows some of the supercritical CO2 and the solvent to bleed from the cleaning vessel while the pump replenishes the supercritical CO2 and the solvent. The separator separates the solvent from the supercritical CO2. The condenser condenses the CO2 to liquid CO2 so that the liquid CO2 storage container can be replenished.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that other various modifications may be made to the preferred embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. A second alternative supercritical processing module of the present invention places alternative inlets for the circulation line 152 to enter the wafer cavity 112 at a circumference of the wafer cavity 112 and places an alternative outlet at a top center of the wafer cavity 112. The alternative inlets are preferably configured to inject the supercritical carbon dioxide in a plane defined by the wafer cavity 112. Preferably, the alternative inlets are angled with respect to a radius of the wafer cavity 112 so that in operation the alternative inlets and the alternative outlet create a vortex within the wafer cavity 112. A first alternative supercritical processing module of the present invention replaces the pressure chamber 136 and gate valve 106 with an alternative pressure chamber. The alternative pressure chamber comprises a chamber housing and a hydraulicly driven wafer platen. The chamber housing comprises a cylindrical cavity which is open at its bottom. The hydraulicly driven wafer platen is configured to seal against the chamber housing outside of the cylindrical cavity. In operation, the wafer is placed on the hydraulicly driven wafer platen. Then, the hydraulicly driven wafer platen moves upward and seals with the chamber housing. Once",
