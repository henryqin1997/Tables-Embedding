    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37603=U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,464, patented Dec. 3, 1996, by Woll et al., an apparatus and method for recording operational events in an automotive radar system. The invention provided what was called an Event Recording Apparatus (ERA) that recorded selectable vehicle performance, operational status, and/or environment information, including information which would be useful for accident analysis and updated software for use by a system processor which was capable of reading data from the ERA. The ERA included a non-volatile solid-state memory card, a memory card adapter which was located in a vehicle, and a microprocessor, either as part of the memory card or embedded in a system within the vehicle, for controlling the storage of data within the memory card. The ERA was configured to store such vehicle information as the closing rate between the recording vehicle and targets located by the radar system of the vehicle, distance between the recording vehicle and targets, vehicle speed, and such vehicle operational status and environment information as braking pressure, vehicle acceleration or deceleration, rate of turning, steering angle, hazard levels determined from a radar system processor, target direction, cruise control status, vehicle engine RPM, brake temperature, brake line hydraulic pressure, windshield wiper status, fog light status, defroster status, and geographic positioning information., 39036=U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,705, patented Dec. 9, 1997, by Zykar, provided a system and method for data entry and retroactive reconstruction of the relative position of features and objects. In particular, this was provided with respect to transitory occurrences, utilizing a signal transmitting and receiving distance determining device. The system and method disclosed had especial applicability to the on-scene recordation and subsequent ex post facto reconstruction of traffic accident scenes by law enforcement officers. It was said to be readily implemented in conjunction with a commercially-available, laser-based speed and distance determining device otherwise usable for vehicle speed traffic monitoring functions, utilizing either triangulation or baseline/offset mensuration techniques., 39846=U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,451, patented Sep. 23, 1997, by Takahashi et al., provided a data recording unit for use with a camera for recording information data, obtained through a GPS receiver, on a photographing film. The data recording unit included a selector for selecting a geodetic system from plural geodetic systems. A data converter was provided for converting a position information data, obtained through the GPS receive, to converted position information data in the geodetic system which was selected by the selector. A printing LED was provided for recording the converted position information data on the photographic film together with images which were photographed by the camera., 36455=U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,141, patented Dec. 19, 1995, by Nather et al., provided a registration arrangement for motor vehicles with a measured value presentation, which was said to be suitable for evaluating accidents. A storage arrangement was provided in which speed measurements were simultaneously written into at least two parallel storage branches. A plurality of time-limited storage areas were defined in each storage branch. Each storage area had a storage portion which can be operated as a ring storage and a storage portion which was arranged subsequent to the latter, which can be operated as a linear storage. The speed values, which were written into the ring storage in a continuous manner during the course of normal driving, were permanently stored in one storage branch when one criterion occurred, and in the other storage branch when the criterion which was greater than a deceleration threshold value occurred. Subsequent speed values were written into the linear storage of the respective storage areas until the set time limit, after which a free storage area of the respective storage branch was switched to., 35681=U.S. Pat. No. 5,446,659, patented Aug. 29, 1997, by Yamawaki, provided a traffic accident data recorder and traffic accident reproduction system which included an acceleration sensor, an angular velocity sensor, if necessary, a memory, and a control section for controlling the recording in the memory. When the output datum from the acceleration sensor or the angular velocity sensor exceeded a predetermined value, the control section recognized that time as a traffic accident occurrence time, and stored the acceleration data and angular velocity data before and after in the memory. By analyzing the data with a traffic accident data reproduction system, it was possible to reproduce the state of the vehicle at the traffic accident occurrence time., 33866=U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,184, patented Jul. 25, 1995, by Pineroli et al., provided a device for detecting running variables e.g., the lighting up of a warning lamp, the positioning of a roll bar, the activation of a belt tightener and/or of an air bag, etc. in a motor vehicle. The device included at least two acceleration sensors to detect the longitudinal and transverse acceleration of the motor vehicle, and an evaluation circuit with a resettable time measuring unit which determined acceleration values from the sensor signals over a given period of time. A signal divider was connected to the signal output of each acceleration sensor to divide the sensor signal into a low-frequency (LF) signal component and a high frequency (HF) component. An adder was connected to the LF outputs of the signal dividers for the vectorial addition of the LF components of both sensor signals corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse acceleration components. A storage unit was connected to the adder and the time measuring unit to store the calculated acceleration values over the measured time. A control unit was connected to the HF outputs of the signal dividers to control the time measuring unit. There was no disclosure of any means for reconstructing an accident., 35153=U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,024, patented Aug. 29, 1995, by Riley, Jr. et al. disclosed an automotive motive recorder, which recorded and stored the information necessary for a determination of the pre-impact speeds and the impact speed of a motor vehicle which was involved in a collision. Following an accident, the unit may be removed and be connected to a personal computer as a reader. With entry of the proper access code, the data pointer outputted the stored information in the correct sequence for analysis., 40557=U.S. Pat. No. 5,680,117, patented Oct. 21, 1997, by Arac et al., provided a collision judging system for a vehicle. Such system included a sensor for detecting a relative speed between a subject vehicle and an object, and a judging section for judging a possibility of collision of the subject vehicle with an object based on the relative speed. In the collision judging system when an output from the differentiating device exceeded a preset value, a signal which was indicative of a command to prohibit the judgment of the possibility of collision in the judging section was outputted from the prohibiting-signal outputting device, thereby avoiding the unnecessary judgment of the possibility of collision in the judging section.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. Consequently, such changes and modifications are properly, equitably, and \u201cintended\u201d to be, within the full range of equivalence of the following claims. The AVB will be of an invaluable help for the determination of responsibilities of individuals in all kinds of events, to such an extent that its use should be encouraged and promoted by insurance companies and other public or private institutions responsible for the security of people and their property. Thus, if an automotive vehicle which is equipped with the AVB were involved in any accident or another event (for example, crimes committed in an area which is viewed by video cameras) the \u201ccompetent authority\u201d will be able to obtain a reading of the information registered in the non-volatile memory of the recorder device. This information will become an irrefutable proof of the events occurred, playing a similar role to that of the \u201cblack box\u201d with which all the commercial airplanes are quipped. The AVB of embodiments of the present invention thus provides a system and method of especial applicability to the on-scene recordation and subsequent ex post facto reconstruction of traffic accident scenes by law enforcement officers which is",
