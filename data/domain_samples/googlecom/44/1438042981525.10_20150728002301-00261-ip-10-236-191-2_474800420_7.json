Accordingly, the present invention is not limited by the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims. For example, while the embodiment described in detail above includes a button 132, embodiments of the present invention could just as easily employ a switch, knob, dial, or other such \u201cactuating\u201d subsystem. Accordingly, the term \u201cbutton\u201d as used herein should be understood to encompass all such means for switching between two, or more, states. Furthermore, while a PCTV system is discussed herein in detail, power management schemes according to the teachings of the present invention can be incorporated into any number of \u201cconverged\u201d functionality devices, such as PC/game systems, PC/telephone systems, or the like. Any and all of such systems should be understood to be covered by various of the appended claims. In fact, any combination of the priority, protection, switching, monitoring, control, empowering, altering, and other such aspects of the present invention can possibly be usefully incorporated into a system combining first and second functionalities to prioritize, protect, switch, monitor, control, empower, alter, or the like, all or part of the system; any such system is covered by the appended claims. Based upon the foregoing, it should now be fully understood and appreciated",
