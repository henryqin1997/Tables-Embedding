    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{12628=Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) offers several advantages over traditional delivery methods including injections and oral delivery. When compared to oral delivery, TDD avoids gastrointestinal drug metabolism, reduces first-pass effects, and provides sustained release of drugs for up to seven days, as reported by Elias, In Percutaneous Absorption: Mechanisms-Methodology-Drag Delivery., Bronaugh, R. L., Maibach, H. 1. (Ed), pp 1-12, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1989. The word \"transdermal\" is used herein as a generic term. However, in actuality, transport of drugs occurs only across the epidermis where the drug gets absorbed in the blood capillaries. When compared to injections, TDD eliminates the associated pain and the possibility of infection. Theoretically, the transdermal route of drug administration could be advantageous in the delivery of many therapeutic proteins, because proteins are susceptible to gastrointestinal degradation and exhibit poor gastrointestinal uptake, proteins such as interferons are cleared rapidly from the blood and need to be delivered at a sustained rate in order to maintain their blood concentration at a high value, and transdermal devices are easier to use than injections., 25660=A typical \u03b3-interferon dose given each time to patients suffering from cancer or viral infections is about 5\ufffd106 U [(i) Grups J. W., Frohmuller H. G., Br. J. Med., 1989, 64 (3): 218-220, (ii) Parkin J. M., Eales L., Galazka A., Pinching A., Br. Med. J., 1987, 294: 1185-1186.] Similar doses of \u03b1interferon and \u03b2-interferon have also been shown to enhance the immune response of patients suffering from viral infections and cancer (cited in `Clinical Applications of interferons and their inducers`, Ed. Stringfellow D., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1986). If this interferon dose was to be given by sonophoresis in 1 hour, the required transdermal flux would be 5\ufffd106 U/hour. Note that 1 unit of \u03b3-interferon corresponds approximately to 1 pg of \u03b3-interferon., 29660=Results: The results are shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B and demonstrate that substantially greater transfer of protein through the skin occurs in the presence of ultrasound. FIGS. 1A and 1B show the variation of transdermal insulin flux across the human skin in vitro. Ultrasound (20 KHz, 125 mW/cm2, 10%) was turned ON at time zero. The insulin flux increased from below the detection limit to a value of about 100 mU/cm2 /hr in about 1 hour and stayed almost constant around that value as long as ultrasound was ON. Upon turning ultrasound OFF, the insulin flux decreases and achieves a value below our detection limit within 2 hours after turning ultrasound OFF. The skin permeabilities to insulin at various ultrasound intensities were calculated from the amount of insulin transported during the first hour of ultrasound exposure and are shown in FIG. 1B. The sonophoretic permeability varies nearly exponentially with ultrasound intensity, probably due to a highly nonlinear dependence of cavitation on ultrasound intensity (Apfel, R. E., IEEE Trans. Ultrason. Ferroelectrics Freq. Control 1986, UFFC-33, 139)., 24515=Based on these calculations and the data in the following examples, one can calculate the required dosage and application regime for treatment of a patient, as follows. A typical diabetic patient (70 Kg weight) takes about 12 Units of insulin three times a day (total dose of about 36 Units per day: cited in `World Book of Diabetes in Practice` Krall, L. P. (Ed), Elsvier, 1988). If each insulin dose was to be delivered by sonophoresis in 1 hour, the required transdermal flux would be 12 U/hour. Note that 1 unit (1 U) of insulin corresponds approximately to 40 mg of insulin. The transdermal patch area used in these calculations is 40 cm2 (the area of a transdermal Fentanyl patch [ALZA Corporation]). The donor concentrations used in these calculations are 100 U/ml in the case of insulin (commercially available insulin solution [Humulin]), 3\ufffd107 in the case of \u03b3-interferon (typical concentration of interferon solution recommended by Genzyme Corporation), and 3\ufffd105 U/ml in the case of erythropoeitin [Davis J., Arakawa T., Strickland T., Yphantis D., Biochemistry, 2633-2638, 1987]., 15176=Ultrasound has been shown to enhance transdermal transport of low-molecular weight drugs (molecular weight less than 500) across human skin, a phenomenon referred to as sonophoresis (Levy, J. Clin Invest. 1989, 83, 2974-2078; Langer, R., In \"Topical Drug Bioavailability, Bioequivalence, and Penetration\"; pp. 91-103, Shah V. P., M. H. I., Eds. (Plenum: New York, 1993); Frideman, R. M., `Interferons: A Primer`, Academic Press, New York, 1981)). In a recent study of sonophoresis, it has been shown that application of ultrasound at therapeutic frequencies (1 MHz) induces growth and oscillations of air pockets present in the keratinocytes of the SC (a phenomenon known as cavitation). These oscillations disorganize the SC lipid bilayers thereby enhancing transdermal transport. However, application of therapeutic ultrasound does not induce transdermal transport of high-molecular weight proteins., 27503=Materials and methods: In vivo as well as in vitro experiments were performed to study the effect of low-frequency ultrasound on the transport of insulin across the skin. In vitro experiments were performed using human cadaver skin. The skin was heat stripped by keeping it in water at 60\ufffd C. for two minutes followed by the removal of the epidermis. It was then stored at 4\ufffd C. in a humidified chamber. A piece of epidermis was taken out from the chamber prior to the experiments and was mounted on the Franz diffusion cell (Crown Bioscientific Co.) which consists of two compartments, the donor and the receiver compartment. A Franz Diffusion Cell consists of two compartments, a donor and a receiver compartment. The human cadaver epidermis (separated from the dermis by heat-treatment) is mounted between the two compartments and is supported by a Nylon mesh (Tetko Inc.) to avoid any damage. The skin was supported by a nylon mesh (Tetko Inc.) in order to a mimic the fact the skin in vivo is supported by mechanically strong dermis. The compartments were then clamped together. The receiver compartment was filled with 2% BSA (Sigma Chemicals) solution in PBS (Sigma Chemicals) and the donor solution was filled with 100 U/ml solution of human recombinant insulin (Humulin Regular). The ultrasound intensity, I, (Spatial Average Temporal Peak) was calculated from the values of the acoustic pressure amplitude, P, measured using a hydrophone (Bruel and Kjaer) using the equation, I=P2 /2\u03c1c, where \u03c1 is the water density (1 gm/ml), and c is the velocity of ultrasound in water [1500 m/s]., 32610=Methods and materials: The passive skin permeability to high-molecular weight proteins, including those mentioned above, is essentially zero (below the detection limit). To assess whether application of ultrasound enhances transdermal protein flux, the skin permeability to these proteins in the presence of ultrasound in vitro across human cadaver epidermis in a Franz Diffusion Cell (Crown Glass Company) was measured. In separate experiments, the donor compartment of the diffusion cell was filled with a solution of insulin (100 U/ml, Humulin Regular, Eli Lilly), \u03b3-interferon (2500 U/ml, Genzyme Corp.), or erythropoeitin (400 U/ml, Amgen Corp.). Ultrasound (20 KHz, 100 msec pulses applied every second) was applied at intensities in the range of 12.5 mW/cm2 -225 mW/cm2 for 4 hours using an ultrasound transducer (VCX 400, Sonics and Materials) which was immersed in the donor solution. The transducer having an area of about 1 cm2 was oriented perpendicular to the skin and placed at a distance of 1 cm from the skin. The concentration of proteins in the receiver compartment was measured every hour either by RIA or ELISA. The insulin concentration in the receiver compartment was measured every hour by Radioimmuno Assay (performed at Linco Research Inc., St. Charles). The \u03b3-interferon concentration was measured using ELISA methods developed by Endogen Inc, and the erythropoeitin concentration was measured by ELISA (performed at ARUP, Salt Lake City). Skin permeabilities to proteins were calculated using the transdermal fluxes measured during the first hour. The transdermal flux can be calculated using the equation, J=DM/\u0394t, where \u0394M is the amount of protein transported per unit skin area during time \u0394t. The skin permeabilities, P, can be calculated from the transdermal flux, J, during the first hour of ultrasound application using the equation, P=J/\u0394C, where \u0394C is the concentration difference across the skin.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Modifications and variations of the method for transdermal drug delivery enhancement using sonophoresis described herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art and are intended to be encompassed by the following claims. The histology studies indicated no physical damage in the skin or in the underlying muscle tissues exposed to ultrasound at all the intensities used in the experiments described above. The regions of hairless rat's epidermis exposed to ultrasound were intact. Additional experiments were performed to assess whether application of ultrasound can induce sufficient insulin transport across the skin of a diabetic hairless rat so that its blood glucose level becomes comparable to that of normal hairless rats. FIG. 2D shows blood glucose levels of diabetic rats during ultrasound-insulin treatment. Insulin-ultrasound treatment (20 KHz, 225 mW/cm2, 100 msec pulses applied every second) reduces the blood glucose level of diabetic hairless rats from about 400 mg/dl to 200 mg/dl (the blood glucose level of normal rats) in 30 minutes. A corresponding change in the plasma insulin levels was observed during sonophoresis. Normal hairless rats were found to possess a plasma insulin level of 101\ufffd31 picomolar, while diabetic hairless rats were found to possess a value below the assay detection limit (34 picomolar). During sonophoresis, the levels of transdermally delivered human insulin in rat plasma reached a value of 77 (\ufffd28) picomolar after 30 minutes, and a value of 178 (\ufffd84) picomolar after 1 hour.",
