    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40917=As previously described, in under-balanced drilling, the fluid 34 being pumped into the drilling location of the borehole, and in the case of horizontal drilling, also utilized to drive the drill bit, is maintained at a downhole pressure of a lesser value than that existing in the formation surrounding the borehole at the drilling location. Having established the pressure in the formation, the selection of the fluid to be pumped into the well is determined by calculating the pressure which will be provided in the drilling area for the particular depth of well involved. For example, for a 5,000 foot depth borehole, based on the densities of water or an oil, such as diesel oil, water would provide a downhole pressure of 2165 p.s.i.g, while diesel oil provides a downhole pressure of 1750 p.s.i.g. Thus, if the pressure in the surrounding formation of the drilling area is determined as being 2,000 p.s.i.g., it can be seen that diesel oil would be utilized rather than water, to provide an under-balanced condition. In the event, the formation pressure is considerably less than the example above or if due to a greater depth of the borehole, the column of fluid is heavier, so that the column of diesel oil is not significantly less than the formation pressure, it is a known practice to insert gas, such as nitrogen into the diesel oil to reduce its density. Thus, the column of fluid in the well could be established to provide a pressure of the drilling location of a lesser value of that in the formation., 24911=This is a division of U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various features have been shown to illustrate the present invention, alternatives will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined in the appending claims. It is also possible to provide a solids level indicator device 230 (FIGS. 15 and 16) in the closed high pressure vessel so that while the separation process is in operation, it is possible to determine when there is a sufficient accumulation at 90 to warrant the starting of pump 137 for removal of the drill cuttings from chamber 70 through outlet 133. The device 230 may be provided in association with end wall 67 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 or with a side wall formed by the outer cylindrical shell 131 of the high pressure vessel 40. The device 230 has a rod member 231 which includes a straight horizontal portion 232 and a second portion 233 which is rigidly affixed to the horizontal portion 232. A hollow tubular member 234 is affixed to the end wall 67 and has an inner end in communication with the interior of the high pressure vessel 40. The outer end of the portion 232 of the rod member 231 extends through a seal 235 in the outer end of the tubular member 234. The seal 235, which may be in the form of a stuffing box, supports the rod members 231",
