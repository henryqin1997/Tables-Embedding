No. 60/063,567 filed Oct. 30, 1997., 50014=Sabol et al., \"Analytical Description of the High and Low Contrast Behavior of a Scan-rotate Geometry for Equalization Mammography,\" Medical Physics, 23(6), June 1996., 50530=Rotary scanning equalization radiography is analogous to first generation computed tomography, as described Sabol et al., \"Analytical Description of the High and Low Contrast Behavior of a Scan-rotate Geometry for Equalization Mammography,\" Medical Physics, 23(6), June 1996., 89215=In other embodiments, the high voltage supply which provides energy to the X-ray source 102 may alternate between two potentials (voltages). Such an embodiment may be advantageous, for example, when the system is used as a line scanner for scanning items such as luggage or mail. One such dual energy source is described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/671,202, entitled \"Improved Dual Energy Power Supply,\" (Attorney Docket No. ANA-094) which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention and which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Projections at the two potentials can be acquired using an interleaved acquisition technique know in computed tomography. Techniques using dual energy X-ray sources are known for providing additional information about a material's characteristics, beyond solely a density measurement. Techniques using dual energy X-ray sources involve measuring the X-ray absorption characteristics of a material for two different energy levels of X-rays. Depending upon the calibration of the system, dual energy measurements provide an indication of dual parameters of the material being scanned; for example, at one calibration setting, the dual parameters can be chosen to be the material's atomic number and the material's density. At another calibration setting, the dual parameters can be chosen to be the material's Photoelectric coefficients and the material's Compton coefficients. At yet another calibration setting, the dual parameters can be chosen to be an amount of a first material present (e.g., plastic) and an amount of a second material present (e.g., aluminum). Dual energy X-ray techniques for energy-selective reconstruction of X-ray computer tomography images are described, for example, in Robert E. Alvarez and Albert Macovski, \"Energy-selective Reconstructions in X-ray Computerized Tomography\", Phys. Med. Biol. 1976, Vol. 21, No. 5, 733-744; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,029,963 and 5,132,998. One algorithm used to generate such dual parameters from dual energy X-ray projection data is known as the Alvarez/Macovski Algorithm. Alternatively, two images can be generated independently for each energy level as described above. In both types of reconstruction, pixel-to-pixel comparisons provide additional discriminants to the clinician., 50211=Sabol et al., \"Rotary Scanning Equalization Radiography: an Efficient Geometry for Equalization Mammography,\" Medical Physics, 21(10), October 1994., 50835=Film Digitizers: The output of a conventional imaging system (i.e., film) may be digitized with a scanning device, so that the costs associated with the storage and retrieval of film are eliminated. The disadvantages of this method are that the use and associated cost of film, along with the disadvantages noted above, have not been eliminated; a relatively high cost, high quality scanning device must be procured and maintained; and additional labor costs are incurred to digitize the films. An exemplary medium resolution scanning device is the ScanJet 6100C, manufactured by Hewlett Packard of Palo Alto, Calif. The ScanJet 6100C has a specified resolution of 600 dpi with up to 2400 dpi of enhanced resolution. An exemplary high resolution scanning device is the Scanmate 5000, manufactured by ScanView Incorporated of Foster City, Calif. The Scanmate 5000 has a specified resolution of 5000 dpi., 80051=FIG. 11 shows a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the system for transmitting and processing the data acquired during the rotation of the detector assembly and for reconstructing an image. As the detector assembly rotates about the axis 110, the shaft encoder 212 provides an indication of the angular position of the assembly about the axis 110 relative to some reference position. The encoder provides an output signal indicating when the detector assembly passes through equal angular increments. At each of these angular positions, the transducers provide a set of outputs to a data acquisition system (DAS) 402. The angular increment between successive readings can be any suitable angle, with 0.25\ufffd being typical. An increment of 0.25\ufffd provides 720 sets of signals for the 1D array of FIGS. 4 and 5 for a complete 180\ufffd rotation, 1440 sets of signals for the 1D array of FIGS. 6 and 7 for a complete 360\ufffd rotation, and 1440 sets of signals (with twice as many signals) for the 2D array of FIGS. 8-10 for a complete 360\ufffd rotation. Since the detectors are parallel to one another, the data resembles data of parallel projections at precise projection angles, and therefore the data is analogous to parallel projections which are acquired during a CT scan of the third generation type. Each set of signals of a corresponding incremental angle is filtered, amplified and digitized in the DAS 402, which in this embodiment is physically located on the detector assembly 106. A DAS commonly used in commercial CT scanners of the third generation type may be used in the present invention. The drive mechanism 108 thus rotates the detector assembly 106 through the required amount of rotation angle about axis 110 while the patient is exposed to the X-ray radiation. A control unit 404 receives information regarding the angular position of the detector assembly 106 from the angular position encoder 212 and sends command signals to the DAS as a function of the angular position information. At approximately equal incremental angular positions of the detector assembly 106 over the total range of required rotation, the control unit 404 commands the DAS 402 to sample the transducers. At each angular position of the detector assembly 106, the data sampled from the transducers collectively forms a one dimensional projection of the conical projection of the patient. In this embodiment of the invention, the DAS 402 collects approximately 720 projections over the angular range of 180\ufffd rotation, or 1440 projections over the angular range of 360\ufffd rotation., 54451=Semiconductor Detectors: The film/screen combination used in a conventional X-ray system may be replaced with a two dimensional array of semiconductors. X-ray photons which have propagated through a patient are either directly detected in the semiconductors or are indirectly detected by placing a scintillating material on top of the array. In the former case, the semiconductor reacts directly to the X-ray energy. In the latter case, the scintillating material converts the X-ray energy into light which is within the detection range of the semiconductor, and the semiconductor reacts to the light. Each element in the array detects X-rays in an area which is approximately 100-microns by 100 microns. The energy detected by each element of the array is digitized and then saved as a pixel in a final digital image. To replace film in general radiographic practice, the array needs to have on the order of 2000 by 2000 elements. The advantage of this system is that film is completely eliminated. The disadvantage of this system is the cost of the detectors and their associated electronics. An exemplary semiconductor detector array is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,426, entitled MULTI-ELEMENT-AMORPHOUS-SILICON-DETECTOR-ARRAY FOR REAL-TIME IMAGING AND DOSIMETRY OF MEGAVOLTAGE PHOTONS AND DIAGNOSTIC X RAYS, invented by Antonuk et al., assigned to The Regents of the University of Michigan., 50389=Boone et al., \"Filter Wheel Equalization in DSA: Simulation Results,\" Medical Physics, 20(2), March/April 1993., 72087=Each fan beam section preferably strikes a corresponding detector of the detector assembly 106. In the embodiment shown the detectors are disposed parallel to one another. Each detector is preferably defined by a scintillator 306, the scintillators 306 being arranged as a 1D array and forming the next layer of the detector assembly 106. Each collimated fan beam section strikes the portion of the corresponding scintillator 306 exposed through the aperture 206 and between the collimator plates 304. Thus, an array of individual scintillators is placed in correspondence with the collimators so that each collimated fan beam section passes between two adjacent collimator plates and irradiates the portion of the corresponding scintillator 306 exposed through the aperture 206. Each scintillator preferably comprises a rectangular parallelepiped of material that converts X-ray photons to optical photons. In a preferred embodiment, the scintillators 306 include cadmium tungstate (CdWO4), although other materials suitable for converting X-ray energy to light energy may be used. The number and density of detectors can vary depending on the application, the ultimate resolution of the image, and limitations relating to cost of the system. In one embodiment of the invention, the number of scintillators is approximately 2000, and the width of each detector (defining the density of the detectors) is approximately 100-200 microns. Thus, the described embodiment requires approximately 2000 scintillators, versus approximately 20002 for a prior art system employing a two dimensional square matrix array of semiconductor detectors, reducing the number of scintillators by 3,998,000. Very clearly, depending upon the application, any number and density of detectors can be utilized, with as little as 100 to 500 (or even less depending on the application), each having a width on the order of 0.5 cm (or even larger depending on the application) still providing relatively good data., 49852=Sabol et al., \"Practical Application of a Scan-Rotate Equalization Geometry to Mammography,\" Medical Physics, 23(12), December 1996.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of the equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. In another embodiment of the invention, the transducers can be placed at other positions along the light pipes, and the light pipes take other forms. For example, the light pipes could be shaped as fans with the apex connected to transducers. The light pipes and scintillators could be split into two or more sections to allow multiple slice CT scanning. The X-ray source 102 can also include an assembly (not shown) to collimate the conical X-ray radiation source to a fan beam. In such an embodiment of the invention, the fan-beam is positioned perpendicular to the length of the scintillators. Additionally, a rectangular mask (not shown) can be positioned over the detector to coincide with the fan beam. In this configuration, the system can be converted and used as a conventional CT scanner. More specifically, the detector and X-ray source 102 can be rotated about the longitudinal axis of the patient. In this configuration, the detector is not rotated on its spindle. Furthermore,",
