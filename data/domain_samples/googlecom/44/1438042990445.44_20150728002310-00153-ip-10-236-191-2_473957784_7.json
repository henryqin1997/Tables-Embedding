This process is used to remove sulfur-containing compounds, arsine and stibine, oxygen, CO and C0 2 as well as hydrogen from propylene in order to produce highly pure propylene for polymerization. The process utilizes a specific adsorbent which is not disclosed in detail for the adsorbtive removal or all impurities apart from hydrogen; this adsorbent additionally acts as catalyst for the hydrogenation of propene with hydrogen and thus removes the hydrogen catalytically., 18677=In a paper presented by D. J. Artrip, C. Herion and R. Meissner at the \u201cMetCon '93\u201d, session four, May 27, 1993, in Houston, Tex., USA, a four-stage process for removing various impurities from olefin streams for polymerization reactions was disclosed. In this process, arsenic- and sulfur-containing compounds are adsorbed on an adsorbent comprising copper oxide and zinc oxide in a first step. In a second step, acetylene and dienes are hydrogenated to olefins over a palladium-containing catalyst after addition of an amount of hydrogen sufficient to hydrogenate them. In the third process step, oxygen present is removed over a metallic copper catalyst. In the fourth and last process step, residual carbon monoxide which is still present is converted into carbon dioxide over a copper oxide catalyst and any remaining hydrogen is likewise oxidized to water., 19975=DE-A 31 19 850 teaches the use of a catalyst comprising from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight of palladium and from 0.05 to 1% by weight of silver on a silicon dioxide support having a BET surface area of from 10 to 200 m2/g for the selective hydrogenation of butadiene in a C4 fraction. Specific embodiments of this catalyst are those having a weight ratio of silver to palladium of from 0.7:1 to 3:1 and from 1:1 to 2.5:1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations 40 kg of Celite\ufffd 209 kieselguhr (trademark of Manville Corp., U.S.A.) and 12.9 kg of SiO2 powder (obtainable under the name D11-10 from BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen) were intimately mixed with 1 kg of Aqualic\ufffd CA W3 polyacrylate (obtainable from BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen) in a Mix-Muller (pan mill). 44 kg of deionized water were added while mixing in the pan mill. Over a period of 5 minutes, 3.6 kg of sodium water glass solution and 2.7 liters of a 25% strength aqueous ammonia solution were added. After mixing in the pan mill for 15 minutes, a further 3 liters of water were added. The resulting mass was extruded to produce 4 mm extrudates, then dried for 2 hours at 120\ufffd C. and calcined for 2 hours at 800\ufffd C. The resulting support had a tapped density of 500 g/l and a total porosity of 0.76 ml/g. The proportion of the total porosity made up by macropores was 100% and its BET surface area was 3.8 m2/g. As components of the active composition, palladium and silver were applied by impregnation with an aqueous solution of palladium nitrate and silver nitrate using the \u201cincipient wetness\u201d method (i.e. the impregnation solution is just completely absorbed by the support). The impregnated extrudates were dried at 120\ufffd C. for 16 hours and calcined at 250\ufffd C. for 5 hours. The finished catalyst contained 0.5% by weight of palladium and 0.5% by weight",
