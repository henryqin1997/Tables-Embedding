Details of these advanced types of ad-hoc networks are described in U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although only a few exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the following claims. Furthermore, the cost associated to spectrum information can be used also to avoid using resources that are financially expensive to the user, operator or some other entity. Additionally, a fast spectrum license revocation technique can be performed using a beacon signal or by flooding a data packet indicating resource revocation through the network 100 as soon as one node 102, 106 or 107 receives information about the revocation. For example, if one node (e.g., a node 102) receives revocation information from an IAP 106, for example, the node 102 propagates this revocation information through the network 100 using a data packet flood or beacon signal. This ability is useful, for example, in emergency situations when the purpose of the spectrum usage changes abruptly. In addition, in a multi hopping network 100, the beacon can be used to enable nodes, such as mobile nodes 102 or wireless routers 107, to indicate the availability of the rule data to other neighboring nodes 102 or 107. This capability is beneficial",
