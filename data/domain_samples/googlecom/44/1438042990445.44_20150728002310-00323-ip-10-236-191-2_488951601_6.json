For example, while the present invention has been described in terms of an integrated circuit with a memory capacity of some 7.3 megabits and some 40-50K logic gates, one could use the present invention to build an integrated circuit of reduced size. An integrated circuit having a memory capacity of 2 megabits, the capacity of basic VGA video memory in graphics cards, with 30K logic gates, the approximate amount of logic in present graphics controller integrated circuits, still realizes the advantages of the present invention. Costs, power dissipation and occupied space are reduced, and performance is enhanced, for instance. The present invention, therefore, should be limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims. The RAM 83 also feeds data into the LCD Display Interface block 65 which is organized for dual scan LCD panel displays. The general operation of the block 65 is that a Shader unit 96 receives the data from the RAM 83. The unit 96 generates the grayscale values for the LCD pixels. In passing, it should be noted that the word, grayscale, implies intensity for a color LCD display. These values are sent to a Formatter unit 92 which, as",
