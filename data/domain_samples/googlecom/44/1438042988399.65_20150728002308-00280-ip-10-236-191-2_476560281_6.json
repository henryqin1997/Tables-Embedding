The improved expansible tip catheter defined in claim 1 wherein the tube is constructed in two sections, an elongate tip portion composed of a resilient polymer, and the remainder of the tube which is composed of flexible polymer, the resilient polymer tip portion being less resistant to lateral expansion than the remainder of the tube. 2. The improved expansible tip catheter defined in claim 1 wherein the outside diameter of the unexpanded tube is substantially uniform along the length thereof. including an elongate flexible wire secured to the connector and the distal end of the tube, extending through the tube to prevent extension and to guide the tube during insertion. an elongate portion of the tube adjacent the distal end is pre-stretched to be less resistant to lateral expansion than the remainder of the tube such that upon injection of fluid under pressure into said tube said elongate distal end portion expands laterally first, said lateral expansion beginning initially in and progressing along said elongate distal end portion in preference to lateral expansion of the remainder of said tube; and I inches to about 0.092 inches; said tube has an outside diameter from about 0.026 1. 1n an expansible tip embolectomy catheter of the type which is so constructed and arranged as to be inserted distal end first into blood passages in the body which comprise",
