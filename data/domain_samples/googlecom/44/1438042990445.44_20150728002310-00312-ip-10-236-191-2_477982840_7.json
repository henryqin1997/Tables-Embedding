For some sizes of the catheters where the inside diameter of the spring 6 may be relatively substantially greater than the outside diameter of the needle 12, it may be desirable to provide a centering sliding support or guide adjacent the proximal end of the needle. For this purpose an elastomeric washer 21, having a diameter to fit closely but slidingly within the spring 6, is fitted over the proximal end of the sleeve 15 in abutting relation to the proximal end of the needle 12, and can slide relative to the spring when the needle is proximally retracted. Because the centering washer 21 provides the additional benefit of preventing blood flow around the exterior of the needle 12 proximally beyond its proximal end until the needle is fully retracted, it may be desirable to include the centering washer in all sizes of catheters. In assembling the needle catheter, the distal end of the retraction wire 17 is first attached to the needle sleeve 15 as described above and then the proximal portion of the retraction wire is threaded through the lumen of the catheter 5 from the distal end to the proximal end thereof and the proximal portion of the needle 12 is inserted through the distal lip 11 of",
