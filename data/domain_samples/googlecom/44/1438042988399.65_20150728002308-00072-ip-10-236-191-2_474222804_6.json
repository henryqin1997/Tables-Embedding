More specific examples of these sensitizations are described in Research Disclosure 17643-III (December, 1978) p-23, etc., 88881=Specific examples of emulsions of internal latent image type include the emulsions of silver halide of conversion type described in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 2,592,250; the emulsions of silver halide of core/shell type as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,761,276, 3,850,637, 3,923,513, 4,035,185, 4,395,478, 4,504,570, Japanese Patent Applications (OPI) Nos. 156614/77, 127549/80, 60222/78, 22681/81, 208540/84, 107641/85, 3137/86, Japanese Patent Application No. 3642/86, Research Disclosure 23510 (November, 1983) p. 236, etc., 103884=As the light source for the fogged exposure any of the light sources emitting the light within the range of the sensitive wavelengths of the photosensitive materials may be used. In general, a fluorescent lamp, a tungsten lamp, a xenon lamp, the sun light, etc. can be used. Details concerning these methods are described, for instance, in British Pat. No. 1,151,363, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 12710/70, 12709/70, 6936/83, Japanese Patent Applications (OPI) Nos. 9727/73, 137350/81, 129438/82, 62652/83, 60739/83, 70223/83 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,851), 120248/83 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 89101A2) etc. For the photosensitive materials having sensitivity over the whole wavelength region, for instance, such as a color photosensitive material, highly color rendering light sources (close to white as much as possible) as described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) Nos. 137350/81 or 70223/83 are preferable. The luminous intensity of the light is from 0.01 to 2000 luxes, preferably from 0.05 to 30 luxes, or more preferably from 0.05 to 5 luxes. The higher the sensitivity of the emulsion used in a photosensitive material, the more preferable a low-intensity exposure. For the adjustment of illumination intensity the brightness of the light source may be varried or reduced by various filters, or the distance or angle between the photosensitive material and the light source may be altered. It is also possible to use a feeble light in the early stage of exposure and then to use a stronger light for the purpose of shortening the time of exposure., 125278=The present color development time is normally 5 minutes or less. In order to speed processing, color development time is preferably 2 minutes and 30 seconds or less, more preferably from 10 seconds to 2 minutes. If a sufficient color density can be obtained, a shorter color development time is preferably use. The pH thereof is not higher than 11.5, preferably from 9.5-11.2, and more preferably 10.0-11.0., 99033=Typical examples of these discoloration inhibitors are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86 pp. 401-440., 96270=In this invention supersensitizers may also be used for the purpose of improving the color developing property of couplers. Typical examples of these compounds are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86, pp. 374-391., 92870=For the purpose of forming a direct positive color image use can be made of various color couplers. Useful preferable couplers are compounds capable of forming or releasing a dye upon the coupling reaction with the oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine series developing agent, and they are themselves preferably substantially nondiffusible compounds. Typical examples of such useful color couplers include naphthol or phenol series compounds, pyrazolohe or pyrazoloazole series compounds and open-chained or heterocyclic ketomethylene compounds. Specific examples of these cyan-, magenta-, and yellow-color couplers usable in this invention are described in Research Disclosure 17643 (December, 1978) p. 25, VII -D, ibid. 18717 (November, 1979), Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86, and patents cited therein., 113384=Examples and processes for synthesis of these compounds are described, for instance, in the patents cited in Research Disclosure No. 22534 (January, 1983) pp. 50--54 and No. 23213 (August, 1983) pp. 267-270, Japanese Patent Publications Nos. 38164/74, 19452/77, 47326/77, Japanese Patent Applications (OPI) Nos. 69613/77, 3426/77, 138742/80, 11837/85, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,306,016, and 4,471,044., 107095=To explain more fully with regard to nucleating agents, many compounds of this sort which can be divided into three groups of quarternary heterocyclic compounds (represented by general formula [N-I]), hydrazine series compounds (represented by general formula [N-II]), and other compounds, are disclosed in Research Disclosure, No. 22534 (January, 1983) pp. 50-54, ibid. No. 15162(November, 1976) pp. 76-77, and ibid. No. 23510(November, 1983), pp. 346-352. ##STR14## (In the above formula, Z' represents a substituted unsubstituted nonmetallic atomic group required for the formation of 5- to 6-membered heterocyclic ring;. R1 ' is an aliphatic group, and R2 ' is a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic group, or an aromatic group R1 ' and R2 ' may be a substituted or unsubstituted group, but, of the groups represented by R1 ', R2 ', and Z' at least one contains an alkynyl group, an acyl group, a hydrazine group, or a hydrazone group, or R1 ' and R2 ' form a 6-membered ring having the skeleton of dihydropyridinium. Moreover, of the substituent groups of R1 ', R2 ', and Z' at least one may have X1 '(L1)m\", wherein X1 ' is an adsorption promoting group to silver halide, and L1 is a divalent connecting group. Y' is a counter ion for the charge balance, n\" is 0 or 1, and m\" is 0 or 1.), 97112=Couplers of this invention can be dispersed in hydrophilic colloids by the method described in Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86, pp. 468-475., 121756=Hydroquinones (e.g., compounds described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,227,552 and 4,279,987), coumarones (e.g., compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,268,621, Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 103031/79, Research Disclosure No. 18264 (June, 1979) pp. 333-334), quinones (e.g., compounds described in Research Disclosure No. 21206 (December, 1981) pp. 433-434), amines (e.g., compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,993, Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 174757/83), oxidizing agents (e.g., compounds described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 260039/85, Research Disclosure No. 16936 (May, 1978) pp. 10-11), catechols (e.g., compounds described in Japanese Patent Applications (OPI) No. 21013/80 and 65944/80), compounds capable of releasing a nucleating compound at the time of development (e.g., compounds described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 107029/85), thioureas (e.g., compounds described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 95533/85), and spirobisindans (e.g., compounds described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 65944/80)., 99174=To achieve the object of these compounds, they are usually co-emulsified with couplers in a proportion of from 5 to 100 wt % on the basis of the weight of the corresponding color couplers. In order to prevent the deterioration of cyan dye images due to heat and especially light, it is effective to introduce ultraviolet absorbents into the layers on both sides adjacent to the cyan color developing layer. Further, ultraviolet absorbents can also be added to hydrophilic colloid layers as protective layers or the like. Typical examples of such compounds are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86, pp. 391-400., 44475=Further, Japanese Patent Publication No. 12709/70 describes that a triazoline-thion or tetraazoline-thione series compound is added as an antifoggant to the photosensitive material forming a direct positive image by the light fogging method. But, even by these methods high maximum density and fast speed of development could not be attained., 137352=After the desilvering (blix or fixing) processings such as water wash and/or stabilization are carried out. As the additives used in the water wash and stabilization steps, various compopunds described in Japanese Patent Application No. 32462/86 specification pages 30 to 36., 100073=Dyes preventing irradiation or halation, ultraviolet absorbents, plasticizers, fluorescent whitening agents, matting agents, air fog inhibitors, coating aids, film hardeners, antistatic agents, slide improving agents, etc. can be added to the photosensitive materials of this invention. Typical examples of these additives are described in Research Disclosure 17643 VII-VIII (December, 1978) pp. 25-27 and ibid. 18716 (November, 1979) pp. 647-651., 40920=As the means for forming selectively fogged nuclei as above described, there are known a process, called generally \"a light fogging method\", in which the second exposure is given all over the surface of the photosensitive layer (for instance, British Pat. No. 1,151,363) and process, called \"a chemical fogging method\", using a nucleating agent. With regard to the latter method there is a description for instance in Research Disclosure vol. 151, No. 15162 (November, 1976), pp. 76 to 78., 126785=As additives for the color developer in this invention, various compounds described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) Nos. 144739/85, pp. 14-22, 242161/85, pp. 45-50. Furthermore, it is particularly preferred to use nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds (e.g., tetraazaindenes, benzindazoles, benzotriazoles, benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, benzoxazoles, 1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazoles, etc.), and aromatic or aliphatic mercapto compounds for the color developers in this invention as antifoggant., 131424=The bleaching solution, blix solution and their prebaths may optionally comprise any suitable bleach accelerators. Specific examples of such useful bleach accelerators include compounds containing mercapto or disulfide groups, thiazolidine derivatives, thiourea derivatives, iodides, polyethyleneoxides, polyamines, compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) Nos. 42434/74, 59644/74, 94927/78, 35727/79, 26506/80, and 163940/83, iodine ion, and bromine ion. Among these compounds, the compounds containing mercapto or dilsulfide groups are preferably used in light of its excellent effect of accelerating bleaching. In particular, compounds as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,893,858, West German Pat. No. 1,290,812, and Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 95630/78 are preferably used. Furthermore, compounds as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,552,834 are preferably used. These bleach accelerators may be incorporated in the light-sensitive material., 37403=This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/091,928, filed Sept. 1, 1987, now abandoned., 102468=For instance, the typical examples include color reversal films, color reversal papers, etc. for slide use or television use. This invention can also be applied to color hard copies, etc. for preserving the images by full color duplicating machine or CRT. This invention can further be applied to black-and-white photosensitive materials utilizing the three color coupler process described in Research Disclosure 17123 (July, 1978), etc., 92311=The photographic emulsions used in this invention can contain a fog inhibitor or a stabilizer for the purpose of either preventing fogging during the manufacturing step, during the storage, or during the photographic processing of the photosensitive material, or stabilizing the photographic performance of the photographic material. More specific examples are described, for instance, in Research Disclosure 17643-IV (December, 1978), E. J. Birr: \"Stabilization of Photographic Silver Halide Emulsions\" (Focal Press), 1974, etc., 91817=The photographic emulsions used in this invention can be spectrally sensitized by photographic sensitizing dyes in a routine manner. Especially useful dyes are those belonging to cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, and complex merocyanine dyes, and these dyes may be used singly or in combination. The above-described dyes may also be used in combination with supersensitizers. More specific examples are described in Research Disclosure 17643-IV (December, 1978) p. 23-24, etc., 106312=As the nucleating agents usable in this invention all the compounds which have hitherto been developed for the purpose of nucleating the silver halide of internal latent image type are applicable. Specific examples of these nucleating agents include the compounds described in the specification pp. 49-66 of Japanese Patent Application (2) filed on Oct. 27th, 1986 (Applicant: Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), and more specifically Examples (N-I-1)-(N-I-10) described in ibid. pp. 56-58, Examples (N-II-1)-(N-II-12) described in ibid. pp. 63-66, etc. Also, the amount of the nucleating agents used and the place of addition of the nucleating agents are described in ibid. pp. 66-67., 71445=Literature: Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, 28, 77 (1875), Japanese Patent Applications (OPI) Nos. 37436/75, 3231/76; U.S. Pat.

Still further, in accordance with the process of this invention direct positive color images can be obtained with the formation of second reversal negative images being lessened when a running processing is carried out by the use of a color developing solution containing substantially no benzyl alcohol. It is also possible to obtain photosensitive materials those storage stability in the raw state has been improved if the nucleation promoters of this invention are contained in them. Further, it is possible to obtain direct positive color images which show little variation in the maximum image density even when the pH of the color developing solution containing substantially no benzyl alcohol changes. In accordance with the process of this invention, it is possible to obtain direct positive color images of which the lowering of the coloring density is small even when the processing is carried out in a short period of time using a color developing solution containing substantially no benzyl alcohol. ______________________________________Color DevelopmentDiethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid 0.5 g1-Hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic 0.5 gacidDiethyleneglycol 8.0 gBenzyl alcohol 9.0 gSodium Bromide 0.7 gSodium chloride 0.5 gSodium sulfite 2.0 gHydroxylamine sulfate 2.8 g3-Methyl-4-amino-N-ethyl- 2.0 gN-\u03b2-methanesulfonamidoethyl)-aniline sulfate3-Methyl-4-amino-N-ethyl-N- 4.0 g(\u03b2-hydroxyethyl)-aniline sulfatePatassium carbonate 30.0",
