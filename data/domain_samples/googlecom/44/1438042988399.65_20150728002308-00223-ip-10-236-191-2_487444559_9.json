The non-crosslinked gel forming polymer can be a cellulose derivative such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and salts thereof, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, gelatinized starches, gelatin, dextrose, and other similar components, and may be a mixture of the above. Certain types and grades of CMC are approved for use with food items and are preferred when the absorbent is to be so used. The preferred polymer is a CMC, most preferably sodium salt of CMC having a degree of substitution of about 0.7 to 0.9. The degree of substitution refers to the proportion of hydroxyl groups in the cellulose molecule that have their hydrogen substituted by a carboxymethyl group. The viscosity of a 1% solution of CMC at 25\ufffd C., read on a Brookfield viscometer, should be in the range of about 2500 to 12,000 mPa. The CMC used in the Examples following was obtained from Hercules, Inc. of Wilmington, Del. (under the tradename B315) or from AKZO Nobel of Stratford, Conn. (under the tradename AF3085)., 22256=This application is a continuation-in-part application claiming priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/787,839, filed Jan. 23, 1997, now U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiment or embodiments discussed were chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled. Although the precise mechanism for prolonging the preservation of food products by the method set out above is not heretofore known, it is speculated that the absorbent material inhibits the reproduction and growth of microorganisms, such as by trapping the microorganisms within the structure of the material, etc. Additionally, the absorbent material may adsorb gaseous products from the interior of the storage container, such as ethylene which is release by the food products during ripening and/or degradation. However, while the precise mechanism may be unknown, the advantages offered by the method of the present invention may conveniently be practiced by one of ordinary skill in the art with reference",
