Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. The above-explained unified message management method of a personal information terminal makes a user confirm all types of received messages at a time and removes user's inconvenience that a message type to write should be distinguished in advance prior to choosing a message input screen. Owing to the above-explained method, there is no need that a user should choose a message input screen suitable for a message type to transmit. After the user completes a message by filling in necessary information as well as a body message in fields of the message input screen (S84, S89) he or she requests for transmission of the completed message (S85, S90). Then, the message type converting unit 22 delivers the completed message to the POPS/SMTP unit 23 or the SMS format adapting unit 25 which will transmit the received message to a remote side in accordance with a protocol intended by \u2018New Mail\u2019 or \u2018New Memo\u2019 (S86, S91). or 8.
