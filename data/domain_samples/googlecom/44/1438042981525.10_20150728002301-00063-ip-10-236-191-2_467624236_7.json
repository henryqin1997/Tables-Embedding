In summary, because the outermost portion of the flow does not provide as great a contribution to thrust because of its turbulence as does flow inwardly of the wake region, treatment to dissipate the acoustic energy within the outermost twenty percent (20%) does not interfere with engine thrust as would such treatment elsewhere along the span. Alternatively, the number of leading edges interacting with the turbulent flow are reduced in the annular channel 56 which reduces thrust. However, the wake turbulent flow does not impact many strut 62 surfaces and less acoustic energy is generated. The detailed embodiment shown in FIG. 4, shows the number of radial airfoil surfaces 62 in the outermost portion of the working medium flow path 24 are reduced thereby reducing noise generation due to a fewer number of these radial airfoil surfaces upon which the wake turbulent flow can impact. This also reduces the recovery of static pressure and therefore thrust by reducing the conversion of dynamic pressure to static pressure in the channel 56 formed in this outermost portion of the flow path. However, as the outermost portion provides a small contribution to",
