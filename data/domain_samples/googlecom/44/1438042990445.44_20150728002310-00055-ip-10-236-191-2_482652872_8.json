The memory device is supplied with a charge of a precharge level from the opposite side of where a precharge circuit is disposed (i.e., the side opposite to the side from which the bit lines are supplied with a charge by a precharge circuit) while performing ordinary operations of precharging the bit lines by the precharge circuit. One example of such a memory is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2-12694.}",

Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. Furthermore, a charge of the precharge level is supplied to virtual ground lines other than the virtual ground line to be accessed, and the charge of the precharge level is not supplied to the virtual ground line to be accessed. Thus,, the access time can be significantly shortened. Furthermore, at the standby state, a charge of the precharge level can be maintained in all the bit lines. As a result, at the first access after the memory cell array gets out of the standby state, upon completing the activation of a word line corresponding to an input address, the sense operation for the bit line can be immediately performed. Thus, the access time can be significantly shortened. Furthermore, a circuit is disposed on the opposite side across a memory cell array storing data. While a column corresponding to an address is selected and accessed, the circuit precharges the bit lines corresponding to all the other columns. With such a structure, a charge of the precharge level can be constantly maintained in the bit lines. Thus, upon completing the",
