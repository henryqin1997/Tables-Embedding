[0099] Also, in each of the third and fourth embodiments, the ankle pulse wave and the toe pulse wave are detected in the state in which the ankle cuff pressure PCA is kept at the pulse-wave detection pressure. However, the ankle pulse wave and the toe pulse wave may be detected in a state in which the ankle cuff pressure PCA is slowly decreased. [0098] For example, in each of the illustrated embodiments, the photoelectric-pulse-wave sensor 56 is worn on a toe of foot. However, the sensor 56 may be worn on any distal portion located on a distal side of the ankle cuff 20, for example, a proximal portion located on a proximal side of a toe, such as an instep (i.e., a portion above a dorsal pedal artery). [0097] While the present invention has been described in its embodiment by reference to the drawings, it is to be understood that the invention may otherwise be embodied. [0096] In the present embodiment, in the state in which the ankle cuff pressure PCA is kept at the pulse-wave",
