In this configuration there can be up to four local computers 111. Each compression user station 1005 receives one output of 4-input 4-output compression switch 1001, and sends the output to the input of 42-port Paragon KVM Switch 1003. Twenty eight outputs from 42-port Paragon KVM Switch 1003 are connected to 28 Sun User Consoles 1007. The remaining outputs of 42-port Paragon KVM Switch 1003 are connected to 20 PC User Consoles 1009. Each Sun User Consol 1007 is connected to a remote sun workstation 1011, while each PC User Console 1009 is connected to a remote PC Server 1013. Thus in this configuration, a compression device, in this case, 4-input 4-output compression switch 1001, can control 108 total servers of which 28 are remote sun workstations 1011, and the other 80 are remote PC Servers 1013.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39101=The field of compression and digitization of computer video through a video switch has seen explosive development over the years allowing the transfer of video data over extended distances at increased speed of transfer. For example, in a primitive form, in 1992 and 1993, Apple Computer developed a technology whereby one computer was controlled by another computer via emulation of keyboard and mouse protocols. This technology was implemented as part of a computer on a card \u201cproduct.\u201d The product consisted of a full computer developed on a single card that was designed to directly plug into a standard Macintosh computer. This Macintosh computer controlled the computer on a card via the keyboard and mouse emulation technologies. However, the video out from the computer on a card was routed to the Macintosh display in analog form. A digitization or compression method was not implemented, nor was a means for transmission of the video over great distances.}",

The scope of the invention, therefore, shall be defined solely by the following claims. Further, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that numerous changes may be made in such details without departing from the spirit and the principles of the invention. , there is a 16-input 16-output KVM switch 1021, with inputs connected to a combination of local computers 111, and remote controlling computer 1023. As in other configurations, the local computers 111 connect to the remote servers 1015, via 4-input 4-output compression switch 1001, and compression user station 1005. The outputs of the 16-input 16-output KVM switch are sent to a combination of remote servers 1015, and remote servers 1015 connected to additional 16-input 16-output KVM switches 1021. In total, there are 268 remote servers 1015 that can be controlled by the local computers 111, and the remote controlling computer 1023. FIG. 13 illustrates an example of an alternate embodiment of the present invention wherein 16 local computers control 256 remote servers. This configuration shows how, with a",
