However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims. c above. The resulting inductor may be packaged as described above, and benefits from enhanced thermal characteristics, as well as the modular packaging which facilitates its interconnection with other circuitry of the overall circuit assembly. FIG. 1 c above. The output of coil 176 is coupled to the input of coil 178, as indicated at reference numeral 184, in a lead that may be labeled \u201c\u2212INV1\u201d corresponding to the arrangement of FIG. 1 On an opposite side the core, a similar arrangement is provided. That is, coils 176 and 178 are wound in a same direction in accordance with the right-hand rule. A DC bus input is provided at lead 180, and an output lead 182 maybe labeled \u201c\u2212INV2\u201d to correspond to the arrangement illustrated in c above. FIG. 1 c above. The coils are wound in the same direction, and interleaved with one another to",
