No. 08/722,413 (PHA 23,156) are used initially, the effect may be that the positions of avatars 402 and 404 as presented on machine 102 are not consistent with the positions as shown on the other machine 104. For example, the proxy agent on machine 102 shows avatar 402 leading avatar 404 and the proxy agent on machine 104 shows the situation the other way round: avatar 404 leading avatar 402. Here, a diversion agent is used at an appropriate moment to establish consistence throughout system 100 by masking the transition to an unambiguous state wherein one of avatars 402 and 404 is leading the other on both machines 102 and 104, brought about by, e.g., a random selection procedure. To attain this consistence, information about the states of the avatars at each of machines 102 and 104 is required. The state of the proxy agent is processed as an external message at input 222 in FIG. 2. Note that the use of the diversion agent here is not directly based on measured latency. The diversion agent is used to mask a problem caused by latency, here as a result of close-proximity interaction taken care of by local proxy agents. FIG. 4 is a second example of a user-perceptible effect created by diversion agent 114. Here, the users at machines 102 and",
