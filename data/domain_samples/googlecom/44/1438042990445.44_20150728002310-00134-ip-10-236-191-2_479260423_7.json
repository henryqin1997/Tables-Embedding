    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53794=For the purposes of the invention, carbon dioxide is employed as a fluid in a liquid, gaseous, or supercritical phase. If liquid CO2 is used, the temperature employed during the process is preferably below 31\ufffd C. If gaseous CO2 is used, it is preferred that the phase be employed at high pressure. As used herein, the term \u201chigh pressure\u201d generally refers to CO2 having a pressure from about 50 to about 500 bar. In one embodiment, the CO2 is utilized in a \u201csupercritical\u201d phase. As used herein, \u201csupercritical\u201d means that a fluid medium is above its critical temperature and pressure, i.e., about 31\ufffd C. and about 71 bar for CO2. The thermodynamic properties of CO2 are reported in Hyatt, J. Org. Chem. 49: 5097-5101 (1984); therein, it is stated that the critical temperature of CO2 is about 31\ufffd C.; thus the method of the present invention may be carried out at a temperature above 31\ufffd C. For the purposes of the invention, it is preferred to employ CO2 at a pressure ranging from at a lower end of about 20 or about 50 bar to an upper end of about 200 bar or about 1000 bar. In certain embodiments (e.g., extrusion), CO2 may be introduced into a system at about 270 bar to about 340 bar. The pressure may then drop to about 100 bar to about 170 bar subsequent to introduction of the CO2.}",
