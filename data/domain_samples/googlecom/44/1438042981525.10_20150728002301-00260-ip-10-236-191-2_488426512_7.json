    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24989=A naturally occurring huHGF variant has recently been identified which corresponds to an alternative spliced form of the huHGF transcript containing the coding sequences for the N-terminal finger and first two kringle domains of mature huHGF [Chan et al., Science 254, 1382-1385 (1991); Miyazawa et al., Eur. J. Biochem, 197, 15-22 (1991)]. This variant, designated HGF/NK2, has been proposed to be a competitive antagonist of mature huHGF., 99788=A full length cDNA clone encoding the huHGFr was constructed by joining partial cDNAs isolated from cDNA libraries and from PCR amplification. Coding sequences for amino acids 1-270 were isolated from a human placental cDNA library (provided by T. Mason, Genentech) screened with a 50 mer oligonucleotide (5'-ATGAAGGCCCCCGCTGTGCTTGCACCTGGCATCCTCGTGCTCCTGTTTACC-3') (SEQ. ID. NO: 16). Sequences encoding amino acids 809-1390 were isolated from a human liver library (Stragagen) screened with the oligonucleotide probe (5'-CACTAGTTAGGATGGGGGACATGTCTGTCAGAGGATACTGCACTTGTCGGCATGAACCGT-3'). (SEQ. ID. NO: 17), 40125=The terms \"wild-type human hepatocyte growth factor\", \"native human hepatocyte growth factor\", \"wild-type huHGF\", and \"native huHGF\" refer to native sequence human HGF, i.e., that encoded by the cDNA sequence published by Miyazawa, et al. 1989, supra, or Nakamura et al., 1989, supra, including its mature, pre, pre-pro, and pro forms, purified from natural source, chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced. The sequences reported by Miyazawa et al, and Nakamura et al. differ in 14 amino acids. The reason for the differences is not entirely clear; polymorphism or cloning artifacts are among the possibilities. Both sequences are specifically encompassed by the foregoing terms as defined for the purpose of the present invention. It will be understood that natural allelic variations exist and can occur among individuals, as demonstrated by one or more amino acid differences in the amino acid sequence of each individual. Amino acid positions in the variant huHGF molecules herein are indicated in accordance with the numbering of Miyazawa et al. 1989, supra., 89522=The huHGF cDNA used corresponds to the 728 amino acid form as published earlier (Miyazawa et al., 1989, supra)., 97383=An HGF polyclonal sandwich ELISA was used to quantify all kringle deletion and C-terminal truncation variants. Briefly, microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 5 mg/mL guinea pig polyclonal (anti CHO-expressed rhuHGF) IgG antibody preparation (Genentech., Inc.) as described above. This antibody recognizes rhuHGF as well as HGF truncated forms when compared to visual inspection of Western blots, making it ideal for monitoring HGF variants. Plates were blocked and duplicate serial dilutions of 293 cell supernatants (1:103-6.106) were added and incubated over night at 4\ufffd C. Purified CHO-expressed rhuHGF (100-0.78 ng/mL) was used as a standard and incubated in parallel. Plates were washed and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of the same polyclonal antibody (approx. 400 ng/mL) but in this case horseradish peroxidase conjugated for detection of the variants (see above). Western blotting was performed to determine the size of the expressed HGF variants. For this, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed using standard methods with the polyclonal IgG antibody preparation (500 ng/mL). A chemiluminescent detection method (Amersham) and a goat anti-guinea pig IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) were used for development of the blot as described by the manufacturer., 105971=Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) monolayers were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Serum-starved cells were incubated without or with 200 ng/mL rhuHGF for 5 minutes at 37\ufffd C. and extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met COOH antibodies and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (see Western blotting above)., 20520=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/884,811 filed May 18, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,921 and U.S. application Ser. No. 07/885,971 filed May 18, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,837., 114697=These data show that Kringles K3 and K4 are not required for receptor binding. Our data support the previous observations by Miyazawa et al., 1991 supra and Chan et al., 1991 supra, in the sense that variant N-303, which in amino acid sequence is very similar to HGF/NK2, retains the ability to compete efficiently for binding to the HGF receptor (Kd\u02dc280 pM). Furthermore, the observations that N-303 is sufficient to bind to the receptor and that the second Kringle is not required for binding the HGF receptor (in the context of the remainder of the molecule) suggest that the receptor binding domain is contained within the finger and first Kringle of huHGF. Unfortunately, we have not been able to detect expression of this variant using our polyclonal antisera suggesting that variant N-207 (deletion after the first kringle) was not expressed in 293 cells., 81319=The HGF variants may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, in colloidal drug delivery systems (e.g. liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, Osol, A., Ed. (1980). An HGF variant sequence can be linked to a immunoglobulin constant domain sequence as hereinbefore defined. The resultant molecules are commonly referred to as HGF variant-immunoglobulin chimeras. Such chimeras can be constructed essentially as described in WO 91/08298 (published 13 Jun. 1991)., 48779=The notations used throughout this application to describe huHGF amino acid sequence variants are described below. The location of a particular amino acid in the polypeptide chain of huHGF is identified by a number. The number refers to the amino acid position in the amino acid sequence of the mature, wild-type human HGF polypeptide as disclosed in Miyazawa et al., 1989, supra. In the present application, similarly positioned residues in huHGF variants are designated by these numbers even though the actual residue number is not so numbered due to deletions or insertions in the molecule. This will occur, for example, with site-directed deletional or insertional variants. The amino acids are identified using the one-letter code. Substituted amino acids are designated by identifying the wild-type amino acid on the left side of the number denoting the position in the polypeptide chain of that amino acid, and identifying the substituted amino acid on the right side of the number., 70555=Prokaryotes are the preferred host cells for the initial cloning steps of this invention. They are particularly useful for rapid production of large amounts of DNA, for production of single-stranded DNA templates used for site-directed mutagenesis, for screening many mutants simultaneously, and for DNA sequencing of the mutants generated. For expressing the HGF variants of the present invention eukaryotic hosts, such as eukaryotic microbes (yeast) and multicellular organisms (mammalian cell cultures) may also be used. Examples of prokaryotes, e.g. E. coli, eukaryotic microorganisms and multicellular cell cultures, and expression vectors, suitable for use in producing the HGF variants of the present invention are, for example, those disclosed in WO 90/02798 (published 22 Mar. 1990)., 53497=The technique of \"polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\", as used herein, generally refers to a procedure wherein minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195, issued 28 Jul. 1987 and in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al. eds., Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience 1991, Volume 2, Chapter 15., 95948=A specific two-site huHGF sandwich ELISA using two monoclonal antibodies was used to quantify wild-type recombinant huHGF (WT rhuHGF), single chain and protease substitution variants. Microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) were coated with 10 mg/ml of a monoclonal anti-rhuHGF antibody A 3.1.2 (IgG2a phenotype, affinity: 3.2\ufffd10-8 mol) in 50 mM Carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4\ufffd C. After blocking plates with 0.5% BSA (Sigma), 0.01% thimerosal in PBS, pH 7.4, and subsequent washes, duplicate serial dilutions of HGF samples were prepared and in parallel a CHO-expressed rhuHGF (40-0.1 ng/mL) was used as a standard. Fifty microliters of these dilutions were simultaneously incubated with 50 mL of a 1:1500 diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated monoclonal anti-rhuHGF antibody B 4.3 (IgGl phenotype, affinity: 1.3\ufffd10-8 mol) for 2 h at RT. The substrate was prepared by adding 0.04% o-phenylenediamine-dihydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.012% (v/v) hydrogen-peroxide (Sigma) to PBS and 100 ml were added to the washed plates for 15 minutes at RT. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mL of 2.25M sulfuric acid to each well. The absorbance at 490 nm, with the absorbance at 405 nm subtracted as background, was determined on a microtiter plate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.). The data was reduced using a four-parameter curve-fitting program developed at Genentech, Inc., 104228=The biological activity of WT huHGF and variants was measured by their abilities to induce DNA synthesis of rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Hepatocytes were isolated according to published perfusion techniques with minor modifications [Garrison and Haynes, J. Biol, Chem. 150, 2269-277 (1975)]. Briefly, the livers of female Sprague Dawley rats (160-180 g) were perfused through the portal vein with 100 mL of Ca++ free Hepes buffered saline containing 0.02% Collagenase type IV (Sigma). After 20 minutes the liver was removed, placed in buffer, gently stirred to separate hepatocytes from connective tissue and blood vessels, and filtered through nylon mesh. Cells were then washed by centrifugation, resuspended at 1\ufffd105 cells/mL in Williams Media E (Gibco) containing Penicillin (100 U/ml), Streptomycin (100 mg/mL), L-Glutamine (2 mM), trace elements (0.01%), transfertin (10 mg/mL) and Aprotinin (1 mg/mL). Hepatocytes were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon) in the presence of duplicate serial dilutions of either purified CHO-expressed rhuHGF (1-0.031 mg/mL), 293 supernatants (1:4-1:256) or medium. After 48 hours incubation at 37\ufffd C., 0.5 mCi 3H-TdR (15 Ci/mmole, Amersham) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 16 hours. Cells were harvested on filter papers, which were washed, dried and counted in a Beckman counter after addition of scintillation liquid. For each huHGF variant, the specific activity (SA) expressed in units/mg was calculated at half-maximal proliferation (defined as 1 unit/mL) using the HGF concentration obtained in ELISA., 75171=Chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosydes to the HGF variants of the present invention may also be used to modify or increase the number or profile of carbohydrate substituents. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the polypeptide that is capable of O-linked (or N-linked) glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free hydroxyl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 (published 11 Sep. 1987), and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981)., 72088=If prokaryotic cells or cells that contain substantial cell wall constructions are used, the preferred method of transfection is calcium treatment using calcium as described by Cohen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 69:2110 (1972), or more recently electroporation., 26397=The levels of HGF increase in the plasma of patients with hepatic failure (Gohda et al., supra) and in the plasma [Lindroos et al., Hepatol. 13, 734-750 (1991)] or serum [Asami et al,, J. Biochem. 109, 8-13 (1991)] of animals with experimentally induced liver damage. The kinetics of this response is rapid, and precedes the first round of DNA synthesis during liver regeneration suggesting that HGF may play a key role in initiating this process. More recently, HGF has been shown to be a mitogen for a variety of cell types including melanocytes, renal tubular cells, keratinocytes, certain endothelial cells and cells of epithelial origin [Matsumoto et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 176, 45-51 (1991); Igawa et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 174, 831-838 (1991); Han et al., Biochem. 30, 9768-9780 (1991); Rubin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 415-419 (1991)]. Interestingly, HGF can also act as a \"scatter factor\", an activity that promotes the dissociation of epithelial and vascular endothelial cells in vitro [Stoker et al., Nature 327, 239-242 (1987); Weidner et al., J. Cell Biol. 111, 2097-2108 (1990); Naldini et al., EMBO J. 10, 2867-2878 (1991)]. Moreover, HGF has recently been described as an epithelial morphogen [Montesano et al., Cell 67, 901-908 (1991)]. Therefore, HGF has been postulated to be important in tumor invasion and in embryonic development. Chronic c-Met/HGF receptor activation has been observed in certain malignancies [Cooper et al., EMBO J. 5, 2623 (1986); Giordano et al., Nature 339, 155 (1989)]., 85427=The compounds of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the HGF product is combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., 1980, Mack Publishing Co., edited by Oslo et al. These compositions will typically contain an effective amount of the HGF variant, for example, from on the order of about 0.5 to about 10 mg/ml, together with a suitable amount of carrier to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable compositions suitable for effective administration to the patient. The variants may be administered parenterally or by other methods that ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form., 67061=PCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making the HGF variants of the present invention, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 issued 28 Jul. 1987 and in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, Volume 2, Chapter 15, 1991. While the following discussion refers to DNA, it is understood that the technique also find application with RNA. The PCR technique generally refers to the following procedure. When small amounts of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers that differ slightly in sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template sequence only at the positions where the primers differ from the template. For introduction of a mutation into a plasmid DNA, one of the primers is designed to overlap the position of the mutation and to contain the mutation; the sequence of the other primer must be identical to a stretch of sequence of the opposite strand of the plasmid, but this sequence can be located anywhere along the plasmid DNA. It is preferred, however, that the sequence of the second primer is located within 200 nucleotides from that of the first, such that in the end the entire amplified region of DNA bounded by the primers can be easily sequenced. PCR amplification using a primer pair like the one just described results in a population of DNA fragments that differ at the position of the mutation specified by the primer, and possibly at other positions, as template copying is somewhat error-prone. If the ratio of template to product material is extremely low, the vast majority of product DNA fragments incorporate the desired mutation(s). This product material is used to replace the corresponding region in the plasmid that served as PCR template using standard DNA technology. Mutations at separate positions can be introduced simultaneously by either using a mutant second primer or performing a second PCR with different mutant primers and ligating the two resulting PCR fragments simultaneously to the vector fragment in a three (or more)-part ligation., 116363=Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on the HGF receptor \u03b2-subunit by HGF was previously reported [Bottaro et al., Science 251, 802-804 (1991), Naldini et al., 1991 supra]. The present data show that variants R494E and Y673S, V692S can bind the soluble HGF receptor: IgG protein in vitro but are not efficient in stimulating tyrosine-phosphorylation in A549 cells. One interpretation of this result is that these variants are capable of binding the HGF receptor on A549 cells, but are defective in a function required to induce efficient phosphorylation, e.g. receptor dimerization. It has been shown for other receptor proteins with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase such as the epithelial and platelet-derived growth factor that receptor-receptor interactions or dimerization is required for activation of kinase function [see for review Ulrich and Schlessinger, Cell 61 203-212 (1990)]. Alternatively, these variants may not be able to bind the cell-surface associated HGF receptor., 21176=HGF was identified initially as a mitogen for hepatocytes [Michalopoulos et al., Cancer Res. 44, 4414-4419 (1984); Russel et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 119, 183-192 (1984) and Nakamura et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 122:1450-1459 (1984)]. Nakamura et al., Supra reported the purification of HGF from the serum of partially hepatectomized rats. Subsequently, HGF was purified from rat platelets, and its subunit structure was determined [Nakamura et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 83, 6489-6493 (1986); and Nakamura et al., FEBS Letters 224, 311-316 (1987)]. The purification of human HGF (huHGF) from human plasma was first described by Gohda et al., J. Clin. Invest. 81, 414-419 (1988)., 55698=Immunoglobulins (Ig) and certain variants thereof are known and many have been prepared in recombinant cell culture. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,055; EP 256,654; Faulkner et al., Nature 298:286 (1982); EP 120,694; EP 125,023; Morrison, J. Immun. 123:793 (1979); Kohler et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77:2197 (1980); Raso et al., Cancer Res. 41:2073 (1981); Morrison et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2:239 (1984); Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Morrison et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:6851 (1984); EP 255,694; EP 266,663; and WO 88/03559. Reassorted immunoglobulin chains also are known. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,878; WO 88/03565; and EP 68,763 and references cited therein. The immunoglobulin moiety in the chimeras of the present invention may be obtained from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 subtypes, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM, but preferably IgG1 or IgG3., 100412=Conditions for plating libraries, and for hybridization and washing filters were as described [Godowski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 8083-8087 (1989)]. PCR was used to isolate a cDNA clone containing residues 271-808 of the HGFr (c-met) from A549 cells. Ten \u03bcgs of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using a primer specific to the HGFr (5'-TAGTACTAGCACTATGATGTCT-3') (SEQ. ID. NO: 18) in a 100 \u03bcl reaction using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and buffers supplied by Bethesda Research Laboratories. One-tenth of this reaction mixture was used for PCR amplification. The PCR reaction was performed in a volume of 100 \u03bcl containing 10 \u03bcl of the reverse transcriptase reaction, 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mM (NH4)SO4, 6 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Trition X-100, 1 U of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 50 pmol each of the forward primer (5'-TTTACTTCTTGACGGTCCAAAG-3' (SEQ. ID. NO: 19) and the reverse primer (5'-CAGGGGGAGTTGCAGATTCAGCTGT-3') (SEQ. ID. NO: 20). After thirty cycles of denaturation (95\ufffd C., 1 min), annealing (55\ufffd C., 45 secs) and extension (72\ufffd C., 2 min), the PCR product were recovered from low-melting temperature agarose gels. The full-length HGFr cDNA was subcloned into vector pRK7 (see WO 90/02798, published 22 Mar. 1990) and double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide method., 71899=If yeast are used as the host, transfection is generally accomplished using polyethylene glycol, as taught by Hinnen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 75:1929-1933 (1978)., 86625=Dosages and desired drug concentrations of pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. A typical effective dose in rat experiments is about 250 \u03bcg/kg administered as an intravenous bolus injection. Interspecies scaling of dosages can be performed in a manner known in the art, e.g. as disclosed in Mordenti et al., Pharmaceut. Res. 8, 1351 (1991) and in the references cited therein., 89061=Mammalian expression plasmid pRK 5.1 with a CMV promotor (Genentech, Inc.) was used for mutagenesis of huHGF allowing secretion of the HGF variants in the culture medium and directly assayed for biological activity and binding. This expression vector is a derivative of pRK5, the construction of which is disclosed in EP 307,247 published 15 Mar. 1989. The nucleotide sequence encoding the pRK 5.1 vector is shown in FIG. 5 (SEQ. ID. NO: 1)., 103011=The binding assay was performed in breakable microtiter plates (Nunc) coated o/n at 4\ufffd C. with 1 mg/mL of rabbit-anti-human IgG Fc specific antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and plates were carefully washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Biorad). After blocking with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, in this same buffer, 50 pM of 125I-rhuHGF in 25 mL per well were added. To each well 50 mL of serial dilutions (1:25-1:6000) of cell supernatants, purified CHO-expressed rhuHGF (25,000-0.064 DM) or medium were added in duplicates. Subsequently, 25 mL of 50 pM of HGF receptor:IgG fusion protein were added and the plates were incubated with gentle shaking. After 4 hours, when equilibrium was reached, plates were washed and wells were individually counted in a gamma-counter. The amount of nonspecifically bound radioactivity was estimated by incubating HGF receptor:IgG with a 500-fold excess of unlabelled rhuHGF. The dissociation constant (Kd) of each analoque was calculated at the IC50 from fitted inhibition curves essentially as described (DeBlasi et al., 1989 [?]) using the huHGF concentration determined by ELISA., 35395=FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of huHGF. Shown in the a-chain are the signal sequence (boxed region) which encompasses amino acids 131, the predicted finger and four Kringle domains, each with their respective three disulfide bonds. The cleavage site for generation of the heterodimeric \u03b1/\u03b2 form of huHGF immediately follows the P1 cleavage residue R494. This last residue has been specifically substituted with either E, D or A to generate HGF single-chain variants. The \u03b2-chain, which follows the cleavage site, contains homology to serine proteases. It is proposed that the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains are held together by a unique disulfide-bridge between C487 (\u03b1) and C604 (\u03b2) (Nakamura et al., 1989, supra). Three residues within the \u03b2-chain have been substituted individually or in combination to reconstitute the authentic residues of a serine-protease. Schematic representations of the mature forms of the C-terminal truncation variants are depicted below: N-207, deleted after the first Kringle; N-303, deleted after the second Kringle; N-384, deleted after the third Kringle and the a-chain. Also shown are the variants where deletions of each of the Kringles (\u0394K1, \u0394K2, \u0394K3 and \u0394K4) were introduced. In each case, the deletions specifically remove the entire Kringle from C1 to C6., 98816=Previous studies on HGF binding to hepatocytes have shown that huHGF could bind to its cell surface receptor with high affinity (Kd\u02dc24-32 pM; Higuchi and Nakamura, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 174, 831-838 (1991)). We preferred to examine HGF binding using a soluble form of the receptor because of the nonspecific binding of HGF to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans [Naldini et al., EMBO J. 10, 2867-2878 (1991)].}",
