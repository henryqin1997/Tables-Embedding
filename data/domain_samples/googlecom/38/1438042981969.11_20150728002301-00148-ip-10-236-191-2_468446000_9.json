The twenty-five active stages 28, 38\u2032 are sandwiched between the pair of outer GaInAs layers. The outer GaInAs layers having n-type dopant densities of about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123. The outer GaInAs layer closest to the InP substrate is about 400 nm thick, and the outer GaInAs layer farthest from the InP substrate is about 220 nm thick. The various layers of the optical core layer are grown over the InP substrate by molecular beam epitaxy processes known to those of skill in the art., 45064=The two optical cladding layers 54, 55 have lower refractive indexes than the active optical core layer 52. The lower cladding layer 55 is the InP substrate itself. The upper cladding layer 55 includes two Al0.48In0.52As layers. Each of these AlInAs layers is about 1.2 \u03bcm thick each. The two AlInAs layers of the upper cladding layer have n-dopant densities of about 1\ufffd1017 cm\u22123 and about 2\ufffd1017 cm\u22123, respectfully., 25301=This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/273,179, filed Mar. 2, 2001., 43024=An exemplary embodiment of QC laser 50 uses Gallium (Ga) Indium (In) Arsenide (As)/Aluminum (Al) Indium Arsenide-type superlattice structures for active layers 32, 32\u2032 and injector layers 34, 34\u2032. The superlattices are formed by alternating layers of Ga0.47In0.53As and layers of Al0.48In0.52As. In the active layers 32, 32\u2032, the alternating layers of the superlattice have the following sequence of thicknesses: 2/3.7/1/4.1/1/4.6/1/4.6/1/4.6/1/4.6/1/4.5/1/4.3. In the injector layers 34, 34\u2032, the alternating layers of the superlattice have the following sequence of thicknesses: 4.0/9/3.9/9/3.9/1.1/3.7/1.5/3.3/1.9/2.9/2.1/2.7/2.6/2.2/3.0/1.8/3.3. In each sequence, numbers provide layer thicknesses in nanometers, and AlInAs layers and GaInAs layers are bolded and unbolded, respectively. In the active layers 32, 32\u2032, the superlattices are undoped. In the superlattices of the injector layers 34, 34\u2032, some GaInAs and AlInAs layers are n-type doped to a dopant density of about 1\ufffd1018 per centimeter (cm) cubed. Underlining indicates the n-type-doped superlattice layers in the above sequence., 45601=Some embodiments of the QC laser also include a top layer 57 of Ga0.47In0.53As. This top layer 57 is about 500 nm thick and has an n-type dopant density of about 7\ufffd1018 cm\u22123. The top layer 57 provides plasmon-enhanced optical confinement for light that is propagating in the optical waveguide.}",

FIG. 8 illustrates a process 70 for operating a QC laser having the optical gain medium 30 of FIG. 2, e.g., QC laser 50 of FIG. 3. The process 60 includes applying a pumping voltage, Vp, across the optical gain medium 30 to transport carriers of charge, q, from one active layer 32 to an adjacent active layer 32\u2032 (step 72). The applied pumping voltage, Vp, produces a per stage voltage drop, Vps, that satisfies qVps>\u0394lm+Emg. The process 70 includes optically stimulating carriers in the active layer 32\u2032 to make inter-miniband transitions with emission of photons with an average energy, Eep, that satisfies Eep<qVps\u2212\u0394lm, i.e., Eep=Emg (step 72). The intra-miniband transitions are to lower minibands 38 in the same active layer 32\u2032 to which the charge carriers were transported. Here, qVps\u2212\u0394lm\u2212Eep is more than the line width, i.e., in energy units, for the light produced by stimulated emission in the gain medium 30. Preferably, Eep is smaller than qVps\u2212\u0394lm by 3-5 or more times the average thermal energy of the carriers in the upper miniband 36 of the active layers 32\u2032.
