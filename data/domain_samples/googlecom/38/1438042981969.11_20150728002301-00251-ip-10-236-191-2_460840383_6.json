In the map data, data pertaining to roads is stored as sets of coordinates representing vertices (nodes) in terms of longitude and latitude. Each road is defined by two or more nodes connected to each other; a connection of two nodes is called a \"link\". The map data is (1) a road layer for map matching and route search, including a road list, a node table, an intersection forming node list and an intersection network list, (2) a background layer for displaying roads, buildings, facilities, parks, rivers and so on in map pictures, and (3) a letter/symbol layer for displaying letters representing names of entities such as cities, towns and villages, roads, intersections, and buildings as well as map symbols.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations This disclosure is illustrative and not limiting; further modifications will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of this disclosure, and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. In particular, in a case where a guide route is searched for by inputting traffic information from the ATIS or the like, a guide route search is performed by avoiding roads under traffic control and congested roads. It is therefore possible to reach the desired destination in the shortest time by driving along the guide route set by the navigation apparatus. Further, if a parking area is searched for as a destination, pertinent parking availability information is input from the above-described traffic information, thus making it possible to search out a parking area where space is available. According to the present invention, as described above, if the vehicle is within a certain range of a destination and if it then travels out of the range of the destination without stopping within the range longer than a certain time, this destination is canceled and another destination in the same category of places is then automatically searched for. In this manner, a guide route to another destination in the same category of places can be indicated even if the user's original purpose cannot be achieved, e.g. because the guide destination store is closed or for other reasons, thereby eliminating the need for the",
