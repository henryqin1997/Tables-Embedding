This patent discloses an elaborate swimming suit which includes a mouthpiece with tubes leading around the wearer's neck. In the preferred embodiment such as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, two snorkel tubes are employed and the snorkel tubes 104 join at the mouthpiece 106 and at the blow hole 56. A major difference here is that the snorkel tubes project around and behind the wearer's neck and would not be practical for the purposes of exercise swimming since the tubes would soon fill up with water., 30116=5. U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 228,476 issued to Ferguson et al. in 1973 for \"Combined Oxygen Mask And Holder\". This patent discloses a mouthpiece with tubing attached to a source of oxygen., 30334=6. U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 215,982 issued to Abraham et al. in 1969 for \"Disposable Anesthetist'Kit\". This patent discloses a mask with tubing attached thereto which also extends to a source of gas., 28873=4. U.S. Pat. No. 2,693,180 issued to Galeazzi in 1954 for \"Exhalation Valve For Diving Suits\". This patent merely discloses a specialized valve to be used with diving suits., 29768=3. U.S. Pat. No.2,868,196 issued to Stampe in 1959 for \"Dust Filter Mask\". This patent discloses a mask which has a filter tubing attached to it., 29183=1. U.S. Pat. No. 2,376,871 issued to Fink in 1945 for \"Respirator Mask\". This patent also discloses a mask (rather than a mouthpiece) with tubes leading from the mask to a single passageway. A key difference is that air is going into the mask (from a supply of oxygen) and the structure is impractical for swimming., 28538=3. U.S. Pat. No. 183,521 issued to Weck in 1876 for \"Life Preserving And Swimming Suits\". In this invention, a mask C' covers the face and a pair of very cumbersome flexible pipes d' extend rearwardly from the mask and at least one attaches to a drum D. The device is extremely cumbersome and impractical., 29943=4. U.S. Pat. No. 2,859,747 issued to Stampe in 1954 for \"Dust Respirator\". This patent discloses a mask which has filter tubing attached to it., 28298=2. U.S. Pat. No. 2,581,007 issued to Douglas et al. in 1952 for \"Swimming Helmet\". In this patent, the swimming helmet also has tubes which extend along the side of the neck and could easily fill up with water., 30782=8. U.S. Pat. Design Pat. Des. 120,372 issued to Boothby et al. in 1939 for \"Nasal Mask\". This patent discloses a mask with a pair of downwardly extending passageways and which then come together into a single passageway., 30564=7. U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 171,482 issued to Bickel in 1953 for \"Respirator\". This patent discloses a respirator with short tube passages extending sidewardly from the breathing portion., 29528=2. U.S. Pat. No. 3,315,672 issued to Cunningham et al. in 1967 for \"Surgical Mask\". This patent discloses a shield 12 molded to the usual contour of the face, and to which is attached an air exhaust conduit 16.}",

However, such detailed description is not intended in any way to limit the broad features or principles of the invention, or the scope of patent monopoly to be granted. Of course the invention is not intended to be restricted to any particular form or arrangement, or any specific embodiment discloses herein, or any specific use, since the same may be modified in various particular or relations without departing from the spirit of the claimed invention hereinabove shown and described of which the apparatus shown is intended only for illustration and for disclosure of an operative embodiment and not to show all of the various forms or modification in which the invention might be embodied or operated. Either embodiment of the exercise snorkel apparatus can be made of any multiplicity of materials. For example, the exercise snorkel apparatus can be made of plastic or from flexible rubber. Another alternative feature which adds extra security for the fit on the alternative embodiment 110 is to attach the straps from goggles 190 to the respective elongated hollow sections 130 and 140, as also illustrated in FIG. 10. The goggles attachment assures a tighter fit of the exercise snorkel apparatus to the swimmer. While it makes most sense for this attachment in",
