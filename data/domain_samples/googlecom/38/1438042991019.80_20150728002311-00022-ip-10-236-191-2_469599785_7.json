It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto, and their equivalents. While the adjustment of the phase of the clock signal VCO-CLK has been described herein as being effected by the adjustment of the magnitude of the control signal VCO-CS, other means are known in the art for effecting such phase adjustment of a clock signal and the present invention can be successfully practiced with such other means. While embodiments have been illustrated and described for the recovery of data from two-conductor transmission lines, the present invention is readily applicable to the recovery of data received on other forms of transmission paths such as radio propagation paths or paths in an integrated or optical circuit. While a particular construction of a phase comparator circuit",
