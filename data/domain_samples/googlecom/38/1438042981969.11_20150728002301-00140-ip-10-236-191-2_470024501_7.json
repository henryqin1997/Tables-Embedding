CI/MS (m/e) 610 (M+H) for C33 H37 Cl2 N3 O4., 22696=Asthma is a particular condition which may be treated with tachykinin antagonists. In experimental studies, sensory neuropeptides, especially tachykinins such as substance P and neurokinin A, can bring about many of the pathophysiological features of asthma. Neurokinin A produces contraction of airway smooth muscle and increases airway responsiveness to other bronchoconstrictive stimuli. Although also contributing to bronchoconstriction in some species, substance P is more potent in its ability to cause mucus secretion, microvascular leakage and vasodilation. Both tachykinins, substance P and neurokinin A, have been implicated in modulation of immune cells including mast cells, T lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils. The effectiveness of the combined NK1 +NK2 receptor antagonist, FK 224, has been demonstrated in asthmatic patients undergoing bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction by Ichinose et al.

Pharmaceutical Sci., 61, 1316-1317 (1972)., 425433=In vivo experiments were performed using male Duncan Hartley guinea pigs (250-350 g). Changes in conscious breathing patterns were monitored in four animals simultaneously using modified whole body plethysmography consisting of four small plexiglass boxes each connected to a reference box via Validyne DP 45-16 differential pressure transducers. The 4 boxes were equipped with an air supply line (also used for aerosol delivery) and an exhaust air line. Supply and exhaust lines were of the same length and narrow bore and arose from a common supply chamber and vented to a common exhaust chamber. This system was used to ensure that fluctuations in supply air and atmospheric pressure would remain in phase and be eliminated from the net signal by the differential pressure transducers. The analog pressure signals were digitalized via a Data Translation DT2821 A to D board. Data were collected at a rate of 100 samples/second/animal. Each cycle of pressure change was analyzed using the following parameters: rising and falling slope determined between minimum and maximum pressures, the ratio of rising over falling slope, and the magnitude of the change between initial trough pressure and peak cycle pressure. Using these values (and observing the animals) the pressure cycles were characterized into normal breaths, forced exhalations (apparent by abdominal heaving), significant respiratory events (SREs; usually coughs, less often sneezes or gasps which were characterized by transient, extremely large pressure increases which were distinguishable from noise) and movement/noise with a PCAT 286 running a System V UNIX operating system. Dyspnea was defined as a significant, sustained increase in plethysmograph pressure which was associated with an observable shift to labored breathing in the animal., 238441=Combine (+)-3-(3,4-dichloro-phenyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-pyrrolidine (R,R)-di-p-anisoyltartaric acid salt (772.7 g, 1140 mmol) and acetone (5 L).
