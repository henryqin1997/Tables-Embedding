According to one embodiment, network 10 may operate according to a CDMA 2000 telecommunications technology that uses a single CDMA channel. As an example, a CDMA 2000 high rate data packet technology, such as the Evolution Data Only (EvDO) technology may be used., 26416=Wireless transmission systems may use transmit diversity, whereby transmission is made using a plurality of antennas to transmit the signal to a receiver. Typically, such transmit diversity systems are intended to increase network capacity and improve coverage by reducing signal degradation that may be caused by multipath and fading effects. References describing various aspects of transmit diversity include include UK Patent Application GB 2353437A, entitled Diversity transmission means with phase adjustment depending upon a feedback signal supplied to the transmitter by the receiver; US Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0002594, entitled Communication device with Smart antenna using a quality-indication signal; US Patent Application Serial No. 2005/0130597, entitled Adjusting a signal at a diversity system; US Patent Application Serial No. 2005/0164645, entitled Communicating signals according to a quality indicator using multiple antenna elements; and US Patent Application Serial No. 2006/0270359, entitled Determining a phase adjustment in accordance with power trends. There is a need for an improved algorithm for control of transmit diversity.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention. Embodiments of the invention may apply to any transmit diversity control method. It will be understood that the methods discussed herein may be integrated with any transmit diversity control algorithm. It will further be understood that the present invention may be implemented as a stand-alone processing module, or may be integrated into a transmit diversity control processor, algorithm, or signal path circuitry. It will be recognized that while the example above is based on relative phase, any transmit diversity parameter may be used, for example, relative amplitude, relative power, frequency of change, timing of application of the transmit diversity controls, or other parameters. It will thus be recognized that there may be alternating phases of implementation and application. Data may be collected in even-numbered designated windows and may be compared with data that may be collected in other even-numbered designated windows to generate, for example, a relative phase difference. Similarly, data may be collected in odd-numbered designated windows and may be compared with data that may be collected in other odd-numbered designated windows to generate,",
