    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6257=Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown an overall diagram of the HFC network. Other than the inventive concept, the elements of FIG. 1 are well known and as such will not be described in detail. The system comprises of a remote web server 105 connected to the Internet 110. An Internet gateway router 124, one embodiment of which is the Cisco GSR 12000, connects the central cable station 120 to the Internet 110. The central cable station 120 is connected to a primary optical fiber link 135 through an Optical transport platform 130, one embodiment of which is the Cisco ONS 15454. The primary optical fiber link 135 is further connected to a plurality of distribution hubs 140,141 through the optical transport platform 130. A cable modem termination system (CMTS) 150 in the distribution hub interfaces to the optical transport platform 130 through an ATM switch (not shown in FIG. 1). Customer premise equipment (CPE) consists of TV set-top boxes 180,185,189, Personal Computers (PC's) 184,187 Cable Modems 160,165,169. The TV set-top boxes and PC's are connected to the cable network through the Cable Modems. The CPE is housed in remote buildings (homes). The CMTS 150 is connected to Fiber Nodes 156,157 via a secondary optical fiber (Analog) 155. The Fiber Node 156 is further connected to the CPE in remote buildings through a coaxial cable 159.}",

On cable systems the content for VOD is encoded according to the various Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards. The latest standard known as MPEG-4 refers to ISO/IEC designated standard 14496, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Previous MPEG standards popular in use today are MPEG-1, referring to ISO/IEC designated standard 11172 and MPEG-2, referring to ISO/IEC designated standard 13818, both of these standards are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in connection with certain specific embodiments for instructional purposes, the present invention is not limited thereto. Accordingly, various modifications, adaptations, and combinations of various features of the described embodiments can be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. In accordance with another embodiment, IP multicasting is used as a broadcast mechanism to implement a data carousel of digital files. A rotating sequence of data files is IP multicast from a central cable station to a plurality of distribution hubs. There is one multicast stream flowing from the central cable station to each distribution hub such that multiple digital files are flowing in a rotating sequence in the stream to the distribution hub. A set-top box is coupled to the distribution hub via a coaxial portion of the cable network. In one aspect, a client agent in a set-top box joins the multicast stream being received at the local distribution hub such that the set-top box receives a digital file of the user's (user of the set-top box) preference. In a second aspect, the usage history of the user of the set-top box is analyzed to determine which of the digital files of the stream to receive such that a digital file the user is likely to want to access in the future will be stored beforehand in the hot",
