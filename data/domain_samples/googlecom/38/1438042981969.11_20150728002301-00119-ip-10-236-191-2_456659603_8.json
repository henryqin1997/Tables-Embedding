    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other variations may occur to those skilled in the art which are within the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Those of skill in the art may recognize modifications to these presently disclosed embodiments. These variation and modifications are meant to be covered by the spirit and scope of the present claims. Another regimen might include the use of a racemic albuteral together with ipratropium bromide to achieve selective adrenergic and anticholinergic therapeutic effects. This regime might then be comprised of Xopenex\ufffd Inhalation Solution which contains 0.63 mg of levalbuteral HC1 and Atrovent\ufffd Inhalation Solution which contains 500 mcg of ipratropium bromide, each nebulized. This regimen might be incorporated in the package of FIG. 1, where medication A schematically represents Xopenex\ufffd and medication B represents Atrovent\ufffd, and the instructions teach the regimen of using both three times a day. EXAMPLE 4 In the case of nebulizer solutions packaged in multiple-dose bottles, it is often required to use a second solution to properly prepare a solution for nebulization. The packaging of both solutions together is therefore considered. An example of such a package might include Proventil\ufffd Solution for Inhalation which contains albuterol 0.5% in a 20 ml amber glass bottle, and a second 120 ml bottle of sterile normal saline. Administration would typically consist of nebulization of 0.5 ml of albuterol and 3.0 ml of sterile normal saline together. This",
