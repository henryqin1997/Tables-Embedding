To perform a vein disrupting operation of the type discussed above in connection with the instrument 11, the physician moves the position control element 69b distally to drive the flexible member 19b, the position control element 91 and the flexible member 45 distally to an extended position in which the distal end 46 and the prongs 39b are out of the catheter body essentially as shown in FIG. 5. If the physician wishes to advance the distal end 46 proximally of the prongs 39, he may do so by moving the position control element 91 distally to the position shown in FIG. 13. Alternatively, the physician may retract the position control element 69b while leaving the position control element 91 in the position of FIG. 12. Accordingly, the instrument 11b provides for greater flexibility in positioning of the tool 21 and the distal end 46 but does not have the full preprogramming features of the instrument 11. FIG. 10 shows the position control elements 69b and 91 in their most proximal or retracted positions. Although the instrument 11b can be constructed to have this retracted position correspond to various different positions of the tool 21 and the distal",
