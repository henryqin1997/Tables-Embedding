    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58739=The components zi,n and zq,n of the equalized signal are respectively inputted via lines 53 and 55 to a data detection system 57 (FIG. 6D), a detailed description of which is provided in French Pat. No. 74 43560 filed by the present applicant Dec. 27, 1974 (publication No. 2,296,322). In system 57, components zi,n and zq,n are inputted to a phase rotation device 58 which causes the phase of the equalized signal to rotate by an angle equal to -\u0394\u03c6n, with \u0394\u03c6n being an estimated value of the phase error. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that the device 58 is a means of subtracting the value \u0394\u03c6n from the phase of signal zn. The components of the equalized signal after the phase thereof has been caused to rotate will be written zi,n ', and zq,n ', respectively. The phase rotation device 58 can be implemented by means of an arrangement relying upon the known relations:, 64965=The components \u0394a zi,n ' and \u0394a zq,n ' of the error signal \u03b5n, the components zi,n ' and zq,n ' of the input signal, and the components ai 2 and aq 2 of the selected point of constellation A are applied to the conversation device 69 via lines 67, 68, 70, 71, 72 and 73, respectively. The conversion device 69 supplies on line 74 a residual phase error \u03b4\u03c6n which is equal to the difference between the phase of the input signal and the phase of the selected point a2. Device 69 calculates the phase error \u03b4\u03c6n in accordance with the relation ##EQU12## For more details, reference should be made to French Pat. No. 74 43560 mentioned above. The residual phase error \u03b4\u03c6n is inputted via line 74 to the predictive phase filter 75 which provides an estimated phase error value derived from pervious residual phase errors. Such a predictive filter is described in detail in French Pat. No. 74 30001 filed by the present applicant Aug. 30, 1974 (publication no. 2,283.606) and in the aforementioned French Pat. No. 74 43560, both of which should be consulted. The estimated phase error value \u03b4\u03c6n supplied by the filter 75 is applied to the conversion device 76 which converts that value to cos \u0394\u03c6n and sin \u0394\u03c6n. Conventionally, the device 76 consists of a ROM in which the values of cos \u0394\u03c6n and sin \u0394\u03c6n are stored at the address corresponding to the value of \u0394\u03c6n. The values of cos \u0394\u03c6n and sin \u0394\u03c6n supplied by the device 76 are fed via lines 61 and 62 to phase rotation devices 58 and 83., 52280=A Hilbert transformer is a two-output device which supplies the in-phase and quadrature components of an input signal applied thereto. An exemplary digital embodiment of such a device is described in an article entitled \"Theory and Implementation of the Discrete Hilbert Transform,\" by L. R. Robiner and C. M. Rader, in Digital Signal Processing, IEEE Press, 1972. The in-phase and quadrature components of the input signal applied to the Hilbert transformer 23 are respectively resampled at the signaling rate 1/T by two sampling devices 24 and 25. A clock recovery device 26 has its input connected via a line 27 to the output of the analog-to-digital converter 22 and controls sampling devices 21, 24 and 25 via lines 28, 29 and 30 and all other components of the receiver via lines not shown. An example of such a clock recovery device is described in French Pat. No. 75 14020 filed by the present applicant Apr. 25, 1975 (publication No. 2,309,089). The in-phase and quadrature components respectively provided on the output lines 31 and 32 from sampling devices 24 and 25 ae demodulated in a demodulator 33 (FIG. 6B). Conventionally, the demodulator 33 includes two multipliers 34 and 35, each of which has a first input connected to the line 31, and two multipliers 36 and 37, each of which has a first input connected to the line 32. The second input of each of multipliers 34 and 36 receives an in-phase carrier, cos \u03c9c t, while the second input of each of multipliers 35 and 37 receives a quadrature carrier, sin \u03c9c t. The in-phase and quadrature carriers are supplied by a local source (not shown)., 55233=The in-phase and quadrature components of the demodulated signal are inputted via lines 39 and 41 to an adaptive complex transversal equalizer 2 (FIG. 6C). A detailed description of such an equalizer is provided in French Pat. No. 73 26404 filed by the present applicatn July 12, 1973 (publication No. 2,237,379).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that numerous changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will also understand that the error signal supplied by the auxiliary data detection device can be applied to the coefficient adjustment device 56, either directly or indirectly, depending upon the receiver arrangement being used. In FIG. 1, the output signal from the equalizer 2 is shown as being directly fed to the data detection device 4 and the auxiliary data detection device 11, whereas in FIG. 6 this signal is shown as being applied to devices 4 and 11 after the value \u0394\u03c6n has been subtracted from its phase. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that, in accordance with the present invention, it is essential that the same signal, designated input signal, be fed to both the data detection device and the auxiliary data detection device, and that said input signal may result from some processing of the output signal of the equalizer. The processing may consist, for example, in acting upon the phase of the output signal of the equalizer, as in the example illustrated in FIG. 6, or in performing a demodulation operation, as is done in some known receiver",
