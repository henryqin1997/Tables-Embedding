A discussion of boundary-scan logic can be found in the following publications: (1) IEEE standard 1149.1, entitled, \"IEEE Standard Test Access port and Boundary-Scan Architecture\", dated May 21, 1990; and (2) \"A Standard Test Bus and Boundary Scan Architecture\", by Lee Whetsel, TI Technical Journal, July-August 1988.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, variations and modifications of the present invention can be effected within the spirit and scope of the following claims. Thus, error processing software 36 is able to pinpoint the first error (i.e., the data parity error) in the system, even though the first error propagated to Node Bus A-1 and System Bus A and may have spawned other types of errors. Using this example, if a processor connected to System Bus B also read the same line, this would yield data parity errors being reported throughout the System Bus B hierarchy. The error precedence modules still allow error processing software 36 to properly identify the initial error and correctly identify the bad CPU Module on System Bus A. Without error precedence determining circuitry, the identification of the first error in system 10 would be complicated or impossible. Returning to step 118, if the first error in the current processor module 18snp is not internal or external, the method proceeds to step 124, in which the processor module counter p is incremented, and the method returns to step 110. Returning to steps 118 and 119, if the first error is external and the Node Bus saw the error first, the method proceeds to step 122 in which error precedence software 36 increments the processor module counter p and correlates error information with",
