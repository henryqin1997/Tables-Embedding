Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the present invention, will become apparent from the description of the present invention. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any modifications as fall within the true scope of the present invention. AND operation is also realized similarly. In this case, the circuit is constructed such that, when the input code word DI is logical 0, the logical 0 is written in a selected memory cell and, when it is 1, data stored in the selected memory cell is refreshed. A circuit construction therefor will be easily considered by those skilled in the art and, therefore, details thereof are omitted. As described hereinbefore, the operation circuit according to the present invention is based on the fact that a logical sum of the input code word DI and the output DC read out from the selected memory cell is, whenever such an operation will be performed, always logical 1 regardless of the logical value of the DC when DI is logical 1 and, on the other hand, it coincides with the logical value of the DC when the input code word DI is logical 0. That is, the present invention is based on the fact that it is",
