(Cl. 178-6) ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A pay television system having a transmitter which supplies one or more television signals and a plurality of 'interrogation signals individually coded to correspond to a single one of a plurality of receivers. In response to its unique interrogation signal each receiver sends back to the transmitter a signal indicative of the desire to receive a particular program. The transmitter compares these signals with their respective interrogation signals and for each correlation transmits a second signal to the corresponding receiver which permits reception of the desired progra-msignal. Each correlation is also recorded for billing purposes and the signals indicative of a desire to receive a program are accumulated in order to provide audience interest information. Alternative arrangements are also covered., 10490=To 29 5'? 3E 725T I A II A I AND.
