A higher resolution embodiment uses a 1280\ufffd1024 array to provide a pixel resolution of over 600,000., 39805=FIG. 2 shows a detailed schematic view of the phase plate and light valve assembly in accordance with the invention. In this embodiment, a lens array 82 is used to control the delivery of light onto a phase plate 86 that selectively diffracts the incident light 90 in a fixed pattern onto the pixel electrode array of light valve 88. Further details regarding the fabrication and use of diffractive optical elements or phase plates can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 08/565,098 filed on Nov. 30, 1995, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference., 22797=Existing light valve projection systems use several dichroic mirrors to separate light from a light source into three primary colors and to direct each of these primary colors through a separate light valve. These light valve systems use active matrix liquid crystal displays in which switching transistors are fabricated in polycrystalline silicon that has been deposited on glass. Attempts to fabricate small area high resolution displays using circuits fabricated on glass has met with limited success. Existing displays with a 640\ufffd480 pixel geometry, for example, have required displays with active areas in excess of 500 mm2. The optics and alignment mechanism necessary to separate the colors and combine the generated images where all three light valves are of this size has necessitated system volumes, including the light source and projection lens, in excess of 1000 cubic inches and typically weighs more than 18 pounds., 31200=A further preferred embodiment provides a pixel resolution of at least 800,000. Where each valve has a 1280\ufffd1024 array within an active area of less than 320 mm2 this resolution can be obtained. This can be achieved using the transferred thin film circuit processes described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,206,749, 5,256,562 and 5,317,436, the entire contents of which are all incorporated herein by reference. Circuits having pixel areas between 100 um2 and 1000 um2 can be fabricated using the processes described in the above referenced patents. These circuits have been used to fabricate liquid crystal displays in which the optical aperture of each pixel is approximately 40% geometrical transmission., 39493=Side metal plates are used to attach the light valves with brackets to the prism 22. The brackets for mounting light valve adjacent to surface is described in greater detail in U.S. Ser. No. 08/111,131 filed on Aug. 25, 1993, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 28869=Another preferred embodiment of the invention is adapted for use with high definition television having a rectangular format of 16\ufffd9 with an aspect ratio of about 1.8. Light valves having between a 960\ufffd540 array (at least 500,000 pixel electrodes) and a 1920\ufffd1080 array (at least 2,000,000 pixel electrodes) are suitable for use with this wide angle format.}",

Equivalents A preferred embodiment of a dual light valve system utilizes the circuit illustrated schematically in FIG. 10 in which cable 392 delivers video input signals 391 to a signal processing circuit 388. Circuit 388 and clock 390 control the delivery of images to first and second active matrix circuits 330,332. Each active matrix display has a row driver circuit 320,340 connected to a respective active matrix along row lines 398 and 386, as well as column driver circuits 318 and 322 connected to a respective active matrix along column liens 397 and 395. Illustrated in FIG. 9A is a preferred embodiment of a rear projection system 100 using the dual valve system previously described in connection with FIG. 1. A housing 106 encloses the light valve system 105 with projection optics that directs the image onto a mirror 107 which reflects the image along path 110 to mirror 104 and onto a rear projection view screen 108. FIG. 9B illustrates another embodiment of a rear projection system 213 in which 215, light valve system 217, projection optics 219 and mirror 222",
