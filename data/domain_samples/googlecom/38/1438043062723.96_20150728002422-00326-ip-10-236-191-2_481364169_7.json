These two circuits avoid the use of voltage source VSS2, any extra pads, and any floating p-wells other than the one containing the fuse or antifuse to be programmed. In FIGS. 6-7 and 8-9, voltage source VSS is supplied to p-well 2 through a second MOSFET such as p-channel MOSFET Q3 gated by programming signal P (the inverse of P) (FIG. 6) or n-channel MOSFET Q3 gated by P (FIG. 8). Thus, the MOSFET Q3 which supplies voltage source VSS is turned off during programming (application of pulse to blow the fuse), allowing the p-well containing the element to be programmed to float. The MOSFET Q3 is turned on at all other times in order to supply VSS. For a 250 Angstrom gate oxide process, a reasonable transistor on-resistance of about 2000 ohms can be obtained using an aspect ratio W/L of 13 (p-ch) or 4.5 (n-ch).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments. Various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example, as previously stated, adaptations of the schematics, sectional views and layouts of FIGS. 1-16 to n-well CMOS or bipolar technologies would be apparent to one skilled in the art. The extension to an n-channel MOS process which has been modified to include n-wells and p-channel transistors also would be apparent. FIGS. 16-17 show a similar programmable circuit utilizing the same concept, but not requiring the complete thyristor or SCR. This circuit may be used in a CMOS process or layout which has been specially designed so that the SCR cannot be turned on, such as a p-well process using an n-epitaxial layer on an n+ substrate which is directly contacted to voltage source VDD from the backside. Without the backside contact, the SCR can almost always operate, even in an epitaxial process. However, in this programmable circuit, a high current gain (usually well over 100 in common emitter mode) bipolar transistor 20 is used to supply the programming current to fuse F. P-channel MOSFET Q1, which is coupled to the base of bipolar transistor 20 and is responsive",
