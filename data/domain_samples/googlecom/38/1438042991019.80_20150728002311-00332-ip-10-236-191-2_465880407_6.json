That is, if they are subjected to a gradually increasing stress, the ratio of the unit stress to the unit strain or deformation, is constant until a certain limiting value of the unit stress, known as the proportional elastic limit, is reached, see, e.g., \u201cThe Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel\u201d 10th Edition, edited by William T. Lankford, Jr., Norman L. Samways, Robert F. Craven and Harold E. McGannon and Published by US Steel and the Association of Iron and Steel Engineers in 1985, the disclosure of pages 1389-1446 (Chapter 50) being incorporated herein by reference, see also the definition of Hooke's law in the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, published by McGraw-Hill Book Company in 1974 and edited by Daniel N. Lapedes (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference), which defines Hooke's Law as \u201cthe law that the stress of a solid is directly proportional to the strain applied to it, \u201celastic deformation\u201d as \u201creversible alteration of the form or dimensions of a solid body under stress or strain,\u201d and conversely \u201celastic failure\u201d as \u201cfailure of a body to recover its original size and shape after a stress is removed,\u201d \u201celasticity\u201d as \u201cthe property whereby a solid material changes its shape and size under action of opposing forces, but recovers its original configuration when the forces are removed,\u201d and \u201celastic limit\u201d as \u201cthe maximum stress a solid can sustain without undergoing permanent deformation.\u201d, 209152=An operating tool 2000 TR is used to impart rotational motion to the driver element 2010 and is shown in FIG. 69 as including a housing 2030 having a proximal end 2032 and a distal end 2034. Tool 2000 TR translates linear motion of handle 2036 into rotational movement of driver shaft 2038 which is operatively connected to driver tube 2012 which has a polygonal inside shape 2040 to match the polygonal shape of head 2002. Fasteners 2000 are located inside tube 2012 to have rotational motion imparted thereto., 208458=A tool element 2000 T suitable for use with rotational fastener 2000 is shown in FIG. 62. Tool element 2000 T can be used with any tool that imparts rotational motion thereto. Tool element 2000 T includes a rotation driver element 2010 which is connected to an element of the operating tool and is located inside a driver tube 2012 and is connected thereto to impart rotation thereto as indicated by arrow 2014. Driver tube 2006 fits over polygonal head 2002 to transfer this rotational motion to fastener 2000 which is located inside an extender tube 2016., 207637=As above discussed, the present invention also encompasses self-retaining fasteners, and shown in FIG. 61 is one embodiment of such a self-retaining fastener, and is a helical fastener 2000 which also fulfills the above-discussed criteria for fastening a prosthesis to a patient and does not experience permanent deformation during or after the cuff-attaching procedure described herein. Fastener 2000 includes a polygonal head 2002 and a central body 2004 with a helical element 2006 thereon. Element 2006 is in the nature of a screw thread, and upon rotating fastener 2000 in the manner of a screw, fastener 2000 acts like a self-tapping screw to force itself into and through a prosthesis and tissue to which the prosthesis is being attached., 213022=Yet another form of such non-permanently deformed fastener is shown in FIG. 64 as fastener 2000\u2033. Fastener 2000\u2033 includes a head 2000 H\u2032 having a knurled outer edge 2090 and to which a helical element 2092 is attached. Element 2092 has a penetrating point 2094 on the distal end thereof and regains its initial shape after completion of the surgical process because neither the process nor the tools used in the process applied sufficient stress to the fastener to exceed the elastic limit of the fastener., 195429=Surgical fasteners can be treated within their elastic limit. In this regard, elastic limit is defined in standard references, such as \u201cMechanics of Materials\u201d by Seibert Fairman and Chester S. Cutshall, published by John Wiley & Sons in 1953, the disclosure of Chapters 1 and 2, pages 1-32, being incorporated by reference, as the maximum stress that may be applied without producing a permanent set. Such fasteners will be referred to herein as elastic fasteners. With elastic fasteners, no permanent set occurs until after the proportional limit is reached, and the ratio of stress to corresponding strain for stress below the proportional limit is defined by ASTM as the modulus of elasticity., 205977=A tool element 1000 T is shown in FIGS. 58-60 and is used to place and set fasteners 1000. Tool element 1000 T is used with a tool that imparts longitudinal movement thereto. Any tool discussed above can be adapted to impart such longitudinal motion in a minimally invasive surgery environment. Referring to FIG. 58, tool element 1000 T includes a fastener track 1010 supported on a tip retractor 1012 and having a cover 1014 thereon. Fasteners 1000 are stored in track 1010 and move downwardly in the track 1010 under influence of either a spring-loaded pusher bar or advancing mechanism associated with the operating tool. After the fastener reaches the end of the track, it drops off of the track as can be seen in FIG. 59, and onto two extender pins 1016 and 1018, best shown in FIG. 60. A hold-down spring 1020 keeps the fastener properly oriented. Hold down-spring 1020 also moves a fastener off the track into position to be opened against pins 1016 and 1018. A retractor back up element 1022 is moved by the longitudinally moving tool and forces the fastener against the pins 1020 to open the legs into the position shown for fastener 1000\u2032. Once the fastener is forced through the prosthesis and tissue, the tool element 1000 T is twisted to withdraw it from the fastener. As soon as tool element 1000 T is withdrawn, legs 1002 and 1004 move toward the overlapping position and cinch tissue and prosthesis together., 209796=Handle 2036 moves in direction 2042 relative to stationary handle portion 2044 about a pivot axis 2046 so end 2048 of handle 2036 moves in direction 2050. End 2048 includes an elongated slot 2052 in which a pin 2054 is located. Pin 2054 is mounted on a follower sleeve 2056. Sleeve 2056 is constrained so sleeve 2056 moves linearly in direction 2058 when handle 2036 is moved in direction 2042. A second pin 2060 is mounted on sleeve 2056 and moves therewith. Sleeve 2060 is located around a driver element 2062 having a helical groove 2064 defined therein to receive pin 2060. Driver element 2062 is rotatably mounted in housing 2030 by mounts 2066 and flange 2068 so it can rotate but not translate under the influence of pin 2060 in groove 2064. Rotation of driver element 2062 is indicated by arrow 2070., 196942=As mentioned above and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,370, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, the first type of fastener uses an installation tool which imparts a force on the fastener causing it to exceed its elastic limit during application thereby physically changing the actual shape and size, and thus is a \u201ctool formed\u201d fastener. The definition of \u201celastic limit\u201d in the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, published by the McGraw-Hill Book Company in 1974 and edited by Daniel N. Lapedes (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) is \u201cthe maximum stress a solid can sustain without undergoing permanent deformation.\u201d Thus, from the foregoing, it can be understood that for materials such as the fasteners of the present disclosure, which obey Hooke's Law, which is \u201cthe stress of a solid is directly proportional to the strain applied to it,\u201d permanent physical changes resulting from stressing the fasteners will disappear when the stress is removed providing the stress does not exceed the proportional elastic limit. After this limit is exceeded resulting strain does not entirely disappear when the stress is removed. The part of the strain that remains is called the permanent set. A surgical staple an example of a fastener that surpasses its elastic limits and deforms during the attachment of a prosthesis to an annulus., 201039=With regard to tool-formed fasteners, in order to set a tool-formed fastener to hold a cuff on a patient, a fastener such as a staple is stressed by a tool and anvil combination beyond the elastic limit of the fastener whereby once the forming force (the external stress) is removed the fastener will not regain its original shape and will be permanently deformed. Elastic limits for most materials, including those used in the fasteners of the present invention, are well documented in standard references, such as in Table X of the above-referenced \u201cMechanics of Materials,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, as well standard handbooks such as \u201cMarks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers\u201d Seventh Edition Edited by Theodore Baumeister and published by McGraw-Hill Book Company in 1967, Chapter 5, the disclosure of Chapter 5 being incorporated herein by reference, as well as the incorporated US Steel Book. By way of example, the US Steel book discloses the mechanical properties of stainless steel on pages 1345-1355, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, including the yield strength thereof (see Table 47), see also the incorporated Mechanical Engineers Handbook, Table 19 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) while the mechanical properties of Titanium are disclosed in the incorporated Mechanical Engineers Handbook (see Table 21 on page 6-101), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Still further, the incorporated \u201cMechanics of Materials\u201d reference includes typical stress-strain diagrams for steel in FIGS. 26 and 27 on page 25, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, that show the proportional limits and illustrate Hooke's law., 204764=As shown in FIG. 57, a pre-stressed fastener 1000 is shown in its initial shape and is monolithic and includes two legs 1002 and 1004 which overlap each other adjacent to tissue penetrating points 1006 and 1008 respectively. In a free condition, the legs overlap each other as shown in FIG. 57. Fastener 1000 is used by storing it in the free condition such as shown in FIG. 57, then spreading the legs apart as indicated in FIG. 58 by fastener 1000\u2032 before placing and inserting the fastener into and through the prosthesis and tissue to be connected. The legs are held apart until the fastener has been placed, and then the legs are released. The procedure does not exceed the elastic limit of the fastener and thus the natural resiliency of the fastener causes the legs to regain the FIG. 57 initial overlapping orientation thereby cinching the prosthesis and tissue together. Fastener 1000 is formed of highly elastic material, such as nitinol or stainless steel spring wire, or the like having a shape memory and is not deformed beyond its elastic limit by either the tool or the procedure used to attach a cuff to a patient., 215540=A further form of non-permanently deformed fastener 2000\u2032\u2033 is shown in FIG. 66 as fastener 2000 IV which includes a circular base 2140 having a base 2102 on one side and a post 2142 on the other side. Base 2102 has a point 2104 on one end and antibackup barbs 2106 adjacent to the point as discussed above for fastener 2000\u2032\u2033. Post 2142 is attached to base 2140 by a one-way crimp 2144 and has a removable portion 2146 connected to the base by a frangible joint 2148. Fastener 2000 IV is used in the manner of fastener 2000\u2032\u2033, is not stressed beyond its elastic limit during or by the process and thus the use and operation thereof will not be discussed. Removable portion 2146 is used to place and set the fastener, and is then removed once the fastener is set. A tool driver is connected to portion 2146 in the manner of element 2000 T\u2032\u2033., 211363=Using tool 2000 TR in connection with tool element 2000 T, fasteners are deployed in the center of the rotating tube. The rotating tube has a distal end which has a jaw assembly to hold the fasten which will extend from the end of the instrument as it is driven into the prosthesis and tissue. In addition, there is an indexing mechanism which advances one fastener at a time into the driving jaw assembly. Rotational mechanisms in the housing then rotate both the storage tube and the jaw assembly upon actuation of the handle as above described. The helix essentially screws its way into the tissue. Once the tissue bunches up against the head of the fastener, it compresses the tissue to the prosthesis thereby creating a seal. Other fastener forms can also be used without departing from the scope of this disclosure which use a load bearing surface and tissue gathering means and which are not permanently deformed by or during the cuff-attaching process so they will regain their initial shape and/or size after completion process. By this, it is meant that there are essentially two components of such a fastener, a crown surface which stays on the outside of the object to be fastened and the fastening mechanism or extension legs which penetrate through the fastening media into the tissue to grip the tissue. Yet another form of this non-permanently deformed helical fastener is shown in FIG. 63 as fastener 2000\u2032 having a polygonal head 2000 H and a helical body 2080 attached at one end thereof thereto and having a point 2082 at the other end thereof., 213608=Yet another fastener which is not permanently deformed by or during the process involving the fastener is shown in FIG. 65 as barbed fastener 2000\u2032\u2033 which includes a head 2100 to which a central base 2102 is attached. Base 2012 has a pointed end 2104 and anti-back up barbs 2106 mounted thereon. Barbs 2106 extend in a direction opposite to point 2104 so once the fastener is set, the barbs will prevent it from moving in an opposite direction. A centrally located hole 2110 receives a point 2104 of an adjacent fastener so the fasteners can be stored as indicated in FIG. 67 in a delivery tool element 2000 T\u2032\u2033. Tool element 2000 T\u2032\u2033 is shown in FIGS. 67 and 68 as including a housing 2112 having a proximal end 2114 and a distal end 2116. Slots 2118 and 2120 are defined in end 2114 to slidably receive an advance bar 2122 that is moved longitudinally by a tool operating element that imparts such longitudinal movement in a minimally invasive surgical setting. Bar 2122 abuttingly contacts an antibackup ratchet 2124 on which fasteners 2000\u2032\u2033 are releasably mounted. Fastener advance ratchets 2126 are oriented in the manner of barbs 2106 to allow a fastener to move past the ratchet but to prevent reverse movement of such fastener. Bar 2122 is forced downwardly into housing 2112 in direction 2123 and forces the fasteners to exit end 2116 between arms 2128 and 2130. Fasteners slide over the arms and when set in the tissue or in the prosthesis, or both, the arms prevent the fastener from moving backwards in direction 2123\u2032. The tool element is then withdrawn and the fastener remains in place. An antibackup post 2132 is also mounted on housing 2112., 210841=Driver element 2062 is operatively connected to shaft 2038 by one-way pawl mechanisms 2072 and 2074 so rotation in the desired direction is transmitted. Pawl mechanism 2074 transmits rotational movement of element 2062 to element 2038, while mechanism 2072 prevents retrograde motion when handle 2036 is moved in the direction opposite to direction 2042. Tool 2000 TR also includes a stationary sleeve 2076., 67241=The application is a continuation-in-part (CIP) of U.S. Ser. No. 08/964,026 filed on Nov. 4, 1997 and now abandoned, which is a CIP of U.S. Ser. No. 08/802,948 filed on Feb. 21, 1997 and now U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,607, which is a CIP of U.S. Ser. No. 08/606,343 filed on Feb. 23, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,370.}",
