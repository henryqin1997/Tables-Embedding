Thus, by repeating a same process, a second SOI wafer was obtained., 23091=Thus, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-302889 proposes a method of manufacturing an SOI wafer without losing a silicon substrate. The proposed method comprises forming a non-porous single-crystal semiconductor layer on a porous layer formed on a first substrate, bonding the non-porous single-crystal semiconductor layer to a second substrate with interposing an insulation layer, separating the first and second substrates along the porous layer without destroying the substrates, smoothing the surface of the first substrate and forming another porous layer on the first substrate for reuse. With this method, the first substrate is separated away without being destroyed so that it can be repeatedly used for the process of manufacturing SOI wafers to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost and simplify the manufacturing process., 110448=The root-mean-square of surface roughness of the Si substrate of the first article was less than 10 nm in a micro-region of a 50 \u03bcm square area and its surface was visually mirror-smooth under fluorescent light over a large area, or over the entire surface of the wafer, after removing the porous layer. For the purpose of comparison, a similar Si substrate was prepared for the first article by following the steps of this example except that a porous layer was formed on a P+wafer with an impurity concentration of 5\ufffd1018/cm3 and no additional doped layer was formed. Then, the root-mean-square of surface roughness of the Si substrate of the first article was less than 10 nm in a micro-region of a 50 \u03bcm square area but undulations were visually observed under fluorescent light over a large area, or over the entire surface of the wafer, after removing the porous layer. FIG. 7 illustrates the observed surfaces of the two specimens., 123213=A P+high concentration layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1017 to 1\ufffd1020/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 16 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate by means of a diffusion method. The process of forming the P+high concentration layer using a diffusion method was conducted in a manner as described below. First, an Si substrate was placed in a furnace tube and N2 gas was introduced into a liquid diffusing source containing BBr3 for bubbling. Then, the produced gas was introduced into the furnace tube with carrier gas of (N2+O2). A B2O3 layer was formed by keeping the temperature in the furnace at 1,050\ufffd C. for 64 hours. Thereafter, the substrate was subjected to a so-called drive-in diffusion process, maintaining the inside of the furnace tube at 1,150\ufffd C. for 24 hours to produce the P+high concentration layer., 149311=A P+high concentration epitaxial Si layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1018/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate under the following conditions., 173940=A P+layer was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm by epitaxial growth with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1018/cm3 on the surface of a p-type single-crystal Si substrate under the following epitaxial growth conditions., 162659=The substrate was then heat-treated at 1,150\ufffd C. for 24 hours to heal the damages caused by the ion implantation and diffuse boron ions. As a result, a doped layer was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of substrate with boron concentration of 5\ufffd1018/cm3. After removing the surface SiO2 layer, the substrate was anodized in an HF solution from the side of the high density front surface under the following, 58891=Techniques that can be used for forming a porous layer for the purpose of the invention will be summarily described below. Porous layers, of Si for example, were discovered by Uhlir et al. in 1956 when they were looking into a process of electrolytically polishing a semiconductor object (A. Uhlir, Bell Syst. Tech. J., vol.35,333 (1956)). Porous Si can be produced by anodizing an Si substrate in an HF solution. Unagami et al. report as a result of researches on the dissolving reaction of Si in anodization that holes are required in an anodic reaction of Si that proceeds in an HF solution and the reaction is expressed by the following formulas (T. Unagami, J. Electrochem. Soc., vol.127,476 (1980))., 186137=As the P type single-crystal Si substrate carried thereon the epitaxially grown P+type doped layer that had not been turned to a porous state and was about 1 \u03bcm thick, it was subjected to another epitaxial growth process under the same conditions to produce an additional P+type layer (boron concentration: 5\ufffd1018/cm3) to a thickness of about 9 \u03bcm to make the total thickness of the overall P+layer on the P+type single-crystal Si substrate 10 \u03bcm, which was same as the thickness of the first P+layer. Thus, by repeating a same process, a second SOI wafer was obtained., 21185=Meanwhile, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-21338 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,037 propose a method of manufacturing a semiconductor article comprising a bonding step as will be described below., 64081=There are reports saying that micro-cavities with a diameter between several nm and tens of several nm are formed in bulk Si to a density of 1016 to 1017/cm3 when the bulk Si is heat-treated after implanting helium or hydrogen ions into it. (for example, A. Van Veen, C. C. Griffioen and J. H. Evans, Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 107 (1988, Material Res. Soc. Pittsburgh, Pa.) p.449). Recently, researches are being made to utilize such micro-cavities as gettering sites for metal impurities., 32826=With the method of separating the bonded first and second articles along the porous layer formed on the first article and reusing the separated Si substrate as another first article as proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-302889, undulations can be produced on the interface of the porous layer/substrate interface due to the variations in the dopant concentration of the wafer surface as pointed out above. For instance, in the process of anodizing the porous layer on the wafer surface, the current density changes to locally change the film thickness distribution of the porous layer and produce undulations on the porous layer/substrate interface. This phenomenon will be described further by referring to FIGS. 2A through 2E., 100623=A P+high concentration layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1017 to 1\ufffd1020/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate by means of a diffusion method. The process of forming the P+high concentration layer using a diffusion method was conducted in a manner as described below. First, a solution obtained by dissolving B2O3 into a solvent was applied to the principal surface of the Si substrate by means of a spin-coat technique. Then, the solvent was driven off by baking the substrate at 140\ufffd C. The obtained substrate was then placed in a diffusion furnace and subjected to a so-called drive-in diffusion process, maintaining the inside of the furnace tube at 1,150\ufffd C. for 24 hours to produce the P+high concentration layer. After removing the coat film, the layer was anodized in an HF solution from the side of the high density surface., 56594=For the purpose of the invention, the concentration of the element capable of controlling the conductivity type that is contained in the produced diffusion region is generally found within a range between 5.0\ufffd1016/cm3 and 5.0\ufffd1020/cm3, preferably between 1.0\ufffd1017/cm3 and 2.0\ufffd1020/cm3, more preferably between 5.0\ufffd1017/cm3 and 1.0\ufffd1020/cm3, although the concentration is preferably selected by taking the step of modifying the surface layer into a porous layer and the characteristics of the epitaxial film to be formed on the porous silicon layer into consideration., 141167=A P+high concentration layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1017 to 1\ufffd1020/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate by means of a diffusion method. The process of forming the P+high concentration layer using a diffusion method was conducted in a manner as described below. First, an Si substrate was placed in a furnace tube and N2 gas was introduced into a liquid diffusing source containing BBr3 for bubbling. Then the produced gas was introduced into the furnace tube with carrier gas of (N2+O2). A B2O3 layer was formed by keeping the temperature in the furnace at 1,050\ufffd C. for 64 hours. Thereafter, the substrate was subjected to a so-called drive-in diffusion process, maintaining the inside of the furnace tube at 1,150\ufffd C. for 24 hours to produce the P+high concentration layer. After removing the coat film, a P+high concentration layer was also formed on the rear surface at the same time. The substrate was anodized in an HF solution from the side of the high density surface., 19041=This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/219,748 filed Dec. 23, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,729., 112534=A P+high concentration layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1017 to 1\ufffd1020/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate by means of a diffusion method and subsequently subjected to an anodization process conducted under the following conditions., 132452=A P+high concentration layer with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1017 to 1\ufffd1020/cm3 was formed to a thickness of 10 \u03bcm on the surface of a resistance-non-specified single-crystal Si substrate by means of a diffusion method. The process of forming the P+high concentration layer using a diffusion method was conducted in a manner as described below. First, an Si substrate was placed in a furnace tube and N2 gas was introduced into a liquid diffusing source containing BBr3 for bubbling. Then, the produced gas was introduced into the furnace tube with carrier gas of (N2+O2). A B2O3 layer was formed by keeping the temperature in the furnace at 1,050\ufffd C. for 64 hours. Thereafter, the substrate subjected to a so-called drive-in diffusion process, maintaining the inside of the furnace tube at 1,150\ufffd C. for 24 hours to produce the P+high concentration layer. After removing the coat film, the layer was anodized in an HF solution from the side of the high density surface., 187325=A P+layer was formed to a thickness of 16 \u03bcm by epitaxial growth with a boron concentration of 5\ufffd1018/cm3 on the surface of a P type single-crystal Si substrate as in Example 12., 22128=Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-102594 proposes a manufacturing method comprising forming a diffusion region by diffusing an element capable of controlling the conductivity into a silicon substrate, forming a porous layer in the diffusion region, forming a non-porous single-crystal layer in the diffusion region, bonding it to a supporting substrate with interposing an insulation layer and subsequently removing the porous layer. This method provides advantages that a relatively inexpensive resistance-non-specified substrate can be employed to reduce the manufacturing cost and that the concentration of the element (specific resistance) on and near the surface can be controlled precisely by the diffusion process. However, with the above proposed methods, a pair of silicon substrates are consumed for producing a single SOI wafer and one of the substrates will be totally lost as a result of grinding, polishing and etching.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described above in detail, according to the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor article that is substantially free from undulations on the interface of the porous layer and the substrate and can be separated from a counter substrate reliably with an enhanced degree of reproducibility. With a method according to the invention, semiconductor articles can be manufactured at low cost. As the P type single-crystal Si substrate carried thereon the epitaxially grown P type doped layer that had not been turned to a porous state and was about 1 \u03bcm thick, it was subjected to another epitaxial growth process under the same conditions to produce an additional P+type layer (boron concentration: 5\ufffd1018/cm3) to a thickness of about 9 \u03bcm to make the total thickness of the overall P layer on the P type single-crystal Si substrate 10 \u03bcm , which was same as the thickness of the first P+layer. Thus, by repeating a same process, a second SOI wafer was obtained. The film thickness of the single-crystal Si layer obtained in this example was found to be as uniform as 201 nm\ufffd4 \u03bcm after the etching operation. After heat-treating the obtained semiconductor article in hydrogen at 1,100\ufffd C. for 1 hour, the surface roughness of the semiconductor article was evaluated to find that the root-mean-square of surface roughness in a 50 \u03bcm square area was about 0.2 nm.
