Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments as illustrated herein, but is limited only by the following claims. As is apparent, examples (1) and (2) demonstrate that calcitonin and parathyroid hormone can be entrapped in liposomes and then administered orally to achieve their biological effect. These preparations could be useful in the treatment of a large number of human diseases of calcium and skeletal metabolism. The particular dosages of PTH and calcitonin required to achieve desired serum calcium regulations will vary depending upon actual calcium level in each individual and the degree of disease or metabolic disorder. The results in Table 5 demonstrate that aspirin enhances slightly the effect of free CT. Maximal responses are seen with liposomal entrapment of sCT in ePC/stearylamine vesicles (8:2).
