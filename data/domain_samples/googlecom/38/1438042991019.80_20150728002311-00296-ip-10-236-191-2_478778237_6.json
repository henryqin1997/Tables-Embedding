Further, since the chromatic aberration can be corrected only by adding the diffracting surface to an. existing scanning optical system, a scanning optical system capable of correcting chromatic aberration can be provided at a low cost as compared with a case that a scanning optical system is entirely redesigned. As described above, according to the present invention, the chromatic aberration of the entire scanning optical system can be corrected by interposing the diffracting surface having the chromatic aberration correcting function between the deflector, or the polygon mirror of the scanning optical system and the surface to be scanned. As a result, the displacement of a converged position (i.e., a spot position) on the surface to be scanned can be suppressed to a small amount even if the wavelength of the laser beam emitted from the light source is different from a design wavelength. Thus, the error of a drawing position can be suppressed to a small amount. The comparative scanning optical system is similar to the scanning optical system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 (i.e., the above-described embodiments) except that the diffraction element 15 is removed therefrom. When FIGS. 6A-6C, 7A-7C, and 8A-8C are compared with FIGS. 9A-9C, it can be understood that the",
