    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6243=The present invention further provides a third embodiment of an RC architecture which is based on partial interleaving of a predetermined number of unconstrained data bytes and illustrates the versatility of the empty locations generated by the formatting block 606. In the first two embodiments, described above, the C2-encoder inserts parity bytes into the empty locations. However, the empty locations may also be used in a different way: some may be filled with C2-parity bytes and some may be filled with unconstrained data bytes. FIG. 10 illustrates a block diagram of a RC architecture 1000 for product codes in which unconstrained data bytes are inserted into some of the empty locations provided by the formatter 606 and parity bytes are inserted into the remaining empty locations. The insertion of the unconstrained data bytes occurs prior to the C2-encoder because the C2-encoder needs these bytes for computing the parity bytes. The unconstrained data bytes are generated by a de-multiplexer 1002. The de-multiplexer 1002 splits the user data into one part that is processed by the first set of modulation encoders 602 and a second part that bypasses the first set of modulation encoders 602 and is processed by the insertion block 1004 prior to the C2-encoder 604.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{143200=The RC architecture of the third embodiment uses as C2-code an RS code with parameters [N2=96, K2=81, d2=16] over the Galois field GF(256), where N2 denotes the length, K2 the dimension, and d2 the minimum Hamming distance of the C2-code. For each subdata set, there are N2 x (U+D)=96\ufffd399=38,304 bytes of user data, which are split into N2\ufffdU=96\ufffd394=37,824 bytes that are encoded by the first modulation encoder 602 and N2 x D=96\ufffd5=480 bytes that are processed by the insertion block 1004 prior to the C2-encoder 604. Thus, the unencoded user data array has size N2\ufffdU=96\ufffd394. Each row of this array is encoded by a rate-197/200 interleaved Fibonacci code with global G=10 and interleaved I=5 constraint. Applying the rate-197/200 modulation encoder 16 times per row, each row of the unencoded subdata set with its 8\ufffd394=3152 bits is mapped into a row of the modulated user data array of size N2\ufffdM=96\ufffd400., 144288=The formatting block 606 transforms the modulated user data array into an array with N2\u2212K2+T \u201cempty\u201d locations in each column, where T is the number of unconstrained data bytes per column that are inserted by the insertion block 1004. For T=1, there are 16 empty locations in each column, although it will be appreciated that T may equal some other number. One of these 16 empty locations will be filled by an unconstrained data byte and the remaining N2\u2212K2 empty locations will be filled with C2-parity bytes. To meet the Diophantine equation (M+L)\ufffd(N2\u2212K2+T)=N2\ufffdL with M=400 and T=1, the number of empty locations per row must be L=80, resulting in K1=L+M=480 for the dimension of the C1-code on a C2-symbols basis, i.e., in bytes. As there are 96 rows in each parity pattern array, there is a total of 96\ufffd80=7680 empty locations per parity pattern array. The 7680 insertion locations are specified by the following 16 linear equations (modulo 96), which relate the column indices x to the row indices y, namely,}",

Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention, the practical application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. Moreover, although described above with respect to methods and systems, the need in the art may also be met with a computer program product containing instructions for encoding data for recording onto media. It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functioning data processing system, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processes of the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of a computer readable medium of instructions and a variety of forms and that the present invention applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media actually used to carry out the distribution. Examples of computer readable media include recordable-type media such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a RAM, and CD-ROMs and transmission-type media such",
