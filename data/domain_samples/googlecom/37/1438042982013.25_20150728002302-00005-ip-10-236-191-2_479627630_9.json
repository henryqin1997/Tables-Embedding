It is thus to be understood that modifications and variations in the present invention may be made without departing from the novel aspects of this invention as defined in the claims and that this application is to be limited only by the scope of the claims. It should be appreciated that the player's award is not limited to an award associated with a bonus value, that is an award that is added to the player's award total associated with regular game play (i.e., game play other than game play during the bonus round). For example, the player's award can include an award associated with a credit value that provides, for example, extended game play or an award associated with any other suitable game value. As shown in FIG. 10, the award 162 b associated with the symbol labeled \u201cB\u201d includes the modifier and is distributed to the player selection 158 b. Therefore, the player's award associated with the award of the player selection 158 b of \u201c54\u201d (not shown), that is, the cumulative total of the awards",
