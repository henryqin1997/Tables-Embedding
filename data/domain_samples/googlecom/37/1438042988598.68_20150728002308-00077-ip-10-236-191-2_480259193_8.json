Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, representative devices, and illustrated examples shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. As is apparent from the above description, according to the present invention, since a ridge serving as an optical waveguide is formed such that grooves adjacent to the ridge are formed along both the longitudinal sides of the ridge, the following effect can be obtained. That is, the ridge can be formed with high precision, crystallinity of a current blocking layer near the ridge is improved, and desired laser characteristics can be obtained with excellent uniformity and reproducibility, thereby improving the reliability of the laser device. According to the seventh embodiment, a laser device of a wavelength of, e.g., 650 nm band, is oscillated at a threshold current of 30 mA, a transverse mode having a single maximum can be maintained until an output power becomes 20 mW. In this embodiment, since the real index guided structure is used, a small astigmatism of 2 \u03bcm or less can be obtained. In temperature characteristics, a 20-mW optical output can be obtained at a temperature of 70\ufffd C. In reliability, a failure rate of the",
