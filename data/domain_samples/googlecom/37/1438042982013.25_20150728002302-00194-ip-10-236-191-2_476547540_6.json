No. 4,941,881 issued Jul. 17, 1990 includes a tube mounted I.V. infusion set with a protective sheath similar to that taught and claimed in the present application. The structure includes foldable wings which are utilized by the phlebotomist to grasp and maneuver the needle for insertion into a patient for use of the needle. When withdrawing the needle from the patient, the wings must be folded and held in place for movement in the folded position through a slot back to a locking position. While this arrangement provides positive locking of the needle inside an enclosed shield once the wings are moved to the locking position, it does require positive camming of the wings in a folded position for the rearward movement of the contaminated needle together with the associated wings from the use position to the locked position. Such maneuvering may be ponderous in the environment of removing a needle from the skin of a patient and attempting to handle the needle and the patient simultaneously.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the forms of apparatus herein described constitute preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to these precise forms of apparatus, and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims. For example, the configuration of the two halves of the shield of the invention may be modified to a degree so long as they provide the cooperating forward use lock surfaces, the rearward finally locked surface format, together with the cooperating resilient flexible slot which accommodates the movement of the wings from the forward use position to the rear locked position. Also, as discussed in more detail above, the two parts may be joined together with a living hinge or they may be separately joined with the variety of cooperating front and back abutments for joining the two surfaces together. Thus, the conventional I.V. infusion set, for example, can be modified relatively inexpensively and in an uncomplicated way to provide a throw-away structure. The assembly is comprised of one or two moldable parts which can be mass produced as will be understood, from a variety of materials including, for example, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, certain metals or polypropylene. Materials will be selected which will provide the proper covering and support for the structure of the invention in its use, but which will provide also",
