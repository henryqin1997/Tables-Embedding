In summary, there has been provided a demodulation and carrier recovery system. In this system, the composite phase difference between a received carrier and a local carrier clock is first determined, which is a combination of the free-running phase between the local clock and the carrier. The composite phase is then discriminated to determine the free-running phase error. Once the free-running phase is determined, it is subtracted from the composite phase to yield the phase modulation on the carrier. It can be seen that the only requirement for attaining the quadrature component of the signal x(t) is to take the Hilbert transform. The use of the phase splitter with reference to FIG. 1 provides a Hilbert transform. However, this is realized in the hardware in the embodiment of FIG. 1. The present system utilizes a digital signal processor as the Hilbert transform filter 310 to perform the calculation. \u03c6(t)=Im [ln u(t)] (b 7) so that ln u(t)=ln R(t)+i\u03c6(t) (6) Here, R(t) represents instantaneous amplitude and \u03c6(t) represents instantaneous phase. Instantaneous phase can be computed with the following alternative approach. Taking the logarithm of both sides of Equation (4), the",
