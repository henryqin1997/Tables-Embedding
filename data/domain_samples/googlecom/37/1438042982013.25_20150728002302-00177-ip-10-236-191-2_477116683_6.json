    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{41606=Referring now to FIG. 3, in one preferred demodulation circuit the signal at node 32 is input to an operational amplifier 64 configured as a follower to create a high input impedance and low output impedance with no signal gain. A wide variety of commercially available operational amplifiers are suitable. The output signal of this buffer at node 66 is input to a DC blocking high pass filter 68 comprising a series capacitor 70 and shunt resistor 72 with an RC time constant of preferably about 50 to 150 microseconds (which is much longer than the typically 1 to 5 microsecond wavelength of the oscillator waveform). The signal is then input to an absolute value circuit 74 which charges the filter capacitor 70 until the high frequency AC signal appearing at the output of the high pass filter circuit 68 is biased to be entirely above ground. Preferably, the filter capacitor 76 of the absolute value circuit 74 is much larger than the high pass filter capacitor 70. Values of 0.1 microfarad and 1000 picofarad respectively have been found suitable. Finally, the signal is low pass filtered with a series resistor 78 and shunt capacitor 80 with a time constant of 50 to 150 microseconds to produce a slowly varying DC output signal representative of the varying peak value of the AC voltage at node 32. This demodulator 60 output signal at node 61 is not linearly proportional to the distance between the probe 22 tip and the target surface 20. Due to eddy current effects, the effective resistance RE of the probe coil 26 increases with increasing distance between the probe tip and the target, and therefore the amplitude of the voltage at node 32 increases with increasing probe-target distance as well. When the amplitude of the oscillator 54 output at node 58 is constant, the voltage at node 32 varies roughly as the log of the probe-target distance, although the exact functional dependence varies with the details of probe construction and target material and configuration. In a preferred embodiment, the non-linear characteristics of this output signal are removed by a signal conditioner 62 (FIG. 2), which outputs a second signal at node 63 which preferably has a substantially linear functional dependence on the probe-target distance. This feature of the present invention is described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8., 21498=This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/008,211, filed Dec. 5, 1995., 25938=Of course, even when the impedance is a non-linear function of target position, reference to a calibration curve can uniquely identify a position corresponding to a given measured impedance. Accordingly, some systems, such as the one described in published European Patent Application No. 84401906.7 to Clergeot et al., calculate position by digitally referencing measured eddy current probe outputs to a stored calibration curve. Other systems for measuring the conductivity (rather than proximity) of a target sample are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,405 to Howard, and published European Patent Application No. 94630039.9 to Prometrix Corporation. A similar system for measuring the thickness of a non-conductive coating on a conductive target is disclosed in published U.K. Patent Application No. GB 2,112,944 A to Taylor.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description details certain preferred embodiments of the present invention and describes the best mode contemplated. It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how detailed the foregoing appears in text, the invention can be practiced in many ways and the invention should be construed in accordance with the appended claims and any equivalents thereof. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that other digital linearization algorithms may be employed. For example, rather than forming a correlation table based on equally spaced input samples as illustrated in FIG. 8, a correlation based on equally spaced probe-target separation distances may be employed. This method requires the use of a more computationally intensive binary search and divide function, yet has the advantage of having a higher data table density at large target displacement values (resulting from the smaller change in voltage for a given change in position at the greater displacement). Hence, the resolution at higher target displacements may be increased with this algorithm. It may also be desirable to combine the two algorithms in a piece-wise manner such that the advantages of each are employed for varying portions of the signal vs. displacement curve 160. For example, the displacement-indexed scheme may be employed for that portion of the curve relating to high values of target displacement (due to its enhanced resolution in this region), while the voltage-indexed algorithm may be used for",
