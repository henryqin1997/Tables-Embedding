Contact to the lower plates (1105, 1106) is made with via contacts (1109, 1110) through the dielectric, which make contact with upper layers of thick metalized interconnect (1111, 1112)., 38029=A recent approach to the integration of capacitors and interconnects has concentrated on fabricating these devices on silicon wafers. See MARC DE SAMBER, NICK PULSFORD, MARC VAN DELDEN, ROBERT MILSOM; \u201cLow-Complexity MCM-D Technology with Integrated Passives for High Frequency Applications\u201d, The International Journal of Microcircuits and Electronic Packaging, Volume 21, Number 2, Second Quarter 1998, pgs 224-229 (ISSN 1063-1674) (International Microelectronics and Packaging Society)., 68638=One skilled in the art will recognize that the capacitor structure depicted in FIG. 11 (1100) depicts two separate capacitor structures having two bottom plates (1105, 1106) with corresponding dielectric layers (1107, 1108). This illustrates how a single ground contact via (1104) and top plate (1113) may be shared among proximal capacitors. This improves the area efficiency of the overall capacitor structure and permits multiple capacitors to be paralleled for bypass/decoupling/filtering purposes. This parallelism tends to improve the overall function of these devices in a given application, and may also be used to isolate power supply noise between various stages within a given active amplifier (1211) or other active element., 32789=Applicant claims benefit pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119 and hereby incorporates by reference Provisional Patent Application for \u201cINTEGRATED THIN FILM CAPACITOR/INTERCONNECT SYSTEM AND METHOD\u201d, Ser. No. 60/234,135, filed Sep. 21, 2000, and submitted to the USPTO with Express Mail Label EM267139965US., 57282=The lower adhesive layer is generally very thin (\u02dc0.03-0.05 \u03bcm) and is optimally comprised of chrome (Cr), titanium (Ti), or titanium-tungsten (WTi), although other adhesive conducting materials are also known in the art. The purpose of this layer is to generally act as a bonding interface between the substrate (0501) and the conducting layer (0502)., 68049=It is important to note that within the context of the prior art, the lower capacitor plates (1105, 1106) would normally be formed as thick metalization comparable to the top interconnect (1111, 1112, 1113), thus making step coverage of the dielectric layer (1107, 1108) problematic and unreliable. The construction technique and materials taught by the present invention overcome these deficiencies in the prior art and provide for a higher degree of performance and reliability than possible with prior art structures., 55981=Referring to the system as described in FIGS. 5-11 (0500, 0600, 0700, 0800, 0900, 1000, 1100) and method as described in FIG. 14 (1400), a substrate and method for forming same containing integrated capacitors, inductors and/or interconnects along with conductors and/or resistors will now be described.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims: Claims A system and method for the fabrication of high reliability capacitors, inductors, and multi-layer interconnects on various substrate surfaces has been disclosed. The disclosed method first employs a thin metal layer deposited and patterned on the substrate. This thin patterned layer is used to provide both lower electrodes for capacitor structures and interconnects for upper electrode components. Next, a dielectric layer is deposited over the thin patterned layer and the dielectric layer is patterned to open contact holes to the thin patterned layer. The upper electrode layer is then deposited and patterned on top of the dielectric. Conclusion Fabricated inductor test structures using the teachings of the present invention had remarkably consistent inductance values in the 20-70 nH range and quality factors (Q) ranging from 22 at 2 GHz (20 nH) to 14 at 800 MHz (70 nH). While this performance analysis is preliminary, it does indicate that the present invention teachings permit inductors to be fabricated with significantly higher reliability, manufacturability, and performance than possible with the prior",
