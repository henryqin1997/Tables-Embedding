Preference is given to surface treatments by means of flame pretreatment. An overview of the techniques for surface treatment is contained, for example, in the article \u201cSurface pretreatment of plastics for adhesive bonding\u201d (A. Kruse; G. Kr\ufffdger, A. Baalmann and O. D. Hennemann; J. Adhesion Sci. Technol., Vol. 9, No 12, pp 1611\u20131621 (1995))., 41749=The moduli of elasticity achieved in the longitudinal direction, measured at 10% elongation in accordance with ASTM D882, are usually between 1000 and 4000 N/mm2, preferably between 1500 and 3000 N/mm2., 41332=For the production of the adhesive tapes of the invention for secure carton sealing, preference is given to biaxially oriented films based on polypropylene with a draw ratio in the longitudinal (machine) direction of between 1:4 and 1:9, preferably between 1:4.8 and 1:6, and a draw ratio in the transverse (cross) direction of between 1:4 and 1:9, preferably between 1:4.8 and 1:8.5.}",
