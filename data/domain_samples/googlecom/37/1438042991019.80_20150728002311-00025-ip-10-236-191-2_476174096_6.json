No. 3,419,399 patented Dec. 31, 1968, prepared soluble coffee doughs having a moisture content of 9.5 to 12.5% at a temperature below 140\ufffd F. and then dryed the dough to 1-4%. This material was very sticky and difficult to process., 16706=Another attempt to produce dehydrated vegetable extracts is disclosed by Risler, et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,154,864, issued May 15, 1979. Risler, et. al. formed a paste or powder which is extruded into a subatmospheric pressure chamber to puff the coffee product. For example, freeze-dried instant coffee powder, having a moisture content of 2.5%, is extruded into a chamber at 80 mb and cut to form grains about the size of a pea which dissolve in cold water. When compared to these grains extruded into atmospheric pressure in Example 5 of that patent, the products with cellular internal structure are far more soluble., 13732=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 231,810, filed Aug. 12, 1988 and now abandoned., 33589=The heated extract enters the top of the evaporator, Luwa model #HS0050. The evaporator's rotor speed is maintained at about 380 rpm and is driven hydraulically by a Falk fluid power drive, model #30VCVf-AA-2123-70. A Nash pump, size AT-64, is used to create the 7 inch Hg vacuum in the evaporator. Saturated steam of about 34 psig is passed through the evaporator jacket to heat the extract inside to about 93\ufffd C. The thickening of the extract causes a rotor torque of about 1,100 inch-lbs. The vaporized water is drawn out the top of the evaporator and into the top of the condenser. The fixed shell and tube condenser has a surface area of 67 ft2 and is supplied with plant chilled water. A Gould pump, model #3196, draws the condensed evaporator drawoff from the condenser to a collection vessel or to drain., 15239=In an early effort to avoid drying of such coffee extracts by Eskew, U.S. Pat. No. 2,929,717, issued Mar. 22, 1960, a fifty-fifty mixture of concentrated coffee extract and an invert sugar solution were concentrated in a thin film evaporator to form a product having four percent or less water which was pumped out of the evaporator and formed on chilling rolls into small flakes which were easily broken into a coarse product before packaging. In this process, the product temperatures exiting the evaporator ranged from 220\ufffd F. to 290\ufffd F. and the products produced had moisture contents of about 1 to 4% and were hygroscopic by reason of the addition of large amounts of the invert sugars. This type of processing was also applied by Turkot et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,906,630, issued Sept. 29, 1959. While the process of Eskew and Turkot et al. produced coffee products without the need to spray-dry, a filler was employed which is not suitable in today's market. Furthermore, special packaging would be required to reduce the chance of moisture contamination which would be disastrous because of the hygroscopisity of the coffee product produced., 17346=In Andre, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,625,704 issued Dec. 7, 1971, dense flakes of instant coffee are prepared and aromatized from roll-milled instant coffee., 34432=Beneath the evaporator the concentrated extract, about 91% solids, enters a custom-made 3-gallon spool piece. A level of about 11/2% gallons is maintained. The spool piece level is detected via a K-Ray level sensor model #7062B. The concentrated extract is removed from the spool piece by a MAAG Vacorax gear pump, model #70/70, run at a speed of 30 rpm. A Nametra direct readout viscometer, model #667-9-87, located below the discharge of the Vacorax pump, senses the visocity of the coffee fluid which runs between 5\ufffd104 to 1\ufffd106 cp. Full-port type C-1 ball valves from Mogas are used to divert the fluid to the static mixers and formation die. The pressure at the Vacorax pump discharge and the formation die inlet are sensed via Gentran model GF-72/6-XXX-5M, -365 pressure tranducers and Gentran model GF-434 digital indicators., 35306=The viscoelastic coffee fluid is pumped through three sections of static mixers each containing fourteen Sultzer SMX type mixing elements. Coffee aromas are injected into the coffee fluid through custom-made Sultzer injection nozzles. An Eldex metering pump, model #AA-100S, is used to feed the aromas at rates and conditions that vary with the coffee blends used. As the viscoelastic fluid and aromas pass through the static mixers they form a homogeneous product which is then extruded through an HPM series 2500 sheet die. The 12-inch wide die is gapped to a 0.005 inch opening. electric heaters provided by HPM are used to maintain the die temperature of 200\ufffd F.}",
