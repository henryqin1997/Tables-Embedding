Further, improvements in multimedia technology ask one LCD to display images of various sizes., 88851=The panel 401 has an aspect ratio of 9:16 for wide images. The data driver 402 stores display data for one gate line. The gate driver 403 sequentially selects gate lines of the panel 401, and data stored in the data driver 402 is written to the selected gate line., 48813=A frequency of a clock signal used to sequentially select the gate lines may be increased during the vertical blanking period from a value for usual display data to a value for the predetermined data. A frequency of the clock signal for the predetermined data may be about two to four times higher than a frequency for usual display data. The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the top and bottom non-image areas of the display panel during the vertical blanking period with the frequency of the clock signal being set to a low value. The timing controller may write the predetermined data to the data driver during the vertical blanking period in one latch operation. The first aspect ratio may be 3:4 corresponding to a normal-size image, and the second aspect ratio may be 9:16 corresponding to a wide-size image., 68317=The LCD panel 1 has an aspect ratio of 3:4. The data driver 2 stores display data for one gate line. The gate driver 3 sequentially selects the gate lines of the panel 1, and data stored in the data driver 2 is supplied to the selected gate line, to display an image on the panel 1., 98895=FIG. 43 is a timing chart showing the operation of the data driver 502 of FIG. 37, and FIG. 44 shows the details of FIG. 43, when displaying a normal image of 3:4 in aspect ratio on the wide panel 501 having an aspect ratio of 9:16., 102056=To display an image of 640\ufffd480 dots on the 1024\ufffd768-dot panel, each dot of the panel may be related to each dot of the image, or several dots of the panel may be related to one dot of the image. To correctly display the image on the display, it is preferable to multiply each dot of the image by an integer. However, the ratio of 1024\ufffd768 to 640\ufffd480 is 5:3. If the image of 640\ufffd480 dots is doubled, it will be greater than the panel. If the image is displayed on the panel dot by dot, the panel will have many pixels without image data. In this case, some data must be written to these redundant pixels., 66770=To display the image of FIG. 1A, the method of FIG. 2A cuts left and right areas SA1 and SA2 of each line of the wide image and displays only an intermediate part of 3:4 in aspect ratio of the wide image. Namely, this method is unable to display the areas SA1 and SA2 of the wide image., 50596=The first aspect ratio may be 9:16 corresponding to a wide-size image and the second aspect ratio may be 3:4 corresponding to a normal-size image. The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the left and right non-image areas of the display panel during the horizontal blanking period with the frequency of the clock signal being set to a low value. The timing controller may write the predetermined data simultaneously to the right non-image area of a given gate line and the left non-image area of the next gate line during the horizontal blanking period. The display may be capable of inverting an image according to data start signals., 66484=The LCD of the prior art has a normal aspect ratio of 3:4. When a wide image having an aspect ratio of 9:16 is displayed on the LCD, the prior art cuts left and right areas of the image as shown in FIG. 1A, or top and bottom areas thereof as shown in FIG. 1B., 69202=FIG. 5 is a timing chart showing the operation of the gate driver 3 when displaying a normal image of 3:4 in aspect ratio on the panel 1., 96113=The panel 501 has an aspect ratio of 9:16 for wide images. When displaying a normal image of 3:4 in aspect ratio on the panel 501, the third aspect writes black simultaneously to the left and right non-image areas BK1 and BK2 (FIG. 29) on the panel 501 during a horizontal blanking period. As a result, the frequency F\u2033 of writing black of the third aspect is half the frequency F\u2032 of the second aspect., 67104=On the other hand, the method of FIG. 2B cuts top and bottom areas SB1 and SB2 of the wide image and displays only an intermediate area of 3:4 in aspect ratio of the wide image. At this time, this method displays black in the areas SB1 and SB2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Many different embodiments of the present invention may be constructed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described in this specification, except as defined in the appended claims. As explained above, the present invention provides a display, a method of driving the display, and a circuit for driving the display, to properly display images of various sizes on the display. As explained above, the fourth aspect of the present invention drives one of several gate lines in a blanking period. Namely, the fourth aspect generates several kinds of clock pulses in each horizontal period, to enable one of a plurality of gate lines and skip the remaining gate lines, so that all gate lines are driven in a plurality of frames. The fourth aspect reduces the frequency of the gate output enable signal GOE, to extend the period of the gate shifting clock signal \u03c6X. Since the width of a write pulse in a blanking period is wide, a sufficient write voltage is applied to liquid crystal cells. The fourth aspect may arrange gate drivers on each side of an LCD panel, to alternately drive gate lines (horizontal scan lines). This arrangement halves the frequency of the clock signal \u03c6X, to further widen the width of a write pulse during a blanking period. When displaying an",
