Engine-- Speed is retrieved from an appropriate sensor coupled to the ECM, while the minimum and maximum engine speeds are calibratable predetermined values supplied to the algorithm 10. Similarly, step 3063 determines if the percentage load on the engine is within predefined limits by determining whether J1587-- Percent-- Load has a value between Trending-- Percent-- Load-- Min and Trending-- Percent-- Load-- Max. The value of J1587-- Percent-- Load is supplied to the ECM from an appropriate sensor, while the minimum and maximum values are calibratable limits which are supplied to the algorithm 10.

The value of Intake-- Manifold Temperature is supplied to the ECM from an appropriate temperature sensor, while the minimum and maximum values are calibratable limits supplied to the algorithm 10.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. It will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that the preferred embodiment algorithm described above operates to save relevant trending data to non-volatile memory throughout the life of the engine in order to provide baseline and previous historical data on engine performance as an aid to troubleshooting and failure prediction. The algorithm operates to store a full set of datapoints only after a number of predetermined trigger conditions have been satisfied for a predetermined length of time. However, even if all of the predetermined trigger conditions have not been met for the predetermined length of time, the algorithm of the present invention is still operable in many instances to save relevant data, even though a full data set will not be stored under such conditions. This feature of the present invention ensures that all relevant data that is available is recorded, even though conditions do not exist which warrant saving an entire data set. Such partial data can be very useful in subsequent troubleshooting and diagnostics operations, even though the full",
