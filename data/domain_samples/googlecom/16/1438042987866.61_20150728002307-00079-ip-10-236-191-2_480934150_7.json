Through the use of \"trigger points,\" as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/289,499, filed Aug. 12, 1994, interactive audio can show up any time during the program as a function of stored user selection information. Trigger points provide designated times during the program when the program content is subtly altered to present individual and specialized attention to each subscriber. The trigger points are essentially markers in the program that effectively trigger macros, preferably stored in memory in each user interface unit 28, which call for a personalized audio segment to play over the user's headphones 132. The particular audio segment(s) chosen at each user interface unit 28 is based on previous user selections to questions preferably presented at the beginning of the show or in combination with a particular pattern of interactions solicited and entered during the program. Each user interface unit 28 recognizes the trigger points by decoding the data codes sent to each of the units. The exact timing of the trigger points are unknown to the subscriber in order to make the interactive elements appear unsolicited to the interactive user. Of course, timing of the interactive events should correspond to suitable times in the program where branching to interactive elements is sensible and does not clash with the program content of the 3D video shown on the screen 20., 44473=The interactive presentation is of a type disclosed in commonly copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/228,355, filed Apr. 15, 1994 and copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/289,499, filed Aug. 12, 1994, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,847,698, 4,847,699, 4,847,700, 4,264,924, 4,264,925, and RE 34,340, the contents of which are incorporated by reference., 57116=There are several different ways in which to integrate, store and/or transmit the 3D interactive presentation. The 3D interactive program video, common audio and multiple audio feedback responses and data codes are preferably recorded for later playback in the movie theater environment in whatever format is available including tape, film, CD ROM or disk (in analog or digital form), including but not limited to: one inch, D1, D2, Betacam, Betacam SP, Hi-8, three quarter, S-VHS, or any other format. The video/audio storage device 40 can be either a video tape player (VCR), CD ROM external storage device, film or video disc player, etc., depending upon the storage medium of the 3D interactive presentation program. Alternatively, the composite 3D interactive digital or analog program can be transmitted to remote reception sites using any suitable transmission means such as satellite, TV broadcast, fiber optic, cable television, etc. If the program is to be transmitted over some transmission means, it is envisioned that at least two 6 MHz NTSC standard video signals will be required to transmit the multiple images required for a 3D presentation. If analog transmission is used, preferably the common audio and multiple alternative audio feedback signals and data codes are inserted into the vertical blanking interval of one or more of the video signals using an interactive program inserter, such as that shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/228,355, filed Apr. 15, 1994. In this embodiment, the different audio tracks are fed into an audio mixer which aligns the different audio tracks in time. An analog inserter, such as that shown in FIG. 3 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/228,355, attached to the output of the audio mixer, video source and computer, is then used to integrate the analog segments, 3D video and data codes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Using the foregoing embodiments, methods and processes, the 3D video presentation system of the present invention maximizes the user's involvement and interactivity in a real time and low cost environment. Although the present invention has been described in detail with respect to certain embodiments and examples, variations and modifications exist which are within the scope of the present invention as defined in the following claims. As discussed above with respect to providing audio interactivity, the theater control unit memory 48 and processor 52 is preferably utilized for storing and processing prior user selections for controlling future video selection. The algorithm for controlling this selection is either embedded into the data codes or exists in software stored in memory 48. Instead of receiving several video streams, the theater control unit 36 could simply call from storage the selected video stream. In this manner, the theater control unit processor 52 determines the desired video segment. The processor 52 then reads from some storage device (e.g., CD ROM) the appropriate video segment, buffers the signal to obtain time sync, and sends the 3D video segment to the projection means 32. Near the end of the selected video segment, the theater control unit 36 switches back to the common 3D video presentation. Upon receipt of the user's selection from the user interface unit 28, the theater control unit processor 52 interprets the data codes and sends a command to the",
