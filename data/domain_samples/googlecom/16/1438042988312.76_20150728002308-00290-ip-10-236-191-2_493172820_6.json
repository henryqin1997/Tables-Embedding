Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims. Thus, by using the electrosurgical instrument of the present invention, transection can be performed quickly and with little disruption or movement of the cervical neck and surrounding organs, and with better accuracy and reliability in transecting at the desired location. Once the transection is complete, the capture element can be moved back to the open position, the electrosurgical wire completely retracted, and the capture element moved back to the closed position to allow the electrosurgical instrument to be removed entirely from the surgical site. Because the cervical neck is cinched as opposed to having to pull the entire energized wire against it in a unidirectional manner, there is very little unidirectional force exerted on it, and therefore, very little movement of it and surrounding organs. Thus, the cervical neck and uterus remain stabilized during the procedure. d and 4 e. The design of the electrosurgical instrument is such that the cervical neck becomes cinched within the electrosurgical wire and is transected and coagulated due to the RF energy applied through the electrosurgical wire. Often it is necessary to pause the section",
