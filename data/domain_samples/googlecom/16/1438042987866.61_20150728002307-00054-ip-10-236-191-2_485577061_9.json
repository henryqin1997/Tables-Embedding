To grow the n+-type Si layer 2004, the melt 2508 consisting of In or Sn is heated up to about 960\ufffd C. using the electric furnace 2512, and a melting n+-type Si substrate is immersed in the melt 2508, where n+-type Si is melted into the melt 2508 until the melt is almost saturated. Then, the melting n+-type Si substrate is lifted up. Alternatively, an n-type impurity such as P (phosphorous) or As (arsenic) may be melted into the melt together with a low-concentration n-type substrate. Subsequently, the temperature of the melt 2508 is lowered to about 950\ufffd C. so that the melt 2508 is supersaturated with n+-type Si. The substrate cassette 2501 is immersed in the melt 2508, and the temperature of the electric furnace 2512 is adjusted to gradually reduce the temperature of the melt 2508 to grow the epitaxial n+-type Si layer 2004 on the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003. The growth time is, for example, about 30 seconds., 115621=However, in order to form an epitaxial Si layer without an abnormal growth or a stacking fault, the porous layer 2002 in contact with the epitaxial Si layer preferably has a low porosity. On the other hand, in order to separate the bonded substrate using a water jet, the porous layer 2002 preferably has a high porosity. That is, it is very preferred that the porous layer 2002 has a low porosity on its surface side and a high porosity inside thereof. Thus, in this example, a porous Si sub-layer of a low porosity is formed on the surface side of the porous layer 2002, whereas a porous Si sub-layer of a high porosity is formed inside the Si wafer 2001 of the porous layer 2002. To form this structure, it is preferable to carry out two-step anodization in which anodization is effected first at a low current density and then at a high current density. Consequently, separation can easily be performed in the lower part of the porous layer 2002 (i.e., at the inside portion of the Si wafer 2001), and an epitaxial Si layer without abnormal growth or stacking fault can be formed., 35932=In order to realize a thin film crystalline Si solar cell, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-213645 discloses utilizing an epitaxial layer on a porous Si layer to separate a thin film monocrystalline Si. FIG. 33 is a schematic sectional view illustrating a method of forming a thin film Si solar cell disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-213645. In the figure, reference numeral 2601 denotes a Si wafer; 2602 a porous Si layer; 2603 a p+-type Si layer; 2604 a p\u2212-type Si layer; 2605 an n+-type Si layer; 2606 a protective layer; 2607 an adhesive; and 2608, 2609 a jig., 123750=Subsequently, grid electrodes 2005 are formed on a surface of the n+-type Si layer 2004, as shown in FIG. 21E. The grid electrodes 2005 are formed desirably by means of printing or sputtering using a material such as Al., 113706=As shown in FIG. 24A, by installing the Si wafer so that a voltage is applied across the electrodes to make a lower metal electrode 2032 positive while making an upper metal electrode 2033 negative thereby allowing an electric field caused by this voltage to be applied in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the Si wafer 2001, the top surface of the Si wafer 2001 is made porous. In FIG. 24B, the right surface in the figure of the Si wafer 2001 is made porous. As the hydrofluoric acid based etching liquid 2031, concentrated hydrofluoric acid (49% HF) is used. Since bubbles are generated from the Si wafer 2001 during the anodization, alcohol may be added as a surfactant to efficiently remove these bubbles. The alcohol is desirably methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or the like. Alternatively, by using a stirrer instead of a surfactant, the liquid may be stirred during anodization. The thickness of the porous layer is preferably between 1 and 30 \u03bcm., 88970=FIG. 13 is a schematic side view showing another separation apparatus according to the present invention in which bonded substrates 1101 a, 1101 b, 1101 c, 1101 d, and 1101 e are set at the same time on a substrate holding means 1105. A plurality of nozzles 1102 a to 1102 e are provided in a set of nozzle movement mechanisms 1103 and 1104. The nozzle interval is the same as the bonded substrate fixation interval. The holding mechanism and nozzle movement method are similar to those in FIG. 3., 86936=Not only a nozzle having a slit-like opening but also a plurality of nozzles 1202 placed closely in a line to jet a fluid against a bonded substrate 1201 as shown in FIG. 11 can be used for the present invention to obtain similar results. Reference numeral 1211 denotes a holder of a bonded substrate 1201., 129505=Finally, the conductive film 2010 such as Al is bonded to the insulating support 2011, which is then bonded to the p+-type Si layer 2014 to form a solar cell unit cell as shown in FIG. 28F., 127075=Example 2 is explained with reference to the sectional views shown as FIGS. 27A to 28F. First, the Si wafer 2001 is provided as a semiconductor substrate, as shown in FIG. 27A. Next, the wafer is anodized in the same manner as in Example 1 to convert a surface portion of the Si wafer 2001 to the porous layer 2002 as a separation layer, as shown in FIG. 27B. Thus, the portion of the Si wafer 2001 except for the porous layer 2002 becomes a first semiconductor layer. The liquid phase growth method described in Embodiment 1 is used to epitaxially grow a p+-type Si layer 2014, for example, 2 \u03bcm thick on the porous layer 2002 as shown in FIG. 27C, then a p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, for example, 30 \u03bcm thick thereon as shown in FIG. 27D, and then an n+-type Si layer 2004, for example, 1 \u03bcm thick thereon as shown in FIG. 27E to form a second semiconductor layer., 134379=In Example 5 a photosensor is produced. This example is described with reference to the sectional views of FIGS. 27A and 28F used to describe Example 2. The steps in FIGS. 27A to 27E are the same as in Example 2. After the step in FIG. 27E has been finished, grooves are formed in the n+-type Si layer 2004 parallel to the grid electrodes 2005 to separate the n+-type Si layer 2004 into stripes. This separation can be carried out using a technique such as photolithography, electron beam lithography, or laser scribe., 140144=Next, the grid electrodes 2005 consisting of Al or the like are formed by means of printing or sputtering as shown in FIG. 34F, and the anti-reflective film 2006 is formed thereon as shown in FIG. 35A. Then, the glass substrate 2007 as the support substrate is bonded to the anti-reflective film 2006 using a transparent adhesive as shown in FIG. 35B. In this case, it is preferable that the glass substrate 2007 is thinner in the peripheral portion than at the center., 116781=FIG. 21C represents a step for forming a p\u2212 type Si layer 2003 on the porous layer 2002. FIG. 21D represents a step for forming an n+type Si layer 2004 on the p\u2212 type Si layer 2003. The p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 and n+-type Si layer 2004 are epitaxial layers that maintains the monocrystallinity of the underlying substrate and constitute a second semiconductor layer., 114749=The metal electrodes 2032 and 2033 are desirably formed of a material that is unlikely to be corroded by a hydrofluoric acid solution, for example, gold (Au) or platinum (Pt). The maximum current density for anodization is 100 mA/CM2, and the minimum value may be any value except zero. During anodization, the current density is adjusted with the lapse of time. If the current density is high during anodization, the density of the porous Si layer will be low. That is, the higher the current density, the larger the volume of the pores, so that the porosity (defined by the ratio of the volume of the pores to a unit volume) is increased. The porous Si layer, although having many pores inside of the Si layer, maintains its monocrystallinity. Thus, a monocrystalline Si layer can be epitaxially grown on the porous Si layer., 132718=Then, the conductive film 2010 of the base material substrate 2011 is bonded to the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 by means of thermal welding or the like as shown in FIG. 31A. If the conductive film 2010 is made of Al, those parts of Si and Al that are located near the bonding surface are fused together, so that the Al-side bonding surface of the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 becomes of p+-type, while the bonding surface becomes ohmic., 117262=The p\u2212 type Si layer 2003 and the n+-type Si layer 2004 are formed desirably by the liquid phase growth method, the molecular beam epitaxial growth method, the plasma CVD method, the low pressure CVD method, the photo CVD method, the bias sputtering method, or the like., 130062=Using the same production steps as described in Example 2 with reference to FIGS. 27A to 28A, a substrate is formed wherein the porous layer 2002 as the separation layer is provided on the Si wafer 2001 as the semiconductor substrate, wherein the epitaxially grown Si layers 2014, 2003, and 2004 as the second semiconductor layer are located on the porous layer 2002, and wherein the grid electrodes 2005 and the anti-reflective film 2006 are located thereon as shown in FIG. 29A., 125288=Next, the above described method is used to apply a water jet 2020 against a side surface of the wafer as shown in FIG. 22D, and separation then occurs at the interface between the porous layer 2002 and the Si wafer 2001 and/or inside of the porous layer 2002, thereby separating the epitaxial layers 2004, 2003 as the second semiconductor layer and the Si wafer 2001 as the first semiconductor layer, as shown in FIG. 22E. In this case, the Si wafer 2001 has a beveling with which the end portion of the wafer is thinner than its center. Thus, the water jet 2020 first strikes against the beveled portion to exert a force in such a direction as to peel the bonded substrate off. Consequently, separation occurs at the portion of the porous layer 2002, which is mechanically weak. The Si wafer 2001 separated in the step shown in FIG. 22D is subjected to removal of a residue of the porous layer on the surface thereof and is used again as the Si wafer 2001 in FIG. 21A., 132544=Next, a base member substrate (an insulating support) 2011 with the conductive film 2010 such as Al is provided as shown in FIG. 30E., 126376=Next, a substrate is provided that has a conductive film 2010 such as an Al sheet bonded to an insulating support 2011 as shown in FIG. 23A, and the conductive film 2010 and the porous layer 2002 are bonded together using a conductive paste or the like as shown in FIG. 23B. The portions of the wafer having no epitaxial layer 2003 or 2004 is cut off along the dash and dot line shown in the sectional view in FIG. 23B and the dashed line shown in the top view in FIG. 23D, thus obtaining a generally rectangular solar cell unit as shown in FIG. 23C., 143283=The bonded substrate 2701 that has been bonded using steps similar to those in Examples 1 to 7 is held by the substrate holder 2708 from both surfaces of the substrate 2701 so as to stand perpendicularly. Then, the water jet nozzle 2704 placed above the bonded substrate 2701 is allowed to jet a pressurized fluid against a recess or gap formed by beveling of the bonded substrate 2701, in the direction parallel to the bonding interface of the bonded substrate 2701. At this time, the nozzle 2704 moves by means of the horizontal drive mechanism 2707 and the guide 2712 along the gap formed by beveling. Thereafter, the rotating mechanism 2702 rotates the bonded substrate 2701 by 45\ufffd or 90\ufffd, and again, the nozzle 2704 moves by means of the horizontal drive mechanism 2707 and the guide 2712 along the gap formed by beveling. By repeating this operation, the fluid can be jetted against the side surface of the bonded substrate 2701 without enlarging the distance between the side surface of the substrate 2701 and the nozzle 2704. Consequently, even for the polygonal semiconductor substrate, a constant pressure can be maintained in jetting the fluid against the substrate, thereby enabling the first and the second semiconductor layers to be reliably separated from each other at the separation layer. Although Example 8 has been described in conjunction with the substrate formed by cutting off four sides of a circular wafer such as 2701 in FIG. 36, the bonded substrate may be rectangular or triangular., 141388=Then, the porous layer 2002 is removed using wet etching or polishing as shown in FIG. 35E to expose the p+-type Si layer 2014. When removing the porous layer 2002 by means of wet etching, APIEZON wax or the like is used to protect the glass substrate 2007 so as not to come into contact with the etchant. The etchant is preferably a 1:1 mixture liquid of hydrofluoric acid (49%) and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (30%)., 140682=Next, the water jet 2020 is ejected against a side surface of the bonded substrate in the above manner as shown in FIG. 35C to separate the epitaxial Si layers 2014, 2003, and 2004 constituting the second semiconductor layer and the Si wafer 2001 constituting the first semiconductor layer, as shown in FIG. 35D. Residues of the porous layer 2002 are removed from the Si wafer 2001 by means of wet etching or the like so that the Si wafer 2001 can be used in the process starting in FIG. 34A. Since the Si wafer 2001 can be used about 1,000 times, about 100 solar cell units can be produced from one Si wafer., 135828=In Example 7 the periphery of the separation layer is removed for reliable separation prior to the ejection of the water jet. FIGS. 34A to 35F are sectional views representing the production steps according to Example 7. First, the Si wafer 2001 is provided as the semiconductor substrate, as shown in FIG. 34A. Next, the wafer is anodized as in Example 1 to convert a surface portion of the Si wafer 2001 the porous layer 2002 as a separation layer, as shown in FIG. 34B. In this case, the portion of the Si wafer 2001 except for the porous layer 2002 becomes a first semiconductor layer. The liquid phase growth method described in Example 1 is used to epitaxially grow, for example, 2 \u03bcm thickness of p+-type Si layer 2014 on the porous layer 2002 as shown in FIG. 34C. Next, for example, 30 \u03bcm thickness of p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 is epitaxially grown as shown in FIG. 34D, and then, for example, 1 \u03bcm thickness of n+-type Si layer 2004 is epitaxially grown shown FIG. 34E. In this case, the p+-type Si layer 2014, the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, and the n+-type Si layer 2004 constitute a second semiconductor layer., 133679=Subsequently, the porous layer 2002 is removed by means of etching or polishing to expose the n+-type Si layer 2004 as shown in FIG. 31D. If an n+-type wafer is used as a wafer in the process of pore formation, the step for removing the n+-type porous layer is not necessarily required. Then, the substrate is rotated through 180\ufffd as shown in FIG. 31E, and the grid electrodes 2005 are formed by means of printing or sputtering. Finally, the anti-reflective film 2006 is provided to the surface as shown in FIG. 31F to complete a solar cell unit., 133236=Next, the water jet 2020 is ejected against a side surface of the bonded substrate using the above mentioned manner as shown in FIG. 31B to separate the bonded substrate at the porous layer 2002, thereby separating the epitaxial layers 2004 and 2003 constituting the second semiconductor layer and the Si wafer 2001 constituting the first semiconductor layer, as shown in FIG. 31C., 36646=In the method of producing a solar cell illustrated in FIG. 33, firstly the porous Si layer 2602 is formed by anodization in a surface of the Si wafer 2601. Then, the p+-type Si layer 2603 is epitaxially grown on the porous Si layer 2602, and the p\u2212-type Si layer 2604 and the n+-type Si layer 2605 are further epitaxially grown thereon, respectively. Subsequently, the protective layer 2606 is formed. Then, the adhesive is applied to the protective layer 2606 and the Si wafer 2601, and the jig 2608, 2609 is adhered thereto. After that, a pulling force is exerted to the jig 2608, 2609 to separate the Si wafer 2601 and the epitaxial layers 2603, 2604, 2605 at the porous layer 2602. Then, the epitaxial layers 2603, 2604, 2605 are used to form a solar cell, while the Si wafer 2601 is again put into the same production steps as mentioned above, thus attaining cost reduction., 129819=Example 3 is almost similar to Example 2 except that there is no recess in the surface of the glass substrate 2007 as a support substrate which is bonded to the solar cell layer, and that the surface is flat instead., 112802=Next, as shown in FIG. 21B, a surface portion of the Si wafer 2001 is made a porous layer 2002 as a separation layer. Thus, the portion of the Si wafer 2001 except for the porous layer 2002 becomes a first semiconductor layer., 89613=By using the central axis of each bonded substrate for alignment, the five bonded substrates are each fixed between the holders 1115 a and 1115 b, between the holders 1115 b and 1115 c, between the holders 1115 c and 1115 d, between the holders 1115 d and 1115 e, or between the holders 1115 e and 1115 f, all of which can move on a guide 1114 in the horizontal direction., 113076=The porous layer 2002 can be formed by anodizing the Si wafer 2001. FIGS. 24A and 24B are schematic sectional views of a system for anodizing the Si wafer 2001 by using a hydrofluoric acid based etching liquid. In the figures, 2031 is a hydrofluoric acid based etching liquid, 2032 and 2033 are metal electrodes, and 2034 is an O ring. The Si wafer 2001 to be anodized is desirably of p-type but may be of n-type if it has a low resistivity. In addition, a normal n-type wafer can be made porous by irradiating the wafer with light to form holes therein., 128606=Next, as shown in FIG. 28C, the water jet 2020 is ejected against a side surface of the bonded substrate in the same manner as mentioned above to separate the epitaxial layers 2002, 2003, and 2014 as the second semiconductor layer and the Si wafer 2001 as the first semiconductor layer, as shown in FIG. 28D., 124234=Subsequently, as a support substrate, a glass substrate 2007 is provided that has a recess 2009 that fits the size of the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 and n+-type Si layer 2004 appropriately, as shown in FIG. 22B. It is preferred that the thickness of the glass substrate 2007 decreases toward the end portion thereof., 137147=The next step removes those parts of the porous layer 2002, p+-type Si layer 2014, p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, and n+-type Si layer 2004 that are located in the periphery of the substrate in FIG. 34E. This removal is carried out desirably by means of dry etching such as RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) or the like, or wet etching using an etchant of hydrofluoric acid + nitric acid or the like. In this case, as a mask, Teflon tape is bonded to the substrate or the substrate is protected by APIEZON wax so that only the side surface of the substrate is etched. The reason for removing the peripheral portion is that because the thickness of the porous layer 2002 is unstable at the periphery of the substrate, leaving the peripheral portion as it is makes it difficult to separate the first semiconductor layer and the second semiconductor layer in subsequent steps. In addition, the beveling of the Si wafer (i.e., the chamfer in the periphery of the Si wafer) may cause the epitaxial Si layers 2014, 2003, and 2004 to be warped at the periphery of the substrate, so that the substrate may be difficult to use for a solar cell., 130632=Next, the flat glass substrate 2007 without a recess is bonded to the anti-reflective film 2006, as shown in FIG. 29B. Then, the water jet 2020 is applied to a side surface of the bonded substrate as shown in FIG. 29C to separate the wafer at the porous layer 2002, thereby separating the epitaxial layers 2004, 2003, and 2014 constituting the second semiconductor layer and the Si wafer 2001 constituting the first semiconductor layer, as shown in FIG. 29D. Subsequently, the porous layer 2002 is removed by means of polishing or the like, and the substrate is finished as shown in FIG. 29E and bonded to the insulating support 2011 having the conductive film 2010 provided thereon to form a solar cell unit as shown in FIG. 29F., 131667=First, the Si wafer 2001 is provided as a semiconductor substrate, as shown in FIG. 30A. Next, the wafer is anodized in the same manner as in Example 1 to convert a surface portion of the Si wafer 2001 to the porous layer 2002 as the separation layer, as shown in FIG. 30B. Thus, the portion of the Si wafer 2001 except for the porous layer 2002 becomes a first semiconductor layer., 138913=Furthermore, it is also preferred that the peripheral portion 2050 of the Si wafer 2001 is partly removed so as to reduce the thickness toward the periphery of the wafer as shown in FIG. 34F. By placing a mask on each of the front and rear surfaces of the substrate and carrying out wet etching so as to allow only the side surface of the substrate to be brought into contact with the etchant, it is highly possible that the thickness of the substrate decreases naturally toward the periphery of the substrate. When the water jet is used as a fluid wedge during the subsequent separation process, such removal allows the wedge effect to be provided easily. The removal of the porous layer 2002, the p+-type Si layer 2014, the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, and the n+-type Si layer 2004 can be executed simultaneously with the removal of the peripheral portion 2050 of the Si wafer 2001. That is, this single step can eliminate the warped parts of the epitaxial Si layers 2014, 2003, and 2004 to stabilize the resulting solar cell as a finished product while stabilizing the subsequent separation step., 112471=First, an Si wafer 2001 is provided as a semiconductor substrate, as shown in FIG. 21A. The Si wafer 2001 normally has a beveling with which the wafer thickness decreases toward the end of the wafer, which effectively functions in subsequently separating the substrate by using a water jet., 90397=After the amount and pressure of fluid jetted from each nozzle have been stabilized at a nozzle stand-by position, all nozzles 1102 a to 1102 e are moved along the guide 1111 to a bonded substrate separation position and then further advance along the guide 1111 while separating the bonded substrates., 70962=The bonded substrate 401 can also be separated by moving the nozzle 402 in a direction parallel to the bonding interface (surface) of the bonded substrate 401 without rotating the wafer 401. However, when separation is effected by moving the nozzle 402 without rotating the bonded substrate 401, high-pressure water at 196 MPa (2000 kgf/cm2) is required to be supplied to a nozzle with a diameter of 0.15 mm, whereas only 19.6 MPa (200 kgf/cm2) of pressure is required when separation is effected while rotating the bonded substrate 401 with the nozzle 402 fixed., 128976=Then, the porous layer 2002 is removed using wet etching or polishing as shown in FIG. 28E to expose the p+-type Si layer 2014. When the porous layer 2002 is removed by means of wet etching, APIEZON wax or the like is used to protect the glass substrate 2007 so that the substrate 2007 is not brought into contact with the etching liquid. The wet etching liquid is preferably a 1:1 mixture liquid of hydrofluoric acid (49%) and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution., 138383=In addition, a 1:1 mixture liquid of hydrofluoric acid (49%) and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (30%) may be used as the etchant. This etchant can etch porous Si with high selectivity. Thus, even if the substrate of FIG. 34D is merely immersed in the etching liquid without a mask, only the peripheral portion of the porous Si layer 2002 can be removed. Even the removal of only the peripheral portion of the porous Si layer 2002 serves to improve the yield of the subsequent separation step., 135377=To form the separation layer according to the present invention, ions may be implanted into a semiconductor substrate to form a layer with voids as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-331077. Then, the water jet is ejected against a side surface of the bonded substrate as in the above Embodiments and Examples to separate the bonded substrate., 118884=Subsequently, the substrate cassette 2501 is introduced through the transfer chamber 2513 into the p\u2212type Si layer growth chamber 2503, where the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 is epitaxially grown on the porous layer 2002 in a liquid phase. The plurality of the p\u2212-type Si layer growth chambers 2503 and 2504 is required in order to grow the p\u2212-type Si layer more thickly than the n+-type Si layer, and it is assumed in this example that the system has six p\u2212-type Si layer growth chambers (some of them are omitted in the figures), one n+-type layer growth chamber, and one hydrogen anneal chamber. The p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 desirably has a thickness of 10 to 50 \u03bcm and more desirably 20 to 40 \u03bcm in order to effectively use the power generation light and the starting materials., 142707=In Example 8, separation is carried out using a polygonal shape wafer for a solar cell. In monocrystalline solar cells, it is preferable to use unit cells of a polygonal shape in order to eliminate dead spaces when forming modules. FIG. 36 illustrates an apparatus for separating a polygonal bonded substrate. In this figure, 2701 is a polygonal bonded substrate, 2702 is a wafer rotating mechanism, 2704 is a water jet nozzle, 2707 is a horizontal drive mechanism, 2708 is a substrate holder, and 2712 is a guide., 87610=In a basic configuration of the apparatus in FIG. 12, components similar to those in FIG. 3 are provided independently. A bonded substrate 1001 a is set on a holder 1005 a. A high-pressure fluid jetted from a nozzle 1002 a hits against a bevelled portion of a bonded substrate 1001 a. The nozzle 1002 a can be moved in a direction perpendicular to the drawing by a horizontal-movement mechanism 1004 a while jetting the high-pressure fluid against the bevelled portion. A similar operation can be performed in the portion shown in the right of the figure having a nozzle 1002 b, a horizontal-movement mechanism 1004 b, and a holder 1005 b. This configuration doubles the throughput. Although this figure shows two sets of the jet portions, three or more of such portions may be provided. In the FIGS. 1003a and 1003 b are vertical-movement mechanisms., 141872=Finally, the peripheral portion of the glass substrate 2007 is cut off, and the rear surface of the p+-type Si layer 2014 is bonded to a conductive film 2010 of Al or the like bonded to an insulating support 2011 by using a conductive adhesive, etc. to complete a solar cell unit., 122410=FIG. 26 is a partial perspective view of the substrate cassette 2501. Four struts 2061 are provided to support the plurality of Si wafers 2001 at four positions. The strut 2061 is structured to support only the end of the Si wafer 2001. In a subsequent step in the production of a solar cell, the epitaxial Si layers 2003 and 2004, which are used as power generation layers, are cut into squares utilizing their cleavage property, as shown by the dashed line in the figure. Accordingly, it is preferred that the struts 2061 support the Si wafers 2001 only at the cutting portions including the orientation flats 2062, and that the supported portions are not subjected to epitaxial growth. Thus, there are formed in the substrate a part at which epitaxial growth is effected and another part at which epitaxial growth is not effected, as shown in FIGS. 21C and 21D. In the dipping-type liquid-phase growth system such as shown in FIG. 25, the struts 2061 are immersed in the melt at nearly 1,000\ufffd C., so they are desirably produced using a heat-resistant material such as quartz. The substrate cassette 2501 of this structure can be used not only for liquid phase growth systems but also for gas phase growth systems such as CVD systems., 117588=A system for growing the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 and the n+-type Si layer 2004 in a liquid phase is explained with reference to FIGS. 25 and 26. FIG. 25 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid phase growth system of a mass-production dipping type for growing the epitaxial Si layers 2003 and 2004 by means of the liquid phase growth method. In the figure, 2501 is a substrate cassette that supports a plurality of growth substrates, 2502 is a hydrogen anneal chamber, 2503 and 2504 are p\u2212-type Si layer growth chambers, 2505 is an n+-type Si layer growth chamber, 2506, 2507, and 2508 are melts, 2509, 2510, 2511, and 2512 are electric furnaces, and 2513 is a transfer chamber through which the substrate cassette is transferred. To effect epitaxial growth on the porous layer 2002, it is preferred that the surface of the porous layer 2002 is annealed in a hydrogen atmosphere to be flattened. Thus, in the hydrogen anneal chamber 2502, the substrate cassette 2501 introduced to the liquid phase growth system is first annealed in a hydrogen atmosphere at, for example, about 1040\ufffd C., 124629=Then, as shown in FIG. 22C, the porous layer 2002 is brought into direct contact with the glass substrate 2007 except for the recess 2009, and the glass substrate 2007 and the porous layer 2002 are bonded together by heat treatment at about 400\ufffd C. In this case, bonding can be made firmly by subjecting the porous layer 2002 and the glass substrate 2007 to N2 plasma processing. Furthermore, a transparent heat-resistant adhesive 2008 may be filled in the recess 2009 to strengthen the adhesion between the glass substrate and the anti-reflective film 2006., 124029=Next, as shown in FIG. 22A, an anti-reflective film 2006 consisting of TiO2 or ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) is provided by means of a sputtering method, coating, or burning., 134967=Subsequently, the steps in FIGS. 27F to 28E are carried out in the same manner as described in Example 2. When the conductive film 2010 is bonded to the substrate as shown in FIG. 28F, striped electrodes perpendicularly crossing the grid electrodes 2005 are bonded. This results in a matrix photosensor., 119820=To grow the p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, the melt 2506 consisting of In or Sn is heated up to about 960\ufffd C. by using the electric furnace 2510, and a p\u2212-type Si substrate for melting is immersed in the melt 2506, where the p\u2212-type Si is melted into the melt 2506 until the melt is almost saturated. Then, the melting p\u2212-type Si substrate is lifted up. Subsequently, the temperature of the melt 2506 is lowered to about 950\ufffd C. so that the melt 2506 is supersaturated with p\u2212-type Si. Then, the substrate cassette 2501 is immersed in the melt 2506, and the temperature of the electric furnace 2510 is adjusted to gradually reduce the temperature of the melt 2506 thus growing the epitaxial p\u2212-type Si layer 2003 on the porous layer 2002. Since the growth time is long as for example, about 30 minutes, the plurality of p\u2212-type Si layer growth chambers are used to simultaneously grow p\u2212-type Si layers in the plurality of substrate cassettes, thereby improving the production efficiency., 128072=Next, the grid electrodes 2005 consisting of Al or the like are formed by means of printing, sputtering or the like as shown in FIG. 27F, and the anti-reflective film 2006 is formed thereon as shown in FIG. 28A. Then, the glass substrate 2007 as a support substrate is bonded onto the anti-reflective film 2006 by using a transparent adhesive as shown in FIG. 28B. In this case, it is preferable that the glass substrate 2007 is made thinner toward its end portion., 37733=However, in the method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-213645, a pulling force is merely exerted to the jig 2608, 2609 to separate the Si wafer 2601 and the epitaxial layers 2603, 2604, 2605 at the porous layer 2602. With this method, it is not necessarily possible to make sure that the separation is effected at the porous Si layer 2602. When separated by the pulling force, the epitaxial layers 2603, 2604, 2605 may sometimes be broken or impaired. Thus, photoelectric conversion devices provided by this method may have a low yield or low product quality., 90152=A movable supply pipe 1112 acting as both a common fluid supply pipe and a nozzle vertical-movement mechanism is connected to the five nozzles 1102 a to 1102 e via a distributor 1113., 132118=Then, the liquid phase growth method described in Example 1 is used to epitaxially grow an n+-type Si layer 2004, for example, 1 \u03bcm thick on the porous layer 2002 as shown in FIG. 30C. Subsequently, a p\u2212-type Si layer 2003, for example, 30 \u03bcm thick is epitaxially grown thereon as shown in FIG. 30D. These layers form the second semiconductor layer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations According to the method of producing a photoelectric conversion device of the present invention characterized in that there is a portion at least at a part of the end portions of the bonded semiconductor substrate and support substrate in which the semiconductor substrate and the support substrate are not bonded to the other, and that a fluid is jetted against a side surface of the bonded semiconductor substrate and support substrate to separate the first and the second semiconductor layers of the semiconductor substrate, the separation can be effected between the first and the second semiconductor layers with a high yield. Further, the active layer of the photoelectric conversion device will not be impaired, so that photoelectric conversion devices can be provided with high quality. Thus, the semiconductor substrate or the support substrate is rarely broken, which results in increase of the production yield of the photoelectric conversion device. Accordingly, photoelectric conversion devices can be produced at a low production cost. The bonded substrate 2701 that has been bonded using steps similar to those in Examples 1 to 7 is held by the substrate holder 2708 from both surfaces of the substrate 2701 so as to stand perpendicularly. Then, the water jet nozzle 2704 placed above the bonded substrate 2701 is allowed to jet a pressurized fluid against a recess or gap formed by beveling of the bonded substrate 2701, in the direction parallel to the",
