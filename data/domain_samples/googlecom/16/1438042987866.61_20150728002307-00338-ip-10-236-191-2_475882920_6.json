Taylor teaches an operating mechanism for a rolling door having power operated means for rolling up and rolling down the door. In one version there is a drive gear for the door shaft which supports the rolling door and a further drive gear for a idler shaft which helps to feed the flexible rubber curtain into its guide channels. These drive gears are floatingly mounted on the respective shafts for free rotation. By means of a dog and pin arrangement, means are provided for accommodating excess winding and unwinding forces which develop in this system as a result of a variation in the actual linear velocity of travel of the bottom or outer end portion of the curtain during unwinding and winding operations. This variation in linear velocity arises from the variation in the diameter of the windings of the rolled door on the door shaft as it is rotated while the speed of rotation of the door shaft itself is constant. There are several difficulties with this known arrangement including the need for an idler roll and the need to precisely locate the dog member and pin associated with each shaft to ensure that engagement and positive drive only occur at the appropriate times., 26314=A simpler arrangement for accommodating the variation in speed of a roll up door is disclosed in copending Canadian patent application Ser. No. 554,847 filed Dec. 18, 1987 by the present applicant. In this known arrangement, there is an idler drive member supported about the idler or guide roll of the roll door assembly. An adjusting element including a coil spring is provided and is capable of accommodating the differences in the turning forces developed at the idler drive member and at the idler or guide roll. This adjusting element is connected between the idler drive member and the idler or guide roll.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be clear to those skilled in the construction of rolling doors that various modifications and changes can be made to the rolling door assembly described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Accordingly all such modifications and changes as fall within the scope the appending claims are intended to be part of this invention. An optional feature of the present rolling door assembly is a travelling wind bar 140, illustrated at least in part in FIG. 1. This wind bar moves up and down the flexible curtain by means of a wind bar strap 142 of known construction. Although the use of such a travelling wind bar is not essential to the operation of the present rolling door assembly, it is advantageous in that it improves the appearance of the flexible door. It also helps to maintain the side edges to the curtain in the guide channels. particularly in the case of wide doors. It will be noted that a rolling door constructed in accordance with the invention is relatively easy to restore to an operating condition if it is struck or otherwise caused to come out of its guide channels. In this event, the hinged portion of each guide channel is opened up so as to gain access Lo the chain loop members and the adjusting mechanisms. The bottom bar 66 is restored to its original condition (or replaced",
