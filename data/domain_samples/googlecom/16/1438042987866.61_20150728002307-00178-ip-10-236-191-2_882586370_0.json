In addition to the text of the review, the markup can include a reviewRating, which expresses a summary of the review as a numeric value. Reviews We support reviews and ratings for a wide range of schema.org types, including businesses, products, and different creative works such as books or movies. When Google finds valid reviews or ratings markup, we may show a rich snippet that includes stars and other summary info from reviews or ratings. Reviews and ratings are two ways to express an evaluation about a range of items. A review is the evaluation described as text, and a rating is an evaluation described on a numeric scale (such as 1 to 5). A rating can be marked marked up in conjunction with, and as part of, a textual review.

Try to use the most specific type for your reviewed items. We are in the process of implementing JSON-LD support for this Rich Snippet type. At the current time, we recommend using microdata or RDFa.
