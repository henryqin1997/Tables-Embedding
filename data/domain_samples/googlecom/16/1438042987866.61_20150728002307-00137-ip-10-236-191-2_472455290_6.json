As has been described, according to the invention, the weight of the movable parts can be reduced to satisfy one of the requisites for the high-speed positioning, thanks to the use of a soft and light material as the material of the guide rails. It is also possible to use polyimide resin, polyethylene resin, nylon and so forth as the material of the slide surface member, besides the aforementioned PTFE reinforced with glass fibers. The use of such macromolecule materials, however, is not exclusive and any other material having a self-lubricating nature can be used as the material of the slide surface member. Other materials than chromium, such as nickel or the like, can suitably be used as the surface material of the guide rails by an electric plating. Various metals and alloys such as iron, stainless steel and the like, and even ceramics can be used as the surface material, if a metalllization method is used",
