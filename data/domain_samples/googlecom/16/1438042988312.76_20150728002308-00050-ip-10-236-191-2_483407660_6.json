    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above described preferred embodiment provides a self locking propeller nut which avoids the need for exterior mechanical retaining devices, which utilizes a combination of features to positively lock the nut in place against rotation by means of frictional gripping forces, and which is economically manufactured and easily installed and removed. Various other embodiments and variations to this preferred embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. The threads 16 illustrated in FIG. 5 are produced through use of a threaded mold insert rod shaped complementarily to the nut threads shown in the figure. The mold insert (not shown) may have an otherwise normal cylindrical thread, but with its thread ridges ground flatter and flatter, to smaller and smaller diameter, toward its inner end. The insert is unscrewed when the plastic has set up. FIG. 5 shows the nut threads 16 in greater detail, illustrating one preferred manner in which they may be tapered. As indicated in this somewhat exaggerated representation, the inner ridges 24 of the threads are of substantially uniform diameter, but the troughs 25 become shallower and shallower, and consequently of smaller and smaller diameter, as the threads progress into the nut. This causes the propeller shaft threads 11 to dig into the plastic nut structure after the nut is screwed",
