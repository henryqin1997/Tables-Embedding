It is contemplated that many changes and modifications may be made, by one of ordinary skill in the art, to the materials and arrangements of the elements of the invention without department from the spirit and scope of the invention as disclosed above. Thus, an improved cursor control and display system has been described. The present invention permits a user to select desired menu titles on a menu bar by movement of a cursor control over a surface. Sub-command items may be specified for execution by the computer control display system in the same manner, such that the operator need not enter command characters on a keyboard or the like in order to access and execute most system functions. Accordingly, it is possible for a user to select and execute a variety of commands without the necessity of inputting characters on a keyboard, as is commonly required in the art. Rather, the present invention permits fast entry and execution of commands, such as for example in a word processing system or the like, wherein large blocks of text or other data may be manipulated or operated upon simply by movement of the cursor",
