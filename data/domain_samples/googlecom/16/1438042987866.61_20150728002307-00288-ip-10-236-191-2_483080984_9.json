Accordingly, the scope of protection of this invention is limited only by the following claims and their equivalents. A first complementary embodiment of this invention utilizes off-the-shelf electric components. For example, a transformer, such as a Tripplite PR15; a Multi-Access Unit of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM); 3M connectors; AT&T telephone plugs; and XIRCOM LAN cards are commonly available. Such components are well known articles of commerce and are not described further. ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS Using the CPDDS all components associated with power supply for the workstations are contained in one system having transformers and low voltage cables. As an example, for a 15 workstation network, without the CPDDS, 30 transformers and multiple extension cords and multiple power outlets would be required. They would have to be unpacked and assembled. With the CPDDS such a system requires only three transformers 10 plugged in to line current 30. Data cables 21 are run between the three mounted, and interconnected, MAUs 31 in the CPDDS and to each LAN connector. Without the custom length cables several shorter cables would need to hooked together to achieve the correct length. Custom power cables are attached to the transformers and then to each workstation 33,",
