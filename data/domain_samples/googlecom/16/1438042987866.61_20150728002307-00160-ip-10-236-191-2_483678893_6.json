It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. To enable the extruder with the sheet extrusion head to be moved away from the calender rolls 34, 35, the pressure loading of the drive unit 49 is reversed so that the cylinder 50 with the thrust box 51 and the upper bearing 54 with the bearing support 55 is moved slightly away upwards. Subsequently, after the bolt 42 has been released by the drive unit 44, the extruder with the wide extrusion head can be moved away corresponding to the direction of the arrow 2. In this moved-away position, the upper extrusion head part 12 with the associated extrusion head insert can then be tilted up by means of the tilting drive 22, whereby the sheet extrusion ejector die 16 is opened. In this position, the latter can be cleaned. Since the bearings 54 are designed as spherical ball-and-socket joints and since the clamping device 60 is guided with",
