They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents. Thus, the wake up system of the present invention activates an electronic touch screen device from it quiescent low power state without requiring the user to manipulate specific buttons. Moreover, the present invention system activates an electronic touch screen device without requiring the user to have extensive knowledge of the operation requirements of the electronic touch screen device. In addition, the wake up system of the present invention does not require any type of clocking signal to operate, enabling analog to digital converter circuits 304 and 306 of FIGS. 3 and 4 which utilize a clocking signal to remain off when the electronic touch screen device is within its quiescent low power state. Furthermore, since the wake up system of",
