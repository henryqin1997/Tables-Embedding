    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense. In addition, the disclosed architecture provides reliable execution of processes without risking the local server process operation by providing a plurality of agent processes executing in separate address spaces that communicate with the local server process via a database link. Hence, if a fault occurs in a foreign process, such as a foreign server instance or an agent executing an external routine, the link with the faulty process can be terminated without adversely affecting the local server process. The present invention provides an architecture providing scaleable, efficient access to data in a heterogeneous database environment, where the non-native characteristics of the distributed database system are transparent to the clients. The agent process 300 provides a framework that allows for translation and transaction services to operate in a heterogeneous environment, where specialized modules provide dynamic translation services for respective database operations. The query services module provides dynamic translation of query statements between the client application and the foreign database systems, while the local server process maintains control of completing the statement. The transaction services module coordinates and manages transactions among the",
