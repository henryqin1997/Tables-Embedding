    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not only by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. While the above contains many specifities, these should not be construed as limitations, but rather as an exemplification of the preferred embodiments thereof. Another benefit is that all the layers in the laminate sheet article 30, may be optionally specified to have absorptive properties, that additionally allow saturation with aqueous as well as solvent based cleaning liquids. The laminate sheet article 30, may also be manufactured in a reverse fashion, wherein two thinner resilient layers are used to form the outer moderately flexible layers 21 and 23, and a thicker substantially flexible absorbent compressible layer is specified for the center layer 22. This is viable because the said support layers also provide efficient cleaning surfaces. Still further, the sonic bonding apparatus has the flexibility of bonding partial coverages of cleaning layers 21, and 23, on support layer 22, as for example, one side of the support layer 22 can be covered with a cleaning layer 21 covering and bonded to 75% of its surface, while having a cleaning layer covering and bonded to only 25% of its opposing surface. It permits for example, the bonding of many variations of synthetic and natural, nonwoven and woven fabrics, as well as films, foams, felts, microsponge sheet material, fiberglass, mineral wool and paper, as well",
