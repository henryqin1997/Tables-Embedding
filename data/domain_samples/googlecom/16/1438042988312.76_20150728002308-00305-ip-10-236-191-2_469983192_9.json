The system can be used with a personal computer including an ISDN card. The computer can include a server that performs functions of the server to implement worldwide calls. Accordingly, the present invention is to be limited solely by the scope of the following claims. Assume remote telephone 414 goes off hook to answer the call. In that case, server 406 bridges together the call from server 406 to the user's remote phone 414. User's primary local telephone 402 stops ringing. The call between remote in-calling phone 416 and user's remote phone 414 is conferenced together in server 406 and appears as a normal call to both partcipants. In contrast to the EKTS-supported embodiment of system 100, the call is not displayed on other telephones, even other telephones associated with the same local switch 404 as local telephone 402, such as a telephone 403. Accordingly, the call cannot be observed and observers cannot bridge in. An alternative embodiment in an analog-based system 400 in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 4. In the analog system, two analog lines 401 come from a local central office switch 404, and are connected to a server 406. A first analog line 401A is used by a user's primary telephone 402. A server data base",
