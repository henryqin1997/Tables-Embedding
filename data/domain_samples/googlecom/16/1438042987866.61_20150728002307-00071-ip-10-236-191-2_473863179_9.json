Further details regarding this arrangement are disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/042,812 filed Jan. 9, 2002 by Cheng-Lien Chiang entitled \u201cSemiconductor Package Device\u201d which is incorporated by reference., 132619=Contact probes include the tweezer contact, side contact, Y contact, micro spring contact, spring and pin, probe and fuzzbutton, probe pin, conductive elastomer, metal contact in elastomer, etched pocket in silicon, conductive epoxy bump, plated metal bump on flex, metal-coated diamond/flex, and probe and conductive elastomer. The most common contact probes are spring-loaded pins and stamped metal contractors. Yet despite this extensive collection of contact probes, recent literature reports that at 0.5 mm pitch, many contact methods are being evaluated and the contacting problems are far from solved. See Crowley, \u201cSocket Developments for CSP and FBGA Packages,\u201d Chip Scale Review, May 1998, pp. 37-40., 213234=The particles can be deposited in the recess before the sacrificial or undercoat plated metal is deposited in the recess, or the particles can be co-deposited in the recess with the sacrificial or undercoat plated metal. A modified composite electroless nickel plating method to co-deposit nickel and hard insulative particles is described in Zou et al., \u201cA New Electrical Surface Joining Technology For Flip Chip Application,\u201d 2001 International Symposium on Microelectronics, pp. 565-570, which is incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For instance, the materials, dimensions and shapes described above are merely exemplary. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. Advantageously, the test probe of the present invention is reliable and inexpensive. The contact surface is small due to the bumped terminal, is jagged due to the particles, is compliant due to the elastomer, and is accessible due to the routing line. As a result, the test probe of the present invention significantly enhances throughput, yield and performance characteristics compared to conventional test sockets and contact probes, and is particularly well-suited for BGAs with a solder ball pitch of 0.5 mm or less. The test probe is well-suited for contacting a wide variety of electronic devices including semiconductor chips, chip scale packages, chip size packages and BGAs. For instance, the test probe can be configured for a semiconductor chip to determine whether the chip is a known-good-die (KGD) suitable for being packaged in a BGA. Likewise, the test probe can be configured for a BGA to determine whether the package is suitable for being soldered to a printed circuit board. Moreover, the contact surface is sufficiently jagged to penetrate the oxide layer on the corresponding electrode of",
