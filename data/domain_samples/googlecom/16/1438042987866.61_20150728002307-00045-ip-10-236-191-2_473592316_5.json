    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of this disclosure. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto. In another embodiment, the information regarding uni-colored tiles may be present on the client side, either fully, for a part of the map area, or for a single tile. If the index is present on the serving part of the system, it may respond to the request for the information, and the client may simply request the information for the area it is currently displaying, and use the information to avoid requesting uni-colored tiles. Another embodiment would allow the TFEs (or TBEs through the TFEs) to respond to a request for a tile, not with a tile, but by returning the information that the requested tile only contains a certain color, and therefore can be replaced by a generic tile on the receiving side. In any such cases, the TBE or TFE causes the remote computing device to use uni-color map tiles that are locally available, so that such tiles do not have to be served. There are several ways of implementing optimizations based",
