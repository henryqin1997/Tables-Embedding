For example, a different laser surgical tool, such as a laser dental surgical tool, could be used. Since the smoke evacuation system of the present invention is activated only when the laser cutting beam is activated, the smoke evacuator system is only on for a small portion of the time the patient is in surgery. For this reason the CO2 gas that is removed from the patient by the vacuum source does not need to be recycled. In the prior art smoke evacuator system, the system is operated continuously during surgery, making the recovery and recycling of the contaminated CO2 desirable. However, with the smoke evacuator system of the present invention, such small quantities of CO2 are used that the contaminated CO2 can be filtered and disposed of out the exhaust port. This method assures the smoke eliminator system cannot transfer any contaminated matter to the patient undergoing the procedure, or to the next patient whose surgery requires the use of the smoke evacuator system. When the surgeon presses the foot switch to activate the cutting laser beam, at",
