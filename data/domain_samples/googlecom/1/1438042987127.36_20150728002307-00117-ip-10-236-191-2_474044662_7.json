Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may provide several advantages. For example, the data system 16 is capable of analyzing images to provide both 2D and 3D information indicative of a workpiece 18. In addition, the system 10 utilizes a fan beam having a shallow incidence angle that is configured to detect specific features of a workpiece to improve the accuracy of identifying the same, as well as identifying surface debris in order to differentiate actual features from common structures associated with the workpiece (e.g., ridge-like structures in the central regions of composite tape material). Moreover, the system 10 is capable of inspecting the workpiece 18 during processing and in real time, which may reduce down time and increase efficiency. Thus, the system 10 provides a hybrid of 2D and 3D information by analyzing",
