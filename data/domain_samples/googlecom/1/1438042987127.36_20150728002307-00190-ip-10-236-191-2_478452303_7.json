For example, if an order received by the exchange complies with the rule-set, as determined by system 2340, then the order may be executed by, e.g., a specialist or other market-maker on the exchange. Otherwise, as described above, the order may be canceled or rejected (e.g., by OFP 110 or consolidating broker-dealer 130), or the investor 110 may be given an opportunity to either modify the order such that it complies with the rule-set, to accept a modified order that complies with the rule-set, or to accept the order with an increased fee (commission). Alternatively, for example (and as described above), an order not complying with the rule-set may be automatically modified (e.g., by reducing the order size) so that it complies with the rule-set, and then executed by, e.g., a specialist on the exchange. As with systems 1850 and 1950 described above, system 2340 shown in FIG. 23 may be, for example, a computer implemented system that analyzes various characteristics of orders originating from investor 110 to determine whether the order complies with the rule-set. Moreover, system 2340 may be, for example, either a part of, or associated with, the exchange of equities market 140 that is using it. The invention is not limited in this manner.}",
