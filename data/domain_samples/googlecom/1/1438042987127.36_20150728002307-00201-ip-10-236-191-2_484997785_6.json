It should be understood that only exemplary embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. In other embodiments of the present invention, the latch mechanism is attached to a top edge of a panel that is not the lead panel. Latch mechanism 40 is displayed in FIG. 8 as part of latch assembly system 140 (shown in FIG. 5) of the present invention. The extending of continuously-hinged panels 12, 13 and lead operable wall panel 14 along track 20 is shown. As continuously-hinged panels 12, 13 and lead operable wall panel 14 extend, lead operable wall panel 14 pivots about pivot member 35 of lead trolley 130. As shown in FIG. 9, when lead operable wall panel 14 swings open, catch member 50 of latch mechanism 40 catches latch pin 134 and locks lead operable wall panel 14 in a straight position. After lead operable wall panel 14 locks into place, continuously-hinged panels 12, 13 and lead operable wall panel 14 extend to their straightened, wall-forming orientation. Lead trolley 130 includes pivot member 35 that is pivotally coupled to lead trolley 130 at one end and is attached at the",
