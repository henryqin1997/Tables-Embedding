The ultimate product in each case is, of course, essentially the same, the difference being that in conventional processes a single function is performed, viz., separation of as large an amount of salts as possible, whereas in the present invention two functions are performed, viz., separation of salt materials from water and dilution of salt containing solutions. However, the present invention is not limited to this two function system and may be practice-d simply by using a system comprising a semipermeable membrane having on one side thereof a saline solution and on the other side thereof a fresh water solution containing avo atile solute.}",
