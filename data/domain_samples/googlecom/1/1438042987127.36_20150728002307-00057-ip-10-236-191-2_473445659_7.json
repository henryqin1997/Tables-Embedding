The algorithms described above may alternatively be generated by a rapidly operating dedicated microprocessor, although this may result in some loss of computational speed. Although the system has been described as using a touch tablet, other possibilities exist for generating the x and y coordinates. Thus a full range of options are open to the operator and are shown as inputs to computer 12 and include colour selection, implement and medium, pressure, time of application (for airbrush etc) and blurring of the eraser or water colour simulation. It has been found that the system produces extremely good artistic results. With the addition of other peripherals (e.g. modem) the image could be directly relayed to remote locations or recorded onto disc for transportation to a remote location or for future use. The system described is not restricted to use in the broadcasting art alone. After completion of the creating process the image may be converted into hard copy for example using the photoplotter 36 so that it can be used as normal artwork for magazines and so on. As shown a cursor display block 39 may be included to indicate, on the monitor 17, the position of the stylus. The cursor block may include an offset device controlled by the patch size",
