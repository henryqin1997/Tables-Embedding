    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6417=FIG. 2 shows an example of quantizers for embedding a binary reference signal by quantizing features of the host media signal. One quantizer has a series of bins of size delta that correspond to a first binary symbol, while the other quantizer has a series of bins of size delta, offset by a distance delta/2 relative to the first quantizer, that correspond to a second binary symbol. The host signal feature, which has a value varying over some dimensions, such as time, space, time and space, frequency or frequency band, etc. is quantized at discrete samples to fall within a quantization bin corresponding to the reference signal values to be encoded in those samples. In this example, the reference signal comprises the sequence 1101001, and is repeated in the host signal features of the block being encoded.}",

No. 7,076,082) which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/895,867, filed Jun. 28, 2001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,483,927), which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/278,049, filed Mar. 22, 2001. These applications are hereby incorporated by reference., 72827=In this implementation, reference signal detection comprises extracting peaks from the Fourier magnitude data. There are numerous approaches for peak detection and extraction. For example, one could isolate points with high energy relative to the average energy in the Fourier magnitude plane. Alternatively, one could isolate points with high energy in a small local region. Statistical measures such as the mean, median, variance, etc. are usually employed to reliably detect peaks. One example of a peak detection and extraction strategy is described by Nicolas Devillard. See N. Devillard, \u201cInfrared jitter imaging data reduction algorithms\u201d, Jun. 21, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A copy of this paper is attached., 25154=The subject matter of the present application is related to that disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/278,049 filed Mar. 22, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/256,629, filed Dec. 18, 2000, which are hereby incorporated by reference., 74377=The detector then fits the extracted peaks to an ellipse (128). The particular method is a variation of the least squares approach described by Fitzgibbon et al. See, A. Fitzgibbon, M. Pilu, R. Fisher \u201cDirect least-square fitting of Ellipses\u201d, International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vienna, August 1996; Extended version available as DAI Research Paper #794; and M. Pilu, A. Fitzgibbon, R. Fisher \u201cEllipse-specific Direct least-square Fitting\u201d, IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, Lausanne, September 1996, which are hereby incorporated by reference. For this approach, it is beneficial to reflect the extracted points over the entire Fourier magnitude plane, taking care of the conjugate symmetry. Reflecting the points before feeding them to the ellipse fitting algorithm will ensure a better least squares ellipse fit. Note that reflection is not a necessary condition, the approach could also be applied to points located in a portion (e.g. half plane or quarter plane) of the Fourier domain. Copies of these papers are attached., 37832=For an example of embedding data in a spectrogram of an audio signal, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/661,900, filed Sep. 14, 2000, entitled WATERMARKING IN THE TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Quantization based embedding and reading of steganographic data as described in this document and those incorporated by reference may be performed in the time-frequency domain as detailed in application Ser. No. 09/661,900. In particular, the calibration and/or synchronization signals described in Ser. No. 09/661,900 may be embedded and read using the techniques described in this document.}",
