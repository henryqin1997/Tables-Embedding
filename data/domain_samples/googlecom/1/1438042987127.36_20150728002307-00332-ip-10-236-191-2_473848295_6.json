Thus any change or amendment relating to the shape, size, dimensions, materials used in the manufacturing process, variations in the accessories or the stages involved in the installation process, as long as they do not constitute a new inventive step, must be considered part of the scope and the aims of the present invention. The above clearly illustrates the advantages of the method of installation of tiles proposed in the present invention, which can be accomplished by any unskilled person without any prior preparation but straight onto a bare wall or floor with a bare concrete surface or surface already covered with other materials such as oldfashioned tiles, marble, plastics, etc. Several other accessories, such as by way of example hooks, towel suspension hooks, soap cases and other sanitary accessories may be used in conjunction with the tiles of the invention. Specially formed pieces might also be used to produce false roofs, roof tiles, partition panels, decorative articles, furniture, etc. Further FIG. 12 shows an illustrative form of a floor lining 19, i.e. a special piece suitable for installation close and normally to the floor, which can be used in conjunction with the tiles of the invention and can be fixed onto the wall by means of a series of bolts passing through holes 20.
