A nonwoven web is typically porous, having a porosity of about 15% or more. Depending upon the particular nonwoven employed, the fiber length can range from about 100 micrometers to infinity, i.e., continuous fibrous strands. Nonwoven mats or webs are further described in \"The Nonwovens Handbook\" edited by Bernard M. Lichstein, published by the Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, New York, 1988., 58359=Novolac phenolic resins are characterized by being acid catalyzed and having a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than 1:1. Typically, the ratio of formaldehyde to phenol is within a range of about 0.4:1 to about 0.9:1. Examples of the acid catalysts used to prepare novolac phenolic resins include sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, oxalic, or p-toluenesulfonic acids. Although novolac phenolic resins are typically considered to be thermoplastic resins rather than thermosetting resins, they can react with other chemicals (e.g., hexamethylenetetraamine) to form a cured thermosetting resin., 137475=The thermoset binder material for Example 17 consisted of 40% silica filler, 30% ER1, and 30% fatty amidoamine resin, trade name \"Genamid 490,\" commercially available from Henkel Corp., Gulph Mills, Pa. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 15:1., 27862=This is a division of application Ser. No. 08/145,773, filed Oct. 29, 1993, pending, which, in turn, was a division of application Ser. No. 07/919,541, filed Jul. 24, 1992, now abandoned, which, in turn, was a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/811,784, filed Dec. 20, 1991, now abandoned., 136934=The thermoset binder material for Example 16 consisted of 20% silica filler, 68% isophthalic polyester resin, commercially available from Fibre Glast Corp., under the trade designation \"Plast #90,\" and 12% polyglycol commercially available from Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., under the trade designation \"E400.\" This example did not contain the third layer of the nonwoven. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 15:1., 130367=For example 2 the reinforcing fiber was 28 gauge chrome bare wire, commercially available from Gordon Company, Richmond, Ill., under the catalog number 1475 (R27510). The backing contained a strand spacing of approximately 9 strands/cm., 148368=Two backings were made in a similar manner to that of Example 1, except the third layer of nonwoven was not included and a different binder resin was used. In Example 37, only continuous fiberglass filament yarns were used, whereas in Example 38 two different reinforcing yarns were used side-by-side as the layer of reinforcing yarns. The fiberglass filament yarn was available from Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., Toledo, Ohio. The continuous fiberglass filament yarn used was ECG 75 0.7Z 1/0 finish 603, stock number 57B54206, having 30 filaments per inch. The second backing was formed 50/50 side-by-side with one half being the same fiberglass .filament as use in Example 37, the second half being made using 1000 denier polyester yarn described in Example 1. The binder resin used was 37.5% urethane resin (known under the trade designation \"BL-16\" from Uniroyal Chemical Corp.); 12.5% of a solution of 35% methylene diamine/65% 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate; 16.5% ER1; 16.5% ER2; and 17.0% of GEN. The backings were each coated with a standard calcium carbonate filled resole phenolic make resin, which was partially cured in known manner. Grade 120 ceramic aluminum oxide, commercially available from 3M under the trade designation \"Cubitron\", was formed into agglomerate abrasive particles in the manner of U.S. Pat. No. 4,799,939 to form agglomerates of average particle size of about 750 micrometers. These agglomerates were drop coated onto the partially cured make coating by conventional techniques; A standard calcium carbonate filled resole phenolic resin size coating was utilized and the resulting structure given a standard cure and flex. Tensile tests were performed as with previous examples, with the results presented in Table 2., 144657=The backing for Example 29 was made in a similar manner to that of Example 1 except for the following changes. There was no reinforcing fibrous strand. There were four layers of the thermoset binder/nonwoven composite wrapped around the hub. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 8:1., 75518=As stated above, the fibrous reinforcing material can also be in the form of a mat structure containing adhesive or melt-bondable fibers used to integrate parallel strands of individual fibers. In this way, \"individual\" parallel strands are embedded, i.e., incorporated, within a fibrous reinforcing mat. These parallel strands can be in direct contact with each other along their length, or they can be separated from each other by a distinct distance. Thus, the advantages of using individual fibrous reinforcing strands can be incorporated into a mat structure. Such melt-bondable fibers are disclosed in European Patent Application 340,982, published Nov. 8, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference., 136286=The backing for this set of examples was made according to \"Procedure I for Preparing the Backing\" and the coated abrasives were made according to the \"General Procedure of Making the Coated Abrasive.\" The nonwoven material was PET1NW. The reinforcing fiber for this set of examples was 1000 denier multifilament polyester yarn, commercially available from Hoechst Celanese under the trade designation \"Trevira T-786.\" There were approximately 9 reinforcing strands/cm. For each example a different thermoset material was employed., 135865=For Example 15 the nonwoven mat was a continuous spun fiberglass mat that was approximately 0.25 millimeter thick with a weight of 42 g/m2 commercially available from Fibre Glast Inc., Dayton, Ohio, under the trade designation \"Plast\" 260. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven mat was about 10:1., 137832=The thermoset binder material for Example 18 consisted of 20% calcium carbonate filler, 32% ER1, 32% ECA, and 16% ER2, diluted to 95% solids with SOL. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 14:1., 134590=For Example 12 the nonwoven mat was a spunbonded polyester that was approximately 0.3 millimeter thick with a weight of 72 g/m2, commercially available from Remay Inc. under the trade designation \"Remay\" Style 2405. There was no third layer of nonwoven mat in this example. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 10:1., 141195=The thermoplastic binder material for Example 24 consisted of 0.11 millimeter thick plasticized PVC film, matte finish,. commercially available from the Plastics Film Corp. of America. There was no reinforcing fibrous strands present. The backing construction was altered slightly from \"Procedure II for Preparing the Backing.\" The backing was prepared by applying two layers of the thermoplastic binder material, one layer of the nonwoven, followed by a layer of a fiberglass scrim and finally a third layer of the thermoplastic binder material. The fiberglass scrim had 1 yarn/cm in the cross belt direction and 2 yarns/cm in the belt length direction. The fiberglass yarn was 645 yield multifilament E glass, commercially available from Bayex Corp., St. Catherine's, Ontario, Canada. The ratio of thermoplastic binder to nonwoven was about 30:1., 143666=A fiberglass scrim, as described above in Example 24 was saturated via a knife coater with the thermoset binder of Example 26. The knife coater gap was set to approximately 0.25 millimeter. Two layers of this thermoset/fiberglass scrim composite were wrapped onto the hub. The thermoset binder was then cured for 30 minutes at 88\ufffd C. The ratio of thermoset binder to scrim was about 3:1., 132984=For example 10 the reinforcing fiber was a fiberglass roving 1800 yield, commercially available form Manville Corp., Denver, Colo., under the trade designation \"Star Roving 502, K diameter.\" The backing contained approximately 6 strands/cm., 138127=The thermoset binder material for Example 19 consisted of 10% chopped fiberglass (1.5 millimeter in length), commercially available from the Fibre Glast Corp. under the trade designation \"Plast #29,\" 36% ER1, 36% ECA, and 18% ER2, diluted to 95% solids with SOL. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 15:1., 134127=For example 11 the nonwoven mat was a spunbonded polypropylene that was approximately 0.2 millimeter thick with a weight of 43 g/m2 commercially available from Remay Inc., Old Hickory, Tenn., under the trade designation \"Typar\" Style 3121. There was no third layer of nonwoven mat in this example. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 15:1., 146553=Backing was made in a similar manner to that of Example 1, except the third layer of nonwoven was not included. The abrasive was attached to the backing using an acrylate pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), RD 41-4100-1273-0, available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. PSA coat weight was 1.6 grams (dry weight) per square meter. Abrasive backing laminated to the backing was 3M 211K \"Three-M-ite\", \"Elek-tro-cut,\" grade 80, commercially available from the 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn., 133333=The backing for this set of examples was made according to \"Procedure I for Preparing the Backing,\" with slight modifications as indicated. The coated abrasives were made according to the \"General Procedure for Making the Coated Abrasive.\" The thermoset binder material consisted of 40% ER1, 40% ECA, and 20% ER2. The thermoset binder material was diluted to 95% solids with SOL. The reinforcing fiber for this set of examples was 1000 denier multifilament polyester yarn, commercially available from the Hoechst Celanese, Charlotte, N.C., under the trade designation \"Trevira T-786.\" There were 9 reinforcing strands/cm. For each example a different nonwoven mat was utilized., 138975=The backing for this set of examples was made according to \"Procedure II for Preparing the Backing\" and the coated abrasive were made according to the \"General Procedure for Making the Coated Abrasive.\" The nonwoven material was PET1NW. The reinforcing fibrous strand for this set of examples was 1000 denier multifilament polyester yarn, commercially available from Hoechst Celanese under the trade designation \"Trevira T-786.\" For each example a different thermoplastic binder material was employed., 89498=The average particle size of the abrasive grain for advantageous applications of the present invention is at least about 0.1 micrometer, preferably at least about 100 micrometers. A grain size of about 100 micrometers corresponds approximately to a coated abrasive grade 120 abrasive grain, according to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard B74.18-1984. The abrasive grain can be oriented, or it can be applied to the backing without orientation, depending upon the desired end use of the coated abrasive backing., 71115=The reinforcing fiber denier, i.e., degree of fineness, for preferred fibrous reinforcing material ranges from about 5 to about 5000 denier, typically between about 50 and about 2000 denier. More preferably, the fiber denier will be between about 200 and about 1200, and most preferably between about 500 and about 1000. It is understood that the denier is strongly influenced by the particular type of fibrous reinforcing material employed., 132311=For example 8 the reinforcing fiber was 250 denier polypropylene multifilament yarn, commercially available from Amoco Fabric and Fibers Co., Atlanta, Ga., under the trade designation \"1186.\" The backing contained approximately 12 strands/cm., 84805=Other useful materials or components that can be added to the backing for certain applications of the present invention are pigments, oils, antistatic agents, flame retardants, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet stabilizers, internal lubricants, antioxidants, and processing aids. Examples of antistatic agents include graphite fibers, carbon black, metal oxides such as vanadium oxide, conductive polymers, humectants and combinations thereof. These materials are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 07/893,491, filed Jun. 4, 1992, and 07/834,618, filed Feb. 12, 1992, both of which are incorporated by reference., 130020=For example 1 the reinforcing fiber was 1000 denier polyester multifilament yarn, commercially available from Hoechst Celanese, Charlotte, N.C., under the trade designation \"T-786.\" The backing contained a strand spacing of approximately 9 strands/cm., 66665=The fibrous reinforcing material can be in the form of fibrous strands, a fiber mat or web, or a switchbonded or weft insertion mat. Fibrous strands are commercially available as threads, cords, yarns, rovings, and filaments. Threads and cords are typically assemblages of yarns. A thread has a very high degree of twist with a low friction surface. A cord can be assembled by braiding or twisting yarns and is generally larger than a thread. A yarn is a plurality of fibers or filaments either twisted together or entangled. A roving is a plurality of fibers or filaments pulled together either without a twist or with minimal twist. A filament is a continuous fiber. Both rovings and yarns are composed of individual filaments. A fiber mat or web consists of a matrix of fibers, i.e., fine threadlike pieces with an aspect ratio of at least about 100:1. The aspect ratio of a fiber is the ratio of the longer dimension of the fiber to the shorter dimension., 131048=For example 4 the reinforcing fiber was 1800 denier polyester multifilament yarn, commercially available from Hoechst Celanese, Charlotte, N.C., under the trade designation \"T-786.\" The backing contained approximately 5 strands/cm., 140440=The thermoplastic binder material for Example 23 consisted of 0.11 millimeter thick plasticized PVC film, matte finish, commercially available from the Plastics Film Corp. of America. There was no reinforcing fibrous strands present. The backing construction was altered slightly from \"Procedure II for Preparing the Backing.\" The backing was prepared by applying one layer of the thermoplastic binder material, one layer of the nonwoven, followed by a second layer of the thermoplastic binder material, a second layer of a nonwoven and finally a third layer of the thermoplastic binder material. The ratio of thermoplastic binder to nonwoven was about 15:1., 48865=The length \"L\" of the coated abrasive belt 1 can be any desired length. Typically, it is about 40-1500 centimeters (cm). The thickness \"T1 \" of the endless, seamless backing loop 5 is typically between about 0.07 millimeter (mm) and about 1.5 mm for optimum flexibility, strength, and material conservation. Preferably, he thickness of the endless, seamless backing 5 is between about 0.1 and about 1.0 millimeter, and more preferably between about 0.2 and about 0.8 millimeter for coated abrasive applications. The thickness \"T1 \" of the endless, seamless backing loop 5 of coated abrasive belt 1 does not generally vary by more than about 15% around the entire length \"L\" of the belt 1, FIG. 1. Preferably, the thickness \"T1 \" throughout the entire endless, seamless backing loop 5 does not vary by more than about 10%, more preferably by no more than about 5% and most preferably by no more than 2%. Although this variance refers to a variance along the thickness \"T1 \" of the backing 5, this variance also generally applies to a backing coated with adhesives and abrasive material, i.e., the thickness \"T\" of the belt 1., 142140=The thermoplastic binder material for Example 25 consisted of 0.13 millimeter thick clear polyurethane film, commercially available from the. Stevens Elastomeric Corp., Northampton, Mass., under the trade designation \"HPR625FS.\" The reinforcing fibrous strands in the backing were present at approximately 6 strands/cm. The ratio of thermoplastic binder to nonwoven was about 30:1., 138544=The thermoset binder material for Example 20 consisted of 40% silica filler, 15% graphite, 22.5% ER1, and 22.5% fatty amidoamine resin, trade name \"Genamid 490,\" commercially available from Henkel Corp. This example did not contain the third layer of the nonwoven. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 20:1., 144140=The backing for Example 28 was made in a similar manner to that of Example 1 except for the following changes. A layer of fiberglass scrim, the same fiberglass scrim as described in Example 24, was inserted between the last layer of the nonwoven and the reinforcing fibrous strands. There was no layer of nonwoven placed on top of the layer of reinforcing fibrous strands. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 13:1., 57938=Resole phenolic resins are characterized by being alkaline catalyzed and having a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of greater than or equal to 1:1. Typically, the ratio of formaldehyde to phenol is within a range of about 1:1 to about 3:1. Examples of alkaline catalysts useable to prepare resole phenolic resins include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, organic amines, or sodium carbonate., 135411=For Example 14 the nonwoven mat was an aramid based nonwoven with approximately 2.5 cm long fibers. The nonwoven was approximately 0.1 millimeter thick with a weight of 9 g/m2, commercially available from International Paper, Purchase, N.Y., under the trade designation \"8000032/0418851.\" The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 27:1., 135029=For Example 13 the nonwoven mat was a spunbonded polyester that was approximately 0.11 millimeter thick with a weight of 21 g/m2, commercially available from Remay Inc. under the trade designation \"Remay\" Style 2205. The ratio of thermoset binder to nonwoven was about 14:1., 129419=The backing for this set of examples was made according to \"Procedure I for Preparing the Backing\" and the coated abrasives were made according to the \"General Procedure for Making the Coated Abrasive.\" The nonwoven mat was PET1NW and the thermoset binder material consisted of 40% OR1, 40% ECA, and 20% OR2. The thermoset binder material was diluted to 95% solids with SOL. The ratio of resin to nonwoven web was about 15:1. For each example a different reinforcing fibrous strand was utilized., 139593=The thermoplastic binder material for this Example 21 consisted of 0.11 millimeter thick plasticized PVC film, matte finish, commercially available from the Plastics Film Corp. of America, Lemont, Ill. The reinforcing fiber in the backing was present at a strand spacing of approximately 6 strands/cm. The ratio of thermoplastic binder to nonwoven was about 30:1.}",
