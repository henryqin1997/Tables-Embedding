Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplications of a preferred embodiment. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. Although it is preferable that the electrode assembly 21 include housing 71 and cover plate 80 to engage mechanical forceps 20 therebetween, in some cases it may be preferable to manufacture the disposable electrode assembly 21 such that only one piece, e.g., housing 71 is required to engage mechanical forceps 20. Although it is preferable to vertically align electrodes 110 and 120, in some cases it may be preferable to offset the opposing electrodes 110 and 120 relative to one another either longitudinally or transversally to suit a particular purpose. From the foregoing and with reference to the various figure drawings, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications can also be made to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, although it is preferable that electrodes 110 and 120 meet in parallel opposition, and, therefore, meet on the same plane, in some cases it may",
