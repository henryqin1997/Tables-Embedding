    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{219412=An eighth embodiment relates to a case when a quartz substrate is used as the substrate 1 in the arrangement shown in the fourth embodiment. In the present embodiment, the amorphous silicon film 3, i.e. the starting film, is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom. Further, the heating temperature in forming the thermal oxide film in the heat treatment shown in FIG. 20C is set at 950\ufffd C. In this case, the oxide film is formed quickly and the gettering effect cannot be fully obtained, so that the concentration of oxygen within the atmosphere is lowered. In concrete, the oxygen concentration within the nitrogen atmosphere is set at 10 volume %. In this case, the treatment time is set at 300 minutes. Under such conditions, the thermal oxide film having about 500 angstrom of thickness may be obtained. In the same time, the time necessary for gettering may be earned., 155256=Further, the temperature of the second heat treatment is preferable to be higher than that of the first heat treatment and it is preferable to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film. Further, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 256581=The thickness of the amorphous silicon film 86 is 1600 angstrom. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film must be thicker than a thickness which is required in the end as described later. When the amorphous silicon film 86 is crystallized by means of only heating, the thickness of the starting film (amorphous silicon film) 86 is set at 800 angstrom to 5000 \u03bcm or preferably, 1500 to 3000 angstrom. It is uneconomical from the aspect of production cost if the thickness is thicker than the above-mentioned thickness range because it takes more time in forming the film. When the thickness is thinner than the above-mentioned thickness range on the other hand, the crystal may be grown nonuniformly or the reproducibility of the process may become bad. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 25A is obtained., 368531=Next, a heat treatment is implemented in the temperature range from 550\ufffd C. to 650\ufffd C. in the state shown in FIG. 37B to crystallize the amorphous silicon film 263 and to obtain a crystal silicon film 265. This heat treatment is implemented in a reducing atmosphere. The temperature of this heat treatment is preferable to be a temperature below the distortion point of the glass substrate. Because the distortion point of the Corning 1737 glass substrate is 667\ufffd C., it is preferable to set the upper limit of the heating temperature here at about 650\ufffd C., leaving some margin., 72942=By the way, the inventors et. al. have developed a technology for obtaining the crystal silicon film through a heat treatment at a lower temperature than that of the prior art by introducing a metal element (e.g. nickel) which promotes the crystallization of silicon to the amorphous silicon film (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Hei. 6-232059 and Hei. 7-321339). These methods allow not only the crystallization speed to be increased and the crystallization to be achieved in a shorter time, but also a high crystallinity to be obtained uniformly across the wide area, thus having a crystallinity which fits for practical use, as compared to the prior art crystallization of amorphous silicon film implemented only by way of heating or by way of the irradiation of laser light., 274413=Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 94. An opening is created on the mask in a region 95. The amorphous silicon film 93 is exposed at the region where the opening 95 is created. The opening 95 has a thin and long rectangular shape in the longitudinal direction from the depth to the front side of the figure. Preferably, the width of the opening 95 is 20 \u03bcm or more. The length thereof in the longitudinal direction may be determined arbitrarily., 453999=Then, a silicon nitride film 427 and a silicon oxide film 428 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 47E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 428 needs not be formed in this case. Thus, the thin film transistor is covered by the silicon nitride film. The reliability of the thin film transistor may be enhanced by arranging as described above because the silicon nitride film is dense and has an excellent interfacial characteristic., 204922=Next, an amorphous silicon film 3, which turns out to be a crystal silicon film later, is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by the low pressure thermal CVD. The reason why the low pressure thermal CVD is used is because thereby, the quality of the crystal silicon film obtained later is better, i.e. the film quality is denser in concrete. Beside the low pressure thermal CVD, the plasma CVD or the like may be used. The amorphous silicon film fabricated here is desirable to have 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3 of concentration of oxygen within the film. It is because oxygen plays an important role in the later step of gettering the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon., 458879=The fabrication process of the present embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. 48A through 48E. At first, a silicon oxide film 434 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate 433 of Corning 1737 (distortion point: 667\ufffd C.). This film is formed by using sputtering. The silicon oxide film 434 has a function of suppressing the diffusion of impurities from the glass substrate in the later steps. It also has a function of relaxing stress acting the class substrate and a silicon film to be formed later., 394544=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 40A, a plasma treatment is implemented within the reduced pressure atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed. In the state shown in FIG. 40A, the reference numeral (299) denotes a glass substrate, (300) an underlying film, (301) an active layer formed of the crystal silicon film and (298) a thermal oxide film formed again after eliminating the thermal oxide film for gettering. After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 40A, a silicon oxynitride film 302 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using the plasma CVD using mixed gas of oxygen, silane and N2 O or the plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the former is used here., 350327=Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 232 and 233 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom. Then, laser light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light may be also used instead of the laser light. Then, a silicon nitride film 244 and a silicon oxide film 245 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 34E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 245 needs not be formed., 529661=Next, the gate electrode 562 is anodized again within the electrolyte after peeling off the resist mask 563 to form a dense anodic oxide 565 in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. The anodic oxides 564 and 565 described above may be formed differently by changing the electrolytes to be used. When the porous anodic oxide 564 is to be formed, acidic solution containing 3 to 20 weight % of citric acid, oxalic acid, chromic acid or sulfuric acid may be used. Here, acidic aqueous solution containing 5 weight % of oxalic acid is used., 543669=Further, because the Corning 1737 glass whose distortion point is 667\ufffd C. is used as the glass substrate in the embodiments 67 through 69, the heating temperature in the thermal oxidation step is set at 600\ufffd C. However, if a glass whose distortion point is 593\ufffd C. is used for example, the heating temperature in the thermal oxidation step may be preferably around 500 to 550\ufffd C., 539487=Next, P (phosphorus) ions are doped again. The doping is implemented with acceleration voltage in the range of 60 to 90 kV and the dosage in the range at: 1\ufffd1012 to 1\ufffd1014 atoms/cm2. The acceleration voltage is set at 80 kV and the dosage at 1\ufffd1014 atoms/cm2 in the present embodiment. At this time, although P (phosphorus) ions do not transmit through the gate electrodes 582 and 583, they transmit through the gate insulating film 581 and are injected to the active layers 579 and 580. Accordingly, the region into which phosphorus ions have been injected twice turn out to be N-type high concentration impurity regions 594 through 597 and the regions into which phosphorus ions have been injected once turn out to be N-type low concentration impurity regions 598 through 601., 483760=It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 460 is formed as thick as 2000 angstrom or more, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 464 by its thickness. Although the offset gate region is formed also in the present embodiment, it is not shown in the figures because its size is small, its contribution due to the existence thereof is small and the figures might otherwise become complicated. It is noted that it must be careful in forming the anodic oxide film having the dense film quality as thick as 2000 angstrom or more because it requires more than 200 V of applied voltage., 183887=In the aspects of the invention described above in (30) through (33), preferably, the thickness of the thermal oxide film is 200 to 500 angstrom and the metal element is doped to the amorphous silicon film after forming the amorphous silicon film in concentration of 1\ufffd1016 to 5\ufffd1019 atoms/cm3. Further, while a metal element is preferable to use in forming the crystal silicon film, at least one or more types of elements selected from Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Cu and Au may be used as the metal element similarly to the aspects of the invention described above., 527159=As the thermal oxide film 559 is formed on the surface of the crystal silicon film 556, non-coupled Si is also generated. The Si atoms couple with dangling bond of Si at the grain boundary, thus passivating the defects of the crystal silicon film 556. The density of the defects at the grain boundary of the crystal silicon film 556 may be fully reduced by forming the silicon oxide film 559 in a thickness of about 500 angstrom with respect to the crystal silicon film 556 having the thickness of 1000 angstrom., 513696=It is noted that the crystallinity of the crystal silicon film 538 may be improved further by implementing light annealing by means of laser light, infrared rays or ultraviolet rays, or heat annealing as necessary after the crystallization step. The light annealing and the heat annealing may be used in combination. However, when the laser annealing is implemented, the thickness of the amorphous silicon film 536, i.e. the starting film of the crystal silicon film 538, is set below 1000 angstrom, or preferably 700 to 800 angstrom, in order to effectively supply thermal energy to the crystal silicon film 538., 349834=By the same principle, a source region 243 and a drain region 240 having strong P-type are formed in a manner of self-alignment and a low concentration impurity region 242 is formed in the same time. Further, a channel forming region 241 is formed in the same time. It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 232 and 233 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness., 247791=It may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 66 and 67 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom. Then, laser light or intense light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Then, a silicon nitride film 78 and a silicon oxide film 79 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 24E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 79 needs not be formed in this case., 331859=After removing the organic substances, thermal oxidation is implemented within an oxygen atmosphere at 640\ufffd C. to form a thermal oxide film 185 of 100 angstrom thick. This thermal oxide film has a high interfacial characteristic with a semiconductor layer and composes a part of a gate insulating film later. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 32A is obtained. After that, a silicon oxynitride film 189 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. Iii forming the film, plasma CVD using mixed gas of silane add N2 O and oxygen is used. It is noted that plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O may be used., 300855=Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 149 and 150 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom. Then, laser light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light may be used instead of the laser light. Then, a silicon nitride film 161 and a silicon oxide film 162 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 29E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 162 needs not be formed., 238617=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 23A, a plasma treatment is implemented within a reduced pressure atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed. In the state shown in FIG. 23A, the reference numeral (39) denotes a glass substrate, (40) an underlying film, (41) an active layer formed of the crystal silicon film and (38) a thermal oxide film formed again after eliminating the thermal oxide film for gettering. After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 23A, a silicon oxynitride film 42 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom., 217509=The irradiation of laser light may be implemented after the step shown in FIG. 20C. It is also important to form the amorphous silicon film 3 which is formed in FIG. 20A as the starting film in a thickness of 200 to 2000 angstrom. It is because the annealing effect exerted by the irradiation of laser light becomes high when the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is thin. Although there is no specific limit on the laser light to be used, preferably laser light in the ultraviolet region, e.g. excimer laser in the ultraviolet region is used. In concrete, while KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm), XeCl excimer laser (wavelength: 308 nm) and the like may be used, the KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm) is used in the present embodiment. Beside laser light, the annealing may be implemented by irradiating intense light by using an ultraviolet lamp or an infrared lamp., 303616=The film whose crystallization has been greatly promoted by such method has a domain which can be considered as a mono-crystal in which an electron spin density measured by ESR is less than 3\ufffd1017 cm-3 and the concentration of nickel element as the minimum value measured by SIMS is less than 3\ufffd1017 cm-3. Substantially, no grain boundary exists in this domain and high electrical characteristics equivalent to a mono-crystal silicon wafer can be obtained., 441225=This dense anodic oxide film 377 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage. Here, the exposed silicon oxynitride film 372 and the thermal oxide film 368 are etched by utilizing dry etching. Then, the porous anodic oxide film 376 is eliminated by using mixed acid in which acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid are mixed. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 45D is obtained., 273902=At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 92 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the Corning 1737 glass substrate 91. Next, an amorphous silicon film 93 which is the starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be less than 2000 angstrom as described before. It is noted that plasma CVD may be used instead of the low pressure thermal CVD., 205678=However, it must be careful here because the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film is hampered if the oxygen concentration is higher than the above-mentioned range of concentration. The concentration of other impurities such as those of nitrogen and carbon is preferred to be low to the utmost. In concrete, the concentration must be below 2\ufffd1019 cm-3. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film 3 is 1600 angstrom. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film must be thicker than a thickness which is required in the end as described later., 322934=At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 175 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the Corning 1737 glass substrate 174. It is noted that a quartz substrate may be used instead of the glass substrate. Next, an amorphous silicon film 176 which is t-he starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 600 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be less than 2000 angstrom as described before. It is noted that plasma CVD may be also used instead of the low pressure thermal CVD., 442577=It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 377 is formed as thick as 2000 angstrom or more, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 381 by its thickness. Although the offset gate region is formed also in the present embodiment, it is not shown in the figures because its size is small, its contribution due to the existence thereof is small and the figures might otherwise become complicated., 291514=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 28A, a silicon oxynitride film 125 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using plasma CVD using mixed gas of oxygen, silane and N2 O or plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the former is used in the present embodiment. The silicon oxynitride film 125 composes the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 121. It is noted that a silicon oxide film may be used beside the silicon oxynitride film., 360817=When the Corning 1737 glass substrate (distortion point: 667\ufffd C.) is used for instance, the higher gettering effect can be obtained when the temperature in gettering nickel element by forming the thermal oxide film is 700\ufffd C. rather than when it is 650\ufffd C. However, if the heating temperature for forming the thermal oxide film is set at 700\ufffd C. while using the Corning 1737 glass substrate, the glass substrate deforms as a result., 259987=The concentration of oxygen within the atmosphere for implementing the heat treatment for the crystallization has to be in an order of ppm, or preferably, less than 1 ppm. Inert gases such as argon, beside nitrogen, or their mixed gas may be used as the gas which occupies the most of the atmosphere for implementing the heat treatment for the crystallization. The lower limit of the heating temperature for the crystallization is preferred to be more than 450\ufffd C. from the aspects of its effectiveness and reproducibility. On the other hand, the upper limit thereof is preferred to be less than the distortion point of the used glass substrate. When the Corning 1737 glass substrate whose distortion point is 667\ufffd C. is used like the present embodiment, its upper limit is set at 650\ufffd C., leaving some margin., 511245=Here, it is difficult to obtain the effect of promoting the crystallization if the nickel concentration within the amorphous silicon film is less than 1\ufffd1016 atoms/cm-3. when the nickel concentration is above 5\ufffd1019 atoms/cm-3, the characteristics as a semiconductor of the silicon film thus obtained is lost and the characteristic as a metal appears. Therefore, conditions such as the concentration of nickel within the nickel acetate solution, a number of times of application and an applied amount are set in advance so that the average nickel concentration within the silicon film finally obtained falls in the range of 1\ufffd1016 atoms/cm3 to 5\ufffd1019 atoms/cm3. It is noted that the concentration of nickel may be measured by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry)., 403945=By the same principle, a source region 337 and a drain region 334 having strong P-type are formed in a manner of self-alignment and a low concentration impurity region 336 is formed in the same time. Further, a channel forming region 335 is formed in the same time. It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 326 and 327 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness., 453449=It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 415 and 416 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in con-act with the channel forming region by that thickness. Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 415 and 416 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom. Then, laser light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light may be also irradiated instead of the laser light., 382927=Next, patterning is implemented to form a pattern 277 formed of the laterally grown region. The concentration of nickel element which remains within the pattern 277 made from the laterally grown region thus obtained may be reduced further as compared to the case shown in the 39-th embodiment. This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown region is low originally. In concrete, the concentration of nickel element within the pattern 277 made from the laterally grown region may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less., 509662=As shown in FIG. 54A, a silicon oxide film is formed as an underlying film 535 on a glass substrate 534 (Corning 1737, distortion point: 667\ufffd C.) by mean., of plasma CVD or low pressure CVD. Next, a substantially intrinsic (I type) amorphous silicon film 536 is formed by the plasma CVD or low pressure CVD in a thickness of 700 to 1000 angstrom. Here, the low pressure CVD is used for forming the both films. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film 536 is 700 angstrom., 418025=It is also effective to add a hydrogen plasma treatment after forming the underlying film. It is also effective to implement a plasma treatment in an atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed. These treatments are effective in eliminating carbon component which is adsorbed on the surface of the underlying film and in enhancing the characteristic of interface with a semiconductor film formed later. Next, an amorphous silicon film 353, which turns out to be a crystal silicon film later, is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom by the low pressure thermal CVD. The reason why the low pressure thermal CVD is used is because thereby, the quality of the crystal silicon film obtained later is better, i.e. the film quality is denser in concrete. Beside the low pressure thermal CVD, the plasma CVD may be used., 429782=Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 361. An opening is created on the mask in a region 362. The amorphous silicon film 360 is exposed at the region where the opening 362 is created. The opening 362 has a thin and long rectangular shape in the longitudinal direction from the depth to the front side of the figure. Preferably, the width of the opening 362 is 20 \u03bcm or more. The length thereof in the longitudinal direction may be determined as necessary., 429298=FIGS. 44A through 44E show the fabrication process according to the present embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 359 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on a quartz substrate 358. Next, an amorphous silicon film 360 which is the starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. It is noted that plasma CVD may be also used instead of the low pressure thermal CVD., 235071=Next, laser light is irradiated to activate the regions into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light may be irradiated instead of laser light. Thus, a source region 30, a channel forming region 32, a drain region 34 and low concentration impurity regions 31 and 33 are formed in a manner of self-alignment. The one designated by the reference numeral 33 in FIG. 22D is the region called the LDD (lightly doped drain). It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 28 is formed as thick as 2000 angstrom or more, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 32 by its thickness., 517070=Next, the crystal silicon film 53E is patterned into an island shape to form an active layer 540 of the TFT. Then, a silicon oxide film is formed as a gate insulating film 541 in a thickness of 1000 angstrom by means of plasma CVD. Because the surface of the active layer 540 has been flattened in the thermal oxidation process, the gate insulating film 541 may be deposited with a favorable coating capability. After that, an aluminum film containing a trace amount of scandium not shown is formed in a thickness of 6000 angstrom on the surface of the gate insulating film 541 by means of electron beam deposition and is patterned as shown in FIG. 54E to form a gate electrode 542., 212989=Because the Corning 1737 glass substrate whose distortion point is 667\ufffd C. is used in the present embodiment, the heating temperature is set at 640\ufffd C. Then, a thermal oxide film 6 as shown in FIG. 20D is formed by implementing the heat treatment under such condition. Here, the thermal oxide film 6 is formed in a thickness of 200 angstrom by implementing the heat treatment for 12 hours. Because the thermal oxide film 6 is formed, the thickness of the crystal silicon film 3 reaches to about 1500 angstrom. When the heating temperature is 600\ufffd C. to 750\ufffd C. in the heat treatment, the treatment time (heating time) is set at 10 hours to 48 hours or typically at 24 hours. It is noted that if the heating temperature is 750\ufffd C. to 900\ufffd C., the treatment time is set at 5 hours to 24 hours or typically at 12 hours Further, when the heating temperature is 900\ufffd C. to 1050\ufffd C., the treatment time is set at 1 hour to 12 hours or typically at 6 hours. These treatment times are set adequately depending on the thickness of the oxide film to be obtained as a matter of course. In this step, nickel element is gettered to the thermal oxide film 6 to be formed. In the gettering, oxygen existing within the crystal silicon film, beside that existing within the oxygen atmosphere, plays an important role. That is, oxygen couples with nickel, thus producing nickel oxide, and the nickel element is gettered to the thermal oxide film 6 in this form., 390326=Next, the resist mask 285 is removed. Then, a dense anodic oxide film is formed again. Thai; is, the anodization is implemented again by using the ethylene glycol solution containing 3 weight % of tartaric acid as electrolyte. Then, an anodic oxide film 288 having a dense film quality is formed because the electrolyte infiltrates into the porous anodic oxide film 287. This dense anodic oxide film 288 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage., 304136=Further, the domain which can be considered as a mono-crystal contains hydrogen by less than 5 atom % to 1\ufffd1015 cm-3. This value is clarified by the measurement carried out by the SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry). By fabricating a thin film transistor by utilizing such mono-crystal or the domain which can be substantially considered as a mono-crystal, a semiconductor device which is equivalent to a MOS type transistor fabricated by using a mono-crystal wafer may be obtained., 106758=(29) The present invention provides a semiconductor device having a silicon film having a crystallinity, characterized in that the silicon film contains a metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon in concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm-3 to 5\ufffd1018 cm-3, fluorine atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1015 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1020 cm-3, and hydrogen atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1021 cm-3. It is noted that the unit of concentration \". . . cm-3 \" means the number of atoms (atoms/cm3) per 1 cc and the same applies throughout the present specification., 517772=Then, an oxide layer 543 is formed by implementing anodization within electrolyte by setting the gate electrode 542 at the anode. In this case, the anodic oxide layer 543 having a dense structure is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom by using the ethylene glycol solution containing 3 weight % of tartaric acid as the electrolyte, by setting the gate electrode 542 at the anode and platinum at the cathode and by applying voltage. The thickness of the anodic oxide 543 may be controlled by adjusting the application time of the voltage., 494465=Then, laser light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light such as ultraviolet rays may be also irradiated instead of the laser light. Then, a silicon nitride film 510 and a silicon oxide film 511 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 52E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 511 needs not be always formed. Thus, the thin film transistor is covered by the silicon nitride film. The reliability of the thin film transistor may be enhanced by arranging as described above because the silicon nitride film is dense and has an excellent interfacial characteristic., 251017=Further, the domain which can be considered as a mono-crystal contains hydrogen by less than 5 atom % to 1\ufffd1015 cm-3. This value is clarified by the measurement carried out by the SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry). By fabricating a thin film transistor by utilizing the mono-crystal or the domain which can be substantially considered as a mono-crystal, one which is equivalent to a MOS type transistor fabricated by using a mono-crystal wafer may be obtained., 404438=Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 326 and 327 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom. Then, laser light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been injected. Intense light may be also irradiated instead of the laser light:. Then, a silicon nitride film 338 and a silicon oxide film 339 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG. 41E. Their thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively. It is noted that the silicon oxide film 339 needs not be formed in this case., 226505=This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown domain is low originally. In concrete, the concentration of nickel element within the pattern 17 made from the laterally grown domain may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less. When a thin film transistor is formed by utilizing the laterally grown domain, a semiconductor device having a higher mobility may be obtained as compared to the case when the vertically grown domain as shown in the fourth embodiment (crystal grows vertically on the whole surface in the case of the fourth embodiment) is utilized., 276705=In this state, a heat treatment is implemented at 650\ufffd C. for four hours within an oxygen atmosphere. In this step, an oxide film 99 containing nickel element in high concentration is formed. In the same time, the concentration of nickel element within the silicon film 98 may be reduced relatively. Here, the thermal oxide film 99 is formed in a thickness of 200 angstrom. The thermal oxide film contains the nickel element gettered by the action of chlorine in high concentration. Further, because the thermal oxide film 99 is formed, the thickness of the crystal silicon film 98 is reduced to about 1900 angstrom., 386453=After removing the organic substances, thermal oxidation is implemented within an oxygen atmosphere at 640\ufffd C. to form a thermal oxide film 279 of 100 angstrom thick. This thermal oxide film has a high interfacial characteristic with a semiconductor layer and composes a part of a gate insulating film later. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 39A is obtained. After that, a silicon oxynitride film 283 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using the plasma CVD using mixed gas of silane and N2 O and oxygen or the plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the former is used in the present embodiment., 378320=Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 271. An opening is created on the mask in a region 272. The amorphous silicon film 270 is exposed at the region where the opening 272 is created. The opening 272 has a thin and long rectangular shape in the longitudinal direction from the depth to the front side of the figure. Preferably, the width of the opening 272 is 20 \u03bcm or more. The length thereof in the longitudinal direction may be determined as necessary., 340597=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 33A, a plasma treatment is implemented within EL reduced pressure atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed. In the state shown in FIG. 33A, the reference numeral (205) denotes a glass substrate, (206) an underlying film, (207) an active layer formed of the crystal silicon film and (204) a thermal oxide film formed again after eliminating the thermal oxide film for gettering. After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 33A, a silicon oxynitride film 208 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. The film is formed by using plasma CVE using mixed gas of oxygen, silane and N2 O. It is noted that plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O may be also used in forming the film., 485443=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 51A, a plasma treatment is implemented within the reduced pressure atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed. In the state shown in FIG. 51A, the reference numeral (471) denotes a glass substrate, (472) an underlying film made from a silicon oxide film, (473) an active layer formed of the crystal silicon film. The thermal oxide film 470 is the film formed again after eliminating the thermal oxide film for gettering. Then, a silicon oxide film 474 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom by using the plasma CVD as shown in FIG. 51B., 171436=In the aspects of the invention described above in (21) and (22), the gate insulating film may be formed by utilizing said another thermal oxide film. The second heat treatment is preferably conducted in temperature above 600\ufffd C. and below 750\ufffd C. Further, it is preferable that the temperature of the second heat treatment is higher than that of the first heat treatment. Still more, in these inventions, it is preferable to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film. Preferably, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 179448=According to one aspect of the invention described above in (29), there is provided a semiconductor device having a silicon film having a crystallinity, characterized in that the silicon film contains a metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon in concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm-3 to 5\ufffd1018 cm-3, fluorine atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1015 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1020 cm-3, and hydrogen atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1021 cm-3. In this invention, preferably, the silicon film is formed on the insulating film and fluorine atoms exist in high concentration near the interface between the insulating film and the silicon film., 433634=The concentration of nickel element which remains within the pattern 366 made from the laterally grown region thus obtained may be reduced further as compared to the case shown in the 50-th embodiment. This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown region is low originally. Thus, the concentration of nickel element within the pattern 366 made from the laterally grown region may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less., 162093=Further, it is possible to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film in these inventions. Further, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 164875=In these inventions, the temperature of the second heat treatment is preferable to be higher than that of the first heat treatment. Further, it is possible to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film in these inventions. Still more, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 202526=FIGS. 20A through 20E are diagrams showing the fabrication process in the fourth embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film 2 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate of Corning 1737 (distortion point: 667\ufffd C.). While the silicon oxynitride film is formed by using plasma CVD using silane, N2 0 gas and oxygen as original gases or plasma CVD using TEOS gas and N2 O gas, the former is used in the present embodiment., 335605=Next, the resist mask 191 is removed. Then, a dense anodic oxide film is formed again. That is, the anodization is implemented again by using the ethylene glycol solution containing 3 weight % of tartaric and as electrolyte. Then, an anodic oxide film 194 having a dense film quality is formed because the electrolyte infiltrates into the porous anodic oxide film 193. This dense anodic oxide film 194 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage., 392046=It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 288 is formed so thick to be more than 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 292 by its thickness. Although the offset gate region is formed also in the present embodiment, it is not shown in the figures because its size is small, its contribution due to the existence thereof is small and the figures might otherwise become complicated., 300362=By the same principle, a source region 160 and a drain region 157 having strong P-type are formed in a manner of self-alignment and a low concentration impurity region 159 is formed in the same time. Further, a channel forming region 158 is formed in the same time. It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 149 and 150 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness., 523321=As shown in FIG. 56A, a silicon oxide film is formed as an underlying film 551 on a glass substrate 550 (Corning 1737, distortion point: 667\ufffd C.) in a thickness of 3000 angstrom by means of plasma CVD or low pressure CVD. The plasma CVD is used here. Next, a substantially intrinsic amorphous silicon film 552 is formed by the plasma CVD or low pressure CVD in a thickness of 700 to 1000 angstrom. Here, the thickness of the amorphous silicon film 552 is set at 1000 angstrom., 534741=As shown in FIG. 58A, a silicon oxide film is formed as an underlying film 576 on a glass substrate 575 (Corning 1737) in a thickness of 2000 angstrom. Next, a substantially intrinsic amorphous silicon film is formed by the plasma CVD or low pressure CVD in ai thickness of 700 to 1000 angstrom. Then, a crystal silicon film 577 is formed by the method shown in the 67-th embodiment. It is noted that the amorphous silicon film may be crystallized by using adequate methods such as heat treatment or irradiation of laser. The process which follows is the same even in those cases., 221783=Next, an amorphous silicon film 10 which is the starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be less than 2000 angstrom as described before. It is noted that plasma CVD may be used instead of the low pressure thermal CVD. Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 11. An opening is created on the mask in a domain 12. The amorphous silicon film 10 is exposed at the domain where the opening 12 is created., 468458=The gettering proceeding near the interface is considered to be caused by the existence of stress and defects near the interface. It is also observed that the concentration of fluorine and chlorine is higher near the interface between the silicon film 437 and the thermal oxide film 438. The crystal silicon film thus obtained contains the metal element which promotes the crystallization of silicon in concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm-3 to 5\ufffd1018 cm-3, fluorine atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1015 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1020 cm-3, and hydrogen atoms in concentration of 1\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 1\ufffd1021 cm-3., 312330=Next, a heat treatment is implemented in the temperature range from 550\ufffd C. to 650\ufffd C. in the state shown in FIG. 30B to crystallize the amorphous silicon film 169 and to obtain a crystal silicon film 171. This heat treatment is implemented in a reducing atmosphere. The temperature of this heat treatment is preferable to be a temperature below the distortion point of the glass substrate. Because the distortion point of the Corning 1737 glass substrate is 667\ufffd C., it is preferable to set the upper limit of the heating temperature here at about 650\ufffd C., leaving some margin. Here, the heat treatment is implemented for four hours at 620\ufffd C. within a nitrogen atmosphere containing 3 volume % of hydrogen., 283007=After that, a silicon oxynitride film 106 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using plasma CVD using mixed gas of silane and N2 O or plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the latter is used in the present embodiment. The silicon oxynitride film 106 functions as the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 102., 471191=At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 441 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on a quartz substrate 440. Next, an amorphous silicon film 442 which is the starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 600 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. The thickness of this amorphous silicon film is preferable to be less than 2000 angstrom as described before. Other substrates such as a quartz substrate may be used as the above-mentioned substrate., 482440=This dense anodic oxide film 460 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage. Then, the exposed silicon oxide film 455 and the thermal oxide film 451 are etched by utilizing dry etching. Then, the porous anodic oxide film 459 is eliminated by using mixed acid in which acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid are mixed. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 50D is obtained., 209890=While inert gases such as nitrogen and argon or their mixed gas may be used as the gas which occupies the most of the atmosphere for implementing the heat treatment for the crystallization, nitrogen is used in the present embodiment. The lower limit of the heating temperature for the crystallization is preferred to be more than 450\ufffd C. from the aspects of its effectiveness and reproducibility. On the other hand, the upper limit thereof is preferred to be less than the distortion point of the used glass substrate. Because the Corning 1737 glass substrate whose distortion point is 667\ufffd C. is used in the present embodiment, its upper limit is set at 650\ufffd C., leaving some margin., 444666=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 46A, a silicon oxynitride film 391 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. The film is formed by using the plasma CVD using mixed gas of oxygen, silane and N2 O. It is also possible to use the plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O instead of that., 475510=This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown region is low originally. In concrete, the concentration of nickel element within the pattern 449 made from the laterally grown region may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less. It is also useful to implement the etching processes further after forming the pattern shown in FIG. 49E to eliminate the nickel element existing on the surface of the pattern., 142650=This fact is supported by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) and by measuring the concentration of nickel element within the gate insulating film of the samples whose measured values have been obtained in FIGS. 12 and 13. That is, it was confirmed that while nickel element of more than the level of 1017 cm-3 is measured within the gate insulating film formed by the thermal oxidation, the concentration of nickel element within the gate insulating film formed by the plasma CVD is less than the level of 1016 cm-3. It is noted that the concentration of impurity described in the present specification is defined as the minimum value of the measured values measured by the SIMS., 337366=It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 194 is formed as thick as 2000 angstrom or more, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 198 by its thickness. Although the offset gate region is formed also in the present embodiment, it is not shown in the figures because its size is small, its contribution due to the existence thereof is small and the figures might otherwise become complicated., 538143=Next, P (phosphorus) ions are injected to the island active layers 579 and 580 by means of ion doping by using the gate electrodes 582 and 583 as well as the porous anodic oxides 586 and 587 as a mask. As doping gas, phosphine which has been diluted by hydrogen to 1 to 10 volume % is used. While the doping is implemented with acceleration voltage in the range of 60 to 90 kV and the dosage in the range of 1\ufffd1014 to 8\ufffd1015 atoms/m2, the acceleration voltage is set at 80 kV and the dosage is set at 1\ufffd1015 atoms/cm2 in the present embodiment., 271582=A 20-th embodiment relates to a case when a quartz substrate is used as the substrate 84 in the arrangement shown in the sixteenth embodiment. In the present embodiment, the amorphous silicon film 86, i.e. the starting film, is formed in a thickness of 2000 angstrom. Further, the heating temperature in forming the thermal oxide film in the heat treatment shown in FIG. 25C is set at 950\ufffd C. In this case, the oxide film is formed quickly and the gettering effect cannot be fully obtained, so that the concentration of oxygen within the atmosphere is lowered. In concrete, the oxygen concentration within the nitrogen atmosphere is set at 10 volume %. Further, the heat treatment is implemented in the atmosphere in which the concentration of HCl (volume concentration) to oxygen is set at 3%., 463858=Next, a heat treatment is implemented within a nitrogen atmosphere containing 3 volume % of hydrogen at the temperature 640\ufffd C. in the state shown in FIG. 48B to crystallize the amorphous silicon film 435 and to obtain a crystal silicon film 437. The heating time is four hours. While the heat treatment may be implemented in the temperature range of 500 to 700\ufffd C., it is preferable to be a temperature below the distortion point of the glass substrate. Because the distortion point of the Corning 1737 glass substrate used in the present embodiment is 667\ufffd C., it is preferable to set the upper limit of the heating temperature here at about 650\ufffd C., leaving some margin., 206270=When the amorphous silicon film 3 is crystallized by means of only heating, the thickness of the starting film (amorphous silicon film) 3 is set at 800 angstrom to 5000 \u03bcm or preferably, 1500 to 3000 angstrom. It is uneconomical from the aspect of production cost if the thickness is thicker than the above-mentioned thickness range because it takes more time in forming the film. When the thickness is thinner than the above-mentioned thickness range on the other hand, the crystal may be grown non-uniformly or the reproducibility of the process may become bad. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 20A is obtained. Next, nickel element is introduced to the amorphous silicon film 3 to crystallize it. Here, the nickel element is introduced by applying nickel acetate solution containing 10 ppm (weight conversion) of nickel on the surface of the amorphous silicon film 3., 262863=Because the Corning 1737 glass substrate whose distortion point is 667\ufffd C. is used in the present embodiment, the heating temperature is set at 650\ufffd C. The second heat treatment is implemented in an atmosphere in which 5 volume % of HCl is mixed into oxygen. It is preferable to mix HCl with a ratio of 0.5% to 10% (volume %) to oxygen. It must be careful not to mix above this concentration because, otherwise, the surface of the film becomes rough with the same or more degree of irregularity with the thickness of the film., 323533=Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 177. An opening is created on the mask in a region 178. The amorphous silicon film 176 is exposed at the region where the opening 178 is created. The opening 178 has a thin and long rectangular shape in the longitudinal direction from the depth to the front side of the figure. Preferably, the width of the opening 178 is 20 \u03bcm or more. The length thereof in the longitudinal direction may be determined arbitrarily., 437334=After obtaining the state shown iii FIG. 45A, a silicon oxynitride film 372 which composes a gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using the plasma CVD using mixed gas of silane and N2 O and oxygen or the plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the latter is used in the present embodiment. The silicon oxynitride film 372 functions as the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 368., 540340=Then, as shown in FIG. 59C, while the region which turns out to be the N-channel TFT is covered by polyimide or heat resistant resist 602, the polymide is used here. After that, boron ions are doped in order to invert the conductive type of the active layer 580 from the N-type to the P-type. Diborane which has been diluted to about 1 to 10 volume % by hydrogen is used as the doping gas and the acceleration voltage is set at 80 kV and the dosage of boron is set at 2\ufffd1015 atoms/cm2., 328162=Next, patterning is implemented to form a pattern 183 formed of the laterally grown region. The concentration of nickel element which remains within the pattern 183 made from the laterally grown region thus obtained may be reduced further as compared to the case shown in the 28-th embodiment. This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown region is low originally. In concrete, the concentration of nickel element within he pattern 183 made from the laterally grown region may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less., 471700=Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 443. An opening is created on the mask in a region 444. The amorphous silicon film 442 is exposed at the region where the opening 444 is created. The opening 444 has a thin and long rectangular shape in the longitudinal direction from the depth to the front side of the figure. Preferably, the width of the opening 444 is 20 \u03bcm or more. The length thereof in the longitudinal direction may be determined as necessary., 224405=In this state, a heat treatment is implemented at 640\ufffd C. for four hours within an oxygen atmosphere. In this step, an oxide film 16 containing nickel element in high concentration is formed. In the same time, the concentration of nickel element within the silicon film 15 may be reduced relatively. Here, the thermal oxide film 16 is formed in a thickness of 200 angstrom. The thermal oxide film contains the gettered nickel element in high concentration. Further, because the thermal oxide film 16 is formed, the thickness of the crystal silicon film 15 is reduced to about 1900 angstrom., 306758=FIGS. 30A through 30E are diagrams showing the fabrication process according to present embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film 168 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate 167 of Corning 1737 (distortion point: 667\ufffd C.). The silicon oxynitride film is formed by using the plasma CVD using silane, N2 O gas and oxygen as original gases in the present embodiment. TEOS gas and N2 O gas may be also used as the original gases., 363096=FIGS. 37A through 37E are diagrams showing the fabrication process according to present embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film 262 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate 261 of Corning 1737 (distortion point:667\ufffd C.). The silicon oxynitride film is formed by using the plasma CVD using silane, N2 O gas and oxygen as original gases in the present embodiment. The plasma CVD using TEOS gas and N2 O gas may be also used instead of that., 519073=When the impurity ions are injected to the active layer 540, the gate electrode 542 and the anodic oxide 543 around thereof function as a mask, thus defining the regions into which the impurity ions have been injected as the source region 544 and the drain region 545 and defining the region into which no impurity ion has been injected as a channel 546. It is noted that the doping conditions such as the dosage and the acceleration voltage are controlled so that the concentration of the impurity ions in the source region 544 and the drain region 545 turns out to be in the range of 3\ufffd1019 to 1\ufffd1021 atoms/cm3. Further, after the doping, laser light is irradiated to activate the impurity ions injected to the source region 544 and the drain region 545., 221122=A ninth embodiment relates to a case of growing crystal in the form different from that in the fourth embodiment. That is, the present embodiment relates to a method of growing the crystal in a direction parallel to the substrate, i.e. a method called lateral growth, by utilizing the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon. FIGS. 21A through 21E show the fabrication process according to the ninth embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 9 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the Corning 1737 glass substrate 8. A quartz substrate may be used of course instead of the glass substrate., 460188=Next, an amorphous silicon film 435, which turns out to be a crystal silicon film later, is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by the low pressure thermal CVD. The reason why the low pressure thermal CVD is used is because thereby, the quality of the crystal silicon from obtained later is better, i.e. the film quality is denser in concrete. Beside the low pressure thermal CVD, the plasma CVD may be used. The amorphous silicon film fabricated here is desirable to have 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3 of oxygen concentration within the film., 526776=The thermal oxide film 559 is formed in a thickness of about 500 angstrom by heating for 12 hours at 600\ufffd C. within the atmosphere in which 450 ppm of NF3 is added to oxygen gas. As a result, the thickness of the crystal silicon film 556 which has been about 1000 angstrom before the formation of the thermal oxidation is reduced to about 750 angstrom., 168846=In the aspects of the invention described above in (19) and (20), the second heat treatment is preferably conducted in temperature above 600\ufffd C. and below 750\ufffd C. The gate insulating film may be formed by utilizing said another thermal oxide film. Further, it is preferable that the temperature of the second heat treatment is higher than that of the first heat treatment. Still more, in these inventions, it is possible to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film. Further, preferably, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 253172=At first, a silicon oxynitride film 85 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate 84 of Corning 1737 (distortion point: 667\ufffd C.). The silicon oxynitride film is formed by using plasma CVD using silane, N2 O gas and oxygen as original gases in the present embodiment. It is noted that this film may be formed by using plasma CVD using TEOS gas and N2 O gas., 461585=The upper limit of the thickness of this amorphous silicon film is about 2000 angstrom. It is because a thick film is disadvantageous in obtaining the effect of the irradiation of laser light implemented later. That is, the most of laser light irradiated to the silicon film is absorbed by the surface of the film. The lower limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film 435 is practically about 200 angstrom, though it depends on a method for forming the film. If the thickness is below that, there will be a problem in the uniformity of the film., 535770=Next, after eliminating the thermal oxide film 578 by using etchant made from buffer hydrofluoric acid, the crystal silicon film 577 is patterned into a shape of island to form active layers 579 and 580, respectively. Further, a silicon oxide film 581 which composes a gate insulating film is deposited in a thickness of 1500 angstrom by means of plasma CVD. It is noted that the active layer 579 composes the N-channel type TFT and the active layer 580 composes the P-channel type TFT., 377636=FIGS. 38A through 38E show the fabrication process according to the 41-st embodiment. At first, a silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying film 269 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the Corning 1737 glass substrate 268. It is noted that a quartz substrate may be used instead of the glass substrate. Next, an amorphous silicon film 270 which is the starting film of a crystal silicon film is formed in a thickness of 600 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be less than 2000 angstrom as described before. It is noted that plasma CVD may be also used instead of the low pressure thermal CVD., 494082=It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 498 and 499 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness. Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 498 and 499 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom., 309139=Next, an amorphous silicon film 169, which turns out to be a crystal silicon film later, is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by the low pressure thermal CVD. The reason why the low pressure thermal CVD is used is because thereby, the quality of the crystal silicon film obtained later is better, i.e. the film quality is denser in concrete. Beside the low pressure thermal CVD, the plasma CVD or the like may be used. The amorphous silicon film fabricated here is desirable to have 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3 of concentration of oxygen within the film. It is because oxygen plays an important role in the later step of gettering the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon. However, it must be careful here because the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film is hampered if the oxygen concentration is higher than the above-mentioned range of concentration., 310087=The concentration of other impurities such as those of nitrogen and carbon is preferred to be low to the utmost. In concrete, the concentration must be below 2\ufffd1019 cm-3. The upper limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is about 2000 angstrom. It is because a thick film is disadvantageous in obtaining the effect of the irradiation of laser light implemented later. That is, the most of laser light irradiated to a silicon film is absorbed by the surface of the film. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film must be thicker than a thickness which is required in the end as described later. The lower limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film 169 is practically about 200 angstrom, though it depends on a method for forming the film., 408184=A 48-th embodiment relates to a case in which patterning of an active layer of a thin film transistor is devised in order to enhance the effect of annealing by the irradiation of laser light. FIGS. 42A through 42F show a process for fabricating the thin film transistor according to the present embodiment. At first, a silicon oxide film or silicon oxynitride film is formed as an underlying layer on a Corning 1737 glass substrate 344., 479261=After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 50A, a silicon oxide film 455 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. The film is formed by using the plasma CVD. The silicon oxide film 455 functions as the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 451. It is effective to contain halogen element within the silicon oxide film 435. In this case, it is possible to prevent the function of the gate insulating film as an insulating film from dropping by the influence of the nickel element (or another metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon) existing within the active layer by fixing the nickel element by the action of the halogen element., 79822=Further, although the quality of the crystal silicon film obtained by irradiating laser light is good, ridges (irregularity) are formed on the surface of the crystal silicon film if the thickness of the film is less than 1000 angstrom. When laser light is irradiated to the silicon film, the silicon film is melt instantly and expands locally. The ridges are formed on the surface of the crystal silicon film to relax internal stress caused by this expansion. A difference of elevation of this ridge is about 1/2 to 1 time of the thickness of the film. For instance, when laser annealing is implemented after crystallizing an amorphous silicon film whose thickness is about 700 angstrom by way of heating, ridges of 100 to 300 angstrom in height are formed on the surface thereof., 354523=At first, a silicon oxide film of silicon oxynitride film 251 is formed as an underlying layer on a Corning 1737 glass substrate 250. Next, an amorphous silicon film is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by using the low pressure thermal CVD. It is noted that this amorphous silicon film turns out to be a crystal silicon film 252 through the crystallization process described below., 247304=By the same principle, a source region 77 and a drain region 74 having strong P-type are formed in a manner of self-alignment and a low concentration impurity domain 76 is formed in the same time. Further, a channel forming region 75 is formed in the same time. It is noted that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 66 and 67 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness., 230094=After removing the organic substances, thermal oxidation is implemented within an oxygen atmosphere at 640\ufffd C. to form a thermal oxide film 19 of 100 angstrom thick. This thermal oxide film has a high interfacial characteristic with a semiconductor layer and composes a part of a gate insulating film later. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 22A is obtained. After that, a silicon oxynitride film 23 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom. While the film may be formed by using plasma CVD using mixed gas of oxygen, silane and N2 O or plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O, the former is used in the present embodiment. The silicon oxynitride film 23 functions as the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 19., 288007=The one designated by the reference numeral 116 here is the region called the LDD (lightly doped drain). It is noted that when the dense anodic oxide film 111 is formed as thick as 2000 angstrom or more, an offset gate region may be formed on the outside of the channel forming region 115 by its thickness. Although the offset gate region is formed also in the present embodiment, it is not shown in the figures because its size is small, its contribution due to the existence thereof is small and the figures might otherwise become complicated., 250463=The film whose crystallization has been greatly promoted by such method has a domain which can be considered as a mono-crystal in which an electron spin density measured by ESR is less than 3\ufffd1017 cm-3 and the concentration of nickel element as the minimum value measured by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) is less than 3\ufffd1017 cm-3. Substantially, no grain boundary exists in this domain and high electrical characteristics equivalent to a mono-crystal silicon wafer can be obtained., 148492=In any of these aspects, the temperature of the second heat treatment is preferable to be higher than that of the first heat treatment and it is preferable to anneal in a plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film. Further, the concentration of oxygen contained in the amorphous silicon film is preferable to be 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 286448=Then, a dense anodic oxide film is formed again. That is, the anodization is implemented again by using the ethylene glycol solution containing 3 weight % of tartaric acid as electrolyte. Then, an anodic oxide film 111 having a dense film quality is formed because the electrolyte infiltrates into the porous anodic oxide film 110. This dense anodic oxide film 111 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage., 234206=This dense anodic oxide film 28 is 1000 angstrom thick. The thickness is controlled by adjusting applied voltage. Here, the exposed silicon oxynitride film 23 and the thermal oxide film 19 are etched by utilizing dry etching. Then, the porous anodic oxide film 27 is eliminated by using mixed acid in which acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid are mixed. Thus, the state shown in FIG. 22D is obtained., 176303=In the aspects of the invention described above in (23) through (25), preferably, a quartz substrate is used as the substrate for forming the amorphous silicon film and the gate insulating film is formed by utilizing said another thermal oxide film. Further, in these inventions, it is possible to anneal in the plasma atmosphere containing oxygen and hydrogen after eliminating the thermal oxide film. Still more, preferably, the concentration of oxygen contained within the amorphous silicon film is 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 255863=The amorphous silicon film fabricated here is desirable to have 5\ufffd1017 cm-3 to 2\ufffd1019 cm-3 of concentration of oxygen within the film. It is because oxygen plays an important role in the later step of gettering the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon. However, it must be careful here because the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film is hampered if the oxygen concentration is higher than the above-mentioned range of concentration. The concentration of other impurities such as those of nitrogen and carbon is preferred to be low to the utmost. In concrete, the concentration must be below 2\ufffd1019 cm-3., 263409=A thermal oxide film 89 containing chlorine as shown in FIG. 25D is formed by implementing the heat treatment under such condition. Here, the thermal oxide film 89 is formed in a thickness of 200 angstrom by implementing the heat treatment for 12 hours. Because the thermal oxide film 89 is formed, the thickness of the crystal silicon film 88 reaches to about 1500 angstrom., 269386=The irradiation of laser light is implemented after the step shown in FIG. 25C. It is also important to form the amorphous silicon film 86 which is formed in FIG. 25A as the starting film in a thickness of 200 to 2000 angstrom. It is because the annealing effect exerted by the irradiation of laser light becomes high when the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is thin. It is preferable to use excimer laser in the ultraviolet region as the laser light to be used. In concrete, KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm), XeCl excimer laser (wavelength: 308 nm) and the like may be used. Beside laser light, the annealing may be implemented by irradiating intense light by using an ultraviolet lamp for example., 366615=The upper limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is about 2000 angstrom. It is because a thick film is disadvantageous in obtaining the effect of the irradiation of laser light implemented later. That is, the most of laser light irradiated to a silicon film is absorbed by the surface of the film. The Lower limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film 263 is practically about 200 angstrom, though it depends on a method for forming the film., 278585=The concentration of nickel element which remains within the pattern 100 made from the laterally grown region thus obtained may be reduced further as compared to the case shown in the sixteenth embodiment. This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the laterally grown region is low originally. In concrete, the concentration of nickel element within the pattern 100 made from the laterally grown region may be readily reduced to the order of 1017 cm-3 or less., 524404=Then, a mask film 553 having an opening 554 formed of a silicon oxide film of 1500 angstrom thick is formed. The opening 554 has a shape of slit in the longitudinal direction in the direction vertical to the drawing. Preferably, the opening 554 has a width of 20 \u03bcm or more. Meanwhile, the size in the longitudinal direction is determined adequately corresponding to the size of the substrate., 460794=It is because oxygen plays an important role in the later step of gettering the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon (in the step) of gettering nickel in case of the present embodiment). However, it must be careful here because the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film is hampered if the oxygen concentration is higher than the above-mentioned range of concentration. When the oxygen concentration is lower than the abovementioned concentration range on the other hand, it contributes less to the action for gettering the metal element. The concentration of other impurities such as those of nitrogen and carbon is preferred to be low to the utmost. In concrete, their concentration is preferable to be below 2\ufffd1019 cm-3.}",

Accordingly, an insulated gate type semiconductor device such as a TFT having the high mobility and high reliability may be fabricated on the substrate, such as a glass substrate, on which it is difficult to implement a treatment in high temperatures such as around 1000\ufffd C. for example. Further, because the surface of the crystal silicon film may be flattened by the thermal oxidation process and because the gate insulating film composed of a deposited film may be formed with a favorable coating capability even if a step of obtaining the crystal silicon film through the irradiation of laser light is adopted, the interfacial level between the gate insulating film and the active layer may be lowered. Because the crystal silicon film is irradiated by laser light and excels in the crystallinity, the mobility of the semiconductor device may be improved.
