    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In addition, it is possible to readily cope with various kinds of photographing modes, photographic environments and specifications merely by varying the program of the microprocessor, so that it is possible to perform various kinds of signal processing according to different statuses. Further, since the burden of the digital process circuit can be reduced, it is possible to facilitate design, alteration or the like of the digital process circuit. These features are greatly advantageous in providing an image input apparatus applicable to the field of multimedia. The signal processing system for a photographed image is arranged in such a manner that the digital signal processing circuit and the microprocessor performs video signal processing in the above-described shared manner. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a digital video signal processing system having versatility improved to a great extent and hence applicable to other systems. In addition, in the high-resolution photographing mode, the aperture diameter is fixed, and the aperture diameter is selected to be smaller than the fully aperture diameter used in the standard-resolution photographing mode. It is therefore possible to affect high-resolution camera photography at the movement accuracy of the focusing lens equivalent to that used in the standard-resolution photographing mode. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve a low-cost simple arrangement without the need to use expensive components such as a high-precision motor or a high-precision speed reducing mechanism. As hereinabove described in detail, in accordance",
