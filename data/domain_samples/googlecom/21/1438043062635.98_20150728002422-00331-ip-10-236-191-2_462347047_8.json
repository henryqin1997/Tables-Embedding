Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. As seen from the foregoing description, the circuit of the present invention reduces the error contained in the output in a circuit, even when the circuit contains the matching error due to the resistors used. The error in the output of the operational amplifier contains only the component resulting from the matching error with respect to only two resistors, one resistor disposed between the output of the second logarithmic amplifier and the inverting input terminal of the operational ampliffier, and the other resistor disposed in the feedback circuit of the operational amplifier. Voltage eG is connected to the noninverting input terminal of a second logarithmic amplifier LOG/R. Upon receiving voltage eG, amplifier LOG/R produces an output voltage eR as: ##EQU8## In the circuit shown in FIG. 4, an inverting (noninverting) amplifier GAMA succeeding amplifyier LOG/R provides a \"\u03b3(gamma)\" correction with an extremely high precision. eG =VT ln (IshG /IsG) A first logarithmic amplifier LOG/G converts photo current IshG into an output voltage eG as: FIG. 4 shows a color difference signal output circuit for a color sensor incorporating",
