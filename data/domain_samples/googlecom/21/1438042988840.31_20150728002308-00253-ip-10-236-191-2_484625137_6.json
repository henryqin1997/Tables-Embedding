    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32025=The Session layer protocol family in the WAP architecture is called the Wireless Session Protocol, WSP. WSP provides the upper-level application layer of WAP with an interface for session services and management. One example of a session service is a connection-mode service that operates above a transaction layer protocol called Wireless Transport Layer (WTP), See also Wireless Application Protocol: Wireless Transport Protocol specification, version 30 Apr. 1998, by Wireless Application Protocol Transport Working Group., 32732=The Wireless Session Protocol comprises one protocol most suited for browsing applications (WSP/B). WSP/B provides HTTP 1.1 functionality and incorporates new features such as long-lived sessions, a common facility for data push, capability negotiation, and session suspend/resume. HTTP 1.1 is disclosed in Fielding, R., et. al., \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP/1.1\u201d, RFC 2068, UC Irvine, January 1997. The protocols in the WSP family are optimized for low bandwidth bearer networks with relatively long latency., 36654=However, EP-1-0,851,696 uses the ID every time it retrieves a user PIN or user ID number. Thus, this procedure has to be repeated every time when the user sends a request to the server. This means that it will not be easier or faster when the user would like to establish another session. This is a major drawback since the cost for a call will then increase. Also, this document does not describe how it is possible to support different types of data formats/types, upon sending/receiving a request. One example of a data format/type supported by WAP is the MIME multipart format, which transports composite data objects (for example, multipart/mixed). See WAP WSP draft version 2 Apr. 1998, 7.4 Multipart data. WSP defines a compact binary form of the MIME multipart entity and the content type. Thus, there is a need to support different data formats of a WSP session, and to increase the speed to establish a session., 31221=The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry wide standard for developing applications over wireless communication networks. WAP is disclosed in the Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Specification; Version 30 Apr. 1998; by Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Working Group;}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention is not limited to the above described and in the drawing shown of an example of embodiments but can be varied within the scope of the appended claims. Once the communication terminal identification number has been stored, \u201cSTORE ID\u201d 380, it can be possible for the communication terminal to initiate further sessions, by simply forwarding a request to the server which may include both an identification of the requested data and the communication terminal identification number received from the server. Then it would be possible for the server, upon reception of a request, to recall the header from the database memory which corresponds to the communication terminal identification number. If the identification of the terminal is not recognized, \u201cID UNKNOWN\u201d 330, then the server upon receipt of the request generates a communication terminal identification number, \u201cGENERATE ID\u201d 350. Thereafter, the server stores the header associated with said communication terminal identification number, \u201cSTORE HEADER\u201d 360. The server replies to the request by forwarding the requested data and the communication terminal identification number to the requesting communication terminal, \u201cSEND REPLY+ID\u201d 370. Finally, the communication terminal stores the communication terminal identification number in a memory, \u201cSTORE ID\u201d 380. Thereafter, the user may choose to end the session, \u201cEND\u201d 345. shows an example of the establishment of a session in accordance with the present invention.
