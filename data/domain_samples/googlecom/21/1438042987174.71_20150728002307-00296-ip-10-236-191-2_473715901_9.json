    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, it is apparent that modifications and adaptations of those embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. However, it is to be expressly understood that such modifications and adaptations are within the scope of the present invention. In summary, the method for dehairing animals as disclosed herein is a comprehensive, efficient and cost effective method for removing hair from animal hides, while recycling and/or safely disposing of compositions and waste products produced during the process. , H2S from acidified spent dehairing liquor is transported so that it comes into contact with 25% NaOH 58 and is pumped through a heater 60 by a typical pump means or a blower 64, ultimately conveying material to a thermal oxidizer 66 or to an NaHS storage tank 68. FIG. 10 With reference to illustrates an acid treatment of submitted spent, dehairing liquor for recovery of residual sulfide values via H2S absorption in a caustic soda scrubber. FIG. 9 , an apparatus for acid treatment of spent dehairing liquor is provided so that residual sulfide can be recovered and H2S absorbed in a caustic soda scrubber. As illustrated, a dropping funnel containing HC1 32 is connected to a resin flash 34 which is contained within a heating mantle 36. A stirrer bar 38 is used to agitate",
