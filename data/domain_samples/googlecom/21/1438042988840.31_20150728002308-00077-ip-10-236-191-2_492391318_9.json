A pressure sensitive adhesive or a combination of pressure sensitive adhesives are preferred. The adhesive may be resistant to permeation and/or dissolution by the ingredients in reservoir 18, but this is not essential in view of the first seals 17 and second seals 21 discussed above. Other suitable adhesives may include but are not limited to the following: A) Solvent-based acrylic adhesives such as: Monsanto GMS 737, trademark of Monsanto Corporation, St. Louis, Mo.; National Starch Durotak 72-9720 and 80-1197, trademark of National Starch & Chemical Corp., Bridgewater, N.J.; Ashland's AROSET 11 13-AD-40 and 1085-A-45, trademark of Ashland Oil Co., Ashland, Ky.; B) Solvent-based rubber adhesives such as: National Starch 36-6172; C.

No. 11/088,829, filed Mar. 24, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,611,481, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/555,841, filed on Mar. 24, 2004. The entire contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference., 59125=Preferred embodiment device 1 delivers active ingredients at high concentrations over short periods of time (i.e. ranging from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours per wear). Some active ingredients at lower concentrations may be delivered for more than about 24 hours. The preferred embodiment device 1 is useful for delivering active ingredients in liquid solution without adding or incorporating an adhesive film (i.e. with no layer between the skin and the liquid containing the active ingredient) into the preferred embodiment device 1. Preferred embodiment device 1 may be used to treat the following conditions or to deliver the following active ingredients, the conditions and active ingredients including, but not limited to: warts (i.e. salicylic acid, and/or other keratolytic agents); acne (i.e. salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and/or other keratolytic agents); pain (i.e. local anesthetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); moisturizers (i.e. urea, water); finger and toenail beds (i.e. urea, water, anti-fungal agents); skin buffering (i.e. buffering agents); vaccines (i.e. small pox, measles, flu, anthrax, polio, etc.); poorly soluble drugs; larger molecular weight molecules (i.e. about 500 to about 1500 molecular weight molecules such as heparin, LHRH); larger macromolecules (i.e., DNA, antibodies, growth factors, Factor VIII) vaccines; wound care (i.e. water, debriding agent(s), enzymes); sampling and diagnostic agents (i.e. glucose, lactic acid, potassium, allergens, etc.); iontophoresis, electroporation, sonophoresis, radio frequency, thermal enhancement (reservoir) (i.e. electrode (anode, cathode)); microneedles (reservoir) (i.e. alone or in combination with iontophoresis, electroporation, sonophoresis, radio frequency, thermal enhancement). The preferred embodiment device 1 may also be combined with other components, deliver other active ingredients, and/or deliver molecule(s) for diagnostic purposes to the skin., 49901=A microprotrusion layer 19 is disposed between the adhesive layer 11 and liner 12. Microprotrusion layer 19 includes a base layer 19 a adjacent microprotrusions 19 b. The microprotrusion layer 19 includes at least one opening 19 c therein that corresponds with the opening in adhesive layer 11 such that the reservoir-containing ingredients may flow through these openings when the device 1 is in use. The microprotrusion layer side adjacent liner 12 contains microprotrusions 19 b that project from the microprotrusion layer 19. As noted above, microprotrusions 19 b may contain one or more channels or bores extending along an internal longitudinal axis of the microprotrusion. However, microprotrusions 19 b may also be boreless (i.e., without internal channels). Alternatively, device 1 may include a microprotrusion layer 19 that has a combination of both boreless microprotrusions and bore-containing microprotrusions. The ingredient(s) in reservoir 18 may flow through these bores or channels in the microprotrusions, or may flow around and between solid microprotrusions when device 1 is in use. The microprotrusion layer 19 may also be any shape, including, but not limited to any geometric shape or, preferably, a ring-shape having an opening 19 c in the center thereof. The microprotrusions themselves may be any shape. The base layer 19 a is preferably formed of a flexible material but also can be of rigid material. The device of the present invention may be applied to areas of a patient's skin or mucosa that require the base layer 19 a be flexible. The base layer 19 a of microprotrusion layer 19 preferably is from about 1 mil to about 10 mils thick, more preferably from about 2 mils to about 8 mils thick and most preferably from about 4 mils to 6 mils thick. The microprotrusions 19 b of microprotrusion layer 19 preferably project from base layer 19 a a length of from about 20 to about 500 microns, more preferably from about 50 to about 400 microns and most preferably from about 100 to about 250 microns. However, the microprotrusions may be longer (e.g., 500-1000 microns or more) depending on the particular application.}",

It will be appreciated that the reservoir compartments 18 a and 18 b may be completely sealed off by cover 14 and backing layer 10. The multiple compartments may be utilized for different ingredients that are not compatible with one another or the like. FIG. 9 With further reference to Additional Separate Ingredient Compartments , a bumper guard such as a ring 70 may be adhered to the liner 12. Ring 70 is made of a material that is substantially incompressible, such as a suitable polymer material, and prevents damage to microneedles 19 b in the event outer protective layer 32 is bumped or the like during shipping storage and the like. In use, the ring 70 is removed with liner 12 immediately prior to application of device 1. It will be readily appreciated that a bumper guard could have a variety of configurations. For example, the bumper",
