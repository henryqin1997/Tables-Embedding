Approximately 700 ml of granulation solvent is used for the wet granulation. Next, the wet granulation is passed through a ten mesh screen and placed in a 50\ufffd C. oven and dried over night. After drying the granulation is removed from the oven and allowed to hydrate to approximately 9.3% water content. The granulation is passed again through a 10 mesh screen. After granulation 10.1 g of magnesium stearate is added and all the ingredients mixed for about 5 minutes. The resulting granulation is ready for use in the delivery device., 16357=This application is a division of U.S. Ser. No. 07/283,359 filed on Dec. 13, 1988 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,229 which application is incorporated herein by reference, and benefit is claimed of its filing date. These applications are assigned to the ALZA Corporation of Palo Alto, Calif., 51435=In accordance with the practice of this invention, it has now been found that delivery system 10 can be manufactured with a first wall section 12a that surrounds the compartment's internal space initially occupied by the beneficial agent formulation. First wall section 12a comprises a composition that does not adversely effect the beneficial agent, the osmopolymer, the osmagent, other ingredients in delivery system 10, the host, or the like. First wall section 12a comprises a composition that is a means that substantially limits or prevents the passage of an external fluid into delivery system 10. The phrase, \"substantially limits or prevents,\" as used herein, indicates the volume of external fluid passing through first section wall 12a is substantially negligible, that is, about zero up to about 1 \u03bc or up to about 1 ml per day. Typical compositions for forming first section 12a are vinylidene chloride copolymers and terpolymers such as vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer, vinylidene chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinylidene chloride-styrene copolymer, and vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride-acrylonitrile terpolymer; acrylonitrile polymers such as acrylonitrile-methyl vinyl ether copolymer, acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer, and the like; halogenated polymers such as chlorinated polyether, polytetrafluroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, copolymer tetrafluroethylene and hexafluropropylene, polyvinylfluoride, polyvinyl-chlorobuteral, plasticized polyvinylidene chloride, and the like; nylon; polyamide-imide; polyarylether; polysulfone; polycarbonate; high density polyethylene; polyvinylchloride-acrylic copolymer; polycarbonate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; glass; bakelite; melamine; polystyrene; stainless steel, and the like. The water vapor transmission rate through compositions useful for forming first wall 12a are reported in J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 59, pp 1634-37, (1970); in Ind. Eno.. Chem., Vol 45, pp 2296-2306, (1953); Materials Engineering. Vol. 5, pp 38-45, (1972); in Ann. Book of ASTM Stds., Vol. 8.02, pp 208-11 and pp 584-87, (1984); and in Ind. and Enoin. Chem., Vol. 49, pp 1933-36, (1957). The polymers are known in the Handbook of Common Polymers. by Scott and Roff, CRC Press, Cleveland Rubber Co., Cleveland, Ohio., 57592=The fluid flux through wall 12 comprising a polymeric composition can be measured by techniques known to the art. One technique that has been found to be eminently well-suited is to cast or hot press a film of the composition to a thickness in the range of 1 to 60 mils. The film is used as a barrier between a fluid source and a container initially free of fluid. Then, by measuring the volume of fluid that passed through a film of known area and thickness, the flux is easily ascertained by standard techniques known to the art as recorded in J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 52, pp 1145-49, (1963); ibid., Vol. 53, pp 798-802, (1964); ibid., Vol. 54, pp 1459-64, (1965); ibid., Vol. 55, pp 840-43 and pp 1224-39, (1966); Encyl. Polymer. Sci. Technol., Vol. 5 & 9, pp 65-82, and pp 794-807, (1968), and references cited therein; in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,854,480; 3,845,761 and 3,896,819. Second wall 12b section that exhibit a fluid permeability of 10-6 to 10-1 (cc.mil/cm2 \ufffd hr atm) can be used for the purpose of this invention. The polymers are known to the art in the Handbook of Common Polymers, by J. R. Scott and W. J. Roff, (1971), published by CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio.}",
