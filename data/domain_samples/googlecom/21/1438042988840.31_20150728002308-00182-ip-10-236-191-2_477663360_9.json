Cooled buffer solution flows from cooling pump 46 at about 1200 cc/min through conduit 108 into cooling chamber inlets 102 at the base of separation column 74. Buffer solution flows upward through cooling chambers 92 and 92' and through flow baffles 86. Baffles 86 are configured to cause individual buffer flows through cooling chambers 92 and 92' to cross and mix as the buffer flows through the column, thus promoting improved heat exchange between separation chamber 90 and cooling chambers 92 and 92' and preventing temperature gradients from forming in the cooling chambers., 25118=This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. NAGW-1196 awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Government has certain rights in the invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to the embodiments could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements are illustrative only and are not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims and any and all equivalents thereof. Because of the construction of the electrophoresis device 10, the device is not dependent upon gravity to assist in sample fraction collection and is also easily autoclavable, as will be next described. To autoclave electrophoresis device 10, electrical rack 50 is disconnected and slid out of electrical compartment 18. Sample pump motor 38, cooling pump motor 40, separation chamber pump motor 42 and drive motor support 136 are removed along with thermal electric heat exchanger 36. It is preferred that vacuum pump 114 also be removed. Separation column 74 and fluid connections are flushed and the remainder of electrophoresis device 10 is placed in an autoclave for sterilization. A preferred sterilization procedure is to autoclave electrophoresis device 10 at 250\ufffd F. for at least 35 minutes. Heat transferred through the walls of separation column 74 will raise the temperature inside to 250\ufffd F. Because the separation column plates and membrane 96 are made of heat resistant plastic, preferably polysulfone,",
