The wheel elements such as 12X, 12Y are usually arranged in a stack. As can be seen by inspection of the various figures of the drawing, each element can be removed from an adjacent element in the stack by slightly separating it from the adjacent element and moving it perpendicular to its axis. Each projection is tapered to enable sliding of one element off another. The elements are free of attachment to one another except through magnetic attraction and the reception of protuberances of one elements in the groove and cavities of another, to enable rigid disassembly of a stack and its reassembly in another arrangement. FIGS. 7-8 illustrate magnetic wheel elements 12X, 12Y, constructed in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, wherein a first face 16A of each element such as 12Y has a circular groove 30 concentric with an axis 32 of the element. Cavities 24A are spaced along the groove. The second face 14A of each element such as 12X has a plurality of protuberances 22 formed to lie in and move along the groove 30 of another adjacent element 12Y as the elements rotate relative to each other about their coincident axes 32. The protuberances 22 all enter",
