    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6651=In the depicted embodiment, an ashable hard mask is then deposited on the semiconductor substrate by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or other deposition processes (block 106). Plasma may be generated using dual-frequency plasma generation process. For example, a low frequency (LF) generator may provide about 200-1000 W at about 50-400 kHz, while a high frequency (HF) generator may provide about 500-2,000 W at about 2-60 MHz during the deposition process. Additional description of a suitable process apparatus is provided in the context of FIG. 8. The deposition process may be performed when substrate temperature is between about 100 and 500\ufffd C. The pressure of the deposition chamber may be maintained at about 2-15 Torr. One example of the process conditions for ashable hard mask deposition is summarized in Table 1. Deposition is continued until the desired thickness of film is deposited. According to various embodiments, between about 1,000 and 9,000 angstroms is deposited.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33308=The pre-processing module may include various elements to remove the storage solvent and provide a modified gas stream having a constant, but reduced, concentration of the storage solvent in acetylene. Among the elements that may be included in the pre-processing module are a heat exchanger and a liquid trap. Further, in certain embodiments, the heat exchanger may be submerged in a bath filled with coolant. For a typical application, the heat exchanger will have surface area is between 100 square inches and 1000 square inches. The coolant may be maintained at temperature of no greater than about \u221235\ufffd C. The trap may include an insert having a plurality of tortuous paths for the acetylene gas stream to pass through., 61436=The acetylene gas stream is initially cooled in the heat exchanger 311. Depending the process requirement the acetylene gas stream may be cooled to temperature within a few degrees of that of the coolant. Various heat exchanger types may be used. In a specific embodiment, a coiled heat exchange design is used with stainless steel tubing, such as 316 SS, of about 0.5\u2033 diameter and the surface area of between about 100 to 1000 square inches. In one specific embodiment, the surface area of the heat exchangers is between about 200 and 600 square inches. Initial condensation of the storage solvent from the acetylene gas stream occurs on the wall of the heat exchanger 311. As described above, acetone has a substantially higher boiling temperature than acetylene. Therefore, there will be substantially more acetone condensing on the walls of the heat exchanger 311 than acetylene. However, some acetylene will dissolve in the liquid acetone that is present throughout the pre-processing module 302. While it is desirable to cool the acetylene gas stream to very low temperatures to remove most of the acetone, a minimal temperature may exist to minimize acetylene losses into the liquid stream. In one embodiment, the acetylene gas stream is cooled down to \u221230\ufffd C. to \u221260\ufffd C. inside the pro-processing module 302., 79829=The present invention is preferably implemented in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor. Such a reactor may take many different forms. Generally, the apparatus will include one or more chambers or \u201creactors\u201d (sometimes including multiple stations) that house one or more wafers and are suitable for wafer processing. Each chamber may house one or more wafers for processing. The one or more chambers maintain the wafer in a defined position or positions (with or without motion within that position, e.g. rotation, vibration, or other agitation). In one embodiment, a wafer undergoing hard mask deposition is transferred from one station to another within a reactor chamber during the process. For example, for a 2000 \u212b hard mask film deposition, 500 \u212b of film may be deposited at each of four stations in accordance with the present invention. Of course, the full film deposition may occur entirely at a single station or any fraction of the total film thickness may be deposited at any number of stations., 35558=In another aspect, the invention pertains to pre-processing module apparatus. The pre-processing module may include an inlet having a connector adapted for connecting to the acetylene source, a heat exchanger, a trap configured to accumulate condensed liquid from an acetylene gas stream, and an outlet having a connector adapted to the deposition chamber. The heat exchanger may have surface area between 100 square inches and 1000 square inches and may include a first coil and a second coil, where the acetylene gas stream from the inlet enters the first coil then passes through the trap and into the second coil attached to the outlet. The trap may include one or more tortuous paths for the acetylene gas stream to pass through during which condensation of the storage solvent is facilitated. The pre-processing module may also include a bath, which contains the heat exchanger and the trap inside., 84630=In one specific embodiment, a 300 mm Novellus Vector\u2122 tool with 4 deposition stations may be used to deposit an ashable hardmask onto a 300 mm wafer. The process may include four operations: undercoat deposition, ashable hard mask pre-coat, ashable hard mask deposition, and chamber cleaning. The acetylene gas stream may be used in the ashable hard mask pre-coat and ashable hard mask deposition operations only. The acetylene gas stream gas stream that passes through the pre-processing module may be delivered at 6,750 sccm during these operations. The dual-frequency PECVD module may provide Low Frequency (LF) power of about 200-600 W and High Frequency (HF) power at about 900-1500 W during these operation, while the process chamber was maintained at approximately 4-12 Torr.}",
