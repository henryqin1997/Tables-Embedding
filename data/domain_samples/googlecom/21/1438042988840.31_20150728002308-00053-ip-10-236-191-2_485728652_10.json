In either event, cathode 21 and faceplate 24 are spaced very close together in a vacuum sealed package. In operation, there is a potential difference on the order of 1000 volts between conductive layers 12 and 26. Electrical breakdown must be prevented in the FED, while the spacing between the plates must be maintained at a desired thinness for high image resolution., 21512=This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/773,022, filed Dec. 24, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,113, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 34141=The aspect ratio, i.e., the ratio of the diameter to the height of the spacers, can be controlled precisely by the size of the laser spot and the distance of relative displacement of the spot and the spacer site on the substrate. The aspect ratio is preferably between 5:1 and 20:1, and more preferably about 10:1; in absolute figures, the spacer diameter should be about 20-25 microns, and the spacer height should be about 200-250 microns, the approximate distance between the faceplate and the cathode., 27078=Referring to FIGS. 2(a)-2(b), a method for growing a spacer on a substrate 40 is pictorially represented. In a chamber with appropriate gases, an energy beam, preferably a laser beam 42 from an argon laser or a Nd-YAG laser, is focused by a lens 44 to produce a focus spot 46 on a substrate 40. The laser provides heat at the spot to grow a rod with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Substrate 40 is moved relative to lens 44 to stimulate the CVD process to continue to grow spacer 48 outwardly from substrate 40. Laser-assisted CVD processes are described in more detail in Westberg, et al., \u201cProc. Transducers '91\u201d, 1991; Boman, et al., \u201cHelical Microstructures Grown By Laser-Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition\u201d, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, 1992; and Wallenberger, \u201cRapid Prototyping Directly From the Vapor Phase\u201d, Science, Mar. 3, 1995. These papers, which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, show generally that structures can be formed on a substrate using such a process.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described a number of embodiments of the present invention, it should be apparent that other modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In another embodiment, referring to FIGS. 9(a) and 9(b), a number of spacers can be made with an X-shaped cross section to help protect against shearing forces that are perpendicular to the elongated direction of the spacers. Furthermore, such spacers can be a formed in different ways at at different locations of the display. For example, the X-shaped spacers can have two orientations that are offset by 45? relative to each other. FIGS. 8(b) and 8(c) show spacers 130 and 132, respectively, with a T-shape and an inverted T-shape. All of these shapes help distribute forces by having one or more wider portions that can be formed by moving the spot in the x-y plane or with a larger spot and elongated portions along the direction perpendicular to the plates. Referring to FIGS. 8(a)-8(c), the present invention also includes a display device having a first plate 120 and a second plate 122 vacuum sealed close together in a package. To protect against forces from impacts against the display and particularly those directed along the direction of the elongated portion of the spacers, the spacers can be T-shaped or I-shaped to help distribute the force. To produce an I-shaped spacer, for example, and",
