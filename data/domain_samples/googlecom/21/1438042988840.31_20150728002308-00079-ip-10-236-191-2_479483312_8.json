[0085] In accordance with one embodiment of the above-described method, memory 502 of supply circuit 500 is divided into a plurality of memory banks. Each bank is provided with a value representing a portion of the prints remaining in ribbon 120. During use of print ribbon 120, the value stored in the banks are selectively decremented to represent the use of the print ribbon 120 as the value in each bank reaches a predetermined end value, controller 140 disables the bank of memory 502 rendering the bank unusable. Once the values in all of the banks of memory 502 reach the predetermined end value, the controller 140 can prevent further use of the print ribbon 120 with printer 100. [0084] Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of operating printer 100, which is illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 20. At step 520 of the method, a value is stored in memory 502 of supply circuit 500. Preferably, the value is representative of a number of prints remaining or that can be printed by print ribbon 120. Accordingly, the value can correspond to a length of",
