    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is clear that the apparatus described allows the evolution of the tumour to be checked after each treatment sequence. It is evident that different modifications may be made thereto and even according to other embodiments, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. During treatment, the apparatus only supplies one image per second, but this rate is sufficient for substantially permanently checking the position of the focal spot. In the locating operating mode, the operator searches for and localizes the zone to be treated. The display device is adapted, in a way known per se, so as to materialize on the screen of the cathode ray tube (for example by means of a cross) the theoretical position of the focal spot in the sectional plane shown, which plane passes through the axis of symmetry of transducer 1. (It is a question of B type echography). The operator begins by moving transducer 1 along X, until the tumour appears clearly on the screen, then he moves it along Y and Z, until the cross coincides with the central region of the image of the tumour (K, FIG. 4). At this moment, the switches may be placed in position for checking the focal region: only this latter is then made visible on the screen, with a luminosity proportional to the corresponding energy concentration. Thus a representation is obtained of what the distribution of the energy",
