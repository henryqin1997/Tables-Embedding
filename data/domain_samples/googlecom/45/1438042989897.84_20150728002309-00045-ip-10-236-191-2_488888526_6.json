This is seen when the benzotriazole begins to settle to the bottom of the test flask. The supersaturated solutions are allowed to remain undisturbed overnight. Then, the top layer is decanted and filtered. The resulting filtrate containing the benzotriazole dissolved in the solvent is tested in triplicate for percent solids using ASTM Test Method D 2369-81. The higher the percent solids found indicates a more soluble benzotriazole. The results are seen in the table below., 55961=2.5.
