See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,428 and PCT/US85/02095 modified. The S peptide fragment of ribonuclease A or CNBr2 fragment of \u03b2-galactosidase may be conjugated with the analyte or a competitive fragment thereof. The sample could then be added to the reagent which would include the enzyme fragment conjugate and the substrate for the enzyme. The matrix would include in a first zone, anti-analyte, while the binding zone will include the enzyme acceptor fragment., 29539=The ligand may be any molecule for which receptors are available or can be prepared. Usually, the ligand will be an organic molecule of at least about 100 daltons (D) and may involve macromolecules, aggregations, cells, viruses, or the like. For the most part, drugs will generally be of about 125 to 2000 molecular weight, oligopeptides and proteins will generally range from about 2 to 1000 kilodaltons (kD) and aggregates such as organelles, membrane fragments, viruses, or cells will be substantially larger.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Multiple test devices allow for performing a panel of related tests on a single specimen or a series (batch) of the same tests on a group of different samples. Multiple test devices provide cost economics in decreasing the cost per reportable result. By providing for a long path flow of fluids, one can allow the sample to traverse a filter matrix over a relatively long path, or providing for a short path to the binding region for reagents and wash solutions, where the reagents may be provided at a substantially constant concentration to the binding region. The long path of the sample provides for removal of interfering materials in an efficient manner. The short path for the wash solutions and reagent provides economies in time, improved control of the contact between reagents, such as conjugates and developer solutions, and may reduce the amount of solution required for obtaining the desired result. As is evident from the above description, the subject devices and protocols provide for a large number of advantages. As contrasted to other devices which are commercially available, in accordance with the subject invention the sample may be pre-treated without the necessity for physical",
