It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawing are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. Further modifications to the present invention include, among numerous possibilities, only retrieving documents which meet a user-defined threshold of relevancy or only searching in particular information sources or databases. In this way, only those documents deemed particularly relevant would be made available to the user thus potentially eliminating unnecessary or unwarranted documents. Viewing the retrieved documents could then be accomplished in a variety of ways. One approach particularly appropriate to a stylus oriented device such as the Apple Newton would be to merely tap on the hand icon 603 to display the retrieved documents. Again, the retrieved documents could be displayed in an abbreviated or abstract form, or merely by title, or in any of a multitude of ways as determined by the implementor or user of the present invention. One alternative might be to simply display a retrieved relevant document in its entirety in a separate floating window 701 as is shown in FIG. 7. This window might further include interface elements to allow scrolling or",
