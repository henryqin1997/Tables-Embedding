    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Numerous advantages of the invention covered by this document have been set forth in the foregoing description. It will be understood, however, that this disclosure is, in many respects, only illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. The inventions's scope is, of course, defined in the language in which the appended claims are expressed. In use, each of the catheters of the present invention is preferably advanced percutaneously through a guide catheter extending through the aorta into the left ventricle of a patient's heart. It can be appreciated that the various embodiments can be advanced into other heart chambers as well. Once the electrode has been advanced to the patient's heart, RF energy is delivered to the electrode. The electrode is then repeatedly advanced into the patient's myocardium to create holes therein. As can be seen in FIG. 6, loop 416 has a substantial transversely extending distal portion. This configuration can be obtained by heat setting or pre-forming loop 416 as known to those skilled in the art. It can be appreciated that if the substantially transversely extending portion of loop 416 is left uninsulated to form an electrode, an electrode can be delivered during the PMR procedure which is substantially wider than the diameter of the guide catheter lumen through which it is advanced. Loop 416 can, however,",
