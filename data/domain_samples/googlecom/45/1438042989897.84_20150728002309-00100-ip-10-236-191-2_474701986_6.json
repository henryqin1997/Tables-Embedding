For example, the multiple-element antenna 50 may be adapted for operation at the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) frequency bands of 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz, the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) frequency bands of 800 Mhz and 1900 Mhz, or some other pair of frequency bands., 26175=[0001] This application claims priority as a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art. [0037] The short-range communications subsystem 86 enables communication between the mobile communications device 60 and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communications subsystem 86 may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth\u2122 communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices. [0036] In a voice communication mode, overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are output to a speaker 94, and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone 96. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the device 60. In addition, the display 98 may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. [0035] In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web page download,",
