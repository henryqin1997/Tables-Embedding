The free NCO content is the weight percent, based on the total weight of the hot-melt composition, of free NCO. Free NCO is the amount of NCO in excess of the amount needed to match the reactive H atoms present in the admixture on a 1:1 basis. Reactive H atoms are those believed to be likely to react fully or nearly fully with the NCO groups. Included in the reactive H atoms are those in hydroxyl groups and those in carboxyl groups. In the practice of the present invention, suitable admixtures have free NCO content of 0.1% or more; preferably 0.2% or more; more preferably 0.5% or more; and even more preferably 1% or more. Also, admixtures preferably have free NCO content of 10% or less; more preferably 8% or less; even more preferably 5% or less., 53712=A reaction vessel was set up with, a gas inlet tube, thermometer, stirrer, vacuum, and a heating jacket. Polyols were preheated overnight at 75\u201385\ufffd C. to facilitate handling. 1189 g hexanediol adipate (Rucoflex S105P110 with a hydroxyl no.=109; M.W.\u02dc1000), 1642 g polyether polyol (PPG 1025; M.W.=1000), 1824 g Vestoplast\u2122 206(silane modified amorphous poly alpha-olefin from Degussa) and 3 g Irganox 245 were added to the reaction vessel and the temperature raised to 105\ufffd C. with stirring. After 30 minutes at 105\ufffd C. and a vacuum of 20 mm of mercury, the temperature was lowered to 90\ufffd C. 489 g of a 98/02 mixture of 4,4\u2032-MDI and 2,4\u2032-MDI (BASF Corp., Mt. Olive, N.J.) was added and the temperature was held at 100\u2013105\ufffd C. for one hour with stirring and under nitrogen. 3897 g hexanediol adipate (Rucoflex S105P30 with a hydroxyl no.=29.5; M.W.\u02dc3803) and 19 g Silquest A-171 was added and the reaction temperature raised to 103\u2013105\ufffd C.; vacuum of 20 mm of mercury was applied for 30 minutes and the temperature allowed to fall to 90\ufffd C. 931 g of a 98/02 mixture of 4,4\u2032-MDI and 2,4\u2032-MDI was added; an exotherm was observed and the reaction temperature was held at 100\u2013105\ufffd C. under nitrogen for one hour. During the last 40 minutes, stirring speed was reduced and 200\u2013300 mm Hg vacuum was applied. After a one hour hold 1 g benzoyl chloride and 5 g Jeffcat DMDEE were added. Mixing continued for an additional 30\u201340 minutes under nitrogen. At this time the reaction product was poured into a container which was then blanketed in dry nitrogen and sealed., 40301=If any material that is to be added to the reaction mixture is a solid, it is preferably solubilized by heating and mixing with at least one of the non-isocyanate containing components before being admixed with the polyisocyanate. In addition, a catalyst such as, for example, a tertiary amine or a tin-based catalyst may optionally be admixed with the components. Such catalysts, if used, are believed to accelerate the reaction between polyols and polyisocyanates, as taught by K. Uhlig in Discovering Polyurethanes, Hanser Publishers, 1999. Such catalysts, if used, may be added to the components either before, during, or after any one or more of the stages of mixing the components. When such an optional catalyst is used, the usual use level is 1% or less by weight based on the total weight of the admixed components; preferably 0.5% or less; more preferably 0.25% or less; and most preferably 0.1% or less. The adhesive composition of this invention, which is a moisture-reactive composition, may be stored, preferably under an inert, dry atmosphere, until use., 45635=In some embodiments of the present invention, the moisture-reactive hot-melt composition is a one-pack system. That is, if desired, the components may all be admixed and then stored in an inert, dry atmosphere, until it is desired to be melted and applied to a substrate. The one-pack characteristic of the present invention gives it a difference from 2-pack systems, in addition to any differences in composition between the present invention and any such 2-pack systems. One example of a 2-pack system is disclosed in WO 01/72922., 21662=The moisture-reactive hot-melt composition of the present invention is formed by admixing components which include at least one polyisocyanate, i.e., an isocyanate bearing at least two isocyanate groups. Polyisocyanates which may be used include for example aromatic polyisocyanates, aliphatic polyisocyanates, cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates, and mixtures thereof. Suitable polyisocyanates include, for example, m-phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate, hexahydrotoluene diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, 1-methoxy-2,4-phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (also called 4,4\u2032-MDI), 2,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (also called 2,4\u2032-MDI), 4,4\u2032-biphenylene diisocyanate, 3,3\u2032-dimethoxy-4,4\u2032-biphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3\u2032-dimethyl-4,4-biphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-triphenylmethane triisocyanate, polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanate, 2,4,6-toluene triisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-dimethyl-diphenylmethane tetraisocyanate, prepolymers having a Mn less than 2000 and bearing at least two isocyanate groups, and mixtures thereof. Preferred are 2,4\u2032 MDI, 4,4\u2032 MDI, and mixtures thereof. When mixtures of 2,4\u2032 MDI and 4,4\u2032 MDI are used, a preferred amount of 2,4\u2032 MDI is 0.5% or more by weight based on the weight of all polyisocyanates; more preferred is 2% or more; still more preferred is 25% or more; still more preferred yet is 40% or more; most preferred is 45% or more. When mixtures of 2,4\u2032 MDI and 4,4\u2032 MDI are used, also preferred are amounts of 2,4\u2032 MDI that are 90% or less by weight based on the weight of all polyisocyanates; more preferred is 80% or less; still more preferred is 70% or less; still more preferred yet is 60% or less; most preferred is 55% or less., 23587=The moisture-reactive hot-melt composition of the present invention is formed by admixing components which include at least one polyol. A polyol is a compound with two or more hydroxyl functional groups. Suitable polyols include a wide variety of compounds, some of which are described in Polyurethane Handbook, 2nd edition, edited by G. Oertel, Hanser Publishers, 1994. In addition to the hydroxyl functions, suitable polyols may contain other functionality, such as for example carbonyl, carboxyl, anhydride, unsaturation, or other functional groups. Suitable polyols include, for example, polyether polyols, polyester polyols, polyetherester polyols (sometimes called polyether ester polyols and/or polyester ether polyols), fatty polyols, and mixtures thereof. Suitable polyol(s) may be independently selected from crystalline, semi-crystalline, or amorphous polyols., 16349=This is a Non-Provisional U.S. Patent Application of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/407,740, filed Sep. 3, 2002., 29514=The moisture-reactive hot-melt composition of the present invention is formed by admixing components which include at least one silane-functional polyolefin. Polyolefins are well known in the art and described, for example, by K. J. Saunders in Organic Polymer Chemistry, Chapman and Hall, London, 1973. Polyolefins are generally polymers of unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers. Examples of polyolefins include polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, isobutene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, isoprene, butadiene, other unsaturated alkenes, and mixtures thereof. Polyolefins also include such hydrocarbon polymers that have added functional groups, such as, for example, chlorinated polyolefins and chlorosulfonated polyolefins. Preferred are polymers and copolymers of hydrocarbon monomers with one double bond per monomer molecule, such as, for example, polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, other \u03b1-unsaturated alkenes with 4\u201310 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof., 51779=A reaction vessel was set up with, a gas inlet tube, thermometer, stirrer, vacuum, and a heating jacket. Polyols were preheated overnight at 75\u201385\ufffd C. to facilitate handling. 1307 g. hexanediol adipate (Rucoflex S105P110 with a hydroxyl no.=112.2; M.W.\u02dc1000, RUCO Polymer, New York, N.Y.), 1805 g. polyether polyol (PPG 1025; M.W.=1000, PPG Ind., Pittsburgh, Pa.), 1003 g.

Irganox 245 (antioxidant, Ciba-Geigy Corp., New York, N.Y.) were added to the reaction vessel and the temperature raised to 105\ufffd C. with stirring. After 30 minutes at 105\ufffd C. and a vacuum of 20 mm of mercury, the temperature was lowered to 90\ufffd C. 544 g of a 98/2 mixture of 4,4\u2032-MDI and 2,4\u2032-MDI (BASF Corp., Mt. Olive, N.J.) was added and the temperature was held at 100\u2013105\ufffd C. for one hour with stirring and under nitrogen. 4285 g hexanediol adipate (Rucoflex S105P30 with a hydroxyl no.=29.5; M.W.\u02dc3803, RUCO Polymer, New York, N.Y.) and 16 g Silquest A-171 (vinyl trimethoxysilane, OSI Specialties, Div. of Witco Corp., New York, N.Y.) was added and the reaction temperature raised to 103\u2013105\ufffd C.; vacuum of 20 mm of mercury was applied for 30 minutes and the temperature allowed to fall to 90\ufffd C. 1030 g. of a 98/2 mixture of 4,4\u2032-MDI and 2,4\u2032-MDI was added; an exotherm was observed and the reaction temperature was held at 100\u2013105\ufffd C. under nitrogen for one hour. During the last 40 minutes, stirring speed was reduced and 200\u2013300 mm Hg vacuum was applied. After a one hour hold 1 g benzoyl chloride and 6 g Jeffcat DMDEE (amine-based catalyst, Huntsman Co.) were added. Mixing continued for an additional 30\u201340 minutes under nitrogen. At this time the reaction product was poured into a container which was then blanketed in dry nitrogen and sealed.}",
