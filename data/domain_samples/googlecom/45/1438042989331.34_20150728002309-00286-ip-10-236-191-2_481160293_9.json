The invention is capable of taking alternative forms without departing in the spirit or essential attributes thereof, and accordingly reference should be made to the following claims, rather than the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the invention. It is preferable to prevent accidental movement of the tack 14 to the extended position. Such unintended movement could result in physical injury. Accordingly, an interlock can be provided which locks the tack 14 at the retracted position. The interlock must be released in order to move the tack 14 to the extended position. The tack assembly of the invention can be made of any suitable material. The housing 24 and tack-head 20 can be made from durable plastic materials. The tack 14 is preferably made of a noncorroding metal, but can also be made from other materials including plastic. In operation, the tack assembly 10 is secured to an article such as a garment 70 by pushing the tack 14 through the garment 70 in the manner depicted in FIG. 3. In the tack assembly 10, however, the tack 14 is normally in the retracted position shown by the phantom lines in FIG. 3, in which the point 16 of the tack 14 is retracted into the housing",
