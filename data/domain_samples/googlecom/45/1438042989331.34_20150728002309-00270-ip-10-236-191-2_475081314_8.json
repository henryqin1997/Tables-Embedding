A patent application for a \u201cmethod for producing t-butoxycarbonyl-aminoethylamine and amino acid derivatives\u201d has already been made by the inventors of the present invention as Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-268638., 97303=To a solution of Fmoc-GABA-OPfp (100 mg, 0.20 mmol) and BocPNA-OH (40 mg, 0.18 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) was added diisoprppylethylamine (34 il, 0.20 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 h.
