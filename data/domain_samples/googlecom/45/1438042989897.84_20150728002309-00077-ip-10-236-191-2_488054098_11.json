For example, different search protocols, such as Structured Query Language (SQL) or other search languages, may be required for the different database protocols (e.g., Oracle Oracle9i versus Microsoft SQL 2000 versus DB4 versus Microsoft Access) and different database structures (e.g., database fields arrangement), different classification schemes (e.g., names for fields and related entries)., 37466=Instead of the databases 2 through n interpreting the security class and determining what is appropriate to return, the TransMetaWarp router can interpret the security class and return only the appropriate results. In addition, there may be fewer than n templates for n databases, as other databases may share templates. Alternatively, multiple templates may be used to help speed search as described in U.S. Patent Application 60/418,129, entitled \u201cSystem And Methods For Recognition Of Individuals Using Combination Of Biometric Techniques,\u201d filed Oct. 11, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 19154=This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/794,770, filed Mar. 3, 2004 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,606,790), which claims benefit to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/451,840, filed Mar. 3, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 47457=There are limitless content types. A few examples are included here to further explain the concept of the invention, but not limit its scope. For audio, a content type could consist of rock from 1980-1990 with a hard and fast beat. Or, a content type may consist of classical music from Beethoven with a piano and cello that is happy. For video, a content type could consist of a movie with James Bond and a BMW with a scene in France and French subtitles, or James Dean in a movie in the year 1969 with the word love in the title (is there a match?). For images, a content type may be an image with a house and red flowers, or waterfalls from Portland, Oreg. (via city and state name or GPS coordinates) within 20 miles of the Columbia river, or Madonna from 1979 with a guitar and happy (where the content type used as the search criteria demonstrates the user is looking for the rock star Madonna). For e-books, it could be Star in the title and Picard as a character, or key words sirens and lure.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The particular combinations of elements and features in the above-detailed embodiments are exemplary only; the interchanging and substitution of these teachings with other teachings in this and the incorporated-by-reference patents/applications are also contemplated. The methods, processes, and systems described above may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. For example, the processes may be implemented in a programmable computer or a special purpose digital circuit. Similarly, the data representation and classification processes may be implemented in firmware, hardware, or combinations of software, firmware and hardware. The methods and processes described above may be implemented in programs executed from a system's memory (a computer readable medium, such as an electronic, optical or magnetic storage device). Having described and illustrated the principles of the technology with reference to specific implementations, it will be recognized that the technology can be implemented in many other, different, forms. To provide a comprehensive disclosure without unduly lengthening the specification, applicants incorporate by reference the patents and patent applications referenced above. Concluding Remarks The use of method combination has been motivated by diminishing returns to classifier extension and refinement even as it has been made possible by desktop computing power unimaginable when face recognition was a nascent field. There is no guarantee that this approach will produce dramatic improvements, especially if the upstream classifiers are already accurate. If the classifiers are of distinctive",
