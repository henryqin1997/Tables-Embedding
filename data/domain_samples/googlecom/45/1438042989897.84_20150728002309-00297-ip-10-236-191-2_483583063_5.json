    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The baths were then analyzed for arsenic content. The baths used to boil the control fibers contained about three times as much arsenic as the corresponding baths used to boil the test fibers containing an antioxidant. Thus, use of an antioxidant to preserve an antimicrobial agent in these fiber compositions reduces the loss of decomposition products of the antimicrobial agent into the dye bath, and thus into the dye effluent. The test and control fibers were then subjected to Beck mock-dyeing. Mock dye baths were prepared having a pH of 4.0 and containing 0.1% Triton X-100 surfactant in aqueous solution. In separate trials, 5% and 10% (based on the weight of the dye bath) of the test and control fibers were added to the boiling dye baths. The dye baths were boiled for up to 30 minutes. Test fibers like those of Example 15 were used again here. A control composition lacking Irganox B1171 antioxidant but otherwise containing the same ingredients in the same proportions was processed in the same manner, then formed into control fibers. EXAMPLE 16 Fibers so treated were found to have retained all of their antimicrobial potency and 76% of their OBPA, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The fibers were then subjected to a modified continuous dyeing process adapted to simulate commercial continuous dyeing processes. The fibers were wet with a 0.1% by weight aqueous solution of a",
