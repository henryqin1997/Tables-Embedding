DCS system: A transmitting frequency band DCS system is 1710\u02dc1785 MHz and a receiving frequency thereof is 1805\u02dc1880 MHz for bidirectionally broadcasting and receiving data and speech signals. 2. GSM system: A transmitting frequency band GSM system is 880\u02dc915 MHz and a receiving frequency thereof is 925\u02dc960 MHz for bidirectionally broadcasting and receiving data and speech signals. 1. Paging system: A frequency band of 285\u02dc1375 MHz is used in unidirectional for propagating unidirectionally, then, the signal is received by the built-in pager of the present invention in time. The present invention utilizes three channels. As the present invention is used in the transmission of data and speech, the receiving and transmitting of the channels can be performed perfectly. The frequency channels of the present invention is: , an operational flow diagram of the present invention is illustrated. The process of pager receiving mode and personal digital assistant mode comprises the steps of starting (step 41); turning on the power (step 411); actuating the personal digital assistant",
