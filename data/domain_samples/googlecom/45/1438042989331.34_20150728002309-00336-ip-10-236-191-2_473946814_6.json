    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Also, wrist radio instruments furnished with such an antenna circuit can receive automatically set resonance signals stabilized at a set sensitivity, regardless of changes in wearer wrist thickness or changes in wrist band length, and without making special adjustments when wearing the radio instrument on the wrist or not wearing it. As said above, the antenna circuit of the present invention makes it possible to tune to a constantly set frequency by automatically compensating for resonance frequency slippage, in order to prevent the resonance frequency of the antenna circuit from being changed by such as loop antenna length or the wrist thickness of the person wearing it, when worn on the wrist or when not worn. Also, the example in FIG. 15, as said above, is used for the object of automatically compensating for resonance frequency slippage in the antenna circuit, when the loop antenna is either worn or not worn on the wrist, and simultaneously also compensates for resonance frequency slippage of the antenna circuit that happens when the length of the loop antenna is changed. This is because the length of the loop antenna changes only when the the loop antenna connector is detached to change the length and remounted on the wrist. Slippage in the resonance frequency of the antenna circuit at this time occurs from two causes, because of effects from the wrist and because of change in the length of the",
