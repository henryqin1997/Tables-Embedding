It is to be understood that in other embodiments the switch assembly may be reoriented with the locking means structure (e.g., 7 in FIG. 1 and 9 in FIG. 2) toward the user (55 in FIG. 3). Also for some powered machines it maybe desirable to orient the switch assembly of the instant invention to be placed in the \"off\" condition by moving the switch body (e.g., 10 of FIG. 2) away from the user. Such an arrangement may be advantageously used on exercise equipment where a fall might typically involve the user falling forward or toward the area of the exercise equipment containing the switch assembly. The switch assembly and in particular the switch body (e.g., 10 of FIG. 2) is also sized to be relatively large compared to switches which may be found on typical powered exercise equipment. For example, a typical treadmill may have a switch comparable to switch 21 (FIG. 2) positioned on or about its operating control assembly (e.g., 76 of FIG. 3). The large size of the switch assembly of the instant invention facilitates easier operation because it can be more quickly located and grasped.
