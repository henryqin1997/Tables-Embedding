    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6417=FIG. 9 is a diagrammatic representation of one embodiment of a system 900 for multiplexing analog set points. System 900 includes an analog signal source 902 connected to multiple slave devices 904 a-904 d via an analog communications link 906 and one or more parallel digital communications links 908. Analog signal source 902 can be a flow controller, such as an OptiChem P1200 produced by Mykrolis, Inc. of Billerica, Mass. (now part of Entegris Corporation of Chaska, Minn.). Similarly, devices 904 a-904 d can also be OptiChem P1200 flow controllers. In other words, one flow controller, acting as analog signal source 902 can act as a master device to other flow controllers. It should be noted, however, that analog signal source 902 can be any device capable of asserting an analog set point and devices 904 a-904 d can be any devices capable of receiving analog set points.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{108232=During at least part of time period t1, set point indicator signal 1002 changes states from high to low (shown at 1010) indicating that slave device 904 a should use the 45% of full scale value as its set point. Slave device 904 a can continue to use this set point value until the set point indicator signal indicates that it should read a new set point from the analog set point signal 1000. Thus, slave device 904 a can continue to use the 45% of full scale set point even though the value of the analog signal is changing., 115566=Similarly, signal 1204 indicates that slave device 1104 b should use the 62% of full scale as its set point (shown at 1212), signal 1206 indicates that slave device 1104 c should use the 30% of full scale as its set point (shown at 1314). In time t4, signals 1204 and 1206 assert a bit (shown at 1216 and 1218), indicating that slave device 1104 d should use the 78% of full scale as its set point (i.e., multiple digital lines are used to send the setpoint indicator to slave device 1104 d). Thus, three set point indicator lines are used to indicate setpoint to four slave devices. Using a binary scheme up to 7 slave devices can be supported (2n\u22121, where n is the number of setpoint indicator lines) with one signal state reserved for the case in which no setpoint is being asserted for a device., 108861=Similarly, set point indicator signal 1004 indicates that slave device 904 b should use the 62% of full scale as its set point (shown at 1012), set point indicator signal 1006 indicates that slave device 904 c should use the 3.0% of full scale as its set point (shown at 1014) and set point indicator signal 1008 indicates that slave device 904 d should use the 78% of full scale as its set point (shown at 1016)., 114570=The analog set point values may have different meanings for the various slave devices. For example, the analog set point may correspond to a pressure at slave device 1104 a, but a pump motor speed at slave device 1104 b. Thus, the analog set point signal can multiplex analog set points for a variety of purposes., 32345=This application is a divisional of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/365,395, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MULTIPLEXING SETPOINTS\u201d, by McLoughlin, filed Mar. 1, 2006, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference herein., 53248=Using the target flow rate (QT1), target temperature (tT1), hot fluid temperature (tH), cold fluid temperature (tc), specific heats of the hot, cold and mixed fluids (CpH, CpC, CpT) and densities of the hot and cold fluids (pH, pC), controller 104, according to one embodiment, can calculate the target flow rate of cold fluid 116 (QC) to mixer 106 based, for example, on the following equation: Q C =Q T*(1000/60)*(\u03c1C/\u03c1T)*(t H *Cp H \u2212t T Cp T)/(t H *Cp H \u2212t C *Cp C)\u2003\u2003[EQN. 1], 111887=Analog signal source 1102 outputs an analog signal including set points for multiple slave devices on analog communications link 1106. Digital bus 1107 can carry set point indicator signals to each of slave devices 1104 a-1104 d. A set point indicator signal for a particular slave device indicates that the analog signal is indicating the set point for that slave device. The set point indicator signal for a particular slave device 1104 can be asserted as multiple bits on bus 1107. For example, the set point indicator for slave device 1104 d can be bits asserted on the second and third signaling lines of bus 1107 (e.g., 011). When a particular slave device 1104 receives an indication that the analog signal is specifying the set point for that device, the particular slave device 1104 can read its set point from the analog signal. Implementing a binary weighted system for each of the digital select line extends the capabilities of the master without increasing the number of digital setpoint indicator lines., 114944=During at least part of time period t1, set point signal 1202 changes states from high to low (shown at 1210) indicating that slave device 1104 a should use the 45% of full scale value as its set point. Slave device 1104 a can continue to use this set point value until the set point indicator signal indicates that it should read a new set point from the analog set point signal 1200. Thus, slave device 1104 a can continue to use the 45% of full scale set point even though the value of the analog signal is changing.}",

FIG. 13 The slave device can receive the analog set point signal (step 1306). When the slave device receives a set point indicator indicating that the analog set point signal is asserting that slave device's set point (e.g., as determined at 1308), the slave device can save the value of the analog set point signal and store the signal as its set point (step 1310). This routine can continue until a predefined event occurs to end the routine. Additionally, the steps of According to one embodiment, an analog signal source generates an analog signal representing multiple set points (step 1302). Put another way, multiple analog set points are multiplexed in the analog signal. The master device communicates the analog signal to the slave devices. When the set point for a particular slave device is being transmitted via the analog signal, the master device can send a set point indicator to that slave device",
