Typical defoaming agents include various alcohols, hydrocarbons, dimethyl polysiloxane, silicone-containing compounds, alcohol alkoxylates, propoxylated alkyl amines, polyacrylates, alkyleneoxide copolymers, fatty acids, fatty acid sulfonates and blends of fatty acids and esters in hydrocarbons. Preferred defoaming agents for use in synthesizing compositions of the present invention include dimethyl polysiloxanes and silicone-containing compounds. Particularly useful defoaming agents are those composed of dimethyl polysiloxane and silica, such as Dow Corning 1400 and 1410 antifoam agents., 10914=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.
