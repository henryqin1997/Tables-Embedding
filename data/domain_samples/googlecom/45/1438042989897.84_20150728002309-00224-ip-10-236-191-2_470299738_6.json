In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clarity and understanding, however, no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Moreover, the descriptions and illustrations given are by way of examples and the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. Thus, the present invention achieves the above stated objectives, eliminates difficulties encountered in the use of prior devices and methods, solves problems and obtains the desirable results described herein. The present invention enables the production of fluid valves that include movement means that require less force to move the stem. This may result in valves that are more compact and less expensive. Although the preferred form of the invention is used in conjunction with pneumatic valves which control the flow of compressed air, the invention may also be used in valves which control the flow of other gases or liquids. The invention could also be used in devices other than valves, in which seals are used between stationary and moveable surfaces. Slots 158 serve to relieve fluid",
