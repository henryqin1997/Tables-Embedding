In the case wherein a zirconocene is employed and the active system is formed in the reactor, the mole ratio of Al to Zr in the reactor is desirably in the range 10-5000, preferably 20-4000 and most preferably 20-1000. In the case that the active system is formed outside the reactor, the preferred ratio of Al to Zr is in the ran9e 1-200, desirably 20-200. In this case, additional alumoxane cocatalyst may be used in the reactor so that the total ratio of Al to Zr is in the range 10-5000, preferably 20-4000 and most preferably 20-1000. Likewise, in this case, a small amount of another alkylaluminum compound, such as triethylaluminum or trisobutylaluminum, may be added to the reactor together with, or instead of, additional alumoxane, for the purposes of scavenging any impurities which may be present in the reactor. In all of the above, the catalyst or cocatalyst may be contacted in the reactor with one of the components present on a suitable support, as described below., 52426=Methods for preparing the required- metallocene component are known in the art, for example see H. H. Brintzinger,et al.; Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, Vol. 288, p. 63 ( 1985); C. S. Ba]qur, W. R. Tikkanen, J. L. Petersen; Inorg. Chem., Vol. 24, pp. 2539-2546 (1985)., 63788=In accordance with the preferred procedure of this invention an EPC elastomer is produced by slurry polymerization utilizing the \u03b1-olefin monomer or mixture of monomers as the polymerization diluent in which a supported zirconocene/alumoxane catalyst system is suspended. Ethylene is added to the reaction vessel in an amount sufficient to produce the desired ethylene content in the EPC product. The differential pressure of ethylene, in excess of the vapor pressure of the \u03b1-olefin monomer, required to produce a given ethylene content depends on the structure of the zirconocene used. Generally the polymerization process is carried out at an ethylene differential pressure of from about 10 to about 1000 psi, most preferably from about 40 to about 600 psi; and the polymerization diluent is maintained at a temperature of from about -10\ufffd to about 100\ufffd C.; preferably from about 10\ufffd to about 70\ufffd C., and most preferably from about 20\ufffd to about 60\ufffd C. Under the conditions as above indicated the ethylene and \u03b1-olefin monomers copolymerize to an EPC elastomer., 68703=In the Examples which illustrate the practice of the invention the analytical techniques described below were employed for the analysis of the resulting EPC elastomer products The Mooney viscosity, ML1+8, 127\ufffd C., was measured in a Monsanto Mooney Viscometer according to ASTM D1646. Polymer ethylene content was determined by infrared analysis according to ASTM D3900. Molecular weight determinations for EPC elastomer products were made by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) according to the following technique. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were measured using a Waters 150 gel permeation chromatograph equipped with a differential refractive index (DRI) detector and a Chromatix KMX-6 on-line light scattering photometer. The system was used at 135\ufffd C. with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the mobile phase. Shodex (Showa Denko America, Inc.) polystyrene gel columns 802, 803, 804 and 805 were used. This technique is discussed in \"Liquid Chromatography of Polymers and Related Materials III\", J. Cazes editor, Marcel Dekker, 1981, p. 207 which is incorporated herein by reference. No corrections for column spreading were employed; however, data on generally accepted standards, e.g. National Bureau of Standards Polyethlene 1484 and anionically produced hydrogenated polyisoprenes (an alternating ethylene-propylene copolymer) demonstrated that such corrections on Mw/Mn were less than 0.05 units. Mw/Mn was calculated from an elution time. The numerical analyses were performed using the commercially available Beckman/CIS customized LALLS software in conjunction with the standard Gel Permeation package, run on a Hewlett-Packard 1000 computer., 39603=The art has also indicated that amorphous ethylene-propylene copolymers may be produced by metallocene/alumoxane catalyst systems in which the metallocene component is a particular species of metallocene. As used in the art the term \"EPC\" means a copolymer ethylene and an \u03b1-olefin which exhibits the properties of an elastomer as defined in ASTM D1566 under rubber. However, as heretofore reported, the EPC's so produced have been too low in molecular weight to be suitable for use as a commercial elastomeric material, especially when the elastomer has more than 20 wt % incorporated propylene. Also, the activities of the catalysts employed have been too low for production of products with low residues of catalyst in a reasonable time., 62014=Prepolymerization of the solid catalyst material aids in obtaining an EPC elastomer produced therefrom during slurry polymerization in well-defined particle form. The prepolymerized catalyst may be rinsed with a hydrocarbon to provide the good granular particle form. Prepolymerization also greatly reduces the requirement for alumoxane. For example, an Al:Zr ratio of 1000:1 or greater for alumoxane:zirconocene is needed for high activity when the alumoxane is added to the liquid phase of the reactor, but a ratio less than 100:1 is sufficient when the alumoxane is incorporated into the prepolymerized catalyst. For a prepolymerized catalyst the ratio of aluminum to zirconium may range from about 1:1 to 500:1, preferably from about 20:1 lo 100:1, and high activities will still be obtained., 56271=The normally hydrocarbon soluble metallocene and alumoxane are prepared as a heterogeneous supported catalyst by deposition on a support material, such as a dehydrated silica gel treated with methylalumoxane. A suitable silica gel would have a particle diameter in the range 1-600 microns, preferably 10-100 microns; a surface area of 50-1000 m2 /g, preferably 100-500 m2 /g; and a pore volume of 0.5-3.5 cm3 /g. The silica gel may be heat treated at 100\ufffd-1000\ufffd C., preferably 300\ufffd-800\ufffd C. for a period of 1-100 hours, preferably 3-24 hours, to insure its use in dehydrated form., 75319=To 240 g of Davison 948 silica gel (dried at 800\ufffd C.) in a 2 gallon reactor equipped- with a mechanical stirrer, was added 2500 ml of methylalumoxane in toluene (5.5 wt % Al). The toluene was removed with sparging nitrogen while heating to 80\ufffd C. The reactor was cooled to 25\ufffd C. and the powder rinsed twice with 2 liters of dry isopentane, decanting to the top of the settled slurry after each rinse. Four liters of isopentane was then added to slurry the powder, and a solution of 5.0 g of bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride in 300 ml of toluene was added over 10 minutes with vigorous stirring. Ethylene was added to the stirring slurry for 1.5 hours while the temperature was controlled to below 30\ufffd C. The slurry was allowed to settle and was transferred to the dry box where it was dried on a filter and stored under nitrogen. 941 g of tan powder was collected which was nominally 24 wt % silica, 6.9 wt % methylalumoxane, 0.50 wt % zirconocene (0.12 wt % Zr), and 67 wt % polyethylene. Since the supported catalyst is only 33 wt % of the prepolymerized catalyst, this is labeled PP(300)THIZ in Table III, indicating that the catalyst was prepolymerized to 300% of its original weight and contained the tetrahydroindenyl zirconocene., 34109=This is a division of application Ser. No. 207,819, filed June 16, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,705., 40373=In U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,299 of Ewen et al, issued June 26, 1990 it is indicated that an alumoxane system with dimethylsilanylenedicyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride or bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium diphenyl will catalyze production of a low molecular weight EPC, and that such catalyst systems may be employed in conjunction with other distinct metallocene/alumoxane catalyst systems to produce reactor blends of an EPC with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) such as, HDPE/EPC, LLDPE/EPC, HDPE/LLDPE/EPC reactor blends or the like. The EPC component of the blends so produced--which by itself by reason of its low molecular weight is not a commercially useful elastomer--is useful in the context of a modifier blend component for the base HDPE or LLDPE with which it is coproduced., 81732=Table II compares the behavior of supported catalysts prepared from two of the most active zirconocenes of this invention with that of a catalyst prepared from one of the best comparative zirconocenes. The comparative catalyst employed in runs B1-B3 show that high activity and high molecular weight are not simultaneously obtained; this is especially true for lower ethylene contents. The comparative catalyst of runs B1-B3 gave much lower molecular weight products at lower than 70 wt % ethylene. This problem is eliminated with the catalysts of this invention. Although good quality EPC may be obtained with the catalysts employed in this invention even in the absence of additional alumoxane added to the slurry (run B11), the activity is dramatically lower. To obtain high activity, it was required to add additional MAO. In all of these runs, the products fouled the reactor as did the nonsupported catalysts. Broader MWDs are also noted where initiation exotherms cause high temperatures. Although the activity of the supported catalysts is somewhat reduced on a g-Zr basis from that of the nonsupported catalysts, the activity on a g-cat basis is well above the 1000 g/g-cat/h desirable for a commercial process.}",
