    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42320=The outer chemical barrier layer 22 comprises at least one of mullite, hafnia (HfO2), hafnium silicate (e.g., HfSiO4 ) and rare earth silicate (e.g., at least one of RE2SiO5 and RE2Si2O7 where RE is Sc or Yb). Any of the rare earth silicates disclosed in the U.S. Patent application entitled \u201cMultilayer Article Characterized by Low Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Outer Layer,\u201d filed on May 22, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may be suitable outer chemical barrier layer materials in the inventive multilayer article disclosed herein. The outer chemical barrier layer is preferably located between and contiguous with the outer layer 14 and the mullite-containing layer 20., 18985=The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-568 (72 Stat. 435; 42 U.S.C. \ufffd2457)., 24116=FIG. 1 of EP 1142850 shows an EBC which employs a YSZ topcoat 18, a YSZ-containing intermediate layer 24 between the topcoat and a Si-containing substrate 12, and a BSAS layer 22 between the YSZ-containing intermediate layer 24 and the substrate. The inventor of the present application has found that when BSAS and YSZ react, an undesirable low melting glass results. This problem was not recognized in the EP '850 disclosure as is apparent by the close proximity of BSAS layer 22 and YSZ layer 24. EP '850 discloses that intermediate YSZ-containing layer 24 can includes sublayers in which an inner sublayer in contact with the BSAS layer 22 contains one of BSAS, mullite or alumina and an outer sublayer in contact with the YSZ top coat consists essentially of YSZ. This again is disadvantageous in that it can position the outer YSZ sublayer in contact with an inner sublayer containing BSAS.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with reference to the examples and with some degree of particularity in the detailed description, it should be understood that various modifications and variations can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth hereafter in the appended claims. In view of the deleterious reaction between YSZ and aluminosilicates, BSAS in particular, a chemical compatibility test was carried out to confirm the chemical barrier layer materials would inhibit or prevent the YSZ/BSAS reaction. Powders of mullite, hafnia (HfO2), hafnium silicate (e.g., HfSiO4), and rare earth silicate (e.g., at least one of RE2SiO5 and RE2Si2O7 where RE is Sc or Yb) were mixed with mullite+20 wt% BSAS powders and heated for 24 hrs in air. No combinations produced molten products at temperatures up to 1500\ufffd C. There was significant diffusion between mullite and BSAS, which can lead to reduced EBC life by altering the chemistry of the layer or even by producing a low melting product in long term exposures (over thousands of hours). Therefore, it is desirable to avoid mullite-BSAS contact in areas of the coating where the temperature is 1300\ufffd C. or higher for an extended period of time by eliminating BSAS from the mullite-containing layer.
