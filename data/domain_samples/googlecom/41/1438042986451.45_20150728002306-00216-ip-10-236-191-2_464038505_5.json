The log-normal distribution of the probability density function R may arise from phase changes and interference effects in the 1D reflection signals caused by the refractive index variation inside a biological cell. Plot 1006 shows the autocorrelation function C(\u0394k) in colonic epithelial cells from control and AOM-treated rats at weeks 2, 5, and 8 respectively. On a log scale C(\u0394k) approximately follows a linear dependence on ((\u0394k)2 with r2>0.99)., 41820=This application is further related to a copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/604,659, entitled \u201cAPPARATUS FOR RECOGNIZING ABNORMAL TISSUE USING THE DETECTION OF EARLY INCREASE IN MICROVASCULAR BLOOD CONTENT\u201d, filed 27 Nov. 2005 with the same assignee as the present disclosure claiming priority to U.S. Application No. 60/801,947 entitled \u201cGUIDE-TO-COLONOSCOPY BY OPTICAL DETECTION OF COLONIC MICRO-CIRCULATION AND APPLICATIONS OF THE SAME\u201d, filed 19 May 2006. The disclosure of the above identified copending applications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference., 167545=Graph 1602 is the bar diagram of the disorder strength Ld of cytology specimens obtained from nine control patients vs. the disorder strength of cytology specimens obtained from ten patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Graph 1604 is the bar diagram of the standard deviation of the disorder strength \u03c3Ld of cytology specimens obtained from nine control patients vs. standard deviation of the disorder strength of cytology specimens obtained from ten patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As can be seen from the figures, both disorder the disorder strength Ld and the standard deviation of the disorder strength \u03c3Ld were significantly elevated in non-cytologically malignant cells obtained from patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus, the presence of pancreatic cancer can be identified via partial wave spectroscopic analysis of pancreatic cells that were detected as cytologically normal, according to one embodiment. Partial wave spectroscopy can potentially revolutionize the cytological diagnosis of pancreatic cells through correct classification of cytologically nonmalignant-appearing pancreatic cells as malignant., 141767=The synthesized backscattering images 1406 and 1408 are acquired by applying the vector diffraction theory to the far-field scattering fields calculated by FDTD., 46120=Colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States. In 2006, there were approximately 55,170 estimated colorectal cancer (CRC) related deaths. Given early detection, early-stage colorectal cancer can be curable. However, given the nature of colonic neoplasia, most patients are diagnosed when the cancer has evolved to a more advanced stage thus underscoring the need for effective screening of the at-risk population (e.g., those over 50 years of age) for early detection. For example, existing colorectal cancer screening methods include fecal blood tests (FOBTs), endoscopy for direct visualization of the colon (e.g., flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy), and/or air-contrast barium enema. Although, the existing methods have demonstrated some efficacy in reducing colorectal cancer mortality and incidence, a large portion of the population do not undergo any endoscopic screening potentially due to patient and/or physician reluctance., 142794=The set of plots 1410 illustrate comparisons of the FDTD-calculated backscattering spectra at 4 locations in the synthesized microscope image with that calculated by 1D slab model with vertical refractive index distribution following the corresponding location in the FDTD element. The set of plots 1412 illustrate comparisons of the point-spread function averaged FDTD-calculated backscattering spectra with the corresponding 1D slab model calculated spectra. The point spread function averaged FDTD spectra can be calculated as follows:, 132100=Graph 1102 is a plot of the probability density function P(Ld) of the disorder strength Ld in colonic epithelial cells for the control and AOM-treated rats at 2, 5, 8 weeks after AOM treatment, respectively, according to one embodiment. Thus in one embodiment, the distribution of Ld can be determined to monitor the progression of carcinogenesis and to identify cell at different stages of carcinogenesis progression., 139383=Plot 1302 illustrates the sensitivity of the disorder strength to the correlation length lc, according to one embodiment. The slab has a refractive index distributed randomly in approximately 200 layers with a constant background refractive index n0\u02dc1.38 and refractive index fluctuation as <\u0394n>max=0.02. The correlation length of the refractive index lc is: <\u0394n(L)\u0394n(L\u2032)\u2245<\u0394n2>exp[\u2212|L\u2212L\u2032|/lc]. In this example, the correlation length is varied from 0 to 65 nm, such that klc<<1, where k is the wave number., 137186=In one embodiment, the increase in disorder strength can be identified from broadening in the distribution of the probability density function P(R). In one embodiment, the increase in disorder strength is further identified via the shift of the mean of the distribution of the probability density function P(R) to higher value and an extended log-normal tail, as illustrated in plot 1004, in agreement with the prediction of mesoscopic light transport theory., 179474=As shown in plots 1802 and 1804, the disorder strength Ld and the standard deviation of the disorder strength \u03c3Ld assessed from the periampullary mucosa is higher for patients with pancreatic cancer as compared with control patients who were cancer-free. Therefore, identification of patients harboring PC can be achieved by minimally invasive and very low risk duodenal brushing that can be performed during upper endoscopy without the need to interrogate the pancreas, which would ideal for a screening of asymptomatic patients. Thus, in one embodiment, partial wave spectroscopy can be used to identify pancreatic cancer via imaging duodenal periampullary mucosa, through the field effect. The imaged duodenal periampullary mucosa may appear normal, or abnormal., 140027=Plot 1304 illustrates the sensitivity of the disorder strength Ld to the refractive index fluctuations <\u0394n2>, according to one embodiment. In this example, an inhomogeneous dielectric slab with an approximate thickness of 5 \u03bcm. is used as the 1D slab model. In this example, the slab has refractive index distributed randomly in approximately 200 layers with a constant background refractive index n0\u02dc1.38 and refractive index fluctuation as <\u0394n>max\u02dc0.05. The effect of the homogeneous slab is removed. As illustrated, Ld is linearly dependent on both lc and <\u0394n2>. Thus, as can be seen, the disorder strength Ld can be proportional to the correlation length at scales less than the diffraction limit, at the nanoscale, for example., 43747=This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. R01 EB003682 and R01 CA112315, awarded by the National Institutes of Health, and Grant Nos. CBET-0238903 and CBET-0417689 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention., 166447=Graph 1502 is a bar diagram of the disorder strength Ld of cytology specimens obtained from seven control patients vs. the disorder strength of cytology specimens obtained from nine patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Graph 1504 is the bar diagram of the standard deviation of the disorder strength \u03c3Ld of cytology specimens obtained from seven control patients vs. standard deviation of the disorder strength of cytology specimens obtained from nine patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma., 132580=Graph 1104 is a bar diagram showing the change in the disorder strength Ld obtained from partial wave spectroscopy for the control and AOM-treated rats at 2, 5, 8 weeks after AOM-treatment, according to one embodiment. In this example, Ld is averaged over approximately 20-30 cells at each time point. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean. As shown, at week two after AOM treatment, increase in disorder strength can be observed. The disorder strength continues to increase over time with increased exposure to AOM., 43112=This application is further related to a copending U.S. patent application, entitled \u201cSYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUSES OF LOW-COHERENCE ENHANCED BACKSCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY\u201d, filed 11 May 2007 with the same assignee as the present disclosure claiming priority to U.S. Application No. 60/799,970 entitled \u201cLow-Coherence Enhanced Backscattering Spectroscopy and Applications of Same\u201d, filed 12 May 2006. The disclosure of the above identified copending applications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference., 141165=Elements 1402 and 1404 are inhomogeneous dielectric cylinders with diameter of 8 \u03bcm. and a height of 5 \u03bcm. In this example, the element 1402 is imported in the FDTD grid with a resolution of approximately 20 nm. Element 1402 has a random refractive index distribution in 600 nm.\ufffd600 nm.\ufffd100 nm. rectangular blocks. Element 1404 has a random refractive index distribution in 60 nm.\ufffd60 nm.\ufffd60 nm. blocks. For both elements, the mean refractive index n0\u02dc1.38 and the maximum refractive index fluctuation \u0394nmax\u02dc0.02., 180765=In one embodiment, partial wave spectroscopy can be utilized for lung cancer screening via examining cells brushed from normal-appearing buccal mucosa. In this experiment, partial wave spectroscopy was performed on 16 patients with no lung cancer but with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 7 patients with no lung cancer and a family history of lung cancer, and 19 patients with lung cancer. As shown in plots 1902 and 1904, the disorder strength and the standard deviation of the disorder strength assessed from the buccal mucosa is higher for patients with lung cancer as compared with control patients who were cancer-free. In addition, the disorder strength and the standard deviation of the disorder strength assessed from the buccal mucosa is higher for patients without lung cancer but with a family history of lung cancer as compared with control patients who were cancer-free. Therefore, in one embodiment, identification of patients harboring lung cancer or a risk of lung cancer can be achieved by removing a sample of cells from the lining of the cheek for study., 177548=As can be seen in plots 1702 and 1704, the disorder strength Ld and the standard deviation of the disorder strength \u03c3Ld in cancer patients were increased in patients with adenoma or carcinomas, and further increased for patients with advanced adenoma or carcinoma. By performing partial wave spectroscopy, an increase in the disorder strength and the standard deviation of the disorder strength obtained from normal-appearing rectal mucosa in patients who harbored adenoma or carcinomas in their colon can be observed when compared with those who were neoplasia free, or with less advanced adenoma/carcinoma., 40168=This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 60/837,103 entitled \u201cApparatus and Methods of Partial Wave Spectroscopy\u201d, which was filed on Aug. 11, 2006, the contents of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. This application further claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 60/837,052 entitled \u201cApparatus and Methods of Ultra-Early Detection of Carcinogenesis in a Single Cell Via Partial Wave Spectroscopy\u201d, which was filed on Aug. 11, 2006, the contents of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein., 40856=This application is related to a copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/261,452, entitled \u201cMULTI-DIMENSIONAL ELASTIC LIGHT SCATTERING\u201d, filed 27 Oct. 2005 with the same assignee as the present disclosure. The disclosure of the above identified copending application is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference., 130258=Plot 1004 shows the probability density function (p.d.f.) P(R) of the reflection coefficient R(\u03bb) in the colonic epithelial cells of control and AOM-treated rats (2, 5, and 8 weeks after AOM treatment). The probability density function of R(\u03bb) from a cell can be calculated from the histogram analysis of R(\u03bb) from different parts of a cell. In this example, R(\u03bb) is calculated by averaging R(\u03bb) over wavelength (\u03bb) from approximately 545 to 555 nm. for an image of approximately \u02dc500 pixels/cell. Other bandwidths may be used for averaging. The reflection coefficients are determined to be on the order of 10-4-10-3, thus indicating that these biological cells could be considered as weakly disordered media., 135068=The set of images 1202 show the spatial distribution of the disorder strength Ld at each pixel with respect to the neighboring pixels in colonic epithelial cells from control and AOM-treated rats at 2, 5, and 8 weeks after AOM injection. The set of images 1204 show the spatial distribution of the standard deviation of the disorder strength SDLd at a number of pixels comprising colonic epithelial cells obtained from control and AOM-treated rats at 2, 5, and 8 weeks after AOM injection. As can be seen, progressive differences in both disorder strength and the standard deviation of disorder strength of colonic cells can be observed within weeks of exposure to AOM. An increase in the disorder strength typically indicates that the cellular organization is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. The increase in disorder strength, in one embodiment, can be used to identify alterations in cellular organization due to carcinoma and/or adenoma earlier than can be currently detected by conventional histopathology., 41214=This application is related to a copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/604,653, entitled \u201cMETHOD OF RECOGNIZING ABNORMAL TISSUE USING THE DETECTION OF EARLY INCREASE IN MICROVASCULAR BLOOD CONTENT\u201d, filed 27 Nov. 2005 with the same assignee as the present disclosure claiming priority to U.S. Application No. 60/801,947 entitled \u201cGUIDE-TO-COLONOSCOPY BY OPTICAL DETECTION OF COLONIC MICRO-CIRCULATION AND APPLICATIONS OF THE SAME\u201d, filed 19 May 2006. The disclosure of the above identified copending applications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference., 42438=This application is further related to a copending U.S. patent application, entitled \u201cSYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUSES OF ELASTIC LIGHT SCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY AND LOW-COHERENCE ENHANCED BACKSCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY\u201d, filed 11 May 2007 with the same assignee as the present disclosure claiming priority to U.S. Application No. 60/801,954 entitled \u201cFOUR-DIMENSIONAL ELASTIC LIGHT SCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY, LOW-COHERENCE ENHANCED BACKSCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY, RELATED OPTICAL MARKERS, AND APPLICATIONS OF SAME\u201d, filed 19 May 2006. The disclosure of the above identified copending applications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference., 133165=Graph 1106 is a bar diagram showing differences between the standard deviation SDLd in colonic epithelial cells for the control and AOM-treated rats at 2, 5, 8 weeks after AOM treatment, respectively. In this example, Ld is averaged over approximately 20-30 cells at each time point. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean. At approximately week two after AOM treatment, increase in the standard deviation of the disorder strength is observable. The disorder strength continues to increase over time with increased exposure to AOM, indicating that the cells exposed to AOM is becoming progressively more heterogeneous with increase in time exposure to AOM, thus carcinogenesis. Such progressive and statistically significant alterations of the disorder strength indicate that the changes in Ld and SDLd are unlikely due to an acute action of AOM. Thus, in one embodiment, the statistical parameters (e.g., Ld and SDLd) determined from light backscattered from the cells in question can be used as potential markers to detect early precancerous transformations in colonic epithelial cells. Note that the time point for a detectable alteration of the disorder strength and the standard deviation of disorder strength (e.g., 2 weeks after AOM-treatment) precedes the development of currently known histological and molecular markers.}",
