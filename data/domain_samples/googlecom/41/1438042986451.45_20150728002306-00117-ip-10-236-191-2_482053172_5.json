    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53819=[0002] Telephones and other types of data terminal equipment (DTE) are routinely used for voice, data traffic and other forms of telecommunication. Such DTE equipment typically is wired with twisted pair wire to a switch or similar telecommunications device. For example, some communications systems utilize an Ethernet switch in communication with Internet Protocol (IP) or voice over IP (VoIP) telephones. Where the IP telephones are compatible and thus adapted to receive phantom power over the twisted pair connection to the switch, it is desirable for the switch to verify the compatibility before applying the phantom power because it is conceivable that the phantom power could damage or operate improperly with certain non-compatible DTE equipment (\u201clegacy equipment\u201d) which might also be connected to the switch. In accordance with the invention disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/710,388 filed Nov. 9, 2000 in the name of inventor Roger Karam and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Detecting a Compatible Phantom Powered Device Using Common Mode Signaling\u201d (CISCO-3052), commonly owned herewith, a method and apparatus which enable discovery of such compatible telephones by a switch or similar device is taught. In a nutshell, the approach used is to generate a differential mode signal, apply it to center-taps of transformers coupling the switch to the twisted pair wires, apply the differential mode signal received at center-taps of corresponding transformers at the IP telephone to an identity network, loop the signal (possibly modified by the identity network) back to the switch, and, based on the returned signal (and possibly other considerations), apply or not apply phantom power between the center-taps of the switch-side transformers to power the IP telephone. This approach requires that the IP telephone be configured to \u201cloop back\u201d signals received by it to the switch. This is undesirable for data signals under certain circumstances as it can lead to certain kinds of potential computer network problems. Accordingly, it is desirable in such circumstances to permit loop back of discovery signals only and not data signals. In the past, normally closed mechanical relays at the IP telephone coupled with a low pass filter (LPF) to pass only the discovery signals and not the data signals have been used. Such mechanical relays are relatively expensive and can become unreliable. Low pass filters composed of inductors and capacitors also consume volume in the DTE equipment and can be relatively expensive to deploy., 56435=[0003]FIG. 1 is an electrical schematic diagram of a telecommunications system in accordance with a prior design. A telecommunications device 10 such as an Ethernet switch includes a port 12 which includes a transmitter 14 and a receiver 16. Transmitter 14 includes a center-tapped transformer winding 18 with differential output on nodes 20, 22 and a center-tap 24. Receiver 16 includes a center-tapped transformer winding 26 with differential input on nodes 28, 30 and a center-tap 32. A phantom power supply 34 provides direct current (DC) phantom power (preferably=+48 volts or less) to center taps 24, 32. A four (or more) wire cable 36 connects telecommunications device 10 to, for example, an IP telephone 38. IP telephone 38 receives a differential signal at nodes 40, 42 of receive transformer 44 which includes center-tapped winding 46. IP telephone 38 transmits a differential signal at nodes 48, 50 of transmit transformer 52 which includes center-tapped winding 54. Center-tap node 56 is the center-tap of winding 46 and center-tap node 58 is the center-tap of winding 54. Phantom power is extracted at nodes 56, 58 and is applied to a power processor 60 at the IP telephone in known ways, such as is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,115,468 filed Mar. 26, 1998 entitled \u201cPower Feed For Ethernet Telephones Via Ethernet Link\u201d and commonly owned herewith. A first relay 62 couples differential output lines 64, 66 when unenergized to low pass filter network 68. A second relay 70 couples the differential outputs 72, 74 of LPF 68 to differential input lines 76, 78 of winding 80 of transformer 52. In this way, while relays 62, 70 are not energized (as is the case when phantom power is not applied), signals loop through IP telephone 38 but they are subjected to LPF 68 which filters out the higher frequency data signals while allowing the lower frequency discovery signals to pass.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0063] While embodiments and applications of the invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that many more modifications than mentioned above are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. [0062] Thus, a number of ways have been shown to block undesired loop back of packet traffic. Application of the phantom power signal can be used to disrupt the loop back circuitry stopping the loop back; switches can be turned on by powering their bases/gates by rectified signal current stored in capacitors (resistors to ground provided to discharge the capacitors so that they can reset when a DTE device is disconnected), data can be distorted through voltage and/or phase shifting so that it will not propagate through the transformer or on the twisted pair transmission line. It should also be noted that the transformer winding used to provide RX+, RX\u2212 to the PHY need not be the same as that used to drive the circuitry described above so as to avoid affecting the operation of the PHY. [0061] Turning now to FIGS. 25 and 26 flow charts illustrating methods in accordance with specific embodiments of the present invention are shown. The flow chart of FIG.",
