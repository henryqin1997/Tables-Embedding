The number of blocks can be any number such as 32, 64 or more. Wordline decoder 14 receives an address input AX0-AXN and decodes the AX0-AXN input to activate a wordline 16a-j. The number of wordlines 16a-j depends on the number of address lines AX0-AXN, for example, 10 address lines can select from 1024 wordlines.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having disclosed exemplary embodiments and the best mode, modifications and variations may be made to the disclosed embodiments while remaining within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. The invention provides many advantages over known techniques. Advantages of the invention include improved row redundancy for wordline replacement and block replacement. Moreover, the inventive memory requires little external control and performs many of the enable and disable functions on chip. This improves the overall efficiency of a computer system. CONCLUSION For example, if the memory is supplied with VDD(+3.3V), and needs VPP(+10V) for a program function, the voltage pump generator creates the needed voltage and provides it to the decoder circuits to accomplish the necessary function. Likewise, the voltage pump can provide a negative voltage VPN(-10V) to the decoder circuits for the erase function. The disclosed embodiments assume that any necessary power level is supplied. However, the disclosed embodiments can be combined with a charge or voltage pump generator to increase the voltage beyond that supplied, i.e. from VDD to VPP. Charge and voltage pumps are known in the art and example is given by way of reference to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,679,134 and 4,812,961. The incorporation of a pump generator with the exemplary embodiments expands the operational voltages in order to facilitate improved yield and reliable retrieval of stored values.
