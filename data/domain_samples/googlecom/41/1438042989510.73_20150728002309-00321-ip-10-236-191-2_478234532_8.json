    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{69277=The reason why it is preferred that the treatment time (A) should satisfy the above requirement is as follows. As pointed out hereinbefore, in an as-spun polyester fiber yarn having a \u0394n value of at least 15\ufffd10-3 but less than 50\ufffd10-3, that is, a polyester yarn spun at a spinning speed of at least about 2,500 m/min but less than about 4,000 m/min, the \u03c7c value is small and the structure of the fiber is incomplete, and the yarn should be drawn in the heat treatment step. When the yarn is drawn in the heat treatment step, if the yarn is subjected to the false twisting treatment after the heat treatment without performing cooling, especially in case of a small draw ratio, the molecule chain of the fiber which has been drawn and oriented in the heat treatment step is relaxed and the mechanical properties are often reduced. Accordingly, in the case where the heat treatment is carried out under elongation, that is, in case of a fiber yarn spun at a spinning speed of at least about 2,500 m/min but less than about 4,000 m/min, cooling is especially preferred, and a relatively long cooling time is preferred. Drawing is not particularly necessary in case of a polyester fiber yarn having a \u0394n value of at least 50\ufffd1031 3, that is, a polyester fiber yarn spun at a spinning speed of at least about 4,000 m/min. In this case, the lower the spinning speed, the less the relaxation of the amorphous region caused by the heat treatment, and the higher the spinning speed, the larger the relaxation of the amorphous region caused by the heat treatment. Accordingly, when the spinning speed is higher, the improvement of the dyeability by the heat treatment is increased. The reason is that in the as-spun polyester fiber yarn spun at a spinning speed of at least about 4,000 m/min, the higher the spinning speed, the more relaxed the amorphous region, and the dyeability is accordingly improved. Even this as-spun fiber, however, cannot be dyed under normal pressure before the heat treatment of the present invention., 142917=Incidentally, in the present and subsequent Examples, the tenacity was measured according to the method of JIS L-1069 (the tensile test method for fibers).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.65 dl/g was melt-extruded from a spinneret having 24 orifices, each 0.23 mm in diameter at a spinning temperature of 300\ufffd C. The yarn extruded was cooled and solidified with a stream of air at 20\ufffd C. supplied in parallel to the direction of the running yarn, and then the yarn was wound at a winding speed of 4,500 m/min. to give multifilaments of 50d/24f by using the spinning apparatus shown in FIG. 1. A mean birefringence index \u0394n of the yarn was 71\ufffd10-3. The wound yarn was subjected to heat treatment for 0.8 second at a feed ratio of 0% by passing through a heat treating heater 9 as shown in FIG. 9, which was placed in an atmosphere of mixed gas containing 80 mol% of super heated steam and 20 mol% of air heated at 235\ufffd C. Subsequently the yarn was naturally cooled for 1.2 second in an atmosphere maintained at 25\ufffd C., and then the yarn was false-twisted at a fales twisting temperature of 212\ufffd C. at a draw ratio of 7% and a twisting number of 3,900 t/m. The tenacity and dye up-take ratio of the fales-twisted yarn are 3.3 g/d and 87%, respectively. EXAMPLE 15 From the results shown in Table 32, it is seen that even in case of the partially molten-false twisting treatment, the false twisting apparatus of the present",
