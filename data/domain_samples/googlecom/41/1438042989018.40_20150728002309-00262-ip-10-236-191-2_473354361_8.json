    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, the dural forceps 10 may be fabricated from either a surgical grade steel or other known surgical alloys. Also, the dural forceps 10 may be fabricated from a plastic resin making it both less expensive and readily disposable. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. Upon completion of a durotomy and upon commencing of the procedure involved in closing the incised dura, the dural forceps 10 according to the present disclosure are grasped by a surgeon in one hand with finger pad 32 and finger pad 36 being held against an index finger and corresponding thumb, respectively. Using an additional pair of simple forceps in an opposite hand, the surgeon brings one cut dural margin 20 into the space above the foot glide 14 and between the central member 12 and extension member 22. The principal thumb then forces finger pad 36 against finger pad 32 bringing the toothed projections 25 of extension member 22 and surface 18 of central member 12 together to thereby firmly grasp the one cut dural margin 20 of the durotomy. Similarly, the second cut dural margin 20 is then brought against opposite surface 18",
