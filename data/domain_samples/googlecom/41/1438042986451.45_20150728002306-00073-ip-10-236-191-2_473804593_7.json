    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45938=The invention provides a communication system for the transmission and reception of signals having standardized signaling schemes over multimedia signal paths. A wireless multimedia carrier (WMC) system is provided for this purpose. The WMC system supports a variety of standardized systems, e.g., T-carrier systems, using wireless radio frequency links (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-point), such as radio in the local loop (RLL). Such application have been facilitated by using spread spectrum technology and the recent release of the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The ISM bands include 900 MHz (902-928 MHz), 2.4 GHz (2400-2483.5 MHz), and 5.7 GHz (5725-5850 MHz)., 66292=where Preamble represents the preamble bits, Channel_Number represents the channel number being used, Category represents the message category (e.g., call establishment), Message_Type represents the message type (e.g., set-up acknowledgment), and IE represents other information elements being sent. In this embodiment, bits 5-7 are designated for IE. Five bits are designated to represent the channel number to allow a maximum number of 32 channels. In asynchronous communication, the message preamble alerts the receiving unit that a message is being transmitted. In a message block, bits 13-15 are designated as the message preamble. The bits 13-15 are set to \u201c111\u201d to indicate that a message is being transmitted. If no message is being sent, then the signaling bit in the frame is set to \u201c0\u201d. The signaling is carried out on the virtual channel (e.g., Channel 0) thereby requiring a channel number (especially in case of errors over one specific channel). Bits 8-12 are designated as the channel number. When the 8-12 bits are set to \u201c11111,\u201d a global alarm is indicated to all channels. A global alarm is may be recognized by all functional elements in the WTS system 200 (FIG. 2). A specially designated microcontroller (e.g., a Hitachi H9/3048) typically manages and controls the occurrence of a global alarm. The remaining bits are designated for the message data of the signal.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention overcomes the long-standing need for a system for communicating standardized telephonic signals (e.g., DS0/E0, T1/E1, T2/E2, and T3/E3) over the RF spectrum including the PCS, NII, and ISM bands. As described above, the system selectively applies intelligent access techniques such as CDMA and/or TDMA to support communication for a variety of input signaling schemes and data rates. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiment is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. The RX Channelizer 890 receives output signals from the RX Elastic Store 880. FIG. 14 is a functional block diagram of the RX Channelizer 890. In the receive mode, T3/E3 output is desired, the Channelizer 890 constructs T3/E3 data from N receive data streams. The RX Channelizer 890 comprises an N-bit Register 862 and a Counter 864. The RX Channelizer 890 receives N data channels 866 from the Deframer 870 into the Register 862. The RX Channelizer 890 constructs T3/E3 data from the N channels 866 containing RX packet data. The Counter 863 clocks",
