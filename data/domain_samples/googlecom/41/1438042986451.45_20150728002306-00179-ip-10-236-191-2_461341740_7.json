No. 07/081,250 filed on Aug. 4, 1987, now abandoned., 21616=The respiration rate provided by the present invention is based on the detection of breath sounds in the presence of other biological signals and ambient noise. Referring to the drawings in more detail, and to FIG. 1 in particular, the preferred embodiment of the respiration rate monitor of the present invention is shown. The breath sounds are detected by an appropriate biological sensor 12, such as a microphone, which is sensitive to acoustical energy in the bandwidths of interest. A wide variety of sensors can be employed for detection of the breath sounds, including those comprising air-coupled stethoscope microphones and piezoelectric devices. The sensor 12 produces an electrical output signal which corresponds to a waveform comprising a component related to the patient's breath sounds, a component related to the patient's heart sounds, and a plurality of components related to other biological functions and ambient noise. The output signal produced by the sensor 12 is amplified by the input amplifier 14 and filtered in the analog bandpass filter 16. In the preferred embodiment of the invention system, the analog bandpass filter 16 has a passband of between 0.1 Hz and 1000 Hz. The analog output signal produced by the bandpass filter is digitized by the analog-to-digital (A/D) sample module 18 to produce a digital output signal. In the preferred embodiment, the A/D sampling is at a rate of approximately 4000 hertz. A typical anti-aliased output signal 20 produced by the A/D sampling module is illustrated in FIG. 2. As can be seen in this figure, the output signal comprises a plurality of high amplitude peaks 21 which represent acoustic signals produced by the patient's heart, a plurality of lower amplitude signals 22 which represent the breath sounds produced by the patient, and a plurality of other signal components produced by biological and environmental factors.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the respiration rate monitor of the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the invention to the specific form set forth herein, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Experimental results have shown that the respiration described herein provides an effective means for determining respiration rate from a patient's breath sound. In particular, the system provided by the present invention is very effective in determining respiration rate in the presence of ambient noise and interference. The banded zero-crossing detector 38 processes the waveform shown in FIG. 4 to produce a series of markers indicating the occurrence of inspiration and expiration events. These markers are shown in FIG. 5. The marked event times are further processed by a rate calculator 42 to provide an indication of the respiration rate which is then displayed on the display 44. The processing routine employed in the rate calculator 42 can be calculated by a number of different techniques which are known in the art. The resulting waveform 35 produced by this series of processing steps is shown in FIG. 4. As can be seen, the resulting waveform comprises a plurality of peaks and troughs. The peaks in FIG. 4 correspond to either an inspiration",
