As discussed in detail above, according to the present invention, it is possible to reduce irregularities in luminance occurring in the vicinity of the incidence surface of the light guide plate employed for the surface light source device of side light type. The reduction of irregularities in luminance is achieved with a little sacrifice of efficiency of light utilization and size of the luminant surface. Further, in the structure according to the eighth to tenth embodiments, the light guide plate 1 may be made of transparent plastic material without the light-scattering light guide and the emission surface 11 may be roughened, or a convex lens array may be formed on the emission surface 11. In such cases, it is possible to provide the same effects as those described above. In the structures according to the eighth to tenth embodiments, surface roughening may additionally be made to the incidence surface 10 of the light guide plate 1. As in the seventh embodiment, it is thereby possible to reduce lack of luminance in the emission surface (occurrence of so-called \"dark band\") in the vicinity of the incidence surface. Further, the edge portions 61, 62",
