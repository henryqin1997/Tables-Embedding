Application developers can, over time, migrate their services into an integrated platform without worrying about the extensibility of the API and the performance penalty. 2) Maintain flexibility for developers' value-added\u2014PAPI may allow application developers to enhance or maintain their value-add so that vendors' differentiation is not compromised. 1) Time-to-market for application developers\u2014Since time-to-market is a major concern for application vendors, the PAPI design minimizes the development effort required by the application developers in order for the existing applications to take advantages of the policy engine's enhanced performance. It can be seen that in accordance with the present invention, use of the policy engine and policy cache not only addresses many if not all of the performance considerations discussed above in the Background, but also preserves a great amount of flexibility in setting network policies and the following consderations are taken into account. Thus, in summary, upon the completion of the policy binding \u201clearning\u201d process, the policy engine 106 may immediately take control of the bound stream and execute the appropriate actions in accordance with the action specifications 210 in the policy cache 209 without any intervention from the \u201chost\u201d (policy-based) application. This method also relieves the policy engine 106 hardware from doing complicated pattern matching because it can simply compute a hash value (or use some other identification function) from the",
