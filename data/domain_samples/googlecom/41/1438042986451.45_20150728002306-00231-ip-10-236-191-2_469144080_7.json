    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{97242=The Phone page is illustrated in FIG. 14. The Phone page is accessed from the Main Menu page. Pressing the PHONE touchpoint on the Main Menu page causes the processor to display the Phone page. The Phone page is also accessed by pressing the PHONE touchpoint on the Get Map and Third Party pages. As with the other pages, the limited GPS data is continuously displayed showing PCD location, heading, and north. The PCD can access several areas of the display even while the PCD is being used as a telephone. Information provided in the display area 1401 will vary depending upon the page from which the phone page was accessed. The Phone page provides for selection of a function through touch points displayed in the sub-menu portion of the display. The selectable touchpoints are: POLICE 403, MEDICAL 405, DATA PROVIDER 407, DIRECTORY 413, and MEMORY 415., 126227=FIG. 38 illustrates a display of a PCD displaying a trail plot with condition reporting device locations. As illustrated, the trail plot is indicated by a thick line. The thick line follows a first route 1262 until the first route intersects a second route 1260. The plot trail thereafter follows the second route. The locations of condition reporting devices 1264 a-b are indicated along the route by star symbols (\u22c6)., 139791=In step 1344 the user selects the TRNSMT option and the information entered by the user in step 1342 is transmitted by the PCD to the cell site telephone number. In step 1346 the cell site computer system determines which information pertains to the cell site telephone number., 52064=This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/126,936 filed Jul. 30, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,853, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference, which is a continuation-in-part of and claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/879,955 filed on Jun. 20, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,261, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 136115=FIG. 47 illustrates a process of determining travel times. In step 1390, the process reads route information stored by the PCD. In step 1392, the process determines if the user has provided alternative route segments. If the user has provided alternative route segments the process reads information describing the alternative route segments in step 1394. Otherwise, the process determines alternative route segments in step 1396. Regardless, if the source of the alternative route segments, the process determines travel times for each of the route segments; and the route as a whole, in step 1398. The process then returns., 129922=Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 41, the process determines an ordered list of CRDs along the route in step 1290. In step 1292, the process causes information from the next CRD to be displayed. In step 1294 the process determines if the CRD whose information is being displayed is within a predefined distance of the PCD. Once the CRD is within the predefined distance the process deletes the CRD from the ordered list in step 1296. In step 1298, the process determines if the list is empty. If the list is empty, the process returns. Otherwise, the process displays information from the next CRD in the list to be displayed in step 1292., 133637=The ALT RTE function of the PCD uses current speed information from CRDs along the user's route, and alternatives to the user's route, to determine travel times. FIG. 43 illustrates a PCD display showing a user's route 1300 comprised of multiple segments 1300 a-d. The user's route follows a first street 1300 a, a first highway 1300 b, and a second highway 1300 c. Roads and highways near the users route include a second street, a third street 1304, and a fourth street 1306. The user's route includes a segment A which follows the first street 1300 a in a southerly direction to the first highway 1300 b, which runs in a east-west direction. The user's route then has a segment B which follows the first highway 1300 b in a westerly direction until the first highway intersects the second highway 1300 c, which runs in a north-south direction. The user's route then has a segment C which follows the second highway 1300 c until the termination of the route at the intersection of the second highway 1300 c and the fourth street 1306., 138979=FIG. 45 illustrates a method of directing a PCD to obtain restaurant-related information from the cell site telephone number. In step 1340 the PCD displays a screen having PHN #, PHN/EMAIL, and RTN ADDRS entry fields. The user enters the cell site telephone number in the PHN # entry field, P or E in the PHN/EMAIL entry field, and either the phone number of the PCD or an e-mail address in the RTN ADDRS entry field. In step 1342 the user enters information in the PHN #, PHN/EMAIL, and RTN ADDRS entry fields. If the user enters P in the PHN/EMAIL entry field, then the user should also enter the phone number of the PCD in the RTN ADDRS entry field. If the user enters E in the PHN/EMAIL entry field, then the user should enter an e-mail address in the RTN ADDRS entry field., 120180=FIG. 36 illustrates a block diagram of a cable television distribution system for the weather reporting and condition reporting devices. A central cable television office 1230 provides for transmission of television signals over land line 1231 to various locations 1231 a-v. The various locations may be residences, businesses, or other users of cable television distribution services. The land lines may be coaxial cable or fiber optic land lines. A central cable television office also provides links 1236 to telephone and computer networks for the transmission of Internet-related data. Thus, the land lines provides two-way communication between the central cable television office and the various locations., 127953=FIG. 40 illustrates a PCD display showing information received from the condition reporting device. The information from condition reporting device includes a single digital photo 1284. The information received from the condition reporting device also includes traffic speed indications 1286 and current weather information, including temperature 1288 and wind speed 1289., 124040=In step 1242 the central computer receives the condition report device request from the PCD. In step 1244 the central computer system determines the locations of condition reporting devices along the route. If the route information includes road or highway identifiers, then the central computer system identifies condition reporting devices along such roads or highways, and also determines the condition reporting devices along such roads or highways within the latitude and longitude constraints, as indicated by waypoints, of the route. This process is performed for each road or highway identified in the route information as being along the route. If the route information does not include road or highway identifiers, then the central computer system determines the locations of condition reporting devices within one-tenth of a mile of the route. The central computer system of course need not be limited to reporting condition reporting device locations within one-tenth of a mile of the route. Other distance values may be used, and the PCD may also transmit a requested search criteria to the central computer system for use by the central computer system., 123077=CRD location data may be used in conjunction with route information (plot trail) stored by the PCD. FIG. 37 illustrates a process for using the route information stored by the PCD to obtain information concerning the availability of condition reporting devices from the central computer system along the route stored by the PCD. In step 1240 a request for condition reporting device locations is transmitted by the PCD to the central computer system. Any of the communication means included with the PCD may be used to form such transmission, with one embodiment using cellular telephone communication. Included with the request for condition reporting device locations is data indicating the route information maintained by the PCD. The route information includes waypoint information for waypoints along the route. Road and highway identifiers are also transmitted when the route information also includes road or highway identifiers., 143627=Thus, the PCD can be used to monitor the locations of individuals utilizing PCDs. For example, credit authorization agencies may make use of the location monitoring capability provided by the PCD in determining the validity of credit requests. FIG. 46 illustrates a method of credit authorization using the PCD. In step 1360 an individual makes a request for credit. This may be accomplished in a variety of manners, including \u201cswiping\u201d a credit card through a credit card reader at a gas station, supermarket, or a variety of other locations, or merely by providing a credit card to a retail clerk who thereafter requests credit authorization. The request for credit may be made to a credit card issuer, or may merely be a request for credit authorization by a credit reporting facility., 120947=Also attached to the land line are condition reporting devices 1234. The condition reporting devices are attached to the land line either through the cable access port or the fiber optic access port, depending on the nature of the land line to the condition reporting devices. The condition reporting devices transmit digital data corresponding to the data received by the devices input sensors over the land line to the central cable television office. The central cable television office then transmits digital information received by the condition reporting devices to the residences in other locations, with each condition reporting device provided a separate cable television channel., 134861=Alternatively, the user could take a route including a second street 1302 which runs in a east-west direction, a third street 1304 which runs in a north-south direction and intersects the second street and the fourth street 1306. The-second street is comprised of a segment D from the user's start point to the third street, and a segment E from the third street to the second highway. The third street is similarly comprised of a segment F and a segment G., 140109=In step 1348 the cell site computer system determines whether the information transmitted by the PCD included a P or an E in the PHN/EMAIL field. In step 1352 the cell site computer system instructs the cell site to transmit the information pertaining to the cell site telephone number to the phone number transmitted by the PCD in the RTN ADDRS field if the PHN/EMAIL field contains a P. In step 1350 the cell site computer system transmits an e-mail message to the e-mail address transmitted by the PCD in the RTN ADDRS field if the PHN/EMAIL field contains an E., 125909=In step 1248 the PCD receives the locations of reporting devices. In step 1250 the PCD correlates the condition reporting device locations to the route information and forms a map display indicating the trail plot and the condition reporting device locations the process then returns., 125241=In step 1246 the central computer system transmits condition reporting device locations along the route to a PCD. For each such condition reporting device, the central computer system also transmits information identifying methods of communication with the condition reporting devices. For example, some condition reporting devices may make data available over computer networks such as the Internet or World Wide Web. Other condition reporting devices may only transmit information via radio communications within a small area, or may be part of a linked condition reporting device system allowing for radio communication over larger areas., 126878=FIG. 39 illustrates a process of the manual method. In the manual method the user of the PCD slews the cursor over the reported location of the condition reporting device in step 1270. In step 1272 the user selects the condition reporting device identified by the cursor. In step 1274 the PCD determines whether the condition reporting device is communicated with a via a computer network or via radio transmissions. If the condition reporting device is communicated with via a computer network, then the PCD transmits a request to the condition reporting device for data over the computer network in step 1275. If the condition reporting device transmits information via radio communications, then the PCD sets its radio receiver to the appropriate frequency for receiving transmissions from the condition reporting device in step 1276. In step 1278 the PCD receives the information from the condition reporting device. The PCD then formats the data in step 1280 and displays the data in step 1282., 117246=The radio transceiver unit allows the condition reporting device to transmit information via radio signals both to end-users and to other condition reporting devices. As illustrated in FIG. 35, first through fourth condition reporting devices 1220 a-d are located alongside an arterial route 1222. Traveling along the arterial route are automobiles 1224a,b. A home 1226 equipped with a radio receiver 1228 is located near the arterial route. Specifically, the home is located most near the fourth condition 1220 d reporting device, and most distant from the first condition reporting device 1220 a. The automobiles receive information from the condition reporting devices via radio signals, as does the home, and thus end-users in the automobiles and the home receive up-to-date information regarding conditions along the arterial., 144442=In step 1362 the request for credit is transmitted to a credit authorizer. In step 1364 the credit authorizer determines whether credit authorization is appropriate in view of the credit authorizer's prior art credit authorization practices. Such prior art practices include the use of credit limits, past credit usage, and other factors. If the credit authorizer determines that credit authorization according to prior art practices is not appropriate, then credit authorization is denied in step 1366. If credit authorization according to prior art practices is appropriate, then the credit authorizer transmits an interrogatory to the individual's PCD in step 1368. In step 1370 the credit authorizer waits a predetermined time for a response from the PCD. In step 1371 the credit authorizer determines if a response from the PCD has been received. If a response from the PCD has been received, the credit authorizer determines if the PCD location is consistent with the request for credit in step 1372. This may be accomplished by determining if the PCD is at the location from which credit was requested. If the reported location is consistent with the request for credit, then the process grants or authorizes credit in step 1378. If the reported location is not consistent with the request for credit, the process denies credit in step 1366. If no response is received from the PCD, the credit authorizer determines if previous PCD reported locations are consistent with the location from which credit was requested in step 1374. For example, the credit authorizer may have received responses from previous requests for position from the PCD, or an e-mail address of the credit authorizer may have been entered by the individual for AUTO-TIMED or MOVE position updates. If the previous location is consistent with the request for credit, then the process grants or authorizes credit in step 1378. If the previous locations is not consistent with the request for credit, the process denies credit in step 1366., 131832=Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 42, in step 1310, the process creates a travel list comprising a sequential list of CRDs expected to be encountered over the route. The process causes data from the first CRD in the list to be displayed in step 1312. The process then determines if a predefined time period has elapsed in step 1314. Once the predefined time period elapses the process determines if the list is empty in step 1316. If the list is empty the process returns. If the list is not empty the process causes display of data from the next CRD in the list in step 1317. The process then waits predefined time period in step 1318. When the predefined time period elapses the process determines if the end of the sequential list has been reached in step 1320. If the end of the list has been reached the process causes display of information from the first CRD in the list in step 1317. Otherwise, the process causes display of information from the next CRD in the sequential list in step 1317., 136795=FIG. 44 illustrates a block diagram of a local area transmission system for providing multimedia information using GPS navigation system coordinates. Data 1330 pertaining to a local geographic area is maintained by cellular telephone system providers or other entities. The particular local geographic locations are based on the locations of cell sites for cellular telephone networks, and the location specific data is transmitted by a cell site 1332 both over a standard radio broadcast system using a radio transmitter 1334 and by request to the cell site via a telephone access number. This data includes ASCII or other text formats, digital graphical images, including maps, digital photo-based images, and audio data., 135359=Condition reporting devices 1308 a-j are located at various points along the streets and highways. The condition reporting devices provide traffic speed and weather indications through the PCD via methods discussed above. The map information made available to the PCD and stored by the PCD contains distance information. The PCD therefore is able to make use of the traffic speed information and the distance information to determine travel times for the various route and route alternative segments. Real time calculation and display of segment travel times accordingly allows the PCD user to accurately determine and estimate travel times to particular destinations over a plurality of different roads and road segments., 115057=FIG. 34 illustrates a block diagram of the condition reporting device (CRD). The CRD includes a processor 1200, memory 1202, a battery 1204, a speed detector 1206, a digital camera 1208, a radio transceiver 1210, an antenna 1212, a coaxial cable port 1214, and sensors 1216. The memory stores data pertaining to operation of the CRD, including instructions for execution by the processor which controls operation of the CRD. Specifically, the processor reads data from the various sensors and transmits data via the transceiver. In one embodiment the memory additionally stores data pertaining to normal expected conditions, such as normal temperatures or traffic flow, at the CRD location. This data could take the form of merely the average normal temperature at the site, but more preferably provides daily or hourly normal temperatures and hourly traffic pattern information.}",
