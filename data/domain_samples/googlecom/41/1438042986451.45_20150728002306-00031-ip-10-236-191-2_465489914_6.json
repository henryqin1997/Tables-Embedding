Thus it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. . In electrical connector 110\u2032, the central contact 160\u2032 extends beyond the forward facing surface 130\u2032 of the interior portion 132\u2032 of the inner tubular sleeve 114\u2032, making the first connector portion 112\u2032 the male portion. The center contact 164\u2032 in the second connector portion 150\u2032 has a front end 166\u2032 that is approximately equal with the front end 168\u2032 of the second connector portion 150\u2032. FIG. 10 An alternative embodiment of an electrical connector 110\u2032 is illustrated in To disengage the first connector portion 112 from the second connector portion 150, a user pulls backward on the outer tubular sleeve 116, causing the projections 144 to move between the projections 126 on the at least two segmented elements 124 and the second connector portion 150 and lifting at least two segmented elements 124 in a radially outward direction, allowing the first connector portion 112 to be unmated from the second connector portion 150. The electrical connector 110 also includes in the inner tubular sleeve 114 a central contact",
