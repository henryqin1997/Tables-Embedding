    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While certain exemplary embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention. It will be realized by those skilled in the art that, while an exemplary embodiment has been described and shown with pull-up and pull-down resistors and transistors, that the pull-up devices can replaced with pull-down devices and pull-down devices replaced with pull-up devices within the scope of this invention. It should be appreciated that the signaling voltages may be any two distinct voltages which may or may not correspond to device supply voltages. The logical high data level may or may not be represented by the more positive of the two signaling voltages. It will also be appreciated that the reference voltage may be at any point between the signaling voltages and it is not limited to the midpoint between the signaling voltages. Therefore it is intended that the scope of the invention be limited only by the following claims. When the adjusting process of the second phase has converged, the pull-up counter 354 value is latched 936 into the pull-up value latch 104 and the pull-down counter 356 value is latched 936 into the pull-down value latch 106, thus programming the strengths of the output buffers 120. The second compensation buffer is disabled 938 and the resistive termination compensation process ends 940. After",
