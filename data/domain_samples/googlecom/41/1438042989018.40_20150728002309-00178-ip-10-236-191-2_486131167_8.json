No. 5,317,179., 32499=Referring to FIG. 5C, a first polycrystalline silicon layer 102 is formed using standard LPCVD techniques over first dielectric layer 40 to a thickness of about 2500 \u212b. First polycrystalline silicon layer 102 is then doped with phosphorus or arsenic using well-known ion implantation techniques to a doping concentration of about 1019 atoms/cm3. Photoresist is then deposited over the first polycrystalline layer 102 and patterned to form photoresist pattern 103. The first polycrystalline layer 102 is then plasma etched using chlorine gas etchant manufactured by Matheson at 45\ufffd C. to form floating gate 50. Photoresist pattern 103 is then removed., 31270=The procedure for producing the memory cell described above will now be explained. Referring to FIG. 5A, upon a monocrystalline silicon substrate 20, having been doped with boron to a doping concentration at about 1016 atoms/cm3, thereby producing a resistivity of about 1 to 10 \u03a9-cm, is grown a field oxide layer 80 to a thickness of 7000 \u212b in the manner known in the art. Upon the surface 26 of the substrate 20 is then formed a first dielectric layer 40, most preferably tantalum oxide, but may also be SiO2 or Si3 N4. The first dielectric layer 40 is grown to a depth of 100-1000 \u212b, preferably 800 \u212b using methods known in the art such as chemical vapor deposition, reactive sputtering or thermal reaction., 32055=Referring to FIG. 5B, photoresist 100 manufactured by Shipley is then deposited over first dielectric layer 40 and patterned to provide aperture 101. Lightly doped portion 37 of the to be formed drain region 35 is then doped using ion implantation of phosphorus or arsenic to doping concentration of about 1018 atoms/cm3. The photoresist 100 is then removed using techniques taught by the manufacturer., 33590=Next, the second polycrystalline silicon layer 105 is then doped with phosphorus or arsenic to provide a resistivity of about 10 \u03a9-cm. Photoresist 106 is then deposited over second polycrystalline silicon layer 105, and then patterned to provide resist pattern 107. The exposed portion of second polycrystalline silicon layer 105 is then etched to form the desired configuration for control gate 70, as shown in FIG. 5E. Thereafter, photoresist 107 is removed and the heavily doped portion 39 of drain region 35 and the source region 30 are doped using ion implantation with arsenic or phosphorus to a doping concentration of about 1020 atoms/cm3. Finally, leads are attached by metallization techniques known in the art., 15318=A typical prior art split gate flash EEPROM cell has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,783,766 issued Nov. 8, 1988, to G. Samachisa et al.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above described process is the preferred method of producing the inventive memory cell. However, it is of course understood that other known techniques may be substituted to produce the inventive memory cell. Next, the second polycrystalline silicon layer 105 is then doped with phosphorus or arsenic to provide a resistivity of about 10 \u03a9-cm. Photoresist 106 is then deposited over second polycrystalline silicon layer 105, and then patterned to provide resist pattern 107.

Finally, leads are attached by metallization techniques known in the art. Second polycrystalline silicon layer 105 is then deposited over second dielectric layer 60 using LPCVD techniques to a thickness of about 3000 \u212b. As shown in FIG. 5D, a second dielectric layer 60, typically silicon dioxide, is then formed using chemical vapor deposition or thermal oxidation techniques to a thickness of between 100 to 500 \u212b, preferably 200 \u212b. Referring to FIG. 5C, a first polycrystalline silicon layer 102 is formed using standard LPCVD techniques over first dielectric layer 40 to a thickness of about 2500 \u212b. First",
