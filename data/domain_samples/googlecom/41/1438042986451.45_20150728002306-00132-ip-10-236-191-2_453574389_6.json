Microcapsules with absorbed taggant can be adhered to cargo and will remain relatively inconspicuous. For example, previous research has shown that Styrofoam boxes, suitcases, attaches and heat sealed plastic bags are all poor barriers of PFTs due to the relative lack of air tightness. Even aluminum luggage with rubber gaskets does not prevent the detection of a vapor taggant. Field experiments have verified theoretical models of barrier enclosed explosives. The result indicates the ability for real-time detection of taggants using a taggant detection with a parts-per-trillion level of detection and a sampling system having a dilution factor of 1000. Another conclusion of the model is that the taggant concentration obtained in a moderately sized room fifteen minutes following the introduction of a severe barrier containing a taggant source of one nanoliter/minute emission rate (placed in the room one hour earlier) is sufficient to allow detection by a concentration detection scheme. A moderate barrier, such as a suitcase or box would allow real-time continuous detection of luggage moving on conveyor belt. With detectors that-have a response time of approximately one second, or less, this application is fully practical., 93650=In 1988, an experiment was conducted on the ground to detect a leak in a tagged natural gas line for a utility. Utilizing passive Capillary Absorption (sampling) Tubes mounted on telephone poles (POLE CATS), the underground leak was detected within one-half block by the passive tubes. When utilizing a continuously operating Perfluorocarbon Sniffer (COPS), the leak was pin-pointed to within a few feet. This specific experiment demonstrates the capability for urban and high density tagged chemical detection using conventional PFT sniffing equipment., 91536=Additionally, an air dispersion test using PFTs was conducted in 1993 to identify the source of the haze over the Grand Canyon. Through the detection of the various PFTs released from known sources of the pollution, the actual source was pinpointed at a power plant located over 100 miles down stream. In other experiments, tracer releases were made over a three month period with sampling out to distances of 3000 km at concentrations down to 0.5\ufffd10-15 L/L of air., 48497=FIG. 5 is an enlargement of a section from the scan of FIG. 4 from approximately 1400 to approximately 500 wavenumbers (cm-1), showing more detail., 63690=FIG. 5 is an enlargement of a section from the scan of FIG. 4 from approximately 1400 to approximately 500 wavenumbers (cm-1), showing in more detail the transmittance in that area., 80475=PFT tracers are safe, non-reactive, environmentally benign and volatile gaseous compounds. The ambient background levels of the five routinely used PFTs are in the range of parts per 1015 of air. The present inventors hereof have successfully demonstrated a method of detecting the location of a bag containing 9 previously tagged bills. This demonstration employed gas chromatography as the detection method, and conclusively established PFTs as a useful tool for tracing currency and other objects. The addition of controlled release technologies and spectral characteristic detection of taggant greatly improves the utility of PFTs as practical taggants., 92508=Aircraft were then used, each with the capability to automatically collect twenty air samples which were later sent to a laboratory for PFT analysis. In addition to the collected samples, the aircraft was also equipped with a two-trap sampler, PFT analyzer for real time tracer plume detection. The plane flew at a speed of 250 Km/hour at 500-1500 feet.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations There has thus been shown and described a novel method of tagging and detecting objects, including illicit drugs, crops, chemical compounds and currency with perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) and related compounds which fulfills all the objects and advantages sought therefor. Many changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications of the subject invention will, however, become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering this specification which discloses the preferred embodiments thereof. All such changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention, which is to be limited only by the claims which follow. In 1988, an experiment was conducted on the ground to detect a leak in a tagged natural gas line for a utility. Utilizing passive Capillary Absorption (sampling) Tubes mounted on telephone poles (POLE CATS), the underground leak was detected within one-half block by the passive tubes.

This specific experiment demonstrates the capability for urban and high density tagged chemical detection using conventional PFT sniffing equipment. The fixed ground and airborne sampling data, when coupled with known weather and atmospheric data, can provide the total picture leading to an accurate back track to the PFT emissions source. Sampling usually occurred soon after the release of the PFTs,",
