    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20924=As an alternative to colour detection, an instance of electrochemical detection is described in Anal. Chem. (1984) 56, 2355, where the assay enzyme label converts an electroinactive compound to an electroactive compound which can be electrochemically detected. The electroactive compound, phenol, has a redox potential of +750 mV, and as such the method is not generally applicable because the system will encounter other components which will oxidise at the potential of 750 mV. In practice, this system therefore can not be adopted with a blood or serum sample., 37387=Ferrocenoyl chloride (1 mM) was then dissolved in 5 ml of ice-cold dry pyridine. To this solution was added in one portion a solution of p-aminophenol (1.1 mM) in 5 ml dry pyridine. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours at 4\ufffd C. and then the solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred for a further 2 hours. After this time the solution was filtered and the solvent removed in vacuo. The residue was then dissolved in the minimum amount of ethyl acetate and the compound purified by column chromatography on silica using ethyl acetate/hexane (3:1 v/v) as the eluent. The purified compound was crystallised as orange needles by slow diffusion of hexane into a solution of the compound in a minimum amount of ethyl acetate, 38320=The substrate for the alkaline phosphatase assay was prepared by modification of the methods in Biochem. J., 47, 93-95, (1950) and Biochem. J., 33, 1182-1184, (1939).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In a similar manner to Example 7(a), the cyclic voltammogram of compound (II) with 0.1M glucose was determined at pH 7.8 using a scan rate of 20 mV/s, giving curves (a), (b) and (c) of FIG. 4 respectively for the compound (III), the compound (III) after 5 minutes with alkaline phosphatase, and the compound (III) with alkaline phosphatase and glucose oxidase. Again the amplification was marked. (b) Use of compound (III) A further decrease in current was observed, showing an inverse relationship between the acid phosphatase concentration and the catalytic current. (d) As (c), but 30 \u03bcl of acid phosphatase solution was added. A decrease in current compared with (b) was observed, presumably due to reaction of acid phosphatase on compound (II), which alters its mediator characteristics. (c) As (b) but with 10 \u03bcl of crude acid phosphatase solution incubated with compound (II) and glucose for ten minutes at 37\ufffd C. prior to addition of glucose oxidase. There was a clear difference in current between (a) and (b), due to the oxidase enzymic reaction acting through compound (II) as a mediator. (b) As (a) but with the addition of 25 \u03bcl of 2 mM glucose oxidase after ten minutes incubation of compound (II) and glucose at 37\ufffd C. The incubation was used to show that any decrease in current occurring after addition of acid phosphatase was not due to breakdown in solution of compound",
