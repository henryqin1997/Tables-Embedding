In this article the author reports maximum change of about 25% in resistance (\u0394R/R) upon application of a magnetic field utilizing the Moodera et al structure. That structure is a sandwich of a thin layer insulation between ferromagnetic materials. As reported in the Moodera article this change in resistance sharply declines as applied voltage increases.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations For application as rams, the magnetization states of the three ferromagnets store the information. In principle, the structure can store more than a single bit because there are 8 possible combinations for the direction of the magnetization of the three materials 16, 18, 20 in the double barrier junction. For the simplest example, we assume that two of the three materials are pinned so that only one (for example, the third) can be reversed. In a typical application, we expect an array of these junctions to be created by, for example, lithographic techniques. The direction of the magnetization can be switched (\"written\") by an external field along the planes of the junction generated by a current in an external wire. This information can be read by applying a current to the first tunnel junction 16, 12, 18 and then checking the sign of the voltage across the second junction 18, 14, 20. Depending on the application there are different design possibilities. One can \"pin\" the magnetization of some of the three ferromagnetic components so that one or two, for example, the first and second materials, do not rotate under a field of reasonable strength that is encountered in an application. This \"pinning\" can be achieved by using a material of high coercivity such as cobalt or iron or by placing a material of high coercivity in contact with the ferromagnetic layers. For applications as the read",
