For the purposes of the present description, the term \"pattern\" refers to data, such as a grammar, regular expression, string, etc., used by a pattern analysis unit to recognize information in a document, such as dates, addresses, phone numbers, names, etc. The term \"structure\" refers to an instantiation of a pattern in the document. That is, a \"date\" pattern will recognize the structure \"Oct. 31, 1995.\" The application of a pattern to a document is termed \"parsing.\", 43730=As shown in FIG. 7, upon recognition of a mouse-down operation over a structure, user interface 240 presents a pop-up menu 710. In this example, pop-up menu 710 displays the candidate actions linked to the selected telephone number grammar 410, including dialing the number and putting the number into an electronic telephone book. Upon selection of the action for putting the number in an electronic telephone book, user interface 240 transmits the corresponding telephone number and selected action to action processor 250. Action processor 250 locates and opens the electronic telephone book, places the telephone number in the appropriate field and allows the user to input any additional information into the file., 40969=Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrating an analyzer server 220 is shown. In this figure, analyzer server 220 is described as having a parser 310 and a grammar file 320, although alternatively or additionally a fast string search function or other function can be used. Parser 310 retrieves a grammar from grammar file 320 and parses text using the retrieved grammar. Upon identification of a structure in the text, parser 310 links the actions associated with the grammar to the identified structure. More particularly, parser 310 retrieves from grammar file 320 pointers attached to the grammar and attaches the same pointers to the identified structure. These pointers direct the system to the associated actions contained in associated actions file 330. Thus, upon selection of the identified structure, user interface 240 can locate the linked actions., 41859=FIG. 4 illustrates an example of an analyzer server 220, which includes grammars 410 and a string library 420 such as a dictionary, each with associated actions. One of the grammars 410 is a telephone number grammar with associated actions for dialing a number identified by the telephone number grammar or placing the number in an electronic telephone book. Analyzer server 220 also includes grammars for post-office addresses, e-mail addresses and dates, and a string library 420 containing important names. When analyzer server 220 identifies an address using the \"e-mail address\" grammar, actions for sending e-mail to the identified address and putting the identified address in an e-mail address book are linked to the address., 47341=Referring now to FIG. 10, a flowchart illustrating the preferred method 820 for scanning and detecting patterns in a document is shown. Method 820 starts by retrieving 1010 data to be analyzed. After the data is retrieved, several pattern analysis processes may be performed on the data. As illustrated in block 1020, a parsing process retrieves 1030 grammars, detects 1040 structures in the data based on the retrieved grammars, and links 1050 actions associated with each grammar to each structure detected by that grammar. As illustrated in block 1060, a fast string search function retrieves 1070 the contents of string library 420, detects 1080 the strings in the data identical to those in the string library 420, and links 1090 actions associated with the library string to the detected string. As illustrated in block 1100, additional pattern analysis processes, such as a neural net scan, can be performed 1100 to detect in the data other patterns, such as pictures, graphs, sound, etc. Method 820 then ends. Alternatively, the pattern analysis processes can be performed in parallel using a multiprocessor multitasking system, or using a uniprocessor multithreaded multitasking system where a thread is allocated to execute each pattern detection scheme.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations These and other variations of the preferred and alternate embodiments and methods are provided by the present invention. For example, program 165 in FIG. 1 can be stored in ROM, disk, or in dedicated hardware. In fact, it may be realized as a separate electronic circuit. Other components of this invention may be implemented using a programmed general purpose digital computer, using application specific integrated circuits, or using a network of interconnected conventional components and circuits. The analyzer server 220 of FIG. 2 may use a neural net for searching a graphical document 210 for faces, or a musical library for searching a stored musical piece 210 for sounds. The user interface 240 may present structures and actions via voice synthesis over a telephone line connection to system 100. The embodiments described have been presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting, and many variations and modifications are possible in light of the foregoing teaching. The system is limited only by the following claims. Referring now to FIG. 10, a flowchart illustrating the preferred method 820 for scanning and detecting patterns in a document is shown.
