In particular, International Patent Application WO-A-0133388 published on May 10, 2001 in the name of Sherwood International Group Ltd. discloses a method and system for multi-user access of a database over the Internet which provides for web-page creation containing user specific personal data obtained from a legacy back-end system such as those maintained by banks, insurance companies, etc. Here, when a web-page containing user specific data is requested by a user, an application server receives the request from the website server, and interfaces with the legacy back-end system to obtain the requested user specific information. The user specific information is usually stored on a legacy database system which is incapable of dynamically processing multiple concurrent requests. In order to get around this problem, WO-A-0133388 introduces the concept of multiple types of user specific web-pages, being those user specific web-pages wherein the information thereon does not change, being static web-pages, user specific web-pages wherein the information content only changes periodically, and can therefore be considered semi-static, and finally user specific web-pages wherein the information content can change in real time, and therefore the web-page can be considered to be dynamic. In order to provide for service to multiple concurrent users, the system of WO-A-0133388 stores user specific static and semi-static web-pages in a file system for access by the application server when requested, and performs periodic batch processing in order to update the information content on the semi-static pages. With respect to the creation of dynamic pages, a mail-merge technique is used wherein the application server interfaces with a database controller to access the required information from the legacy database, and the required information is then mail-merged into a web-page template in order to create a dynamic web-page. The statistical division of web-pages into static, semi-static and dynamic pages, as described above allows for a greater number of multiple concurrent users to be serviced than would otherwise be the case.}",

The hierarchical structured approach to web-page generation embodied by the present invention allows for many thousands of multiple concurrent users to be serviced at any one time.
