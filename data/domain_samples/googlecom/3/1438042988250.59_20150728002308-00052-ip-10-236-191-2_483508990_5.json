    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The attached description of exemplary and anticipated embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the teachings herein. For example, a suitable inflatable device or mechanical drive can be used in replacement for the air-muscle. Additional sensors could be used for measuring critical parameters for restoring physical function. Multiple motion causing devices could be simultaneously connected at various positions on the patient's body, and the devices could be controlled by multiple or single controllers. Also, there could be a single display configured to provide feedback on several different measured parameters. The therapist could be allowed to select, from a menu provided through the display, unique therapeutic protocol(s) for a specific patient. Furthermore, the frequency of patient use and the ability to reach performance goals can be recorded in memory and the record played back for the therapist/patient. While the specification describes particular embodiments of the present invention, those of ordinary skill can devise variations of the present invention without departing from the inventive concept. In summary, the system and method according to the present invention is a self-contained, mobile device, implementing a protocol, and which provides visual and/or aural feedback of wrist and finger position, measurement of extensor and flexor activity for",
