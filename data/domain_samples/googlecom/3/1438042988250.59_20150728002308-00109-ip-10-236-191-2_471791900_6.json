No. 07-040,538, filed Apr. 17, 1987 now abandoned, which application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser. No. 628,517 filed July 6, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,397, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 547,713 filed Nov. 1, 1983, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,046., 47914=A port 26 is provided in the top, end face 28 of the watch. The port provides a window 30 for the light source 32 contained in the watch. As previously discussed, this light source may be one of various types which may be powered by the battery and electronic circuitry contained within the electronic watch. Reference numer 34 indicates the light-emission pattern from the light source and clearly shows the cone-type projection previously discussed. The cone-type emission pattern 34 from the light source 32, contained in the watch, transmits the coded optical signal through the air to a protodetector contained within the signal receiving unit discussed below. The top location of part 26 is convenient for the user so he can visually align the emission pattern 34 towards the receiver by sighting in the 12 o'clock direction. Radio antenna 33 is also provided in the top, end face 28 for emitting a radio frequency signal. Unlike the light beam, the radio signal diverges from the antenna with spherical wavefronts 35 travelling in all directions., 58418=Even more recently, non-volatile random access memories (NVRAMs) have been developed that combine a conventional high speed volatile memory with a back-up E2 PROM that is loaded with the volatile memory data in case of a loss of power. Such NVRAMs are manufactured by Intel Corporation under the designation 2004. Although the memory capacity of the 2004 is substantially in excess of the capacity need, the NVRAM technology is the preferred choice for use in the signal transmitting and receiving units of the invention., 40997=The universal electronic system may also be used in hotels or other multiple rental units that are controlled from a central desk. The desk clerk would have access to each door lock by a data link such as wire pairs, optical fibers, etc. that permits entry or erasure of a code or resetting the lock so that the next code entered will be added to the lock's temporary memory. When a guest registered for a room the desk clerk would assign the guest a room number and advise the guest that he has just reset the door lock so that it will be activated by the next code received by the guest's transmitter. In a case where the guest does not yet have a transmitter, an inexpensive unit having a minimum of features can be assigned to him for the duration of his visit in the same manner that a key is presently assigned. In addition to the remote reset features just described, the door lock can also be designed so that another code, in addition to the guest code, can be added or deleted from the individual lock memory without interfering with the guest's code. This would permit a maid to gain entry into the room. As is to be understood, all codes could be changed from the front desk at convenient intervals. Carrying the concept of remote setting of a lock code further, in certain secure areas a lock may be remotely set in a programmed fashion for many different authorization situations. For example, a lock can be set to allow access only during 8AM to 5PM working hours, or a code that might open a bank safe at 9AM on January 2nd may be rejected on January 3rd. This mode of operation would be useful in banks and other financial institutions, government agencies, storerooms, data files, etc. An additional useful feature is that actuated locks may report the actuation code to a central process for future reference. An example would be the actuation of a lock to use an office copying machine. Reporting the code could be useful in subsequent charging for service.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has now been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments and exemplified with respect thereto, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various modifications, changes, omissions and substitutions may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. It is intended, therefore, that the present invention be limited solely by the scope of the following claims. Also, while the invention has been exemplified with respect to two forms of electromagnetic radiation, light and radio, it is understood that other forms of electromagnetic radiation, notably microwaves, can be used to transmit the encoded signal. As indicated previously, an important aspect of this invention is the recognition that many elements already included in typical electronic watches, such as the digital display panel and some function operations, can be used for the dual purpose of telling time and opening locks. Of course, it is recognized that the invention may be incorporated into other electronic devices which include many of the functions and integrated circuitry of the modern, electronic watch. State-of-the-art reliability in present day solid state electronics, including optical emitters and photodetectors, makes the electronic locking system more reliable, secure and convenient than present mechanical locking devices. FIG. 11 depicts a further mechanism for providing the dual unlatching capability in accordance with the invention, employing an electrical switch rather than a series of mechanical parts. In this embodiment, an electronic switch lock 120 is",
