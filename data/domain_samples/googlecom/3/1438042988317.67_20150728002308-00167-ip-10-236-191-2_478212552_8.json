    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{181618=[0125] A film of the block copolymer was prepared by casting from a 5 wt % solution in toluene onto a water surface at room temperature. Following the slow evaporation of the solvent, the film was dried for 2 hours in air and 12 hours in vacuum at room temperature before annealing for 12 hours under vacuum at 100\ufffd C. and 2 hours at 150\ufffd C. in order to remove all residual solvent and relax any mechanical stresses induced by the film casting procedure. A strip of material measuring 0.28\ufffd5.8\ufffd15.85 mm was cut from this film. The modulus of this strip was measured in a conventional dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (Rheometrics DMTA-IV) to be 10\ufffd2 MPa over a frequency range from 1 to 1000 Hz. See FIG. 25. At the same time, a second strip of material 0.28 mm thick was glued to the previously measured piece of polyimide with a drop of toluene, permitted to dry for 2 hours in vacuum, and mechanically clamped between the top and bottom plates of the sample fixture. The stiffness of this composite material was measured on the same two channels simultaneously. From the linear stiffness of the composite (1340 N/m), the thicknesses of the polyimide and copolymer layers, and the previously measured modulus for polyimide, the modulus of the copolymer was measured to be 13.7 MPa, in good agreement with the value recorded by the conventional measurement., 180860=[0124] The PDMA described herein was used to determine the solid modulus at small strains of a thin film of a commercial poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) copolymer supplied by Aldrich. A sheet of polyimide (DuPont KAPTON HN\u2122) 0.002\u2033 thick was mechanically clamped between the top and bottom sample plates and measured at an oscillation amplitude of 2.5 \u03bcm and a frequency of 10 Hz. The data were measured on two channels simultaneously and show a linear stiffness of 145 N/m; from the thickness of the polyimide and the dimensions of the clearance holes in the sample plates (0.250\u2033), this corresponds to a solid modulus of 2300 MPa, in good agreement with previously published values for this material., 106793=[0075] Various methods can be used to make the sample arrays 320. For example, a sample array 320 comprised of polymers can be prepared by depositing known amounts of solid samples 332 at predefined regions on the flexible substrate 324. Following deposition, the samples 332 and substrate 324 are compressed under melt-flow conditions to create polymer films of requisite thickness. Alternatively, the polymer samples 332 can be dissolved in one or more solvents and deposited at predefined regions on the flexible substrate 324 using conventional liquid handling techniques such as automated pipetting. To prevent liquid samples 332 from spreading beyond their respective predefined regions, the flexible substrate 324 is pretreated\u2014e.g., by selective etching or by silane treatment\u2014to modify the surface energy of the substrate 324 in or out of the predefined regions. See, for example, co-pending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cFormation of Combinatorial Arrays of Materials Using Solution-Based Methodologies,\u201d Ser. No. 09/156,827, filed Sep. 18, 1998, and co-pending U.S. patent application, \u201cPolymer Libraries on a Substrate, Method for Forming Polymer Libraries on a Substrate and Characterization Methods With Same,\u201d Ser. No. 09/567,598, filed May 10, 2000, all of which is herein incorporated by reference. Upon deposition, the liquid samples 332 are confined to regions having like surface energies, and form solid films following evaporation of the solvent. After brief annealing under vacuum to remove residual solvent, the thickness at the center of each sample 332 can be measured using a variety of known techniques, including optical reflection profilometry and optical interference profilometry. Finally, metallic or organometallic compounds can be directly deposited on the flexible substrate 324 by chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, or similar techniques., 63238=[0038] The present invention comprises a system and method for screening combinatorial libraries of materials by measuring the response of individual library members to mechanical perturbations. Throughout and in accord with this specification, the number of member of a combinatorial library of materials may vary depending on the embodiment being practiced. Generally, an array of materials comprises a plurality of materials for which a property measurement is desired. In some embodiments, an array of materials will comprise 8 or more, 16 or more, 24 or more or 48 or more materials, each of which is different from the others. Arrays of materials and methods of making such arrays are described in detail, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,617 and 6,030,917 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/227,558, filed Jan. 8, 1999, all of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. The materials in the arrays may be any type of material for which a property measurement is desirable. Examples of the types of materials that may be in an array include non-biological polymers (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polymethacrylicacid, polyacrylamide, polymethylmethacrylate and the like, including copolymers or higher order polymers of the same monomers), metals (including all types of alloys), composites, etc. The materials in the array may be in various forms, including amorphous, crystalline and mixtures thereof. The only limitation on the type of material is that the material must be capable of being deposited in a manner compatible with the property testing described herein. Those of skill in the art will appreciate from this specification that members of the array may be the same or different materials. Also, standards (such as calibration standards) or blanks may be employed in the array for known scientific purposes. Relative comparison of the properties of members of the array is a particularly useful embodiment of this invention., 178015=[0122] The PMDA using a sample holder 730 and test fixtures 732 shown in FIG. 22 was used to determine the adhesive characteristics of a commercially available formulation (BASF ACRONAL\u2122 DS 3510 X). Approximately ten \u03bcl of this emulsion was deposited on the bottom surface 748 of a brass weight 736 and dried at room temperature and humidity for one hour to form a thin film of adhesive. The weight 736 was placed in the sample holder 730 of the PDMA with the bottom surface 748 facing the probes 104. The sample holder 730 was lowered at 25 \u03bcm/s so as to bring the weight 736 into contact with a stainless steel test fixtures 732 having a rounded tip with a {fraction (1/16)} inch diameter. Upon contact, the sample holder 730 was held in position for 2000 \u03bcs before being retracted at a rate of 25 \u03bcm/s.}",
