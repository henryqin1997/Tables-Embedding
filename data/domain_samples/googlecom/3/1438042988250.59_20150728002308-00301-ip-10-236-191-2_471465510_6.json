    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38574=An additional method known in the art to test LSI circuits is VLSI self test or \"random testing\". (See, e.g., Sedmak, R. M., \"Implementation Techniques for Self-Verification\", Proceedings of the 1979 IEEE Test Conference, October 1979, pp. 37-41; Koenemann, Bernd, \"Built-in Logic Block Observation Techniques\", Proceedings of the 1979 IEEE Test Conference, October 1979, pp. 37-41.) Using this approach, there is no need to externally generate and apply test vectors. Rather, the circuits existing within the VLSI chip design, many of which are designed thereinto solely for testing purposes, are used. Input patterns are randomly generated and applied to the inputs of the unit under test. Said input patterns can be generated, among others, by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). Such registers generate long, repetitive pseudo-noise sequences, short segments of which display properties similar to random patterns. The responses of the outputs of the unit under test are accumulated in a Multiple Input Shift Register (MISR), and upon applying a determined set of said patterns it becomes possible to obtain the signature of said network. The aforementioned test generation method can be optimized by assigning different weights to the input leads of the unit under test. Significant advantages may be realized with VLSI self test: (1) test vectors can be generated automatically inside the chip at high speed; (2) neither test nor response vectors need to be stored external to the chip; (3) testing can proceed at much higher speed than is normally possible using LSI testers; (4) no expensive VLSI testers are needed., 64348=When it is desired to weight the inputs to the UUT to produce a greater number of binary 1's than 0's or vice versa, the individual LFSRs 100-1, . . . 100-N each have additional weighting circuitry. For details of the weighted random pattern generation, see page 20 and FIG. 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,988, filed June 24, 1985, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Alternatively, if a single LFSR is used, a plurality of stages of the LFSR would be connected to the appropriate weighting circuitry. The weighting circuitry is capable of producing weights in which the ratio of 0's to 1's or vise versa can be varied from any ratio between 1-1 to 1-31., 56887=The test generation process for an ECIPT chip is essentially identical to that employed for a chip with level sensitive scan design (LSSD) logic and has been widely published. All the apparatus and program controls necessary for generating the test patterns and performing the tests are known in the state of the art. The programs are instrumental in creating an appropriate fault dictionary and creating a set of test patterns of test vectors to detect faults in an automatic mode. The actual application of tests to an ECIPT chip is essentially identical to that employed for LSSD chips and systems, and routinely requires appropriate testing equipment to achieve it. Such testing equipment is usually complex in both its expense and processes involved therein. The present invention also incorporates elements that are used in the field of self test wherein testers and large computers can be reduced or eliminated. Such built-in self test techniques are explained in the article \"LOCST: A Built-in Self-Test Technique\" by LeBlanc, J. J., of IBM in the November 1984 IEEE Design and Test Magazine. The article uses the generation of pseudorandom sequences through the use of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). This technique is known by those skilled in the art, thus the details are not repeated herein. The implementation of a pseudorandom test generator by means of linear feedback shift register is also known by those skilled in the art. Basically the implementation requires interconnecting a series of latch circuits in a shift register configuration and selectively choosing feedback paths that are coupled back to the input through one or more exclusive OR gates. Signature analysis is also part of the self test theory. Signature analysis is also known to those skilled in the art. For example, see Frohwerk, R. A., \"Signature Analysis: A New Digital Field Service Method,\" Hewlett-Packard Journal, May 1977, pp. 2-8. Basically, when signature analysis is used, a signature analyzer compresses an infinitely long stream of data into an end-bit signature. If the unit under test has a fault and that fault is stimulated by a pseudo-random pattern, it causes the signature from the signature analyzer to differ from the expected signature with a probability very close to 1. For example, if a 16-bit signature analyzer is used, it can be shown that the probability of failing to detect an error in a continuous end bit long stream is only 1.53\ufffd10-5., 61684=Prior to the actual physical testing of a UUT, initial steps are performed wherein for every UUT to be tested, a good machine simulation signature is obtained by applying a set of pseudo-random patterns that will ultimately be created by the LFSRs 100 on test chip 12 to a simulated logic model of the UUT. A plurality of the individual simulation signatures are preferably stored in memory 28 together with the respective pattern count to be applied to each UUT under actual test. Details of a typical simulated signature creation and interrelationship of the simulated signature with the LFSRs and control circuitry may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,688,223 filed June 24, 1985. The actual testing of an isolated UUT is accomplished by loading from memory 28 into appropriate LFSRs 100 the respective initial patterns and loading into the counter register 18 the number of test patterns to be applied to the UUT. The test patterns are applied to the UUT through primary inputs 50-1, . . . 50-N of each chip 10. A final signature is obtained after all test patterns are applied to the chips under test. After the final actual test signature is obtained, the thus obtained actual test signature is compared to the independently simulated \"good machine\" signature. This basic process is then repeated for each UUT. After partitioning and testing as described above, diagnosing is simplified to an unprecedented degree as will be described hereinafter., 28065=Major testing methods used for state of the art testing are Chip-in-Place testing as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,220,917; Through-The-Pins testing as described in the IBM TDB, Vol. 23, No. 2, July 1980, pp. 607-609; Electronic-Chip-In-Place testing (ECIPT), as described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 4,494,066 and 4,441,075 and Self-Test techniques, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,614,608, 3,719,885 4,519,078 and 3,976,864, as well as many published articles in the technical literature; (see, e.g., the November 1984 issue of IEEE Design and Test entitled, \"LOCST: A Built-in Self-test Technique\" by LeBlanc, Johnny J.), 37604=One method known in the art to reduce the amount of test data that must be stored when a deterministic method is employed, is \"signature analysis\". (See Frohwerk, Robert A., \"Signature Analysis: A New Digital Field Service Method,\" Hewlett-Packard Journal, May 1977, pp. 2-8.) In normal LSSD testing, the responses from the test vectors must be compared to known good test vectors. Thus, a large catalog of good test vectors must be stored in order to perform such a comparison. In contrast, signature analysis eliminates the need to generate and store such a catalog of good test vectors. Signature analysis recognizes that an inherent \"signature\" is present in the data streams of output test response vectors. This \"signature\" can be derived, and if it is still detected as being present in the response vectors, one is assured that a successful or correct response has been given by the circuit under test., 35642=Through-The-Pins Testing, as described in the IBM TDB dated July 1980, pages 607-609, by Carpenter et al, has also been used to test multi-chip modules. This technique essentially treats the multi-chip module as if it were a single chip entity. Test patterns are created to detect all possible faults within that package, oftentimes with the help of partitioning techniques, without which test pattern generation would not always be feasible. Testing is done through the module I/O pins as its name indicates it instead of using the I/O's or EC pads of individual chips. However, a tester and its corresponding burden are still required. Moreover, partitioning is inadequate to form partitions along chip boundaries., 41029=A recent advance in the self test art was made in U.S. Pat. No. 4,519,078 granted to D. Komonytsky on May 21, 1985. Komonytsky teaches that it is possible to combine the Design for Testability Technique, known as LSSD (Level Sensitive Scan Design), with self test and thus do away with the tester. Logic on a module can be partitioned along the boundaries set by the shift register latch banks and letting a set of random patterns be created and applied to each partition. These partitions consist of combinatorial logic. The output responses of said partition can be accumulated on the next bank of shift registers, which provides the second boundary of said partition. Thus a complex module containing a large plurality of chips can be reduced to a limited number of partitions, each comprising some combinatorial logic \"sandwiched\" between two banks of shift registers, or one set of shift registers and the inputs of the package, or one set of shift registers and the outputs of said package., 30638=A common thrust of the LSSD approach is to prescribe a built-in test capability for every VLSI unit, such as a chip, module etc., whereby the entire logic state of the unit under test, can be explicitly set and/or examined through exercising certain input/output (I/O) procedures at a limited number of I/O terminals. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,761,695 entitled \"Method of Level Sensitive Testing A Functional Logic System\" granted Sept. 25, 1973 to E. B. Eichelberger; and 3,784,907 entitled \"Method of Propagation Delay Testing A Functional Logic System\" granted Jan. 8, 1974 to E. B. Eichelberger. Stated briefly, the LSSD approach comprises a test operation wherein certain desired logic test patterns are serially inputted and shifted to the appropriate latch locations when the unit is operated in the \"shift mode\" (i.e., by withholding the system clock excitations and turning on the shifting clock to the unit). When this is done, the latch states will provide the desired stimuli for the testing of the related logic nets. Next, the test patterns are propagated through the nets by executing one or more steps of the \"Function Mode\" operation (i.e., by exercising one or more system clock excitations). The response pattern of the logic networks to the applied stimuli is captured by the system latches, in a known manner depending on certain details of hardware design, often replacing the original inputted test patterns. Then, the system reverts to the shift-mode operation, outputting the response patterns for examination and comparison with standard patterns which should be present if the circuitry has operated properly. The LSSD technique is employed to design and test the component chips of the package as well as the design and test of the package. The technique logically partitions the dense LSSD logic into portions which are bounded on the inputs and outputs by Shift Register Latches (SRL's) and package pins wherever system logic dictates. Tests are then generated individually for each partition and subsequently applied through the pins of the package at the tester, as described in the Through-The-Pins Test mechanism. The limitations of the partitioning technique are (a) the partition size can exceed the capacity of available LSSD test generators, (b) the turnaround time to generate package tests is excessive, and (c) the turnaround time to regenerate package tests due to an engineering change is also excessive., 44183=The problems associated with testing very large multi-chip packages, such as multilayered ceramic substrate packages typically having greater than 100 interconnected chips, (i.e. \"Thermal Conduction Modules\" (TCMs), disclosed in the IBM News, Special Edition, November 1980, Copyright by the IBM Corporation (see FIG. 4A for example), clearly demonstrates how many of the aforementioned testing problems come to light. The existence of at least 100 interconnected chips mounted on a ceramic substrate makes self test techniques impractical unless adequate means for partitioning logic into manageable partitions can be found. Self test techniques in the art require a dedicated test chip. On those packages having a relatively small number of large high density chips, the dedication of a chip site for a test chip can be a major detriment to package and system performance. Furthermore, the task of generating an adequate number of sets of test patterns consumes enormous amounts of CPU time, and the storing and handling of the test patterns likewise imposes great demands on any tester.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been particularly described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. The aforementioned structure has the distinct advantage of unifying under one technology both chip and package and incorporating at the same time the necessary testing partitioning and diagnostic requirements to make the complete entity self contained. The test operation is generally as follows: the initial test pattern for the LFSR, the pattern count, and the simulated \"good machine\" signature for each chip are fetched from memory. Chip 10-1 is placed in test mode and all ECIPT SRLs are loaded with the appropriate binary values to inhibit all other chips on the multi-chip module package from interfering with the testing of chip 1. Pseudo-random patterns are generated by the LFSR up to the count stored in the counter register; a final signature is created and compared to that originally fetched from memory and an unfavorable comparison determines that the chip tested is bad. Chip 2 is tested next by placing it in test mode and blocking signals from chip 1 from interfering with the test of chip 2. This is again achieved by appropriately loading ECIPT SRLs with the necessary binary values. The process previously described is then repeated",
