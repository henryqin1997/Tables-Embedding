For example, many different embodiments of haptic feedback devices can be used to output the haptic sensations described herein, including joysticks, steering wheels, gamepads, and remote controls. Furthermore, certain terminology has been used for the purposes of descriptive clarity, and not to limit the present invention. The present invention can also be used in other types of application programs besides games. For example, a user's experience of streaming audio can be enhanced by adding haptic sensations to the audio output, so that if the user is contacting the haptic device while listening to the audio output, features in the audio such as music beats, sustained notes, features of speech etc. can be haptically experienced by the user. Likewise, the present invention can be used with a sound track that is output with streaming video, e.g. over a network such as the Internet. Some embodiments can also allow the user to enter preferences which can adjust how the sound data is analyzed, how the haptic effects are assigned, and how the haptic sensations are output. For example, haptic effect strength, the minimum threshold level of amplitude to recognize a sound feature (e.g., so",
