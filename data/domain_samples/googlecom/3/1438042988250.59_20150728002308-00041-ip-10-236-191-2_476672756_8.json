    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23550=In one aspect, this invention relates to an improved method of rendering a polymer which is not heatable of sealable utilizing high-frequency (0.1-30,000 MHz) electromagnetic radiation (HF) (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.) HF-sealable by either incorporation of carbon monoxide by ccpolymerization or by blending or grafting a carbon monoxide copolymer or terpolymer into the polymer matrix. Hydrogenated forms of the above can also be used. In addition, ethylene/carbon monoxide copolymer (ECO) and interpolymers containing CO can be used for microwave sealing applications (i.e., microwave sealable plastic bags, toothpaste tube sealing, shampoo tube sealing, other microwave sealable containers, valve bag sealing, etc.). We have unexpectedly found that ECO copolymers and interpolymers convert high-frequency electromagnetic radiation into heat for sealing,.welding or fusing over a broad frequency range (0.1-30,000 MHz). Typically, ethylene copolymers may be heatable to some extent at low RF frequencies of 1-50 MHz (radio frequency range is typically considered to be from 1-300 MHz; microwave frequency range is 300-30,000 MHz) such as ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), but none have been found which efficiently heat at the higher frequencies. Other examples of polymers heatable at low frequencies, but which do not efficiently heat at the higher frequencies are polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinylidene chloride, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), and Nylon 6., 22166=As used herein \"high-frequency sealability\" refers to the bonding of the sealable polymer to a portion of itself or to another material using electromagnetic energy frequencies of 0.1-30,000 MHz. This includes radio-frequency (RF) heating and microvave (MW) heating in contradistinction to conventional heat sealing. The high-frequency range is generally taken to include electromagnetic waves over a broad frequency range (0.01 to 30,000 MHz) and covers the ultrasonic frequency range (18 KHz-1000 KHz), the radio frequency (RF) range (1 MHz-300 MHz), and the microwave (MW) frequency range (300 MHz-10,000 MHz). The RF and MW ranges are of particular interest here, with special interest in the MW range due to the increasing use of MW as a processing device., 38781=The melt index (M.I.), also called melt flow rate, as measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238, is preferably in the range of about 0.5 to about 2500, most preferably in the range of about 1 to about 60, even more preferably in the range of about 1 to about 20., 12420=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 042,997, filed 4/27/87 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,787,194) which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 738,008 filed 5-25-85 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,660,354), which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 645,990 filed 8-31-84 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,948) which is, itself, a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 531,110 filed 9-12-83 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,600,614)., 30846=As can be seen from Table I, only ethylene/vinyl alcohol polymer and ethylene interpolymers containing carbon monoxide melted in the microwave oven (2450 MHz).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A multiwall paper/polyethylene/paper valve bag was made using a 13.3 cm layflat blown tube, 0.038 mm thick, of 10% ECO. The ECO tube was bonded to the paper/poly bag using a commercially available hot melt. For demonstration purposes the bag was cut across its width so only the top portion of the bag which had the valve incorporated in it was used. This top portion at the valve was erected and placed on top of a stray field electrode (RADIO FREQUENCY CORPORATION 747) that was coupled to a 10 KW 40 MHz generator. A flat piece of teflon was placed against the top of the bag and a 567 g teflon block was placed on top. The generator was turned on and the top of the bag was pulled over the electrode to approximate a ten second exposure to RF energy. The bag, when removed, had its valve completely fused together. EXAMPLE 9 A multiwall caustic bag was made using a 5 mil inside film of ECO (10% CO. The bag was successfully sealed in less than 2 seconds using a Thermatron 6 KW KF 62/SP40 generator and press. The sealed bag demonstrated uniform strength across the width of the bag even in the gusset areas. EXAMPLE 8 For comparison, a bag, without the CO-containing polymer, was sealed with a hot bar sealer at a sealing temperature of 450\ufffd F. (213\ufffd C.)",
