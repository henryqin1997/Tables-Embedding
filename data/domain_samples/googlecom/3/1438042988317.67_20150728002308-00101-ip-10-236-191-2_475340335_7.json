    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail herein in accordance with certain preferred embodiments thereof, many modifications and changes therein may be effected by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. From the above, it should be appreciated that the coolant fluid flow assemblies shown in FIGS. 1-6 achieve all of the objectives specified above. In particular, the resultant structure is efficient, compact, planar, tunable, and easily manufacturable and adjustable. In addition, in those circumstances where the power levels permit it, the coolant distribution system may be operated without the inclusion of the heat sinks. FIG. 6 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention which also implements a highly parallel tunable impingement coolant fluid flow design. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, a coolant flow path is defined at least in part by an exterior housing having side walls 47, sloped top wall 48, and rear wall 49. The bottom wall of the housing may be a separately provided structure or it may comprise substrate 31. The interior of the housing in FIG. 6 is divided into two parts by flow path-defining structure or divider 46 which includes impingement orifices 16 into which are inserted impingement or directing tubes 18 the bottoms of which preferably include shrouds 19 to better",
