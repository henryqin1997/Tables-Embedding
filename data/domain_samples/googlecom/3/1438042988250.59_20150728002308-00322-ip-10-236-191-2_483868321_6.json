One solution to these problems was suggested in my co-pending application, U.S. Ser. No. 762,847, entitled \"SELF-COMPENSATING SIDING OR ROOFING STRIP\", which was filed on Jan. 27, 1977 and another solution was suggested in my co-pending patent application, U.S. Ser.

It will, of course, be realized that these dimensions in the materials set forth herein are as illustrative only. It will be realized that the slat assemblies of the present invention may be used both inside and outside of buildings and may be used for siding, roofing or other purposes, both functional and decorative. For example, the present invention may be used to simulate brick, stone or wood paneling and the like as well as for conventional aluminum siding. In the preferred embodiment, the groove 31 was continuous across the width of the panel although a series of aligned groove segments would probably perform as well. In the embodiment shown, the depth of the groove was approximately one-half the thickness of the panel and the width of the groove across the face of the slat assembly 10 was approximately 1/16 of an inch. In the preferred embodiments described herein, the unitary slat assembly of FIG. 1-3 is a single piece of sheet aluminum although",
