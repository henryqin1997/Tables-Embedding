Horton, in FIG. 4 discloses a vasoocclusion device having a helical coil with a safety wire positioned therein for structural support. Alternatively, the internal wire may be preformed into an ultimately desired shape (for example, a sphere) and fed through the coiled strand, the coiled strand then assuming the shape of the safety wire., 39991=This application claims the benefit of No. 60/103,647 filed Oct. 9, 1998., 41993=For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,069 to M. Ritchart et al., issued Feb. 19, 1991, discloses a flexible, coiled wire for use in small vessel occlusion. The wire has a stretched, linear condition in which it can be advanced through a catheter lumen to a selected vessel, and a relaxed, convoluted condition produced by a combination of helical windings of the wire and irregularities of the helical winding (referred to as a \u201cmemory\u201d). The patent does not appear to suggest that the wire can itself be a conventional shape memory material, such as nitinol alloy., 43798=Finally, FIG. 4 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,822 issued Jun. 4, 1996 to J. J. Phelps et al., discloses a vasoocclusion device which comprises a helical coil having an internal wire attached to end caps at both ends of the coil. The wire may be made of a shape memory material such as nitinol, while the coil is typically made of a radiopaque material such as tungsten, platinum, gold or silver., 42573=Numerous similar devices have been disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,891 issued May 12, 1998 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,619 to issued on Dec. 10, 1996, both to C. G. M. Ken et al., are directed to implantable vasoocclusion devices comprising a helically wound coil which is itself wound into a secondary shape. The devices can include an inner, stretch-resisting member positioned in the lumen of the coil. Possible materials for the wire making up either the coil or the inner member include stainless steel and nitinol. The device shown in FIG. 4 of the '891 patent can include multiple layers of coils, the inner member being a wire which prevents stretching of the coil during movement of it. The '619 patent also discloses a coil having a wire positioned therein to similarly prevent stretching.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood, however, that the above-described device is merely an illustrative embodiment of the principles of this invention, and that other devices and methods for using them may be devised by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is also to be understood that the invention is directed to embodiments both comprising and consisting of the disclosed parts. The present invention is useful for establishing an embolus or occlusion in the vascular system, and therefore finds applicability in human and veterinary medicine. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The details of the construction or composition of the various elements of the vasoocclusion device 10 not otherwise disclosed are not believed to be critical to the achievement of the advantages of the present invention, so long as the elements possess the strength or mechanical properties needed for them to perform as disclosed. The selection of any such details of construction are believed to be well within the ability of one of even rudimentary skills in this area, in view of the present disclosure. It should be clear that the present invention provides a coil-type vasoocclusion device 10 which may possess significant advantages over prior devices for that purpose. It may be possible to adjust the assistive anchoring force provided by the core of the device to a coil of a given length, by selection of the length",
