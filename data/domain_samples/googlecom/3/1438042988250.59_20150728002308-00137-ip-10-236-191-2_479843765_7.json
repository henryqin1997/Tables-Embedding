    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Through the method according to the invention, the continuous production of synthetic foam products, which are used particularly as thermal insulating materials, is substantially simplified in comparison with known methods. Commercial Usability The variant of the method described with the aid of FIG. 3 has the advantage that it does not work with an easily dusting powder mixture as starting material, in which there often obtains the risk of separation. The variant of the method has the advantage, especially also when a starting material containing a Novolak-wetting agent compound is used, that this compound, which must be prepared separately, need not be ground to a specific grain size and that the grain sizes and/or the grain-size distributions of the other components of the starting material are not very critical. Rate of feed of material through the band press: 1 m/min. Length of pressure zone 4: 6.0 m Electrode length: 1.20 m Electrode gap: 5 cm High-frequency voltage: 4 kV at 13.56 MHz In an advantageous production example, phenol-formaldehyde foam plates, 5 cm thick and with a volumetric weight of 30 kg/m3 is produced under the following manufacturing conditions: By keeping the heated guide-shoes 20, 21 as well as the pressure bands 2, 3 of the band press 1 at the same temperature between 150\ufffd and 165\ufffd C. as well, it is achieved that the foaming and/or subsequently foamed material retains the approximately same optimal",
