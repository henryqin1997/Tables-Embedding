Accordingly, it is to be understood that all such modifications and alterations are included within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. In accordance with the present invention, since the laser beam weaves from side to side with respect to the weld line, the width of the laser bead is increased and weld bead surface can smoothly connect the surface of the thicker sheet to the surface of the thinner sheet. As a result, the thus welded sheets do not damage the press roll, even if the sheets are not grinded before being pressed. The sheets constructed through laser welding of different thickness sheets are pressed after laser welding to form outer or inner body panels of vehicles. Since the sheets have no sharp edge at the welded portions, the press roll does not cause a galling during press. As a result, grinding before pressing, which was thought to be indispensable in the past, can be omitted. The omission of grinding decreases the manufacturing cost of the assembly. Boxes B, D, and E of FIG. 11 illustrate the results of",
