FIG. 6 Between heartbeats, blood having just passed through the proximal opening 2 of the device 1, can flow back down the blood vessel 20. On doing so, it forces the inner walls 12 away from the outer walls 14 of these elements 6 at the proximal end 2 of the device 1 to create the opening 16 leading into a temporary blood storage area 22. Since the inner walls 12 and the outer walls 14 are joined together at the distal end 4 of the device, the temporary blood storage area 22 is effected in each blood stoppage element 6 at this phase ( ), the flow of the blood through the device 1, forces the inner walls 12 of the stoppage elements 6 against the outer walls 14 thereof in order to effect a blood flow through channel. FIG. 5 In this position ( ). FIG. 5 When actively pumped through the system, blood is forced through the device 1 through the distal end 4 and out of",
