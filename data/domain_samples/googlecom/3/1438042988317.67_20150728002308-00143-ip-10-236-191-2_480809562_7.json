The Government has certain rights in the invention., 35723=Attempts have been made to produce solid state white light sources. See for example, the publication entitled \"White Organic Electroluminescense Devices\" by Jordan et al., Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 68, No. 9, pp. 1192-1194, Feb. 26, 1996. In this publication, thin film organic electroluminescent devices are described which employ a blue-emitting species as a layer sandwiched between the hole transporter bis(triphenyl)diamine and the light emitting electron transporter tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum to obtain bright efficient white emission. Unfortunately, the use of exotic organic materials may not be compatible with conventional microelectronic devices and fabrication processes which generally use semiconductor materials.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims. Accordingly, a controlled flow of hydrogen may be used to form indium gallium nitride or aluminum indium gallium nitride films having excellent optical and morphological properties and a high percentage of indium incorporation. This can improve the quality of all nitride-based semiconductor materials which include indium, including the stacked quantum well light emitting diodes of the present invention. It will be understood that the controlled hydrogen flow may be used in MOCVD, MBE, pulsed flow MOCVD and ALE types of deposition systems, and all other systems which form Indium Group III-V nitrides. Finally, as shown in FIG. 15, for hydrogen flow rates greater than about 80 sccm, little or no indium incorporation is produced, regardless of indium precursor flow rates. These films typically have good surface morphology but exhibit gallium nitride near-band edge emission in photoluminescent measurements. Continuing with the description of FIG. 15, for hydrogen flow rates between about 4 sccm and about 80 sccm, Inx Ga1-x N films appear to have excellent optical properties and good surface morphology. In0.65 Ga0.35 N quantum wells have been grown with excellent optical properties in this hydrogen flow rate",
