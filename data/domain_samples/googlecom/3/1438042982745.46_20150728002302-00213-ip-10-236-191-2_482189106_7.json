    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{152492=In another embodiment, a further modification of the audio devices 10, 10A, 10B, 10C, and 10D is provided wherein the audio devices can include and/or communicate with a variety of sensors, including but not limited to motion, radar, heat, light, smoke, air-quality, oxygen, CO and distance. Medical monitoring sensors are also contemplated. Sensors can be directed inwardly toward the user's body, or outwardly away from the body (e.g., sensing the surrounding environment). Sensors in communication with the audio devices also can be strategically positioned or left behind to facilitate the communication of sensed information. For example, a firefighter entering a burning building can position sensor to communicate the smoke and heat conditions to that firefighter and to others at the sensor-drop location. Remote sensors can also be relatively fixed in position, as in the case of a maintenance worker wearing an audio device that receives various signals from sensors located in machines or other equipment for which the worker is responsible. A blind wearer of audio device can employ a distance sensor to determine distance to surrounding objects, for example, or a GPS unit for direction-finding. Other exemplary sensing capabilities are disclosed on one or more of the following, all of which are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. Pat. No. 5,285,398 to Janik, issued Feb. 9, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,651 to Janik, issued Feb. 13, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,907 to Janik, issued Aug. 25, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,492 to Janik, issued Dec. 3, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,555,490 to Carroll, issued Sep. 10, 1996; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,401 to Carroll, issued Nov. 5, 1996., 33179=The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/628,212, filed Jul. 28, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,004,582, which claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) from U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/399,317, filed Jul. 26, 2002, and 60/460,154 filed Apr. 3, 2003, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 168788=Further, the interface 116 can include a processor and a memory for providing added functionality. For example, the interface 116 can be configured to allow a user to control the cooperating wireless device, such as a cell phone. In an illustrative, non-limiting embodiment, where the transceiver 114 is a BLUETOOTH\u2122 device, the interface 116 can be configured to support a hands-free protocol, as set forth in the BLUETOOTH\u2122 hands-free protocol published Oct. 22, 2001, the entire contents of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Optionally, the interface 116 can be configured to comply with other protocols such as, for example, but without limitation, general access profile, service discovery application profile, cordless telephony profile, intercom profile, serial port profile, headset profile, dialup networking profile, fax profile, land access profile, generic object exchange profile, object push profile, file transfer profile, and synchronization profile, published Oct. 22, 2001, the entire contents of each of which being hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Additionally, the \u201cSpecification of the Bluetooth System, Core\u201d, version 1.1, published Feb. 22, 2001 is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Of course, the foregoing description is that of a preferred construction having certain features, aspects and advantages in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, various changes and modifications may be made to the above-described arrangements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. Preferably, the transceiver 114 is configured to transmit signals at about 100 mW. More preferably, the transceiver 114 is configured to transmit signals at no more than 100 mW. As such, the transceiver 114 uses less power. This is particularly advantageous because the power source 112 can be made smaller and thus lighter while providing a practicable duration of power between charges or replacement of the power source 112. For example, but without limitation, the source device B can be in the form of a palm-top or hand-held computer known as a BLACKBERRY\u2122. The presently marketed BLACKBERRY\u2122 devices can communicate with a variety of wireless networks for receiving email, phone calls, and/or internet browsing. One aspect of at least one of the present inventions includes the realization that such a hand-held computer can include a text-to-speech engine. Thus, such a hand-held computer can be used in conjunction with any of the audio devices 10, 10A, 10A\u2032, 10B to allow a user to \u201chear\u201d emails, or other text documents without the need to hold or look at the device B.
