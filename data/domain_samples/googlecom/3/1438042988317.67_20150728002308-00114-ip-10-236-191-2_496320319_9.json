For each ring the following information is present: The average radius of the ring 1150 (see FIG. 20) and the number of wedges in the ring., 54714=1010 Create Out-Class Variation Matrix [OCVM], 111500=All the mean matrices for the In-Class groups are averaged yielding an overall sample mean matrix 1000. The mean component by component deviation from that sample mean matrix is then computed 1010 and that result is the Out-Class Variation Matrix., 55544=1180 Input Layer, 55130=1080 Partition Feature Matrix into Bricks, 55191=1090 Form Feature Template, 119694=Turning to FIGS. 19 and 20, the template or mask is specified in terms of rings 1100, 1110 and wedges 1120. A ring 1100 is the area between two circular arcs 1130, 1140. The thickness of each ring depends on the percentage of scale invariance specified and this thickness decreases as we near the origin. Each ring in turn is divided into many wedges 1120. The number of wedges in a ring and the angular width of each wedge is determined by the percentage of rotational invariance specified and are the same for each ring. A ring need not extend all the way from -180 to +180. There can be gaps as exemplified by FIGS. 18 and 19., 54977=1050 Create Feature Matrix, 114160=The Out-Class Variation matrix is normalized 1020 against its largest component (maxima). All components of that matrix smaller than a lower discrimination threshold are discarded 1030 (set to zero)., 95546=The neural network is then trained with a modified backward error propagation or Back Propagation Network 880. Back Propagation is a supervised learning paradigm based on a steepest descent method of computing the interconnection weights which minimize the total squared output error over a set of input Feature Vectors. The outputs generated by the neural network for a given Input Feature Vector are compared with desired outputs. Errors are computed from the differences, and the weights are changed in response to such error differences in order to reduce this difference. The Back Propagation Network learns a mapping function of weights by having the Input Feature Vectors repeatedly presented in the training set and adjusting the weights until some minimal total error for all examples is reached. The activation of each unit in the hidden 1190, 1200 and output 1210 layers is computed by a sigmoid activation function: ##EQU1## where \u03c3i is the activation for unit i, and \u03c4i is:, 55337=1130 Circular Arc (outer), 32530=This application is a division of application Ser.

The N-100 (150) is an implementation of a standard frame grabber and a digital signal processor board. Feature vector extraction and neural network computations are performed on the DSP portion of the N-100 Board. The N-100 DSP board comprises a straightforward implementation of the AT&T DSP32C digital signal processing chip and related circuitry, high speed memory and related circuitry, frame grabber and related circuitry, and bus control circuitry. The frame grabber circuitry and DSP functions are combined on one card to minimize the volume taken up within the computer, to minimize the number of expansion card slots used in the computer, and to promote high speed communication between the frame grabber circuitry and the DSP circuitry without the need to communicate via the slower PC-AT bus structure. It would be well within the capabilities of one of ordinary skill in the art to adapt the N-100 card (or a similar card) to operate with other bus circuitry such as VME, MULTIBUS, or any other potential computing environment. As well known in the art, the N-100 Frame Grabber functions could be replaced with a standard Frame Grabber board such as the BEECO Model FG-B100 available from Beeco, Inc., the ITI PC Vision Plus available from Imaging Technology, Inc., and the Matrix Model MVP-AT available from Matrix, Inc. The N-100 Digital Signal Processing Functions could be replaced by a standard DSP board supporting a digital signal processor such as the Eighteen-Eight Laboratories of Boulder City, Nevada, Model PL800, PL1250 and PL1252 Floating Point Array Processor DSP Boards which support the DSP32C chip or the ITI Image 1208 available from Imaging Technology, Inc. The system concept may be implemented on other DSP chips such as the Texas Instruments TMS320C30 or the Analog Devices, Inc. part no. ADSP21000. A schematic diagram of the N-100 board is attached hereto as Appendix A and hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein., 54608=1000 Average All Mean Matrices for the In-Class Groups into Overall Sample Mean Matrix, 37541=Prior researchers have attempted to create systems for quantifiably categorizing facial image and analog data but not automated methods for retrieving it from large databases. For example, the \"Identikit\" is used in criminology to classify human facial images by breaking certain facial features down into a finite number of choices. The choices are then superimposed upon one another to \"reconstruct\" the human facial image. Other systems have attempted to define the contour lines of a human facial image and identify it based upon that information. Others have taken average gray levels taken from large area of human facial image and attempted to classify and identify human faces based upon such information. Such systems have not proven robust against rotation and translation of the face, expression and perspective changes, the introduction of artifacts such as beards, glasses, etc., nor have they proved practical for use in large databases of human facial images. An example of a very large human facial image database is the F.B.I. mug shot collection which has been estimated to contain over 20 million images. A typical access control system may need to recognize 200 to 1000 persons who have been previously identified as having authorized access to a controlled facility., 114679=For each instance where the corresponding components of the In-Class Variation matrix and the Out-Class Variation matrix are BOTH non-zero, we then divide the Out-Class component by the corresponding In-Class component and enter that in the Feature Matrix 1050. If either component is zero, zero is entered into the Feature Matrix. The Feature Matrix is Normalized 1060. Then all components of the Feature Matrix which fall below the feature threshold are set to zero 1070., 55382=1140 Circular Arc (inner), 55072=1070 Set Thresholds for Feature Matrix, 120557=For each wedge, the following information is present: The average angles of the wedges 1160, 1170 relative to the origin (see FIG. 20) and the number of points in the wedge. For each point in the wedge its X and Y coordinates are specified., 80879=OTSU is described, for example, in \"A Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms,\" Nobuyuki Otsu, I.E.E.E. Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Vol. SMC-9, No. 1, January 1979, pp. 62-66. The OTSU algorithm is implemented in the DSP code contained in Appendix B., 55272=1110 Inner Ring, 55307=1120 Wedge, 55427=1150 Average Radius, 116154=The Feature matrix is then treated as a Fourier 2-space and partitioned by an orthogonal coordinate system into regions or bricks 1080. The components within each brick are averaged. In effect, a grid partitioned by radial lines and concentric circles will now be imposed onto the components in the frequency domain. This partitioning can be adjusted, giving different tolerances to scaling and rotational invariance. The larger each partition is, the more invariance will be obtained at the expense of increased dilution of the information contained. Each partition is called a \"brick\" in the frequency domain., 117571=A Feature Template Vector is then defined 1090 and a fixed allotment assigned to the Fourier space domain. That allotment is filled with the links to the Fourier region corresponding to tit component. All other Fourier components are discarded., 54847=1030 Set Thresholds for OCVM [Out-Class Variation Matrix]}",

The invention, therefor, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. ##SPC1## Create artificial regions of `unknown` class half way between the known classes in the feature space, where each is of an hypersphere having a radius smaller than any intraclass and interclass distance. This reduces the feature space occupied by the known classes and forces the neural network to create regions belonging to the \"unknown\" class. E. ARTIFICIAL REGIONS Precluster Feature Vector classes into k clusters such that each class belongs to one and only one cluster. In each cluster, use samples from the other (k-1) clusters as the samples in the \"unknown\" category. This reduces the feature space occupied by the known classes in that cluster and forces the neural network to create regions belonging to the \"unknown\" class. D. PRECLUSTERING While it will certainly reduce the false alarm rate, it will also bring down, to some extent, the rate of successful recognition of the known individuals. To preserve a high recognition rate, it becomes even more important to increase",
