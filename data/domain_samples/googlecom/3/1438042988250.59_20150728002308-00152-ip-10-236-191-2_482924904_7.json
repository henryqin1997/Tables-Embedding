No. 08/681,679, filed Jul. 29, 1996, entitled \"Interoperable Cryptographic Key Recovery System\" (\"Johnson et al. II\") now U.S. Pat. No. 5,796,830, describes a key recovery system that uses an \"entropy-preserving\" procedure to generate key recovery values. As disclosed in the Johnson et al. II application, P, Q and R key recovery values (where P and Q are presented in encrypted form to respective key recovery agents and R is kept secret as in Johnson et al. I) are generated using a key inversion function having as inputs only the session key K being recovered and nonsecret information available to the receiver and parties assisting in the recovery process. By using such an entropy-preserving key inversion function, one avoids the necessity of having to convey additional secret information to the receiver merely to enable the receiver to verify the recovery information., 71558=The concept of generating multiple keys, such as multiple key-encrypting keys (KK1, KK2, etc.) from a single key-generating key (KG) is well-known in the art. For example, Working Draft American National Standard X9.42-1995 entitled Public Key Cryptography For The Financial Services Industry: Establishment Of Symmetric Algorithm Keys Using Diffie-Hellman, Oct. 26, 1995, describes a method for generating multiple keys from a single shared secret number, which is called Cryptographic Key Derivation. This is accomplished by hashing an input with a one way function, where the input is defined as the concatenation of a shared secret number and public information that includes at least PerPartyData. The PerPartyData contents is defined by the key management protocol. For example, the PerPartyData could include public key recovery information, thereby binding the information associated with a particular data key--to be protected by the key recovery mechanism--with a particular generated key-encrypting key., 111975=The hash is performed as many times as necessary, with an incrementing counter, so the validation hash is long enough to ensure that the probability of collision (i.e., a false validation of R) is sufficiently small. For example, if r represents the number of bits in R and the length of Ha is 2r+t (for any value of t), then the probability that two values of R end in the same value of the hash is about e-t (where e is the base of natural logarithms 2.7182818 . . . ). A value of t\u226720 would probably be sufficient., 160630=Key Specified to the Shuffler: The present invention contemplates that there may be a variety of ways to \"key\" the shuffler. One method would be to combine the key and the remainder of the input to be hashed, i.e., input=(public header||key||data) where data may be XL, XR, mXL, mXR, etc. For example, the key could be prepended (front of input) or appended (back of input). However, just prepending or appending the key is not necessarily enough as it is possible to construct distinguishers (i.e., a statistical test that detects that the function is not behaving as a random one). However, appending and prepending parts of the key to the data will avoid this problem. See M. Luby, C. Rackoff, \"How to construct pseudo-random permutations from pseudo-random functions\", SIAM Journal of Computing, vol. 17, pp. 373-386, 1988. This paper proves that a structure like the shuffler is a pseudo-random permutation if the function used inside is a pseudo-random function. See also M. Bellare, R. Canetti, and H. Krawczyk, \"Pseudo-random functions revisited, the cascade construction,\" to appear in FOCS 96. This paper proves that appending and prepending parts of the key to the data are pseudo-random functions if the collision function of the hash algorithm H is pseudo-random., 48674=Key recovery systems of various types are described in D. E. Denning and D. K. Branstad, \"A Taxonomy for Key Escrow Encryption Systems\", Communications of the ACM, vol. 39, no. 3, Mar. 1996, pp. 34-40, incorporated herein by reference., 66389=The method of encrypting data (in this case a message instead of a key) under more than one key, for purposes of controlling access to the data, is described by Chaum (see D. L. Chaum, \"Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Address, and Digital Pseudonyms,\" Communications of the ACM, Vol. 24, No. 2, pp. 84-88, Feb. 1981). Chaum describes a mail system in which each user has a public and private key pair, where Ka is the public key is an addressee with address A. The mail system also includes a computer called a \"mix\" that processes each item of mail before it is delivered. A participant prepares a message M for delivery to a participant at address A by sealing it with the addressee's public key Ka, appending the address A, and then sealing the result with the mix's public key K1. Thus, each M is doubly encrypted, i.e., it is encrypted with Ka of the addressee and K1 of the mix computer. The mix decrypts each input and forwards the message encrypted under Ka of the addressee A to the addressee. The purpose of the mix is to hide the correspondences between messages in the input to the mix and those in the output of the mix., 120926=RSA encryption with enhanced optimal asymmetric encryption (EOAE) is an encryption procedure in which a formatted block (comprising data plus appended values) is subjected to a plurality of masking rounds (similar to those of the keyed shuffler described below except that the hashes are not keyed) before encrypting the result of the masking rounds using RSA encryption. The procedure is described in the copending application Ser. No. 08/681,679 of Johnson et al. (Johnson et al. II), as well as in the ANSI X9.44 RSA Key Transport draft standard and in D. B. Johnson and S. M. Matyas, \"Enhanced Optimal Asymmetric Encryption: Reverse Signatures and ANSI X9.44\", Proceedings of the 1996 RSA Data Security Conference, San Francisco, Calif., 1996, incorporated herein by reference., 63721=Schneier defines secret splitting as dividing a message up into pieces. (See Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography, Second Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York, 1996, pp. 70-71.) An example provided by Schneier teaches that a message M can be split by generating three random bit-strings, R, S, and T, and then calculating the dependent bit-string U=M xor R xor S xor T, where M can be regenerated by XORing R, S, T, and U. It is also evident from Lipner et al. and the subsequent teaching by Schneier, that the common and preferred method of splitting involves the generation of one or more random numbers of size equal to the quantity to be split and then calculating one dependent value of equal size (e.g., as the Exclusive OR product of the random numbers and the quantity to be split). Thus, Lipner et al. and Schneier teach that splitting a key or message involves the calculation of at least one dependent value, which can only be calculated after the quantity to be split is known. Thus, in the case of key splitting, the splits or parts of a key cannot be encrypted under the public keys of the trustees (or key recovery agents) before K is known., 83982=In the present invention, a secret (e.g., a value derived from the key-generating key) is combined with the self-identification data (e.g., by concatenating these values) and hashing the resultant data block with a strong one-way hash function (e.g., using the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-1 described in Federal Information Processing Standard, FIPS PUB 180-1 Secure Hash Standard, April 1995). This resultant hash value is then stored together with the encrypted data, e.g., in the header record of an encrypted file. In the case of an encrypted file sent form Alice to Bob, Bob could also create a similar hash value and store it the file header record, by using his own self-identification data and the secret (a secret derived from KG), which Bob also knows., 50508=The copending application of D. B. Johnson et al., Ser. No. 08/629,815, filed Apr. 10, 1996, entitled \"Cryptographic Key Recovery System\" (\"Johnson et al. I\"), describes a partial key recovery system using multiple key recovery agents. In one version of the system described in that application, the sender generates a set of key recovery values (or key parts) P, Q and (optionally) R. The session key is created by combining the P and Q values by XOR addition, concatenating the result with R, and hashing the concatenation result to generate the key. The P and Q values are then encrypted using the public keys of the respective key recovery agents and the encrypted P and Q values included (along with other recovery information) in a session header accompanying the encrypted message. The R value, if generated, is not made available to any key recovery agent, but is kept secret to provide a nontrivial work factor for law enforcement agents seeking to recover the key., 58091=The key recovery method of the present invention is based on a protection mechanism called cryptographic sealing suggested by Gifford (see D. K. Gifford, \"Cryptographic Sealing for Information Secrecy and Authentication,\" Communications of the ACM, vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 274-286, April 1982). According to Gifford, the mechanism \"is based on the idea of sealing an object with a key.\" The protection mechanism provides a secrecy property which states that a sealed object is useless to someone who does not have a set of keys that unseals the key that was used to seal the object. Cryptographic sealing is described further by Denning (see D. E. Denning, Cryptography and Data Security, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Mass., 1982, pp. 229-230), who says the cryptographic sealing is an example of a \"lock and key mechanism.\" According to Denning, encrypting data \"places a lock on it, which can be unlocked only with the decryption key.\" If X is an object encrypted with a key K; then access to X requires K. Access to K can be controlled by associating an \"opener\" with X. Openers can provide different kinds of sharing: OR-Access, AND-Access, and Quorum-Access. Each of the different openers can be explained., 67566=Meyer and Matyas also provide a further teaching in which a key (KSTR) is encrypted under two keys (KTR1 and Knode) to form the doubly encrypted key value eKnode(eKTR1(KSTR)), see C. H. Meyer and S. M. Matyas, Cryptography, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York,1982, p. 558. The method is also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,755,940 \"Transaction Security System\" by Brachtl et al. Within an electronic funds network, the time-variant key KSTR is generated randomly and then encrypted first under the key KTR2 and second under the key Knode, where Knode is a time-variant system key and KTR1 is a key derived from a personal key known only to a customer and a secret PIN (Personal Identification Number) known only to a customer. Thus, to recover the secret key KSTR, it is necessary to know a system-held key, Knode, and a user key, KTR1, derived from user-held information.}",

However, the present invention is not limited to this method of combining the key with the data to be hashed within the shuffler. One may also divide the key into smaller parts and interleave these parts, or combine the key with the data using some other combining function, which may be a simple function or a complex function, before the hashing operation is performed.
