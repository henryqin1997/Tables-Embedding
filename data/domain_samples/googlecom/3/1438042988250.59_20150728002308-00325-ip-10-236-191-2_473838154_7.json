They need not only an editor screen to input and modify the rules in the knowledge base but also a program to compile, integrate, and link the input knowledge base and the stored inference engine together. (The Rete algorithm developed and published by Forgy in 1982 is a widely used example, but it is pretty complicated.)}",

CTT : Code Truth Table. AVT : Attribute-Value Table. AT : Action Table. AIE : Automatic Inference Engine. Acronym FIG. 8b shows AVT 83, CTT 84, and CQL 85 of this specific design. AVT 83 is created by the applicant based on ITT 81. CTT 84 is created by the TE and is stored in the memory of the computer. Each entry of CTT 84 is a code of the value in the corresponding entry of ITT 81. And the code of the value is chosen as the sequence number of the value in its value-list in AVT 83. CQL 85 is created by AIE before an querying session starts. This example displays the relationships among ITT, CTT, and AVT of a real design. FIG. 8a shows ITT 81 and AT 82. These two tables are selected from a printer trouble shooting manual and can be inputted directly into the invented automatic expert system by the user. FIGS. 8a and 8b show a printer trouble shooting expert system as an example. This is an example of the structures of an ITT, an AT,",
