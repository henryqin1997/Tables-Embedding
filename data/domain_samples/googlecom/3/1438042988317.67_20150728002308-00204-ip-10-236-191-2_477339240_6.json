While the presently preferred embodiment and various additional alternative embodiments for carrying out the instant invention have been set forth in detail in accordance with the Patent Act, those persons skilled in the data recorder art to which this invention pertains will recognize various alternative ways of practicing the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. It should further be noted that although the present event history data recorder was developed to be used with passenger transit vehicles, the instant invention may be easily applied to other mechanisms including aircraft, water craft, automobiles, buses, railcar train consists, biomedical instruments, and a multitude of other machines. It should be noted that care must be taken in ascertaining where on the circular buffer the formatted data elements start and stop for such distinct event and whether the formatted data elements have been stored contiguously or whether they wrap around from an end to a beginning of the circular buffer. Those persons skilled in the art of programming with circular buffers should easily be able to determine and manipulate the start, stop and current index numbers so as to ensure that the formatted data elements transfer in the proper sequence.
