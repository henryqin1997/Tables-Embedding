Various substitutions and modifications have suggested in the foregoing description, and other will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, all such substitutions and modifications are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. [0031]FIG. 8 shows a top view of another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The keyboard body 1 is an integrally formed one rather than a foldable one; therefore, the keyboard body 1 does not have clamping problem. [0030] Moreover, after the interface 2 is rotated to the positioning groove 16, the interface 2 is electrically connected to the keyboard body 1 through a connection unit 18 to transmit the command input from the keyboard body 1 to the interface 2. The command then is transmitted from the mobile device. [0029] Moreover, after the interface 2 is rotated to the positioning groove 16, the interface 2 is placed at the junction of the two panels 11 and 12 of the keyboard body 1. At this time, the interface 2 is clamped by the clamping means 17 and the two panels 11 and 12 of the keyboard body 1 are prohibited from",
