Policy object 1212 knows the specific type of policy 504 (e.g. OR policy, AND policy, etc.) and its list of devices for that policy 504. In step 1314, communication is established between server 104 and enrollment station 106. This communication is established exactly as described in reference to FIG. 4. In step 1316, based on the list of devices, enrollment object 1208 sends a request to enrollment station 106 to test the user on a particular device. The request includes device ID 508 (FIG. 5) that identifies the particular device the user is to be enrolled in.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{379828=The inventors of the present invention came up with a scheme for hierarchically storing templates within enterprise 2800. In enterprise 2800, all templates 502 are stored at corporate office 2802. Then the additional storage of templates 502 at individual offices depends on the logical block (e.g. either block 2818 or block 2820) the office is in., 211760=Monitor object 1004 is provided by the present invention for each computer 208 in the enterprise where the administrator desires to have \u201clive\u201d data start off the engine in system 102 to authenticate a user. Monitor object 1004 is up and waiting for \u201clive\u201d data to be presented. In addition, monitor object 1004 is specialized (e.g., a fingerprint monitor object waits for \u201clive\u201d fingerprint data and a facial image monitor object waits for \u201clive\u201d facial image data)., 309849=Alternatively, in step 2706, if the x element is a policy, then control transfers to step 2710. In step 2710, the x element (i.e., the policy) is executed and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the x element (i.e., the policy). Whether the x element is a policy or a device, controls transfers to step 2712., 381183=Thus, with the above hierarchical structure, the farthest any office will have to go to get a user's template is corporate office 2802. For example, say User A was enrolled at office 2812. This means that User A's templates 502 are stored at office 2812, office 2810 and corporate office 2802. If User A travels to office 2806, office 2806 will have to follow the hierarchical structure up to corporate office 2802 to retrieve a copy of User A's templates 502. This scheme allows the templates 502 within enterprise 2800 to be stored at the minimum number of locations, while still providing each user the flexibility to be authenticated by system 102 from any office within the enterprise., 276723=In step 2312, the second policy in the list of policies is determined. Once the second policy is determined, the second policy is executed in step 2314. Here, the steps in the flowchart that apply to the second policy are executed., 309536=In step 2708, the x element is either a biometric or a non-biometric device. In step 2708, the user is tested on the x element (i.e., either a or a non-biometric device) and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the first element (i.e., the device)., 394480=The procedure is as follows. First, each office in enterprise 2800 stores the digital certificates for every user that was issued a digital certificate at that office. Then, in each logical block, start with the offices at the bottom of the hierarchical structure. For example, in block 2818 start with office 2806 and office 2808. Office 2806 and office 2808 only store the digital certificates for users that were issued digital certificates at those offices. Then, following the hierarchical structure up to office 2804, office 2804 stores the digital certificates for users that were issued digital certificates at office 2804, and also copies of all the digital certificates stored at office 2806 and office 2808. This procedure is repeated until the top of the hierarchical structure is reached (i.e., corporate office 2802)., 241610=Certain policies of the present invention may be viewed as being hierarchical in nature. As described above, users can be required to be authenticated by biometric system 102 when they try to access various points in network system 202. Examples of the various points include network system 202 itself, one or more of applications 204, one or more of user computers 208, Internet access 1504 and dial-in access 1506. With the hierarchical nature of certain policies of the present invention, the present invention will only attempt to authenticate the user into a desired point in network system 202 if that user has already gained access to (i.e., been authenticated into) a list of required points., 128651=The present invention overcomes limitations that are encountered when resource protection is used in a networked environment. The present invention has the following benefits: (1) flexibility to use the right measurement for an environment when biometric devices are used; (2) allows user mobility within the enterprise; (3) flexibility in the degree of authentication required to protect each resource; (4) allows remote enrollment of users into a resource protection system; (5) allows remote refreshing of templates; and (6) ensures the integrity of software loaded on remote computers in the network. The present invention also allows different threshold values to be set for each device. In other words, the present invention can tailor the authentication level based on probability that each user must pass before gains access to enterprise resources (e.g., 1/1000, 1/10,000, or 1/1000,0000 that the user is who claims to be)., 401521=Public key system engine 2902 performs the various functions of the public key system. Public key system engine 2902 interacts with the various applications (e.g., e-mail, browsers, etc.) that it provides the use of encryption and digital signatures for Identification device interface 2904 allows third-party vendors of identification devices to create an identity device module that interfaces with it. Identity device module 2908 is one of these identity device modules that interfaces with identification device interface 2904. Identity device module 2908 acts similar to the open interface of the present invention as described above., 303000=In step 2606, the first element is either a biometric or a non-biometric device. In step 2606, the user is tested on the first element (i.e., either a biometric or a non-biometric device) and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the first element (i.e., the device)., 216842=Enrollment station 106 is used to enroll users into system 102. Enrollment station 106 has attached to it every type of identification device used by system 102 to identify and ultimately authenticate users. It is important to note that enrollment interface 1204 and enrollment interface 1206 are not part of the present invention. In fact, enrollment interface 1204 and enrollment interface 1206 are specific to the particular operation system the present invention is interfacing with., 395428=Thus, with the above hierarchical structure, the farthest any office will have to go to get a user's digital certificate is corporate office 2802. For example, say User A was issued a certificate at office 2812. This means that User A's digital certificate is stored at office 2812, office 2810 and corporate office 2802. If User A travels to office 2806, office 2806 will have to follow the hierarchical structure up to corporate office 2802 to retrieve a copy of User A's digital certificate. Once it is determined that the user is finished with his or her digital certificate, the digital certificate must be re-retrieved the next time the user requests access to his or her digital certificate, 296386=Alternatively, in step 2504, if the first element is a policy, then control transfers to step 2508. In step 2508, the first element (i.e., the policy) is executed and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the first element (i.e., the policy). Whether the first element is a policy or a device, controls transfers to step 2510., 306249=In step 2628, it is determined whether the next element in the list of policies or devices is a policy. If the next element is not a policy, then control transfers to step 2630. In step 2630, the next element is either a biometric or a non-biometric device. The user is tested on the next element and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the next element (i.e, the device)., 91685=The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers. As of 1998, the Internet has more than 100 million users worldwide, and that number is growing rapidly. More than 100 countries are linked into exchanges of data, news and opinions. Unlike private networks which are centrally controlled, the Internet is decentralized by design. Each Internet computer, called a host, is independent. Users can choose which Internet services to use and which local services to make available to the global Internet community. There are a variety of ways to access the Internet. Most online services, such as America Online, offer access to some Internet services. It is also possible to gain access through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP)., 381997=Not only does the hierarchical structure of enterprise 2800 provide ease of access, but also a means of backing up templates 502 within enterprise 2800., 88207=This is a continuation-in-part application of the commonly-owned, co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method and Computer Program Product for Allowing Access to Enterprise Resources Using Biometric Devices,\u201d U.S. application Ser. No. 09/264,726, filed on Mar. 9, 1999 (incorporated by reference in its entirety herein)., 297686=Alternatively, if in step 2510 the user fails the first element, then control transfers to step 2514. In step 2514, it is determined whether the second element in the list of policies or devices is a policy. If the second element is not a policy, then control transfers to step 2516. In step 2516, the second element is either a biometric or a non-biometric device. The user is tested on the second element and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the second element (i.e, the device)., 303331=Alternatively, in step 2604, if the first element is a policy, then control transfers to step 2608. In step 2608, the first element (i.e., the policy) is executed and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the first element (i.e., the policy). Whether the first element is a policy or a device, control transfers to step 2610., 402235=Public key system manager and directory 2906 stores and manages public keys. Server 104 operates exactly as described above. Finally, profile server 2910 stores all of the users' profiles in the public key system. Profile server 2910 is attached to server 104 and acts as a roaming profile server for the public key system., 271597=In step 2212, the second policy in the list of policies is determined. Once the second policy is determined, the second policy is executed in step 2214. Here, the steps in the flowchart that applies to the second policy are executed. For example, the second policy can be the same type of policy as the first policy or it can be one of the other policies., 380259=The procedure is as follows. First, each office in enterprise 2800 stores the templates 502 for every user enrolled in system 102 at that office. Then, in each logical block, start with the offices at the bottom of the hierarchical structure. For example, in block 2818 start with office 2806 and office 2808. Office 2806 and office 2808 only store the templates 502 for users that were enrolled in systems 102 at those offices. Then, following the hierarchical structure up to office 2804, office 2804 stores the templates 502 for users that were enrolled at office 2804, and also copies of all the templates 502 stored at office 2806 and office 2808. This procedure is repeated until the top of the hierarchical structure is reached (i.e., corporate office 2802)., 257891=In step 1912, the first score is compared to the contingent threshold value. In step 1912, if the first score is less than the contingent threshold value, then control transfers to step 1914. In step 1914, the user has failed the CONTINGENT policy. At this point the user has not been authenticated by system 102. Alternatively, if in step 1912 the first score is greater than or equal to the contingent threshold value, then control transfers to step 1916. The contingent threshold value is used to give the user a second chance to pass the CONTINGENT policy and thus be authenticated by system 102., 299773=In step 2528, it is determined whether the next element in the list of policies or devices is a policy. If the next element is not a policy, then control transfers to step 2530. In step 2530, the next element is either a biometric or a non-biometric device. The user is tested on the next element and the result indicates whether the user passed or failed the next element (i.e, the device)., 396214=Not only does the hierarchical structure of enterprise 2800 provide ease of access, but also a means of backing up digital certificates within enterprise 2800., 97130=The policies of the present invention provide flexibility to the level of protection for individual enterprise resources. Examples of pre-defined polices include an OR policy, an AND policy, a CONTINGENT policy, a RANDOM policy, a THRESHOLD policy, a multi-user policy, a multi-location policy, a multi-template policy, a user dependent policy, a location restriction policy, and a computer/device specific policy. This is done through the layering of both biometric devices and/or non-biometric devices. The layering of devices allows for the combination of one or more devices in a logical way (via policies) to protect each enterprise resource. The present invention also allows different threshold values to be set for each device. In other words, the present invention can tailor the authentication level based on probability that each user must pass before the user gains access to enterprise resources (e.g., 1/1000, 1/10,000, or 1/1000,0000 that the user is who claims to be).}",
