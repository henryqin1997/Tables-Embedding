    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30673=Due to lower than 1*1018 cm-3 carrier concentration of p-GaN, good contact between p-GaN and the ITO cannot be obtained. Theory and experiment have shown that when a contact layer with a carrier concentration exceeding 5*1018 cm-3 and a thickness of few hundred Angstroms, good contact can be achieved through tunneling effect. The operating voltage can thus be reduced. The present invention uses a GaN contact layer with a concentration of greater than 5*1018 cm-3 and a thickness of less than 500 Angstroms., 32572=FIG. 4 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. The difference between this structure and that of FIG. 2 is that a contact layer 121 is inserted between the the AlGaN cladding layer 13 and the ITO current spreading layer 11B. The feature of this contact layer 121 is that the carrier concentration is in excess of 5*1018 cm-3 and thickness is under 500 Angstroms. The ideal contact layer should have at least one layer of InGaN, GaAs, AlGaAs, gallium phosphide (GaP), or gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP). Although the bandgap of these material is smaller than GaN, hence having the drawback of light absorption, the thickness of the contact layer 121 is only around 500 Angstroms and has a transmission coefficient of approximately 95%. Together with the ITO, the overall transmission coefficient of 85% can be achieved. Thus, by replacing the prior art Ni/Au with ITO as a current spreading layer, a light emitting efficiency of more than 70% can be obtained., 26046=Not until the end of 1993 did the Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. in Japan announce the successful fabrication of a blue light emitting diode using gallium nitride as the basic material. Afterwards, a high intensity green light emitting diode was also developed. At present, many research organizations have invested a large amount of resources to pursue such development, but only a few two and three companies have achieved any success. The foregoing difficulties are the bottlenecks., 27197=The p-type GaN contact layer 12, after thermal annealing, usually has a carrier concentration of less than 1\ufffd1018 cm-3. The lowest resistivity is no lower than 1 ohm-cm Such poor conductivity cannot effectively distribute the current over the entire semiconductor die and causes a current crowding phenomenon which lowers the light emitting efficiency.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various modifications may be made in the embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Such modifications are all within the scope of this invention. FIG. 8 shows the theoretical transmittance of the Ni/Au as a function of thickness. When the thickness is less than 100 Angstroms, the transmission coefficient is high. However, when the thickness is too thin, the layer tends to granulate or \"ball\" into islands and forms discontinuous layer. Then, the current from the electrode 10 cannot effectively distribute to all parts of the chip. For this reason, in conventional practice, the thickness of the Ni/Au layer must be several hundred Angstroms thick. In so doing, the transmission coefficient cannot be high. FIG. 6 shows a structure to overcome this drawback. A very thin layer of Ni/Au 42, less than 100 Angstroms is first evaporated over the cladding layer 13, and followed by another layer of transparent conductive ITO 11B. The Ni/Au layer 43 serves as a contact layer for the transparent ITO 11B and the GaN cladding layer. Due to the high conductivity of the ITO, the current flowing down from the electrode 10 can distribute uniformly over the entire chip, thus increasing the light emitting efficiency. FIGS. 6 and 7 show the fifth and sixth embodiments",
