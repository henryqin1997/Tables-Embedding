(Cl. 318227) ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A motor is connected to the power lines in series with a symmetrical switch such as a Triac. A firing signal is applied through a symmetrical switching device which maintains an open circuit condition until a selected breakdown voltage is applied across the device after which it conducts. The trigger signal is generated by an alternating current network including a thermistor connected in series with a timing capacitor. A voltage regulator is connected across the thermistor and the capacitor to maintain an essentially constant voltage across the timing circuit for any one temperature. Variations in the resistance of the thermistor with temperature changes results in a corresponding variation in the voltage division across the timing circuit and in the time constant of the circuit. Consequently, the thermistor produces a dual action in the timing circuit and increases the sensitivity of the output with temperature. The voltage regulator is shown as a neon bulb and as a diode bridge having a Zener type diode connected across the DC. terminals with the input terminals connected across the combination of the thermistor and the timing capacitor., 27075=Thermistor 12GA5 lPZ #34, 100K ohms Resistor 17-31.4K ohms IRC 2 watts Resistor 2475.4K ohms IRC 10% /2 watt Capacitor 13CDE WMF 0.0455 mfd., 36223=Mungenast & Dowling, AC Motor Speed Control, Home Appliance Builder, August 1964 (pp. l315, 38)., 35806=said voltage regulator including a diode bridge circuit including at least four diode means connected in a closed loop and polarized to define a pair of References Cited UNITED STATES PATENTS 2/1965 Momberg et al. 318-345 XR 6/1965 James 3l8345 8/1965 Gambill et al. 3l8345 XR 2/1967 Wigington 318-345 XR OTHER REFERENCES Application Note: Triac Control for AC Power, Gen eral Electric, May 1964., 14364=Referring to the drawings and particularly to FIG. 1, a permanent split capacitor motor 1 is schematically shown including a running winding 2 connected in parallel with a starting winding 3 and a capacitor 4.
