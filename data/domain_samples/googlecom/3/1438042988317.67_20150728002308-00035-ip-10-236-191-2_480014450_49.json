No. 10/259,187 filed on Sep. 28, 2002, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/229,907 filed on Aug. 28, 2002 (which claims priority U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/325,832 filed on Sep. 28, 2001), now U.S. Pat. No. 7,494,507, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/494,276 filed on Jan. 30, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,681, and priority is claimed to all of the foregoing., 180570=It is important not just to add the solvent metal to diamond feedstock, but also to include solvent metal in an appropriate proportion and to mix it evenly with the feedstock. The use of about 86% diamond feedstock and 15% solvent metal by mass (weight) has provided good result, other ratios of diamond feedstock to solvent metal may include 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 65:35, 75:25, 80:20, 90:10, 95:5, 97:3, 98:2, 99:1, 99.5:0.5, 99.7:0.3, 99.8:0.2, 99.9:0.1 and others., 90709=In some embodiments, a quantity of solvent-catalyst metal may be combined with the diamond feedstock prior to sintering. This is found to be necessary when forming thick PCD tables, solid PDC structures, or when using multimodal fine diamond where there is little residual free space within the diamond powder. In each of these cases, there may not be sufficient ingress of solvent-catalyst metal via the sweep mechanism to adequately mediate the sintering process as a solvent-catalyst. The metal may be added by direct addition of powder, or by generation of metal powder in situ with an attritor mill or by the well-known method of chemical reduction of metal salts deposited on diamond crystals. Added metal may constitute any amount from less than 1% by mass, to greater than 35%. This added metal may consist of the same metal or alloy as is found in the substrate, or may be a different metal or alloy selected because of its material and mechanical properties. Example ratios of diamond feedstock to solvent-catalyst metal prior to sintering include mass ratios of 70:30, 85:15, 90:10, and 95:15. The metal in the diamond feedstock may be added powder metal, metal added by an attritor method, vapor deposition or chemical reduction of metal into powder., 100212=CVD and PVD processes are also advantageous because they permit precise control of the thickness and uniformity of the diamond coating to be applied to a substrate. Temperature is adjusted within the range of 500 to 1000 degrees Celsius, and pressure is adjusted in a range of less than 1 atmosphere to achieve desired diamond coating thickness., 96259=The CVD and PVD processes have some advantages over sintering. Sintering is performed in large, expensive presses at high pressure (such as 45-68 kilobars) and at high temperatures (such as 1200 to 1500 degrees Celsius). It is difficult to achieve and maintain desired component shape using a sintering process because of flow of high pressure mediums used and possible deformation of substrate materials., 435155=To prepare for sintering, the entire pressure assembly is loaded into a cubic press and initially pressurized to about 40-68 Kbars. The pressure to be used depends on the product to be manufactured and must be determined empirically. Then electrical power is added to the pressure assembly in order to reach a temperature in the range of less than about 1145 or 1200 to more than about 1500 degrees Celsius. About 5800 watts of electrical power is available at two opposing anvil faces, creating the current flow required for the heater assembly to generate the desired level of heat. Once the desired temperature is reached, the pressure assembly is subjected to pressure of about 1 million pounds per square inch at the anvil face. The components of the pressure assembly transmit pressure to the diamond feedstock. These conditions are maintained for about 3-12 minutes, but could be from less than 1 minute to more than 30 minutes. The sintering of PDCs takes place in an isostatic environment where the pressure transfer components are permitted only to change in volume but are not permitted to otherwise deform. Once the sintering cycle is complete, about a 90 second cool down period is allowed, and then pressure is removed. The PDC is then removed for finishing., 181096=In order to mix the diamond feedstock with solvent-catalyst metal, first the amounts of feedstock and solvent metal to be mixed may be placed together in a mixing bowl, such as a mixing bowl made of the desired solvent-catalyst metal. Then the combination of feedstock and solvent metal may be mixed at an appropriate speed (such as 200 rpm) with dry methanol and attritor balls for an appropriate time period, such as 30 minutes. The attritor balls, the mixing fixture and the mixing bowl may be made from the solvent-catalyst metal. The methanol may then be decanted and the diamond feedstock separated from the attritor balls. The feedstock may then be dried and cleaned by firing in a molecular hydrogen furnace at about 1000 degrees Celsius for about 1 hour. The feedstock is then ready for loading and sintering. Alternatively, it may be stored in conditions that will preserve its cleanliness. Appropriate furnaces that may be used for firing also include hydrogen plasma furnaces and vacuum furnaces., 188002=Referring to FIG. 3A-7-1, the relationship of the can half skins 3A-910 with the junction 3A-912 and the punch 3A-1016 is seen., 481697=In one embodiment, grinding utilizes a grit size ranging from 100 to 150 according to standard ANSI B74.16-1971 and polishing utilizes a grit size ranging from 240 to 1500, although grit size may be selected according to the user's preference. Wheel speed for grinding should be adjusted by the user to achieve a favorable material removal rate, depending on grit size and the material being ground. A small amount of experimentation can be used to determine appropriate wheel speed for grinding., 62988=This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. 60/499,026 filed on Aug. 29, 2003; to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/498,768 filed on Aug. 29, 2003; to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/498,968 filed on Aug. 29, 2003, to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present devices, components thereof, materials therefore, and manufacturing methods have been described and illustrated in conjunction with a number of specific configurations, those skilled in the art will appreciate that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the principles herein illustrated, described, and claimed. The present invention, as defined by the appended claims, may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The configurations described herein are to be considered in all respects as only illustrative, and not restrictive. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. A sintering and/or hipping process can be used to create Ti or Nb cemented TiC balls. The balls are then placed in an Nb can with diamond between the can and the ball. The filled can is then placed in a high pressure/high temperature press and the diamond is sintered to the ball. Ti and Nb are useful in this ball production process because diamond will chemically bond with TiC grains during the sintering process in a structure that is similar to the crystalline structure of diamond. The diamond will also chemically bond to the Ti and Nb because both are good carbide forming elements. The chemical bonding will increase the adhesion of the diamond to the substrate (ball core) and prevent the diamond",
