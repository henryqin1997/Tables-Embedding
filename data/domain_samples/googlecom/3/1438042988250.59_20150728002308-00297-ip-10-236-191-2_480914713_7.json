    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25675=A photoresist mask (not shown) is formed to expose channel stop region 150 laterally surrounding the buried layer 140. Boron is implanted into region 150 at an energy of 150 KeV. The dose is 1\ufffd1014 atoms/cm2, and the resulting net doping concentration is 1\ufffd107 atoms/cm3. The doping concentration is chosen on the one hand sufficiently high to obtain a low leakage current and a high punchthrough voltage between the collector of the transistor being described and other collectors, if any, formed in the same integrated circuit. On the other hand, the doping concentration is sufficiently low to get a low capacitance between buried layer 140 and channel stop region 150., 47006=Titanium nitride layer 1520 is deposited over, and in contact with, the entire silicide 1510 by chemical vapor deposition to a thickness of 3000 \u212b. The deposition temperature is 650\ufffd C. Layer 1520 is patterned to form local conductive lines that contact titanium silicide 1510. As used herein, the term \"local conductive lines\" means conductive lines that are formed after the transistors but before formation of any interlevel dielectric in which contact openings are formed to contact the transistors. Layer 1520 has a sheet resistance of 1.5 ohms/square. A different sheet resistance can be obtained by changing the thickness of layer 1520. Conductive lines 1520 are used as interconnects and/or as extensions of the emitter, base, source/drain and gate regions. Such extensions allow forming contacts to these regions over field oxide 830.1, 830.2 rather than over those regions themselves., 43819=A conformal layer of silicon dioxide is deposited by CVD at 650\ufffd C. An optional \"silicide exclusion\" mask (not shown) is formed from photoresist over selected areas to protect the oxide and thus to prevent formation of a metal silicide on such areas in subsequent processing described below. This CVD oxide is etched anisotropically to form spacers 1410 (FIG. 14) on the sidewalls of emitter contact region 1220 and gate regions 1230, 1240. The gate oxide not covered by the spacers and by polysilicon regions 1220, 1230, 1240 is removed during this etch. The remaining gate oxide over the bipolar transistor is completely covered by emitter contact region 1220 and spacers 1410. The overetch required is uniform over the bipolar, PMOS and NMOS transistors because the gate oxide has a uniform thickness over the bipolar and MOS transistors, because the CVD silicon dioxide has a uniform thickness over the transistors except, perhaps, on the sidewalls of polysilicon portions 1220, 1230, and 1240, and because oxide 1310 is thin compared to the CVD oxide., 42051=Polysilicon 1210 is then masked by a photoresist (not shown) and etched to define emitter contact region 1220 and gate regions 1230, 1240 (FIG. 13). Polysilicon resistors (not shown), if any, are also defined at this step. The etch stops on gate oxide 910 which protects epitaxial layer 210 and, in particular, the damage-sensitive base region 940. Emitter contact region 1220 extends over the edges of the emitter opening in oxide 910., 28772=A photoresist mask (not shown) is formed that exposes the location of a to-be-formed N-well 310 (FIGS. 3, 4) of the PMOS transistor. Nitride 230 is etched away at the location of well 310. The photoresist is then stripped, and phosphorus is implanted with nitride 230 as a mask to form well 310 in epitaxial layer 210. The net doping concentration of well 310 is 7\ufffd1016 atoms/cm3., 27192=Next a photoresist mask (not shown) is formed, and phosphorus is implanted to form N collector region 240 and N guard ring 250. The implantation energy is 180 KeV, the dose is 3\ufffd1012 atoms/cm2, and the net doping concentration is 4.5\ufffd1016 atom/cm3. Guard ring 250 (FIGS. 2, 3) laterally surrounds the bipolar transistor active region. Collector region 240 meets the guard ring on two sides as shown in FIG. 3. In some embodiments, collector region 240 meets the guard ring on one side only or does not meet the guard ring at all. Such a smaller collector region provides a lower collector-base capacitance but, on the other hand, a higher collector resistance. The doping concentration, stated above to be 4.5\ufffd1016 atoms/cm3, is generally optimized for a trade-off between a large current density and a small collector-base capacitance. Because the higher doped collector region 240 does not extend throughout the active region surrounded by guard ring 250, the extrinsic collector-base region has a reduced capacitance. The unity gain frequency Ft is high as a result., 44905=A masked N+ arsenic implant is performed into source/drain regions 1330.1, 1330.2 and sink region 250.1 at an energy of 30 KeV and a doping dose of 3\ufffd1015 atoms/cm2. The resulting doping concentration in the top portion 250.2 of the sink region is 1\ufffd1020 atoms/cm3., 51902=Some embodiments combine the isolation techniques of FIGS. 1-8 with other processes than those of FIGS. 9-17. For example, in some embodiments, after the structure of FIG. 8 is made, the base is formed by diffusion from a P-doped polysilicon layer as described, for example, in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,784 issued Jun. 15, 1993 to A. G. Solheim and incorporated herein by reference. The emitter is also formed as described in that patent. Other fabrication techniques, including non-polysilicon emitter techniques, are used with the structure of FIG. 8., 24707=The fabrication starts with P+ monocrystalline silicon substrate 110 having a resistivity of 24-36 ohm-cm. P- layer 120 is grown epitaxially on substrate 110. In some embodiments, the thickness of layer 120 is 5 to 10 \u03bcm, and the doping concentration is 1\ufffd1015 atoms/c3. In some embodiments, the fabrication starts with a P- wafer, and epitaxial layer 120 is omitted., 49763=FIG. 17 is a top view of the resulting structure. Emitter region 1420 is a non-walled emitter region. Gate oxide 910 (FIG. 13) isolates emitter contact region 1220 from base region 940 outside emitter region 1420 and, in particular, at the boundary between base region 940 and field oxide 830.1, eliminating yield and leakage problems described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/085,436 filed by M. J. Grubisich on Jun. 30, 1993 and hereby incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, emitter 1420 is a walled emitter. In some embodiments, collector region 240 (FIG. 3) is in top view coextensive with emitter region 1420, providing a low base-collector capacitance. Titanium nitride lines 1520 reduce the resistance allowing a low resistance to be obtained with thinner titanium silicide 1510 (FIG. 15), especially since the titanium nitride has a lower resistivity than the titanium silicide. Because the titanium silicide is thinner, the consumption of silicon during the silicide formation is reduced, which lessens the chance of shorting out the junctions between the base and the collector and between the source/drain regions and the MOS wells 310, 520. Hence these junctions can be made shallower. The silicide outgrowth which results in stringers on spacers 1410 (FIG. 15) is also reduced, leading to a better yield. Further, it has been found that the formation of stringers can be inhibited by lower silicidation temperatures, but the lower temperature also increases the silicide resistivity. Due to lines 1520, the stringer formation is inhibited by making titanium silicide thin. Hence, the silicidation temperature can be made higher to reduce the silicide resistivity., 40714=As shown in FIG. 11, resist 1010 is removed, and gate oxide 910 is etched with polysilicon 920 as a mask. The resulting opening 1110 exposes region 940 at the location of the to-be-formed emitter. During the etch, polysilicon 920 protects the gate oxide over the wells of the MOS transistors. In some embodiments, the gate oxide etch is a wet buffered oxide HF etch designed to reduce any damage to, and removal of, the P doped region 940., 45234=A masked P+ boron implant is performed into source/drain regions 1320.1, 1320.2 and region 940 at an energy of 45 KeV and a dose of 3\ufffd1015 atoms/cm2. The resulting doping concentration in the extrinsic base region not covered by spacers 1410 is 5\ufffd1019 atoms/cm3. These implants complete the doping of the source/drain regions of the NMOS and PMOS transistors and reduce the resistivity of the sink region and the extrinsic base region., 32453=Boron is implanted at an energy of 150 KeV and a dose of 3.3\ufffd1012 atoms/cm2 to form P-well 520. The photoresist is then stripped, and the wells are driven in at the temperature of 1,100\ufffd C. for 50 minutes in an oxidizing ambient. During this step, the thickness of oxide 220 increases over the MOS transistors to planarize the surface of wells 310, 520. Over the bipolar transistor the oxidation is inhibited by nitride 230 as described above. Buried layer 140 and channel stop regions 150 increase during this step due to dopant diffusion. The dopant diffusion, however, is inhibited by layer 230 as described above. Guard ring 250 and collector region 240 also increase and meet the buried layer to provide a well-defined guard ring and a well-defined collector region. Thus the active region of the bipolar transistor becomes completely enclosed by the guard ring and the buried layer within epitaxial layer 210. Because epitaxial layer 210 is thin, the guard ring and the collector region need not be doped as heavily to meet buried layer 140 as would be required if epitaxial layer 210 were thicker. The lighter doping of guard ring 250 and collector region 240 reduces the junction capacitances in the bipolar transistor and thus provides higher speed., 41173=Intrinsic polysilicon is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) over the wafer at 630\ufffd C. to a thickness of 3,250 \u212bto combine with the polysilicon 920 to form polysilicon layer 1210 (FIG. 12). Even though layer 920 is removed at the emitter location, layer 1210 has a substantially uniform thickness because layer 920 is thin compared to layer 1210., 51482=Emitter contact opening 1620.7 and gate contact openings 1620.8 through 1620.11 are formed over field oxide 830.1. Titanium nitride line 1520 runs along emitter contact region 1220 to the contact opening 1620.7, reducing the emitter resistance and thus improving the VBE matching. As a result, the emitter current and the bipolar transistor speed can be increased without increasing the emitter area., 43349=The photoresist is stripped. Another photoresist mask (not shown) is formed over the bipolar and PMOS transistors. An LDD implant of arsenic is performed at an energy of 90 KeV and a dose of 4\ufffd1013 atoms/cm2 while gate region 1240 masks the NMOS channel region. This implant forms lightly doped source/drain regions 1330.1, 1330.2 of the NMOS transistor. In some embodiments, sink region 250.1 is also doped during this implant., 28669=Silicon nitride layer 230 is deposited over the pad oxide to a thickness of 1350 \u212b., 53380=While the invention has been illustrated by the embodiments described above, other embodiments and variations are within the scope of the invention. In particular, the invention is not limited by any particular materials or dimensions. For example, in some embodiments, other metal-containing materials are used instead of titanium to form the non-semiconductor conductive layer 1510. Conductive lines 1520 are formed in some embodiments from other materials than titanium nitride, including other non-semiconductor materials. Lines 1520 are formed from titanium, tungsten or titanium tungsten in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the conductivity types are reversed to form PNP transistors in a BiCMOS circuit. Some embodiments include non-BiCMOS integrated circuits containing only bipolar or bipolar and MOS transistors. In some embodiments, an additional implant is performed into the collector region 240 to reduce the collector resistance. Other embodiments and variations are within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims., 41876=An optional P type masked implant forms resistors (not shown) in layer 1210., 45733=Next, an RTP (Rapid Thermal Processing) anneal performed at 1030\ufffd C. for 20 seconds causes the N-type dopant from emitter contact region 1220 to diffuse into region 940 and convert the top portion 1420 of the region to N conductivity type. This portion is the emitter region. The RTP anneal is the first major high temperature step after formation of base region 940 (FIG. 9). The previous steps had but a small effect on region 940 compared with the RTP anneal. The base region is shallow and well-defined as a result., 42638=The NMOS transistor is then masked by a photoresist (not shown), and a lightly doped drain (LDD) implant of boron is performed at an energy of 45 KeV and a dose of 1\ufffd1013 atoms/cm2 into N-well 310 and region 940 while gate region 1230 and emitter contact region 1220 mask, respectively, the PMOS channel region and the intrinsic base region. The resulting net doping concentration of the extrinsic base region is 4\ufffd1018 atoms/cm3. This implant forms lightly doped source/drain regions 1320.1, 1320.2 of the PMOS transistor and reduces the extrinsic base resistance., 41548=A masked implant of arsenic at an energy of 100 KeV and a dose of 1.2\ufffd1016 atoms/cm2 creates N+ emitter contact region 1220 and N+ gate regions 1230, 1240. The net doping concentration of emitter contact region 1220 and gate regions 1230, 1240 is 1\ufffd1020 atoms/cm3., 35484=The photoresist is then stripped, and another photoresist mask (not shown) is formed for a P+ boron implant that creates field implant regions 840, 840.1. The boron is implanted at an energy of 30 KeV and a dose of 5.5\ufffd1013 atoms/cm2. The resulting net doping concentration of regions 840, 840.1 is 2\ufffd1017 atoms/cm3. The field implant region 840.1 that overlies channel stop region 150 meets the channel stop region to create a P+ ring around the bipolar transistor. This ring isolates the bipolar transistor from other transistors of the integrated circuit., 48943=As shown in FIG. 16, interlevel dielectric 1610 is formed by TEOS deposition of silicon dioxide to a thickness of 1,000 \u212b, TEOS deposition of boron and phosphorus doped silicon dioxide to a thickness of 7,000 \u212b, and a densification and reflow of the boron and phosphorus doped silicon dioxide. Contact openings are etched in layer 1610. The contact openings terminate on conductive lines 1520. Tungsten is deposited by CVD and etched back to form tungsten plug contacts 1620.i in the contact openings. The plugs physically contact the titanium nitride lines 1520. Collector contact 1620.2 physically contacts titanium nitride 1520 over sink region 250.1. Conductive lines 1630 are formed from Ai--Si--Cu or some other suitable material. The fabrication is completed using known processing techniques., 18614=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 08/203,236, filed Feb. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,189., 42507=Silicon dioxide 1310 is grown thermally at 900\ufffd C. for 30 minutes over polysilicon 1210 to a thickness of 80 \u212b., 46272=A refractory metal, titanium in some embodiments, is deposited over the structure by chemical vapor deposition to a thickness of 600 \u212b. The structure is heated and kept at 650\ufffd C. for 30 minutes to react the titanium that contacts silicon surfaces with the silicon. As a result, titanium silicide 1510 (FIG. 15) is formed on the exposed silicon surfaces including the surfaces of the extrinsic base region, emitter contact region 1220, sink region 250.1, and source/drain and gate regions of the MOS transistors. The sheet resistance of layer 1510 is 3 ohms/square. The titanium silicide reduces resistance to the intrinsic transistor regions and thus increases the circuit speed and reduces the power consumption., 37558=A base implant mask 930 is formed from photoresist. Boron is implanted at an energy of 20 KeV and a dose of 5\ufffd1013 atoms/cm2 to convert top portion 940 of epitaxial layer 210 in the bipolar transistor active region to the P conductivity type. Polysilicon layer 920 and gate oxide 910 combine to reduce the implant width, providing a shallower base with existing implanters. Because the base is formed after the gate oxide, the base region does not experience any oxidation or dopant redistribution during the gate oxide formation and in some embodiments does not see any significant diffusion/anneal cycles until the RTP (rapid thermal processing) anneal which forms the emitter region (not shown in FIG. 9). This RTP anneal is described below in connection with FIG. 14. Thus a shallow well-defined base region results. The shallow base region leads to a higher bipolar transistor speed and allows epitaxial layer 210 to be thinner., 40485=Photoresist 930 is stripped, and a photoresist mask 1010 (FIG. 10) is formed to define the emitter. Polysilicon 920 is etched through an opening in mask 1010 by a plasma etch. The etch stops on gate oxide 910., 47930=In the embodiment of FIG. 15, TiN is etched off the gate regions. A conductive line 1520 runs along the top surface of emitter contact region 1220, reducing the emitter resistance. In some embodiments, TiN lines run along, and/or contact, the top surfaces of gate region 1230 and/or gate region 1240. In some embodiments, the spacing between the TiN lines over base region 940 on the one hand and emitter contact region 1220 on the other hand is smaller than the minimal photolithography dimension obtainable by the fabrication equipment. The same is true for the spacing between lines 1520 and each of gate regions 1230, 1240. Spacers 1410 help isolate conductive lines 1520 from regions 1220, 1230, 1240. Because lines 1520 are thick, a low resistance can be obtained with but a small overlap of lines 1520.over base region 940 and over the source and drain regions. The areas of the base, source and drain regions can therefore be reduced, providing a high packing density and a high speed., 26570=Oxide 130 is then stripped, and N-- layer 210 (FIG. 2) is grown epitaxially over the structure to a thickness of about 1.2 \u03bcm. The doping concentration in layer 210 is about 4.5\ufffd1014 atoms/cm3. Buried layer 140 and channel stop region 150 extend some distance into layer 210 due to dopant diffusion., 25116=The structure is denuded. A silicon dioxide layer. 130 is then grown thermally at 900\ufffd C. to a thickness of 250 \u212b. A photoresist mask (not shown) is formed and arsenic is implanted to form N+ buried layer 140 of the bipolar transistor. The resulting net N type doping concentration is 2\ufffd1019 atoms/cm3.}",
