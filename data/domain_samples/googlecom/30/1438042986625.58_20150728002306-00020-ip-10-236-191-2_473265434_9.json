Hemostatic barrier 62 inhibits the growth or invasion of vascular tissue, osteocytes, fibroplasts, etc. into developing cartilage. This is believed to allow hyaline cartilage to grow at the transplantation site. Suitable hemostatic barriers will inhibit vascularization and cellular invasion into the developing cartilage to optimize formation of cartilage and to achieve growth of the full thickness of cartilage at the defect site. Preferably, the hemostatic barrier is stable for an extended period of time to allow full cartilage repair, and then will be absorbed or otherwise broken down by the body over time. A suitable hemostatic barrier is Surgicel\ufffd W1912 (Ethicon, Ltd., United Kingdom), an absorbable hemostat formed of oxidized regenerated sterile cellulose.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{63025=Although the above discussion pertains in part to a process for growing chondrocyte cells on a support matrix in glassware such as a NUNCLON\u2122 plate and changing the growth or transplant media as required for proper cell culturing, the present invention also includes a method of growing chondrocyte cells on a support matrix in a bioreactor such as bioreactor Model No. 1302 available from MinuCells GMBH Ltd., D-93077 Bad Abbach, Germany. Using a bioreactor, constant flow of growth or transplant media is passed by the support matrix, and chondrocyte cells can be grown on the support matrix at a faster rate without having to replace the growth or transplant media, for example, every 24 to 96 hours as required when using the NUNCLON\u2122 plate. It is understood that using such a bioreactor causes angled growth of the chondrocyte cells due to flow of the growth or transplant media through the bioreactor. A microphotograph of chondrocyte cells grown on the support matrix in the bioreactor is shown in FIG. 11D., 21332=Coon and Cahn (Science 1966, 153, 1116) described a technique for the cultivation of cartilage synthesizing cells from chick embryo somites. Later, Cahn and Lasher (PNAS USA 1967, 58, 1131) used the system for analysis of the involvement of DNA synthesis as a prerequisite for cartilage differentiation. Chondrocyte cells respond to both EFG and FGF by growth (Gospodarowicz and Mescher, J. Cell Physiology) 1977, 93, 117), but ultimately lose their differentiated function (Benya et al., Cell 1978, 15, 1313). Methods for growing chondrocyte cells were described and are principally being used with minor adjustments by Brittberg, M. et al. (new Engl. J. Med. 1994, 331, 889). Cells grown using these methods were used as autologous transplants into knee joints of patients. Additionally, Kolettas et al. (J. Cell Science 1995, 108, 1991) examined the expression of cartilage-specific molecules such as collagens and proteoglycans under prolonged cell culturing. They found that despite morphological changes during culturing in monolayer cultures (Aulthouse, A. et al., In vitro Cell Dev. Biol., 1989, 25, 659; Archer, C. et al., J. Cell Sci. 1990, 97, 361; H\ufffdnselmann, H. et al., J. Cell Sci. 1994, 107, 17; Bonaventure, J. et al., Exp. Cell Res. 1994, 212, 97), when compared to suspension cultures grown over agarose gels, alginate beads or as spinner cultures (retaining a round cell morphology) tested by various scientists did not change the chondrocyte\u2014expressed markers such as types II and IX collagens and the large aggregating proteoglycans, aggrecan, versican and link protein did not change (Kolettas, E. et al., J. Cell Science 1995, 108, 1991)., 19008=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/373,952, filed Aug. 13, 1999 now abandoned . Further, the present invention relates to the field of chondrocyte cell transplantation, bone and cartilage grafting, healing, joint repair and the prevention of arthritic pathologies. In particular, the present invention is directed to new methods and instruments for chondrocyte cell transplantation and cartilage regeneration, as previously described in U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/096,597, filed Aug. 14, 1998, and a U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/146,683, filed Aug. 2, 1999, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 41023=In one embodiment, the incubated minced cartilage is then strained using 40 \u03bcm mesh, centrifuged (at 1054 rpm, or 200 times gravity) for 10 minutes, and washed twice with growth media. The chondrocyte cells are then counted to determine their viability, following which the chondrocyte cells are incubated in the growth media for at least two weeks at 37\ufffd C., and 5% CO2, during which time the growth media was changed three to four times., 24027=Excessive degradation of type II collagen in the outer layers of articular surfaces of joints is also caused by osteoarthritis. The collagen network is accordingly weakened and subsequently develops fibrillation whereby matrix substances such as proteoglycans are lost and eventually displaced entirely. Such fibrillation of weakened osteoarthritis cartilage can reach down to the calcified cartilage and into the subchondral bone (Kempson, G. E. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1976, 428, 741; Roth, V. and Mow, V. C., J. Bone Joint Surgery, 1980, 62A, 1102; Woo, S. L.-Y. et al., in Handbook of Bioengineering (R. Skalak and S. Chien Eds), McGraw-Hill, New York, 1987, pp. 4.1-4.44)., 23322=The articular chondrocytes are specialized mesenchymal derived cells found exclusively in cartilage. Cartilage is an avascular tissue whose physical properties depend on the extracellular matrix produced by the chondrocytes. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes undergo a maturation leading to cellular hypertrophy, characterized by the onset of expression of type X collagen (Upholt, W. B. and Olsen, R. R., In: Cartilage Molecular Aspects (Hall, B. & Newman, S., Eds.) CRC Boca Raton 1991, 43; Reichenberger, E. et al., Dev. Biol. 1991, 148, 562; Kirsch, T. et al., Differentiation, 1992, 52, 89; Stephens, M. et al., J. Cell Sci. 1993, 103, 1111)., 24752=Descriptions of the basic development, histological and microscopic anatomy of bone, cartilage and other such connective tissues can be found for example in Wheater, Burkitt and Daniels, Functional Histology, 2nd Edition (Churchill Livingstone, London 1987, Chp. 4). Descriptions of the basic histological anatomy of defects in bone, cartilage and other connective tissue also can be found for example in Wheater, Burkitt, Stevens and Lowe, Basic Histopathology, (Churchill Livingstone, London, 1985, Chp. 21)., 20814=Techniques used for resurfacing the cartilage structure in joints have mainly attempted to induce the repair of cartilage using subchondral drilling, abrasion and other methods whereby there is excision of diseased cartilage and subchondral bone, leaving vascularized cancerous bone exposed (Insall, J., Clin, Orthop. 1974, 101, 61; Ficat R. P. et al., Clin. Orthop. 1979, 144, 74; Johnson L. L., in Operative Arthroscopy, McGinty J. B., Ed., Raven Press, New York, 1991, 341)., 19883=More than 500,000 arthroplastic procedures and total joint replacements are performed each year in the United States. Approximately the same number of similar procedures are performed in Europe. Included in this number in Europe are about 90,000 total knee replacements and around 50,000 procedures to repair defects in the knee. These numbers are essentially the same in the U.S. (Praemer A., Furner S., Rice, D. P., Musculoskeletal conditions in the United States, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Park Ridge, Ill., 1992, 125).}",

While this invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments thereof, it is not limited thereto. In its most general sense, this invention encompasses essentially any article (and use thereof) comprising a support matrix, preferably flexible and preferably absorbable in a living body, which support matrix acts as a support for living cells, which are typically grown thereon for some minimum period of time and attached thereto. Such attachment may be by virtue of cell growth penetrating the surface of the matrix. Preferably, also the support matrix provides sufficient physical integrity to the implantable article to facilitate its manipulation, such as the manipulation necessary to implant it into a living body. Where a bioreactor is not used, it is also understood that the growth media or transplant media, whichever is being used at the particular stage of the culturing process, must be replaced, for example, about every 24 to 96 hours depending, for example, on the number and viability of the cells.
