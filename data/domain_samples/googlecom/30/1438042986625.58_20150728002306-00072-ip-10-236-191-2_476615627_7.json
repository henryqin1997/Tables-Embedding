While an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed herein, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and adaptations to the disclosed embodiment may be made and it is intended that this invention be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. The system/load controller includes an internal real time clock and may also be programmed to autonomously take ohmic resistance, charge transfer resistance, and double layer capacitance measurements for each jar at predetermined specific time intervals at predetermined specific times. The acquired data in this case is temporarily stored in the voltage measurement modules as well as the system/load controller for future downloading to the remote personal computer. Thus, typically, in a large battery backup or standby system the remote personal computer 28 initiates the collection of voltage measurement data once a week during an off hour. The system/load controller and interface 24 sends signals over the bus system 26 to cause a string of long and short duration current pulses to be applied to each quarter string and to have the voltage measurement module 20 associated with that quarter string take voltage measurements from each jar within that quarter string. During the data collection from each jar, a stream of both",
