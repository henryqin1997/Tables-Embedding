According to the invention, the comparators CCA and CCB are located in the automatons, but they can very well be built into the cards. An important advantage of the invention is that is is not necessary to make two-way communication automatons inviolable by placing them in protected enclosures, which must be the case in many systems in order to enhance their security. The invention permits the certification of the origin of an item of information which has been stored in advance in the card memory. In these conditions, the individual receiving this information has a good reason to believe in the authenticity of this information if the latter has been checked at the time it is written, particularly if written permanently into a protected area of the memory. The invention is adapted for use not only between individuals, but also between systems, which enables it to be applied to relations between subscribers and an information retrieval service without requiring the latter to consult at each call the complete subscriber file, which may not even exist. The invention does not deal with the problem of proving the logical relationship between the card and its bearer, since it is known that the presentation of a personal enabling or identification code (PIN code) suffices to prove that he",
