Therefore, its utilization value is extremely high in clinical inspection. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Furthermore, the oxidoreductase is not limited to glucose oxidase shown in the foregoing examples but various enzymes such as alcohol oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, etc. can be used. Further as the electron acceptor, though potassium ferricyanide used in the examples is excellent in stability and reaction rate, redox compounds such as quinone compounds or ferrocene compounds, etc. can also be used, in addition to potassium ferricyanide. In the foregoing examples, the electrode system in which the electrode portion is comprised of two electrodes of an electrode for measurement and a counter electrode has been stated. However, by constructing the electrode system with three electrodes further including a reference electrode, the accuracy can be further improved. As materials for the electrode, carbon illustrated in the examples is suitable as a stable and inexpensive material but the materials are not limited thereto. Other noble metal materials and oxidized materials may also be used. In the examples, CMC was used as the hydrophilic high molecular substance. As has already been stated, its role is to prevent influence of adsorbable substances contained in a sample solution adsorbed to the electrode on response, in addition to the smooth introduction of the sample solution. Furthermore, its role",
