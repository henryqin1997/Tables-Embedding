A variety of techniques can be used to implant the energetic particles into the silicon wafer. These techniques include ion implantation using, for example, beam line ion implantation equipment manufactured from companies such as Applied Materials, Eaton Corporation, Varian, and others. Alternatively, implantation occurs using a plasma immersion ion implantation (\u201cPIII\u201d) technique. Examples of plasma immersion implantation techniques are described in \u201cRecent Applications of Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation,\u201d Paul K. Chu, Chung Chan, and Nathan W. Cheung, SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, pp. 165-172, June 1996, and \u201cPlasma Immersion Ion Implantation\u2014A Fledgling Technique for Semiconductor Processing\u201d, P. K. Chu, S. Qin, C. Chan, N. W. Cheung, and L. A. Larson, MATERIAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING REPORTS, A Review Journal, pp. 207-280, Volume R17, Nos. 6-7, (Nov. 30, 1996), which are both hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. Furthermore, implantation can occur using ion shower. Of course, techniques used depend upon the application., 40305=Using hydrogen as the implanted species into the silicon wafer as an example, the implantation process is performed using a specific set of conditions. Implantation dose ranges from about 1015 to about 1018 atoms/cm2, and preferably the dose is greater than about 1015 atoms/cm2. Implantation energy ranges from about 1 KeV to about 1 MeV, and is generally about 50 KeV. Implantation temperature ranges from about \u2212200 to about 600\ufffd C., and is preferably less than about 400\ufffd C. to prevent a possibility of a substantial quantity of hydrogen ions from diffusing out of the implanted silicon wafer and annealing the implanted damage and stress. The hydrogen ions can be selectively introduced into the silicon wafer to the selected depth at an accuracy of about +/\u22120.03 to +/\u22120.05 microns. Of course, the type of ion used and process conditions depend upon the application., 24834=This application is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/480,979, filed Jan. 10, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,631, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/370,975, filed Aug. 10, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,974, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/313,959, filed May 18, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,313, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/026,027, filed Dec. 19, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,207 and claims benefit of provisional application No. 60/046,276, filed May 12, 1997., 48583=Using hydrogen as the implanted species into the silicon wafer as an example, the implantation process is performed using a specific set of conditions. Implantation dose ranges from about 1015 to about 1018 atoms/cm2, and preferably the dose is greater than about1015 atoms/cm2. Implantation energy ranges from about 1 KeV to about 1 MeV, and is generally about 50 KeV. Implantation temperature ranges from about \u2212200 to about 600\ufffd C., and is preferably less than about 400\ufffd C. to prevent a possibility of a substantial quantity of hydrogen ions from diffusing out of the implanted silicon wafer and annealing the implanted damage and stress. The hydrogen ions can be selectively introduced into the silicon wafer to the selected depth at an accuracy of about +/\u22120.03 to +/\u22120.05 microns. Of course, the type of ion used and process conditions depend upon the application., 71287=FIG. 11 is a simplified diagram of an energy state 1100 for the controlled cleaving action using the rotational force according to the present invention. This diagram is merely an illustration, and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. As previously noted, the energy level or state of the substrate is raised using a global energy source (e.g., thermal, beam) above the cleave front propagation energy state, but is lower than the energy state necessary to initiate the cleave front. To initiate the cleave front, a mechanical energy means such as rotational force applied to the stressed region initiates the cleave front. In particular, rotational force applied to the stressed region of the substrates creates zero stress at the center of the substrate and greatest at the periphery, essentially being proportional to the radius. In this example, the central initiating pulse causes a radially expanding cleave front to cleave the substrate., 70115=An alternative aspect of the invention is illustrated by FIGS. 10 and 11. FIG. 10 is a simplified illustration of a stressed substrate 1000 undergoing rotational forces 1001, 1003. This diagram is merely an illustration, and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. As shown, the substrate includes a top surface 1005, a bottom surface 1007, and an stressed region 1009 at a selected depth. An energy source increases a global energy level of the substrate using a light beam or heat source to a level above the cleave front propagation energy state, but lower than the energy state necessary to initiate the cleave front. The substrate undergoes a rotational force turning clockwise 1001 on top surface and a rotational force turning counter-clockwise 1003 on the bottom surface which creates stress at the stressed region 1009 to initiate a cleave front. Alternatively, the top surface undergoes a counter-clockwise rotational force and the bottom surface undergoes a clockwise rotational force. Of course, the direction of the force generally does not matter in this embodiment.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention which is defined by the appended claims. Although the above description is in terms of a silicon wafer, other substrates may also be used. For example, the substrate can be almost any monocrystalline (e.g. epitaxial silicon wafer), polycrystalline, or even amorphous type substrate. Additionally, the substrate can be made of III/V materials such as gallium arsenide, gallium nitride (GaN), and others. The multi-layered substrate can also be used according to the present invention. The multi-layered substrate includes a silicon-on-insulator substrate, a variety of sandwiched layers on a semiconductor substrate, and numerous other types of substrates. Additionally, the embodiments above were generally in terms of providing a pulse of energy to initiate a controlled cleaving action. The pulse can be replaced by energy that is scanned across a selected region of the substrate to initiate the controlled cleaving action. Energy can also be scanned across selected regions of the substrate to sustain or maintain the controlled cleaving action. One of ordinary skill in the art would easily recognize a variety of alternatives, modifications, and variations, which can be used according to the present invention. The above sequence of steps provides a step of initiating a controlled cleaving action using",
