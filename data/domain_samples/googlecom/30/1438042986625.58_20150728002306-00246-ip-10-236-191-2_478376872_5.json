For example, the apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,036,154 which was granted to Emil I. Harmon on May 22, 1976 has a functional drawback in that it requires the use of a relatively large and heavy internal battery for operation of the device. Furthermore, it does not project an enlarged image upon a display surface outside of the device. Therefore, difficulties in observing the details of the video image projected can be experienced, particularly for a large group. Finally, the image projected also has the further drawback of being the reverse of the actual video image., 12411=Other prior art image enlarging devices utilize a complicated system of a series of mirrors (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,543,561 issued on Feb. 27, 1951 to Madison H. Tracy--column 3, lines 45-50) or the use of mirror and lens arrangements (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,021,104 granted to Stanley D. Schubach on May 3, 1977 and 3,820,995 which was issued on June 28, 1974 to Bennie S. Miller).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing description has been limited to a two dimensional projection apparatus, it will be appreciated that the present invention also may be employed to project a three-dimensional image. This requires the use of plural enlarging apparatus 2 for reflecting respective components of image generated by the image source. Of course, viewing of the resultant image appearing on screen 24 would require conventional 3-D glasses in order for the viewer to obtain the three-dimensional affect. The preferred manner of utilizing the present invention involves adjusting the video image 22 of the television set 20 so that it is inverted. The set 20 is separated from a display surface, such as screen 24, by a distance determined by the operator. Enlarging apparatus 2 is aligned with the video image of television set 20 and with screen 24. By adjustment of the height of said enlarging apparatus 2, the orientation of the concave mirror 6, and the distance of the enlarging apparatus 2 and the set 20 from the screen 24, a desired enlarged true image 26 is projected in an upright fashion onto the screen. After these adjustments and distances have been determined by trial and error, the television set 20 and enlarging apparatus 2 are enclosed in housing 12 such that the image reflected by mirror 6 passes through the upper portion of opening 18 in the housing. The television set 20 then is locked",
