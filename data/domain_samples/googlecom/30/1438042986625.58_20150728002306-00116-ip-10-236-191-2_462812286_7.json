    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{49078=The procedure of Example 1 was repeated but cyanuric chloride was used as the crosslinking agent in place of PEG-DGE. In this case the polymer and enzyme were made up in 100 mM phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.1. 2 microliters each of the polymer and enzyme solution were mixed on the electrode surface with 0.5 microliters of an acetonitrile solution of cyanuric chloride (20 mM). This crosslinking reaction is quite fast and the electrode films required a curing time of only about 30 minutes in air or vacuum. Upon exposure to solutions containing high concentrations of glucose (\u226760 mM), such electrodes commonly exhibited current densities of 80-120 microA/cm2 at a potential in the 0.35-0.45 volt range measured relative to the SCE. In the absence of glucose, the current density was approximately 1 microA/cm2., 46837=FIG. 4. cis - Bis(2,2'-bipyridine-N,N') dichloroosmium (II) (Osbpy2 Cl2) was prepared by a standard literature procedure (Lay, P.A.; Sargeson, A.M.; Taube, H., Inorg. Syn. 1986, 24, 291). Polyvinylpyridine (PVP), nominal molecular weight 50,000, was purchased from Polysciences, Inc. and purified three times by dissolution in methanol and precipitation with ether. 0.494 gram Os(bpy)2 Cl2 and 0.430 gram PVP were added to 18 mls. of ethylene glycol in a round bottom flask under nitrogen. The mixture was slowly heated to reflux (196\ufffd C.) and maintained at reflux for about 105 minutes. It was then cooled to room temperature and 30 mls. of dimethylformamide (DMF) was added. 1.5 gram bromoethylamine hydrobromide was added to the mixture which was then stirred at about 35\ufffd C. overnight. The polymer solution was then poured into a rapidly stirred solution of acetone and the precipitate was filtered, washed with acetone and stored in a vacuum dessicator. The approximate structure of this polymer is shown in FIG. 2 (Polymer C)., 48203=The enzyme containing solution was made up fresh every day; the other two solutions were stable for at least one month. 15 microliters of solution 1, 15 microliters of solution 2 and 5 microliters of solution 3 were thoroughly mixed in a vial and 3 microliters of the mixture was deposited onto a glassy carbon disk electrode (4.5 mm in diameter). The electrode was then placed in a vacuum dessicator for 24 hours. Upon exposure to solutions containing high concentrations of glucose (\u226760 mM), such electrodes commonly exhibited current densities of 400-1100 microA/cm2 at a potential in the 0.35-0.45 volt range measured relative to the potential of the Standard Calomel Electrode (SCE). In the absence of glucose, the current density was approximately 1 microA/cm2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations This invention has been disclosed in connection with specific embodiments. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that variations may be undertaken without departing the spirit and scope of the invention. A 3mm glassy carbon disk electrode was made by applying 3 microliters of 5 mg/ml glucose oxidase in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 8.1, 1 microliter of 2.7 mg/ml PEG-DGE in the same buffer and 3 microliters of 10 mg/ml Polymer G in acetonitrile. The electrode was cured overnight in vacuum. Upon exposure to a solution containing a high concentration of glucose (\u226760 mM), this electrode exhibited a current density of 2.1 microA/cm2 when held at a potential of 0.15 V relative to the SCE reference. The background current density in the absence of glucose was 0.84 microA/cm2 at the same potential. 190 mgs of the resulting 4-methy1,4'-(butylaminoethylamine) bipyridine was dissolved in 4 mls. DMF and 144 mgs of K2 OsCl6 was added and refluxed for 1 hour. Water and dilute HCl were added to the DMF solution, it was filtered and the product was precipitated by the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate. The product was dried under vacuum. The structure of this compound is shown in FIG. 2 (Polymer G). 4'-Methyl,4'-(4-bromobutyl) bipyridine, made from the monolithium salt of dimethylbipyridine and 1,4-dibromobutane, was used as a starting material. 1.11 gram of this was dissolved in 50 mls. of ethylene diamine and warmed",
