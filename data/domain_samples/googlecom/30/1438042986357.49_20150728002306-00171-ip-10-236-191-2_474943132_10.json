The final rotation rate must be the same for both spindles if the stent is keyed into element 308 for 1:1 rotation, otherwise the stent can be damaged through torsion. Similarly, for the pulse of FIG. 10D, element 308 continues to rotate ahead of or faster than stent 302 as long as the rotation rate is at R2. For a pulse shown by FIG. 10B, the final rotation rate is less than R1 which causes element 308 to rotate behind or slower than stent 302. The final rotation rate, R3, is the same as the pre-pulse rotation rate, R1, in FIG. 10C. Thus, element 308 stops rotating relative to stent 302 when the rotation rate of element 308 returns to R3. After the pulse, element 308 has different contact points with stent 302.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{130387=In further embodiments, assembly 40 can include only one rotatable support element, e.g., support element 42, with the opposing support element being rotationally fixed. An end of stent 45 can fit loosely over an opposing support element so that there is not a 1:1 rotation of stent 45 with the support element. Such a support element can have a variety of shapes including those pictured in FIGS. 11A-B., 84520=FIGS. 3A-C depict a prior art weighing pan 160 that can accommodate stents under 28 mm in length. Weighing pan 160 is circular with a diameter, DP, of 27.57 mm and has a top surface 162 for supporting a stent. Weighing pan 160 is coupled to a support rod 164 on a bottom surface (not shown). Support rod 164 is configured to be coupled with a balance. Surface 162 of weighing pan 160 is substantially flat and has no features such as indentations or ridges. The weight of weighing pan 160, Mettler Toledo, part number ME-211185, and support rod 164 is approximately 1.2 g., 121652=Additionally, stent 45 can be disposed loose enough on support elements 42 or 44 so that there is not 1:1 rotation between stent 45 and support elements 42 or 44. Support elements 42 and 44 can be positioned relative to one another so that stent 45 has an axis of rotation different from an axis of rotation of the support elements. In this case, the contact points or area between support elements 42 and 44 and stent 10 continuously change., 142739=In additional embodiments, assembly 300 can include only one rotatable support element, e.g., support element 308, with an opposing support element being rotationally fixed. Distal end 311 of stent 302 can fit loosely over an opposing support element so that there is not a 1:1 rotation of stent 302 with the support element. Such a support element can have a variety of shapes including those pictured in FIGS. 11A-B and FIGS. 14A-B., 190477=In one embodiment, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) copolymer (PVDF-HFP) (e.g., SOLEF 21508, available from Solvay Solexis PVDF, Thorofare, N.J.), can be used as a polymer for a drug-polymer layer or matrix. Polybutyl methacrylate (PBMA) can be used as the primer to improve adhesion between the metallic stent and the drug-polymer layer or matrix., 219664=Examples of active agents include antiproliferative substances such as actinomycin D, or derivatives and analogs thereof (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich 1001 West Saint Paul Avenue, Milwaukee, Wis. 53233; or COSMEGEN available from Merck). Synonyms of actinomycin D include dactinomycin, actinomycin IV, actinomycin I1, actinomycin X1, and actinomycin C1. The bioactive agent can also fall under the genus of antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, antifibrin, antithrombin, antimitotic, antibiotic, antiallergic and antioxidant substances. Examples of such antineoplastics and/or antimitotics include paclitaxel, (e.g., TAXOL\ufffd by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Stamford, Conn.), docetaxel (e.g., Taxotere\ufffd, from Aventis S.A., Frankfurt, Germany), methotrexate, azathioprine, vincristine, vinblastine, fluorouracil, doxorubicin hydrochloride (e.g., Adriamycin\ufffd from Pharmacia & Upjohn, Peapack N.J.), and mitomycin (e.g., Mutamycin\ufffd from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Stamford, Conn.). Examples of such antiplatelets, anticoagulants, antifibrin, and antithrombins include aspirin, sodium heparin, low molecular weight heparins, heparinoids, hirudin, argatroban, forskolin, vapiprost, prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogues, dextran, D-phe-pro-arg-chloromethylketone (synthetic antithrombin), dipyridamole, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet membrane receptor antagonist antibody, recombinant hirudin, and thrombin inhibitors such as Angiomax \ufffd (Biogen, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.). Examples of such cytostatic or antiproliferative agents include angiopeptin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril (e.g., Capoten\ufffd and Capozide\ufffd from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Stamford, Conn.), cilazapril or lisinopril (e.g., Prinivil\ufffd and Prinzide\ufffd from Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J.), calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine), colchicine, proteins, peptides, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) antagonists, fish oil (omega 3-fatty acid), histamine antagonists, lovastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a cholesterol lowering drug, brand name Mevacor\ufffd from Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J.), monoclonal antibodies (such as those specific for Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) receptors), nitroprusside, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, suramin, serotonin blockers, steroids, thioprotease inhibitors, triazolopyrimidine (a PDGF antagonist), and nitric oxide. An example of an antiallergic agent is permirolast potassium. Other therapeutic substances or agents which may be appropriate agents include cisplatin, insulin sensitizers, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, carboplatin, alpha-interferon, genetically engineered epithelial cells, steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antivirals, anticancer drugs, anticoagulant agents, free radical scavengers, estradiol, antibiotics, nitric oxide donors, super oxide dismutases, super oxide dismutases mimics, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO), tacrolimus, dexamethasone, ABT-578, clobetasol, cytostatic agents, prodrugs thereof, co-drugs thereof, and a combination thereof. Other therapeutic substances or agents may include rapamycin and structural derivatives or functional analogs thereof, such as 40-O-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin (known by the trade name of EVEROLIMUS), 40-O-(3-hydroxy)propyl-rapamycin, 40-O-[2-(2-hydroxy)ethoxy]ethyl-rapamycin, methyl rapamycin, and 40-O-tetrazole-rapamycin., 88460=In some embodiments, the pan of a fixture may have an asymmetric shape that is longer along one axis, for example, an oval, rectangular, or dumbbell shape. The surface along the longer axis may be configured to accommodate a stent greater than 28 mm in length along its entire length. FIGS. 5A-C depict exemplary pans with asymmetric shapes which include an oval pan 184, a rectangular pan 186, and a dumbbell-shaped:pan 188. An axis A-A corresponds to a longer axis of the shapes in FIGS. 5A-C. A length LA corresponds to the length along axis A-A. LA is long enough to support a stent greater than 28 mm. A length along a shorter axis need not be long enough to support the stent. Pans 184, 186, and 188 can include holes 185, 187, and 189, respectively, to further optimize the mass of the pan., 123108=Motor 46 can rotate support element 42 at the same or different rate as motor 48 rotates support element 44. Thus, motor 46 and motor 48 can provide rotational pulses independent of one another to support elements 42 and 44, respectively, to shift contact points between stent 45 and support elements 42 and 44. The pulses can take the form of those shown in FIGS. 10A-D. As discussed above, a rotational pulse causes a rotation of support elements 42 or 44 relative to stent 45. An increase in rotation rate of element 42 from R1 to R2 causes element 42 to rotate ahead of stent 302 resulting in a shift of contact points between stent 45 and element 42. The relative rotation can continue as long the rotation rate of element 42 differs from element 44. However, if both ends of the stent are stuck, coupled, or attached to the respective collets resulting in 1:1 rotation at each end, a difference in velocity between the ends could damage or destroy the stent. The stent could be twisted and damaged or destroyed by a torsional force., 116456=Numerous variations of the form of a pulse that could break a stent free are possible. FIGS. 10A-D each depict the rotation rate as a function of time for representative pulses. The pulse duration can be, for example, between 0.0001 sec and 1 sec. A pulse duration outside this range can be contemplated by one of skill in the art. R1 is the rate prior to the pulse, R2 is the maximum rate of the pulse, and R3 is a final rate of the pulse (in FIGS. 10A-C). R1 can also correspond to the rotation rate of the opposing non-pulsing element. FIGS. 10A-D depict pulses that have an increase in rotation rate. However, pulses with a decrease in rotation rate can also be used to reduce or prevent sticking, as well as shifting contact points, as described below., 124890=When stent 45 is loosely supported on support elements 42 and 44 so that there is not a 1:1 rotation, rotational pulses can reduce or prevent sticking of stent 45 to support elements 42. Sticking can also be reduced or prevented by rotating support elements 42 and 44 at different rates. Rotating support elements 42 and 44 at different rates can reduce or prevent sticking of the ends of stent 10 to elements 42 or 44. The difference in torque at the different ends of stent 10 causes the slower end to pull back on the faster end and the faster end to pull forward on the slower end to reduce or prevent sticking or to break free an end that is sticking. The difference in torque between elements 42 and 44 should be small enough so as not to cause excessive flexure to the stent., 120417=Support elements 42 and 44 can be positioned by motors 54 and 56, respectively, so that support elements 42 and 44 and stent 45 have the same or substantially the same axes of rotation. Opposing forces exerted from support elements 42 and 44, for securely pinching stent 45 against support elements 42 and 44, should be sufficiently strong so as to prevent any significant movement of stent 45 on mounting assembly 40. The forces can be sufficiently strong so that there is a 1:1 rotation of stent 45 with support elements 42 and 44., 215161=In accordance with one embodiment, the composition can include a solvent and a polymer dissolved in the solvent and optionally a wetting fluid. The composition can also include active agents, radiopaque elements, or radioactive isotopes. Representative examples of polymers that may be used as a substrate of a stent or coating for a stent, or more generally, implantable medical devices include, but are not limited to, poly(N-acetylglucosamine) (Chitin), Chitosan, poly(3-hydroxyvalerate), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), poly(4-hydroxybutyrate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), polyorthoester, polyanhydride, poly(glycolic acid), poly(glycolide), poly(L-lactic acid), poly(L-lactide), poly(D,L-lactic acid), poly(D,L-lactide), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide), poly(caprolactone), poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone), poly(D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone), poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone), poly(trimethylene carbonate), polyester amide, poly(glycolic acid.-co-trimethylene carbonate), co-poly(ether-esters) (e.g. PEO/PLA), polyphosphazenes, biomolecules (such as fibrin, fibrinogen, cellulose, starch, collagen and hyaluronic acid), polyurethanes, silicones, polyesters, polyolefins, polyisobutylene and ethylene-alphaolefin copolymers, acrylic polymers and copolymers, vinyl halide polymers and copolymers (such as polyvinyl chloride), polyvinyl ethers (such as polyvinyl methyl ether), polyvinylidene halides (such as polyvinylidene chloride), polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl ketones, polyvinyl aromatics (such as polystyrene), polyvinyl esters (such as polyvinyl acetate), acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers, ABS resins, polyamides (such as Nylon 66 and polycaprolactam), polycarbonates, polyoxymethylenes, polyimides, polyethers, polyurethanes, rayon, rayon-triacetate, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellophane, cellulose nitrate, cellulose propionate, cellulose ethers, and carboxymethyl cellulose. Additional representative examples of polymers that may be especially well suited for use in fabricating embodiments of implantable medical devices disclosed herein include ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (commonly known by the generic name EVOH or by the trade name EVAL), poly(butyl methacrylate), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (e.g., SOLEF 21508, available from Solvay Solexis PVDF, Thorofare, N.J.), polyvinylidene fluoride (otherwise known as KYNAR, available from ATOFINA Chemicals, Philadelphia, Pa.), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, poly(vinyl acetate), styrene-isobutylene-styrene triblock copolymers, and polyethylene glycol., 154308=In some embodiments, support mandrels 408 and 410 could be covered, coated, or jacketed with a lubricious material, such as Teflon, to reduce or eliminate defects that could be caused by interaction of the inside diameter (ID) of stent 402.with the outside surface of the mandrels. Additionally, in one embodiment, the outside diameter of the mandrels can be sized to allow a slip or friction-fit so that there is a 1:1 rotation of stent 402 with the mandrels., 97543=The coating runs included application of a primer layer and a drug-matrix or reservoir layer over the primer layer. The coating material for the primer layer was poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) in an acetone/cyclohexanone solvent. The coating material for the reservoir layer was poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) copolymer (PVDF-HFP) (e.g., SOLEF 21508, available from Solvay Solexis PVDF, Thorofare, N.J.) in an acetone/cyclohexanone solvent., 115239=Support elements 22 of small diameter, as compared to the inner diameter of stent 10, results in an axis xm about which support elements 22 rotate, that is offset from an axis xs, about which stent 15 rotates. Axis xs is positioned longitudinally through the center of stent 15. Since support elements 22 and stent 15 rotate about different axes, xm and xs, support elements 22 and stent 15 do not have a 1:1 rotation. Thus, the contact points or area between support 22 and stent 15 continuously change. However, coating material can cause stent 15 to stick to support elements 22, resulting in a stationary contact point., 75568=Table 1 presents data for stents dried at two different temperatures using an embodiment of the drying apparatus discussed herein. Ten different sample runs were performed at each temperature. The stents were Xience-V stents obtained from Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif. The coating runs included application of a primer layer and a drug-matrix or reservoir layer over the primer layer. The coating material for the primer layer was poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) in an acetone/cyclohexanone solvent. The coating material for the reservoir layer was poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) copolymer (PVDF-HFP) (e.g., SOLEF 21508, available from Solvay Solexis PVDF, Thorofare, N.J.) in an acetone/cyclohexanone solvent., 122223=When there is 1:1 rotation between a support element and the stent, contact points between the support and the stent tend not to change if the rotation rate of elements 42 and 44 are the same. As discussed above, contact points that do not change for all or a substantial part of the coating process can lead to coating defects. A shift in contact points during coating can reduce or eliminate defects due to contact points during coating. Providing a rotational pulse to a support element can shift the contact points between the support element and the stent. Contact points that are uncovered due to a shift may then be covered by coating material. A repeated shifting of contact points during coating tends to allow coating material to cover defects or uncoated regions caused by contact points during the coating process.}",
