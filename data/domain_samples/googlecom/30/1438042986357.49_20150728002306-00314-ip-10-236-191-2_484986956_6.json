No. 50,782 filed June 19, 1970, now abandoned., 11618=The broadband medium gain performance of log periodic dipole arrays has long been recognized for use in the high frequency or HF (3-30 MHz) and the very high frequency or VI-[F (30-300 MI-Iz) bands. The linear relationship of the standard dipole to operating wavelengths, however, results in difficulty capacitive th in using such arrays in space limited applications. For example, at 3 and 30 MHz the dipole span is 50 and meters, respectively. The need for more compact antennas has led to consideration of foreshortening or size-reducing dipoles by various techniques such as series inductance loading, transmission line loading and various types of capacitive loading of the elements as described, for example, in the article entitled Reduced-Size Log Periodic Antennas by D. F. DiFonzo, Proccedings of the 9th National Communication Symposium October 1963, pages 121 to 130, inclusive (IEEE). These techniques, however, have not provided the required transforming action, the wideband active region and/or the high attenuation of the active region required for antenna gain, pattern uniformity and the front to back ratio necessary for high performance broadband operation., 11086=7 Claims, 13 Drawing Figures PATENTED 81975 3,732,572}",
