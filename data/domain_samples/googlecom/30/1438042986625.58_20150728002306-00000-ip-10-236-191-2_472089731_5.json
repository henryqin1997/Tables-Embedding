If, after alarm 22 is activated, the user desires to reset radio 20 without detaching and throwing the alarm, resistor 86 will discharge capacitors 46 and 48 to arrest audible signal 33. The user then resets radio 20 and remounts alarm 22 on chassis 26 for the next use. The user then throws alarm 22 against a surface causing impact sensitive switch 60 to close momentarily, thereby activating thyristor 62 to send audible signal 33 a continuous current signal which decays in magnitude as capacitors 46 and 48 are quickly discharged. This causes audible signal 33 to emit a corresponding continuous and quickly decaying tone deactivating the signal. The pulsating tone emitted by audible signal 33 awakens the user, who then grips casing 27 and removes alarm 22 from chassis 26 disconnecting leads 38 from terminals 24. Capacitors 46 and 48, which have been charged, continue to energize audible signal 33, which continues to emit a pulsating tone. Switching circuit 42 operates as follows: multivibrator 50 sends a pulsating signal to transistor 58, which transistor switches on and off causing transmission of pulses of current through to audible signal 33, causing it to emit a pulsating tone; the resistor 52 and capacitor 54 control the current signals, and for the sizes given in Table A will produce a",
