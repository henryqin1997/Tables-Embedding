In this state, the plasma frequency WF (which is proportional to ne 0.5) falls within a microwave range of about 10 GHz to 1000 GHz. When a microwave having a higher frequency than a plasma frequency is radiated into a uniform plasma in which abnormal discharge is not generated, the microwave is propagated through the plasma without damping.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, representative devices, and illustrated examples shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, since abnormal discharge is monitored by detecting changes in impedance of a plasma, the response speed is high and the sensitivity is also high in comparison with a case of detecting arc emission light, so that abnormal discharge can certainly be monitored. Further, if maintenance of the apparatus (such as replacements of a chamber, an electrode, or the like) is carried out on the basis of monitoring results, down time of the plasma processing apparatus can be shortened and significant malfunctions can also be prevented. Furthermore, since a treatment step for recovering a damage caused by abnormal discharge is performed on the target substrate on the basis of monitoring results, the yield of manufacturing semiconductor devices is improved. (2) On the basis of monitoring results, subsequent processing to be performed on the target substrate is stopped. (1) As a damage recovery treatment step, at least one of heating treatment, cleaning treatment, polishing treatment, thin film formation, and exposure to a gas atmosphere is performed. Preferable",
