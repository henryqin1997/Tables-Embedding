The invention is also not restricted to gaseous dried air but can in principle be applied to any other fluids. In addition, the residual coldness of the fed-back gas can be used not only for cooling the heat exchanger 95 but also for cooling any desired other assemblies or heat exchangers before said residual coldness is fed back to the container 5. In particular it is to be noted that the exemplary embodiments above can of course be combined with one another. Additional line connections and regulating valves for the respective gas flow, which can be controlled manually or electrically, can also be provided. Although the present invention has been described above with reference to preferred exemplary embodiments, it is not restricted to them but rather can be modified in a variety of ways. The direct feeding in of dried air via the outflow element 30 in the container 5 is therefore additionally provided in this embodiment but it can also be configured in such a way that it can be switched off if the throughflow rate through the sample stage 10 is completely sufficient for conditioning the atmosphere within the container 5. designates an additional gas-temperature controller to",
