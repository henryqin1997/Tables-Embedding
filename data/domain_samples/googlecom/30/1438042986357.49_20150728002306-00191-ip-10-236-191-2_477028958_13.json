In particular, where desired, the process of the present invention may advantageously produce gel compositions having a BET surface areas of greater than or equal to 200 m2/g, preferably greater than or equal to 400 m2/g, more preferably greater than or equal to 500 m2/g. BET surface area may be determined utilizing ASTM test procedure D1993., 27238=a \u03c1liquid/\u03c1solid ratio at the freezing point of 0.95-1.05, preferably 0.97-1.03; and, 79631=BET surface area of a gel composition may be determined utilizing ASTM test procedure D1993., 28292=A further embodiment of a process of the present invention comprises drying a wet gel composition comprising gel solids and a drying agent to remove the drying agent wherein the drying agent has a \u03c1liquid/\u03c1solid ratio at the freezing point of 0.95-1.05, preferably 0.97-1.03; and/or a vapor pressure at the freezing/melting point of greater than or equal to 1 Torr, preferably greater than or equal to 10 Torr, more preferably greater than or equal to 25 Torr. In preferred embodiments, the drying agent additionally has one or more of the following properties:, 78371=The dibutyl phthalate adsorption value (DBP) of the carbon blacks utilized in the examples, expressed as milliliters per 100 grams of carbon black (ml/100 g), was determined according to the procedure set forth in ASTM D2414.}",
