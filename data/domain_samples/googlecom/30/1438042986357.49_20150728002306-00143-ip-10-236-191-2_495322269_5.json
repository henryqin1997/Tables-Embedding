However, such trenches do not meet at right angles nor do they have flat bottoms. The etch rate ratio of the (110) planes to the (111) planes is >400:1. The disadvantage is that the (110) planes have a higher surface state density, as previously described, than the (100) planes. The following article gives examples of such grooves: D.L. Kendall, Annual Review of Mat. Sci., 9, pp. 373-403 (1979). In using <110> oriented wafers, it is extremely important that the mask be aligned to the crystal planes to within 0.1\ufffd or the etched trench will be hard to control and the trench walls will be stepped and rough. On the other hand, the width of a V-groove in <100> oriented silicon is controlled not only by the mask width \"W\" and the perfection of the mask alignment to the (111) planes intersecting the surface, but also by mask erosion, since this crystal orientation does not have as high an intrinsic etch-rate ratio of its crystal planes., 121883=Boron Etch Stop--\"EDP\" will stop etching in silicon when the boron doping concentration exceeds 5\ufffd1019. A disadvantage is that this much boron creates epitaxial stacking faults. The theory suggests that tensile stress created by the boron is the stopping mechanism., 122256=These etches do not stop, they just slow down; as an example, see R.L. Meek, \"Anodic Dissolution of N+ Silicon\", J. Electrochem Soc., 118, pp. 437-442, March 1971. These etches will \"stop\" on a device-quality N-layer., 122593=These etches do stop; as an example, see T.N. Jackson et al, \"An Electrochemical P-N Junction Etch Stop for the Formation of Silicon Microstructures\", IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, 2, pp 44-45, February 1981. These etches will truly stop on a device-quality N-layer., 135558=There are countless packaging schemes which could be employed with this invention. With the methods disclosed herein, a superchip can be formed and interconnected. Once the superchip is formed, as in the case of FIG. 5, for example, the superchip can be potted or vacuum-chucked from above such that its bottomside can be freed of excess solidified polymer 22 (if any). A conventional epoxy die attach, for example, could then be executed. In applications wherein all the segments are of equal thickness, then little backside preparation is required before die attach. In cases wherein a potting material is employed, the material may be a hot-melt wax or resin or a thermosetting or UV-curable polymer. A method of solder die-attaching huge chips without using a flux and without resulting in voids has been recently disclosed by Mizuishi et al, \"Fluxless and Virtually Voidless Soldering for Semiconductor Chips\", IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids and Manufacturing Technology, Vol. II, No. 4, Dec. 1988., 58771=References to \"closely abutting\" integrated-circuitry constructed on multiple independent bodies of semiconductor material are undoubtedly numerous. As an example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,322,737, issued Mar. 30, 1982, to Jack Sliwa and assigned to INTEL Corp. clearly shows such a concept in FIGS. 17a and 21. However, this reference, like so many others, is not specifically designed to implement micrometer-scale intersegment interconnections, so all of the particulate and edge damage issues are ignored and no particular claims relating to micrometer-scale extendability are made., 103977=(b) \u22480.90 g/cm3 HSG-2200 @ viscosity=7.5 cp;}",

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art. It is possible that the invention may be practiced in any combination of digital, analog, or electro-optical device technologies, superconducting technologies, solid-state sensor technologies, or micromechanical device technologies, to name but a few. Similarly, any process steps described might be interchangeable with other steps in order to achieve the same result. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents. Finally, it may be desirable to form superchips from a first segment and one or more segments containing test circuitry using the procedures disclosed herein, test the first segment, and separate the segments. The first segment is then processed further. Such forming of superchips for testing is also within the scope of this invention. A particular strength of the foregoing approach is that there will be no appreciable strain",
