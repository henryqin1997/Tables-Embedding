Many of the different ways a component (such as the flaps 24) can be \u201cjoined to\u201d or \u201cassociated with\u201d, etc. another component which are set forth in the definitions of these terms contained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,906 entitled \u201cDecoupled Sanitary Napkin\u201d which issued to Osborn, et al. on Apr. 16, 1991. When the flaps comprise separate elements, they can be Joined to the main body portion 22 by any techniques known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include, but are not limited to adhesives, heat and/or pressure, ultrasonics, etc., 73501=In one alternative emiodiment of the sanitary napkin 20 (typically in which the topsheet 40 overlays only the main body portion 22 and does not extend out to form the top surface of the flaps), the backsheet 42 may be comprised of two layers. In such a case, the backsheet 42 may comprise a first layer of lofted material disposed on the core-facing side 42 a of the backsheet. The purpose of the first layer is to provide a comfortable, non-irritating surface against the body of the wearer. The lofted layer may be comprised of any suitable material, such as a nonwoven material. Preferably, the lofted layer comprises a hydrophobic nonwoven material. The second layer may be disposed on the garment side 42 b of the backsheet 42, and may comprise a fluid impervious film. A low density polyethylene material about 0.01 to about 0.05 millimeters in thickness, preferably about 0.02 millimeters in thickness, has been found to work well as this second layer. A polyethylene film, such as is sold by the Ethyl Corporation, Visqueen Division, under model XP-39385 has been found particularly well suited for this second layer. The backsheet 42 may also be made of a soft, cloth-like material which is hydrophobic relative to the topsheet 40. A polyester or polyolefinic fiber backsheet 42 has been found to work well. A particularly preferred soft, cloth-like backsheet 42 material is a laminate of a polyester nonwoven material and a film such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,180 issued to Wnuk on October 9, 1984., 79441=While a preferred sanitary napkin embodiment of the present invention has been described, numerous other sanitary napkin embodiments having flaps are available and are disclosed in the literature. These could be provided with the zones of differential extensibility of the present invention. In particular, sanitary napkins having flaps are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

Weber et al. on Feb. 28, 1991. The fold lines in the corrugations of the topsheet should run in the transverse direction so the topsheet is longitudinally extensible., 37466=Sanitary napkins having flaps of the various types are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478, entitled \u201cShaped Sanitary Napkin With Flaps\u201d, which issued to Van Tilburg on Aug. 18, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,047, entitled \u201cSanitary Napkin Attachment Means\u201d, which issued to Mattingly on Aug. 26, 1986 U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876, entitled \u201cSanitary Napkin\u201d, which issued to Van Tilburg on May 20, 1986, U.S. Pat. No. 4,285,343, entitled \u201cSanitary Napkin\u201d, which issued to McNair on Aug. 25, 1981, U.S. Pat. No. 3,397,697, entitled \u201cDisposable Sanitary Shield For Undergarments\u201d, which issued to Rickard on Aug. 20, 1968, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,787,271, entitled \u201cSanitary Napkins\u201d, which issued to Clark on Apr. 2, 1957., 78511=The fasteners used with the present invention are not limited to adhesive attachment means. Any type of fastener used in the art can be used for such purpose. For example, the sanitary napkin 20 could be secured to the wearer's undergarment by the fastener described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,527 entitled \u201cPressure-Sensitive Adhesive Fastener and Method of Making the Same\u201d issued to Battrell on Aug. 7, 1990. For simplicity, however, the fasteners will be described in terms of adhesive attachment means., 118114=FIG. 8A also shows that the curved juncture 30 only needs to be curved concave inward in the central region 104 of the sanitary napkin. (The same is true for virtually all of the curved Juncture embodiments described herein.) The curved juncture 30 can be in any suitable configuration in the end regions of the sanitary napkin. For Instance, the juncture 30 can be straight, or (as shown in FIG. 8A) curved convex outward in the end regions 100 and 102. (The terms \u201ccentral region\u201d and \u201cend regions\u201d are defined in U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,680 issued to Higgins on Sep. 1, 1987.), 85358=It is also not necessary that the flaps 24 extend from (or be joined along) the longitudinal edges 22 a of the main body portion 22. The flaps 24 can Joined inward (or \u201cinboard\u201d) from the longitudinal edges 22 a toward the longitudinal centerline such as is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,320 issued to McCoy on Feb. 13, 1990. The flaps 24 can, thus, each be Joined to the main body portion 22 along the principal longitudinal centerline l, or along the longitudinal edges 22 a of the main body portion 22, or at any place between the principal longitudinal centerline l and the longitudinal edges 22 a of the main body portion 22. The flaps 24 will, of course, generally be on opposite sides of the principal longitudinal centerline l., 63827=Suitable formed films are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135, entitled \u201cAbsorptive Structure Having Tapered Capillaries\u201d, which issued to Thompson on Dec. 30, 1975, U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,426, entitled \u201cDisposable Absorbent Article Having A Stain-Resistant Topsheet\u201d, which issued to Maullane and Smith on Apr. 13, 1982, U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,314, entitled \u201cResilient Plastic Web Exhibiting Fiber-Like Properties\u201d, which issued to Radel and Thompson on Aug. 3, 1982, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,045, entitled \u201cMacroscopically Expanded Three-Dimensional Plastic Web Exhibiting Non-Glossy Visible Surface and Cloth-Like Tactile Impression\u201d, which issued to Ahr, Louis, Mullane, and Ouellette on Jul. 31, 1984. Formed films are preferred for topsheet 40 because they are pervious to liquids and yet non-absorbent. Thus, the surface of the formed file which is in contact with the body remains dry and is more comfortable to the wearer., 81325=Suitable absorbent articles in the form of pantiliners are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,676 entitled \u201cPantiliner\u201d issued to Osborn on Apr. 19, 1988. Suitable absorbent articles, at least some of which are in the form of adult incontinence products, are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/637,571 entitled \u201cAbsorbent Article Having Rapid Acquiring Wrapped Multiple Layer Absorbent Body\u201d filed by Barry R. Feist, et al. on Jan. 3, 1991., 39833=A number of variations on the types of flaps described above have been presented in an attempt to solve various problems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,320 issued to McCoy on Feb. 13, 1990, discloses a sanitary napkin having flaps affixed at points inward from the longitudinal edge of the napkin. U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,701 issued to Mavinkurve on Mar. 27, 1990, discloses a sanitary napkin having elastic means for providing greater convex shape to the body-facing portion of the central absorbent and for enabling adhesive-free placement of the flaps of the napkin. U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,462 issued to Salerno on Jul. 10, 1990, discloses a sanitary napkin with longitudinally expandable flaps. A sanitary napkin having flaps with stress relief means in the form of a notch or a slit is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697 which issued to Osborn, III, et al. on Apr. 17, 1990. Although this latter sanitary napkin works quite well, the search for sanitary napkins having improved flaps has continued., 66793=Such a topsheet is described In greater detail in the following patent applications which were filed on Jun. 23, 1991: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/734,404 entitled \u201cAbsorbent Articles, Especially Catamenials, Having Improved Fluid Directionality, Comfort and Fit\u201d filed in the names of Thompson, et al.; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/734,392 entitled \u201cFluid Handling Structure for Use in Absorbent Articles\u201d filed in the names of Thompson, et al.; and, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/734,405 entitled \u201cAbsorbent Core for Use in Catamenial Products\u201d filed in the names of Buenger, et al. These patent applications may be referred to collectively as the \u201cCapillary Channel Fiber\u201d patent applications.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention provides a sanitary napkin having flaps and zones of differential extensibility to provide an improved stress relief means for relieving the stresses that develop in the flaps when the flaps are folded down and under a wearer's undergarment. In still other alternative embodiments, the sanitary napkin could be provided with additional components. For instance, the sanitary napkin could be provided with the wet-laid tissue and/or the liquid permeable wipe acquisition sheet described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,653 issued to Osborn. In addition, such sanitary napkins could be provided with additional types of stress relief means such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697 at various locations around the periphery of the sanitary napkin. The barrier 98 may be provided on most of the embodiments described herein. (The barrier may also be provided on other sanitary napkin embodiments. For instance, the flaps of the sanitary napkin 20 shown are completely extensible. In addition, the sanitary napkin could even be provided with such a barrier 98 if it did not have flaps 24.) The barrier 98 may be constructed in any suitable manner. FIG. 16 shows one preferred construction",
