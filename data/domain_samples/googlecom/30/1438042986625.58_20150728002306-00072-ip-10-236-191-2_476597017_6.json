The scope of the present invention, therefore, is to be determined solely by the appended claims. Further, in the foregoing description, has been explained the operation of the above described embodiment in case that the access signals for the cache tag memory and for the cache memory are generated by delaying the control signal (i.e., the clock) for producing the hit signals in the address conversion device. It is apparent that equivalent effects can be obtained even in case that the access control signals are generated by delaying the various control signals (e.g., the hit signal) used in the address conversion device. In any case, the generation of a physical address and the reading of a tag address are simultaneously performed, and a wait time required for waiting the arrival of one of the physical and tag addresses to a comparator after the other reaches there is eliminated, and cache data stored in the cache memory is transferred in response to the generation of the cache hit signal. In contrast, in case where the access time tM for the cache memory is shorter than the sum of the access time",
