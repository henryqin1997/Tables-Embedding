Further, the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Consequently, variation and modification commiserate with the above teachings, within the skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present invention. The embodiment described hereinabove is further intended to explain the best mode presently known of practicing the invention and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention as such, or in other embodiments, and with the various modifications required by their particular application or uses of the invention. Additionally, note that in certain contexts the DISPLAY ENGINE 622 may transmit a message to an Internet Service Provider 806 indicating that no further Internet access will be subsidized due to a predetermined number of advertising presentation display failures. However, regardless of how the present invention subsidizes Internet access, the game/advertisement controller 604 is notified whenever each subsidized user connects to the Internet or disconnects from the Internet. Additionally, certain reliability features are included in the daemon 806 and ad view program 812 for assuring that advertising is indeed presented to the user. For example, there may be periodic transmissions from each subsidized user's Internet client node 318 to the web site 308 verifying that both the daemon 806 and the ad view program 812 are active.
