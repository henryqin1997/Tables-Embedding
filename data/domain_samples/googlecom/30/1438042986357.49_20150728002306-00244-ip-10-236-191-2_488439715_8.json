    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The embodiments of the present invention desribed above are to be regarded in all respects as merely illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without deviating from the spirit thereof. For example, the air pump of the present invention may be provided with three or more cylinder chambers. The present invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of the following appended claims. The protruded portion 75 can be moved to locate between the first and the second locating portions 231 and 232. In the meantime, the pressure releasing member 74 is movable in both directions inside the air duct 21, thereby enabling the sealing positions of the two leakproof elements 78 and 80 to be altered so as to connect the first and the second channels 18 and 20 or to isolate the first and the second channels 18 and 20. As a result, the air pump of the present invention can be put into operation, with only one cylinder chamber working to pump the air into the tire or with both cylinder chambers working simultaneously to pump the air into the tire. The third preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 in which the definitions of the reference numerals are similar to those of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The third preferred embodiment is different",
