    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been specifically described in connection with certain specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not of limitation, and the scope of the appended claims should be construed as broadly as the prior art will permit. Thus, as can be seen from the foregoing, the invention provides a new system for gauging and filling the tires on vehicles or trailers. While adaptable for most all tire wheels, single or dual, it is particularly useful with dual deep-dish wheels as commonly used on trucks and tractor-trailer rigs. Dual wheel assemblies are basically two single such wheels that are bolted together back to back, as shown in FIG. 2. The described air-fill, gauging system of the invention provides readily accessible tire fill valve stems for filling or lowering the air pressure in respective tires and preferably a tire pressure gauge for each tire. An advantage of the invention is that can be easily mounted to the inside surface of the outside wheel without the need for mounting the air pressure system to the hub cap or similar structure of the wheel assembly, as in conventional air pressure gauging systems. For a secure mounting at high speeds or for bumps or potholed roadways, the assembly 18 is preferably not snapped onto the wheel rim, as is the conventional practice, but is mounted to a bracket structure 64",
