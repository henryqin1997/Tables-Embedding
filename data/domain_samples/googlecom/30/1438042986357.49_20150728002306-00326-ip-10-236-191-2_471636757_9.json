Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. , the masking material 53\u2032 and cover lay 16\u2032 are stripped off from the FPC 110 as indicated by the outline arrow (S55), whereby a land 111 is formed as a hole to expose a part of the circuit 2 b. The land 111 can be formed in various shapes depending on the shape of the masking formed on the circuit 2 b or the shape of the cutter 31 a of the die 31. FIG. 34 After cutting only the masking material 53\u2032 and cover lay 16\u2032 of the land forming part, the work head 23 is moved again in the outline arrow direction to separate from the FPC 110, as shown in FIG. 33. Finally, as shown in , a work head 23 of a press machine (not shown) is moved in the outline arrow direction to cut, with a die 31, only the masking material 53\u2032 of the masking material forming part (namely, the part to form a land) and the cover lay 16\u2032 of FPC 110 (S54).",
