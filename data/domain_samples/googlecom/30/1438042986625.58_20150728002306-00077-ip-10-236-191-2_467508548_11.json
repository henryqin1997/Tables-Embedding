Support for notifying a control whenever the data node it is bound to changes. 4. Support for notifying a control whether the value of the bound data node changes. 3. Support for a control specifying what property of the control should be synchronized with the value of the bound data node (including specifying that no property should be so bound). 2. Support for the specification of the data node of interest being relative to the data node bound to another control's rather than the root of the data store. This support includes both implicit (data binding hierarchy follows control hierarchy) and explicit (control specifies another control as the parent in the data binding hierarchy) specification of the data binding hierarchy. 1. Full support for specifying the data node of interest using the syntax native to the data store. In summary, the data binding concepts implemented in Internet Explorer version 5 from Microsoft Corporation have been significantly expanded to include: </html> </body>",
