No. 4,899,112, at different spacing(s), to attain further depths of investigation. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,343 there is disclosed a logging apparatus that can be utilized in logging-while-drilling, and which has three or more transmitting antennas and a pair of receiving antennas. (See also \"New 2-MHZ Multiarray Borehole-Compensated Resistivity Tool Developed for MWD in Slim Holes\", By S. D. Bonner, et al., SPE Paper 30547, SPE Annual Technical Conference & Exhibition, Dallas, Tex., U.S.A., Oct. 22-25 1995.) In one disclosed embodiment of the referenced '343 Patent there are five transmitters; that is, fifth, third, first, second, and fourth transmitting antennas longitudinally spaced on a logging device in the recited sequence. A pair of longitudinally spaced receiving antennas are located between the first and second transmitting antennas. The fifth, third, first, second, and fourth transmitting antennas are spaced from the midpoint between the receiver pair by fifth, third, first, second, and fourth distances, respectively, and each of the fifth, third, first, second, and fourth distances are different. The transmitting antennas can be individually energized, and the configuration can provide the advantages of borehole compensation without the need for having, for each transmitter-to-receiver pair spacing, an \"equal and opposite\" transmitter with the same spacing on the other side of the receiver pair., 119628=Referring to FIG. 14, there is shown a flow diagram of the routine for implementing the selection of the Rxo that results in the minimal normalized variances of DI and Rt over a range of TR spacings, with the further requirement that DI and Rt are within specified ranges. For ease of explanation, the computations of normalized variances is shown as being performed in a separate routine, it being understood that these and other related computations could be made at the time that the DI and Rt estimates are first determined. The block 1405 represents initializing of Rxo to its first discretized value, the block 1410 represents initializing of an Rt counter and a DI counter (to be explained subsequently), and the block 1415 represents initializing to the first TR spacing. The previously determined Rt and DI (for the current Rxo and the current TR) are returned (block 1425) and determination is made (blocks 1431 and 1434), respectively, as to whether DI is within the prescribed range (block 1431) and whether Rt is within the prescribed range (block 1434), respective counters being incremented if an out-of-range determination is made (blocks 1432 and 1435). If Rt and DI are within the prescribed ranges, the counters will not be incremented. Determination is then made (decision block 1440) as to whether the last TR spacing has been reached. If not, the spacing is incremented to the next TR spacing (block 1442), the block 1425 is re-entered, and the loop 1443 is continued for all TR spacings being considered. When the last TR spacing has been reached, determination is made (decision block 1450) as to whether either of the DI or Rt counters has reached a count greater than 1. If so, the range criteria have not been met for the current Rxo, and it will not be considered for selection, so the block 1460 (incrementing to the next Rxo) is entered directly. If the counters are not greater than 1, the block 1465 is entered, and the mean and variance of Rt are computed for the current Rxo. Then, the mean and variance of DI are computed for the current Rxo (block 1470). Next, the normalized variance, designated NVi, for the current Rxo is computed (block 1480). Inquiry is then made (decision block 1482) as to whether the last Rxo has been considered. If not, the block 1460 is entered for consideration of the next Rxo and the Rt and DI counters are reset to 0 (block 1462), and block 1415 is re-entered, for processing for the latest Rxo. The loop 1487 is then continued, and the normalized variance of Rt and DI is computed for all values of Rxo that have met the range requirements. The smallest normalized variance is then selected (block 1490)., 115864=Referring to FIG. 13, there is shown a flow diagram of the routine represented by the block 860 of FIG. 8B for obtaining DI and Rt estimates at each Rxo and TR using apparent phase shift PS-- a and apparent phase average PA-- a. The block 1310 represents initializing to the first Rxo value, and the block 1320 represents initializing to the first TR spacing. Next, for the current value of Rxo and the current TR spacing, the supplemental look-up table is used to determine the DI and Rt that correspond to the apparent phase shift PS--a and apparent phase average PA-- a through a two dimensional interpolation. The two dimensional interpolation can be more easily visualized as the combination of one dimensional interpolations described in conjunction with blocks 1330, 1340 and 1350., 113585=It will be understood that other suitable techniques could be utilized to make the forward modeling computations. Accordingly, the previously referenced block 1225 represents the computation and storage of PSnjkl for the current indices, and the block 1230 represents the computation and storage of PAnjkl for the current indices. Subsequently, four nested loops, 1240, 1250, 1260 and 1270, are used to produce all combinations of the indices so that PSnjkl and PAnkjl are obtained for all combinations of coarse grid values of TR, DI, Rxo and Rt. More specifically, the four nested loops 1240, 1250, 1260 and 1270, are respectively used to iterate the index values of n, j, k, and l. In the loop 1240, the determination of whether the last j (that is, the last Rt value) has been reached is represented by the decision block 1242, and the incrementing of the index j is represented by the block 1247. In the loop 1250, the decision as to whether the last n (that is, the last value of Rxo) has been reached is represented by the decision block 1252, and the incrementing of the index n is represented by the block 1257. Each time the loop 1250 is traversed, the index j is initialized (block 1255) for the next sequence in the subsidiary loop 1240. In the loop 1260, the decision as to whether the last k (that is, the last value of DI) has been reached is represented by the decision block 1262, and the incrementing of the index k is represented by the block 1267. Each time the loop 1260 is traversed, the indices j and n are initialized (block 1265) for the next sequence in the subsidiary loops 1250 and 1240. In the loop 1270, the decision as to whether the last l (that is, the last value of TR) has been reached is represented by the decision block 1272, and the incrementing of the index l is represented by the block 1277. Each time the loop 1270 is traversed, the indices j, n, and k are initialized (block 1275) for the next sequence in the subsidiary loops 1260, 1250, and 1240. In this manner, it will be seen that the coarse grid look-up table is computed and stored with PSnjkl and PAnjkl for all coarse grid values Rt (index j), Rxo (index n), DI (index k), and TR (index l)., 111727=The coarse grid values of TR, DI, Rxo, and Rt to be used can cover the practical ranges encountered in logging conditions. Examples are DI in the range 5 inches to 200 inches and Rxo and Rt in the range 0.1 to 300 ohm-m. In the flow diagram of FIG. 12, the block 1205 represents the initializing of TR (index l) to its first value, the block 1210 represents the initializing of DI (index k) to its first value, the block 1215 represents the initializing of Rxo (index n) to its first value, and the block 1220 represents the initializing of Rt (index j) to its first value. Next, the block 1225, represents the computation and storage of PSnjkl, using forward modeling in a so-called step model shown in FIG. 11 (with an invaded zone of diameter DI, an invaded zone resistivity Rxo, a formation of resistivity Rt, and a transmitter-to-receivers spacing TR) in which the model parameters are defined by the described indices n, j, k, and l. Various techniques can be utilized to compute the amplitude and relative phase of electromagnetic energy at the frequency employed in the present embodiment, such as by using a routine for computation of the complex amplitude and phase at the receiver locations in media having a defined geometry and resistivities, and the specified spacings, all determined from the particular logging tool to be employed. An example of such a routine is described in the following publication: Anderson, B. and Chew, W. C., \"A New High Speed Technique For Calculating Synthetic Induction And DPT Logs\", SPWLA 25th Annual Logging Symposium (1984), Paper HH. Reference can also be made to the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,393 and to Field Computation By Moment Methods, Roger Harrington, IEEE Press 3rd Ed., 1993; and to Electromagnetic Wave Theory, Jim Kong, Wiley-Interscience, 1986., 88466=The scheme of driving the model with discritized Rxo or DI values and the search for a minimum is presently preferred and also serves the purpose of ease of explanation of the algorithm. Without limiting generality, it will be understood that steps of the inversion technique of the disclosed embodiment can be replaced by other minization schemes such as Newton-Raphson method (see Applied Numerical Methods by B. Carnahan, H. A. Luther, and J. O. Wilkes, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1969, P. 319) or Nelder and Mead's simplex method (see Numerical Recipes by W. H. Press, B. P. Flannery, S. A. Teukolsky, W. T. Vetterling, Cambridge University Press, 1978, 3rd Ed., P. 289). The trade-offs between the various schemes are robustness and speed of convergence., 116705=The procedure of the blocks 1330, 1340 and 1350 can be envisioned graphically from FIG. 15. In the step model of FIG. 11, PA and PS are each a function of Rxo, Rt, DI, and TR. For a particular spacing TR and a particular invaded zone resistivity Rxo, each of PS and PA are functions of the diameter of invasion DI and the formation resistivity, Rt. That is,, 117286=Thus, for example, since PS and PA are both functions of DI and Rt, a plot of PS versus PA can be envisioned, for specific values of DI and Rt. An example of such a plot is illustrated in FIG. 15, which is a simplified version of FIG. 5B (with exemplary TR and Rxo values of TR=34 in. and Rxo=2 ohm-m) sketching just some of the curves for ease of illustration and explanation. There are five curves, one for each of five respective diameters of invasion. On each of these curves, the Rt value varies, generally with decreasing Rt for increasing PS and PA. The plot of FIG. 15 can be used to illustrate the interpolation represented by the blocks 1330, 1340 and 1350 of the FIG. 13 flow diagram. For a particular apparent value of PS (that is, PS-- a), the five model diameters of invasion (DI) of the illustrated curves correspond to five values of PA, designated as PA-- x values, shown by dots at the five intersections on the vertical line. In the interpolation of block 1340, the apparent phase average PA-- a is used to interpolate between the PA-- x values on either side of it to obtain an interpolated DI value. This DI value is called DI-- rxoi. The DI value will lie at the intersection of PS-- a and PA-- a on an interpolated DI curve, as shown in dashed line in FIG. 15. The blocks 1330 and 1340 implement the functions just described of, first, determining the DI values (the intersection points), and then interpolating to obtain DI-- rxoi. The block 1350 represents determination of the value Rt-- rxoi by similarly interpolating between PS-- a and values of the interpolated DI curves (dashed line of FIG. 15). Inquiry is then made (decision block 1360) as to whether the last TR has been reached. If not, TR is incremented (block 1363), the block 1330 is re-entered, and the loop 1365 is continued until all TR spacings have been considered. Inquiry is then made (decision block 1370) as to whether the last Rxo has been reached. If not, Rxo is incremented (block 1373), the block 1320 is re-entered, and the loop 1375 is continued until all Rxo values have been considered. In this manner, DI-- rxoi and Rt-- rxoi are obtained for all discretized Rxo and all TR spacings., 49442=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/789,902, filed Jan. 29, 1997, which, in turn, claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/011,275, filed Feb. 7, 1996.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations When considerable time has passed after drilling, the diameter of invasion may be quite large for some formations. Therefore, in conjunction with logging techniques that are performed well after the drilling process, such as during so-called \"wash down\" where logging is performed using the drill string after drilling, or during wireline logging, it may be desirable to implement inversion using inherently deeper measurements, e.g. attenuation. as also set forth in numbered Section 8. DI-- inv(m)=DIi(n) Rt-- inv(m)=Mean(Rt-- dii(m,n,l)) over l=3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Rxo-- inv(m)=Mean(DI-- dii(m,n,l)) over l=3, 4, 5, 6, 7 As noted above, DI rather than Rxo can be initially discretized. In such case, block 855 would obtain model PA and PS values at each discretized diameter of invasion, DI. Then, in block 860, Rxo and Rt would be obtained at each DI and TR using the apparent phase shift PS-- a and the apparent phase average PA-- a. (In this case, PS and PA are both functions of Rxo and Rt.) This means that in FIG. 13, interpolation will obtain Rxo-- dii (m,n,l) and Rt-- dii (m,n,l) (see numbered Section 7. above) Then, the selection routine (block 870, routine of FIG. 14) will select the DIi(n) which yields the smallest combined normalized variance, as set forth in numbered Section 8. above. In this case, the final inverted parameters are given",
