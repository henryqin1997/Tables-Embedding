It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. Having thus described the invention with the details and particularity required by the patent laws, what is claimed and desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims. The present invention has been illustratively presented in terms of a folded bit line architecture; however, other architectures may be employed which can benefit by the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, an illustrative diagram is shown for quantifying the effects of surrounding components on a signal on bitline 212 2\u2032. Each line labeled in FIG. 11 represents the effect on voltage that each corresponding component of FIG. 10 has on the signal on bitline 212 2\u2032. Sense amplifier 216 1 advantageously sees a relative loss of only \u22122.0, indicted in box 229. This relative term is a multiplier, which represents a multiple of a coupling percent. A bar 217 is indicated showing the relative differential measured by sense amplifier 216 1 due to the coupling",
