This was then pelletized by a rubber pelletizer. Next, the elastomer component and resin were dry blended in a predetermined formulation, charged into a twin-screw mixing extruder, and dynamically vulcanized to prepare a thermoplastic elastomer composition. The mixing conditions at this time were a temperature of 230\ufffd C. (270\ufffd C. in Comparative Example I-4) and a shear rate of 1000 s\u22121., 19136=Research directed to the difference in viscosities at the time of processing in mixing of rubbers and resins has been known in the past. Among these, the capability of reducing the domain dispersion particle size the most in the state where the ratio of melt viscosities of the rubber/resin is brought close to 1 (that is, no difference in viscosities) has been reported in S. Wu, Polym. Eng. Sci., 27(5), 1987. If using these technologies to fabricate a thermoplastic elastomer having more flexibility, larger strength and elongation, and superior durability by raising the rubber ratio, while keeping the ratio of melt viscosities of the rubber/resin at 1, the rubber becomes the matrix and thermoplasticity is no longer exhibited., 16179=This is a division of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the present invention, by controlling the dispersed particle size of the rubber in the thermoplastic elastomer composition and the blended resin structure of the matrix phase, it was found that the durability, particularly the durability up to stringent times of 10\ufffd C., 0\ufffd C., \u221220\ufffd C., or \u221240\ufffd C. was remarkably improved while maintaining the gas permeation preventive property. Therefore, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention can be effectively used as a member of a product requiring durability such as elongation flexural fatigue in a wide temperature range from ordinary temperature to a low temperature region such as the inner liner member of a pneumatic tire, a hose member, a belt member, and a fender. Industrial Applicability According to the results of Table III-1, it is learned that the compositions of the Examples of the present invention improve the durability under low temperature compared with the Comparative Examples by bringing the viscosity ratio of the blended resin close to 1. 1 Zinc stearate 2 Stearic acid (Beads Stearic Acid, made by NOF Corporation) 0.5 ZnO (Zinc White No. 3, made by Seido Chemical) 100 Br-IPMS (Exxpro 89-4, made by Exxon Chemical) Parts by Weight Composition of Br-IPMS",
