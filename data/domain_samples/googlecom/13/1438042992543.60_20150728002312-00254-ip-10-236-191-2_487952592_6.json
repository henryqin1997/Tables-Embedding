(Cl. 296-137) 'I'his invention relates to roofs for automobiles having a iixed portion at the rear and a slidable portion at the front which can be drawn forward to close the roof, or pushed back to provide an open space in the front of said roof for ventilation and for outlook. It is the principal object of this invention to provide a form of roof for an automobile which when open will provide a clear space for outlook upwardly and forwardly as free as possible from obstruction, while the sliding portion or panel shall be easy to operate from within the vehicle. A further object is to provide such a roof in which the sliding panel may be supported so as to be capable of rocking about a transverse axis near the middle thereof under spring action, being locked in a forward position by manually operated locking means in such a position that it forms a continuation of the Iixed portion of the roof forwardly up to the windscreen, while when unlocked the rocking of said panel under spring action 'may bring it into a position such that it is free to pass under the iixed portion oi said roof when pushed rearwardly. Further objects are to provide for the eiective lateral guidance of such a sliding panel when unlocked at the front, and to provide airtight and weathertight joints between said panel and said windscreen on the one hand, and between said panel and Xed roof on the other hand when in the locked position. These and other objects are attained by the roof structure hereinafter described and dened by the claims., 30584=Name: :Date HERBERT'MGBBSL 23944112131 Bishop, v.
