    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{99207=[0123] Referring now to FIG. 46, a multiple treatment zone catheter 2700 is shown comprising a plurality of thermally transmissive regions 2400, a plurality of outer members 2445, a body 2420 and a plurality of fluid transport members 2410. Additionally, sensors 2550 are utilized to help locate the catheter 2700 and to provide data such as the temperature of the catheter 2700 or tissue contacting the catheter 2700. Each of the outer members 2445 are inflatable between an expanded position and a deflated position 2710. Each of fluid transport members 2410 are movable between a neutral position and a deflected position 2720. When the fluid transport member 2410 is positioned adjacent to the thermally transmissive region 2400, energy is transferred to the tissue in proximity to the region 2400. In one embodiment, the multiple treatment zone catheter 2700 is flexible to enable the thermally transmissive regions to be advantageously positioned within the selected tissue (as shown in FIGS. 47 and 48)., 106440=[0130] A further embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 54 showing a catheter 2000 as comprising a body 2002, an outer member 2010, a movable fluid transport member 2020 and a thermally transmissive region 2030. The fluid transport member 2020 is flexible and is placed proximal to the outer member 2010 when the outer member 2010 is inflated. In one embodiment, the fluid transport member 2020 is also rotatable to provide treatment zones all along the thermally transmission region 2010 without repositioning the entire catheter 2000 or rotating the body 2002., 97777=[0122] Referring to FIG. 44, a catheter 1450 is shown comprising an expandable outer member 1400, a fluid transport member 1410 and a body 1420. The outer member 1400 is expanded and retracted using a chamber inflation member 1415. In the deflated position 1425, the diameter of a thermally transmissive region 1445 is generally close to the diameter of the catheter body 1420. A bio-compatible fluid is injected into a chamber 1455 created between the outer member 1400 and the fluid transport member 1410 using the chamber inflation member 1415. The fluid transport member 1410 is flexible and movable towards the thermally transmissive region 1445. A guide wire (not shown) or other suitable method of moving the fluid transport member 1410 such as using a memory material to deform the fluid transport member 1410 to a postion 1435 is used to trasnfer the thermal energy contained in the fluid transport member 1410 to the thermally transmissive region 1445 which is in contact with the selected tissue (not shown). After treatment, the fluid transport member 1410 is moved back to a neutral position and the chamber 1455 is deflated by removing fluid from the chamber 1455 using the chamber inflation member 1415., 100380=[0124] In operation, FIGS. 47 and 48 illustrate the method of using the multiple treatment zone catheter 2700 within the tissue 1600. Treatment sites 1610 are selected and the catheter 2700 is positioned to line up the thermally transmissive regions 2400 with the selected sites 1610. Often, the treatment sites 1610 are not smooth (as shown in FIG. 47). Once the outer members 2445 are expanded against the sites 1610, the sites 1610 are smoothed (as shown in FIG. 48) and made more amenable to treatment. Each fluid transport member 2410 is moved into position adjacent to the thermally transmissive regions 2400. A thermally energetic fluid is then circulated within the fluid transport members 2410 for an amount of time selected to perform a medical procedure such as ablation, etc. The fluid transport members 2410 may be repositioned without moving the rest of the catheter 2700 to perform further treatments. The outer members 2445 are then deflated and the catheter 2700 is repositioned or removed depending on the procedure., 101577=[0125] Now referring to FIGS. 49 and 50, a catheter 1450 having a single treatment region is shown in operation. Again, in a similar manner as discussed above, the catheter 1450 is inserted in the tissue 1600. The uneven surface of the tissue 1600 is smoothed and stretched by expanding the outer member 1620 against the tissue 1600. The fluid transport member 1410 is moved towards the treatment site 1610 and thermal energy is transferred to the tissue 1600 proximal to the treatment site 1610. As discussed above with respect to the multiple treatment zone catheter 2700, the catheter 1450 is removed or repositioned or the fluid transport member 1410 is repositioned for further treatments., 104533=[0128] Referring now to FIG. 52, a catheter 1900 is illustrated as comprising a body 1905, a thermally transmissive region 1915 and a movable fluid transport member 1910. This embodiment is similar to the catheter shown in FIG. 44, however, the catheter 1900 utilizes a constant diameter thermally transmissive region 1915 instead of an inflatable region as shown in FIG. 44. Because the thermally transmissive region 1915 does not inflate, the thermally transmissive region 1915 must be placed in proximity to the selected tissue to begin the process. After positioning the thermally transmissive region 1915 in proximity to the selected tissue, the fluid transport member 1910 is moved proximally to the thermally transmissive region 1915 and thermal energy is applied to the target tissue (not shown) to perform the treatment., 105483=[0129] Another embodiment of a catheter, shown generally as 1965 in FIG. 53, comprises a body 1960, a thermally transmissive region 1955 and a rotatable fluid member 1950. Once the thermally transmissive region 1955 is proximally positioned in a selected tissue (not shown), the fluid transport member 1950 is rotated to align the portion of fluid transport member 1950 adjacent to the interior surface of the thermally transmissive region 1955 with the selected treatment site (not shown). A thermally active fluid is circulated within the fluid transport member 1950 for a medically effective period of time based on the desired procedure. After the required transfer of thermal energy to the selected site, the fluid transport member 1950 may be rotated to a new position and the process repeated or the catheter 1965 may be removed., 103622=[0127] In another embodiment, the catheter 1805 may include a rotatable fluid transport member 1830. In the rotatable embodiment, the sliding contact 1840 is also able to rotate around the support slide either in tandem with or independently of the support cap 1815. This embodiment allows treatment to occur anywhere within the circumference of the thermally transmissive region 1810 without repositioning the entire catheter 1805. Additionally, linear treatment patterns are selected by rotating both the support cap 1815 and the sliding contact 1830 in tandem, and curved treatment patterns are selected by holding either the sliding contact 1840 or the support cap 1815 stationary while rotating the other or by counter rotating the sliding contact 1840 and the support cap 1815., 108564=[0133] A typical fluid transport member 1500 is illustrated in FIG. 45. As shown and discussed with reference to FIGS. 25-39, the fluid transport member, shown generally as 1410, allows an energetic fluid 1530 to be circulated within an outer wall 1502. A conduit 1500 injects the fluid 1530 into the space formed between the wall 1502 and the conduit 1500. A series of holes 1510 or a conduit end opening 1520 or a combination of both may be used to direct the fluid 1530 within the fluid transport member 1410. The conduit may be flexible or rigid depending on the required use. The wall 1502 is also flexible or rigid to complement the conduit 1500 and required use. Other embodiments of the fluid transport member 1410 include a solid thermally transmissive conduit 1500 where the energetic fluid transfer of energy takes place before reaching the end of the fluid transport member 1410. In an alternative embodiment, the entire end of the transport member 1410 is a thermally transmissive solid which is thermally activated prior to reaching the end and the energy is transmitted along the fluid transport member 1410 without actually circulating the fluid 1530 at the end therein., 102406=[0126] Referring now to FIG. 51, an embodiment of a sliding treatment catheter 1805 is shown as comprising a body 1800, a thermally transmissive region 1810, a fluid transport member 1830, a support slide 1820, a support cap 1815, and a sliding contact 1840. The fluid transport member 1830 is deformable and moves towards or away from the thermally transmission region 1810 when the sliding contact 1840 is moved. A wire 1845 is used to move sliding contact 1840 (or any other means of applying a linear force to the sliding contact 1840). A chamber 1855 may be formed between the thermally transmissive region 1810 and the fluid transport member 1830. The chamber 1855 is filled with an insulative bio-compatible fluid to isolate non-selected tissue from the thermal energy contained within the fluid transport member 1830. Sensors such as thermocouples and ECG electrodes (not shown) may be located within the chamber or on the surface of the thermally transmissive region 1810 or body 1800 to provide information to an operator.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by [0134] A variety of modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Specifically, although many embodiments are illustrated being slender and flexible, other embodiments may be thick and rigid, and introduced into the body directly through incisions or through structures such as trocars. The opening and closing of the catheter openings may also be controlled by using nanotechnology and miniaturized valving. Furthermore, although some of the illustrated devices are particularly well suited for cardiac procedures, the same embodiments and others are equally suited to other organs and/or any body portion that would benefit from the application of thermal energy. For example, the illustrated devices may be used for treating arteries for restenosis or portions of the GI tract to stop bleeding or portions of the GU tract to treat spasm, inflammation, obstruction or malignancy. Thus, the devices as shown are not to be limited to catheters but should be viewed more broadly as cryogenic structures or portions thereof. It is therefore understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described hereinabove. All references cited herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. [0133] A typical fluid transport member 1500 is illustrated in FIG. 45.
