    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55491=In vitro release studies were performed with these microparticles in a buffer medium under physiological conditions. Approximately 20 mg of microparticles were placed in 50 mL test tubes. 30 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution was added to the test tubes. The test tubes were placed in a constant temperature water bath, and kept at 37\ufffd C. for the duration of the test. To determine drug release from the microparticles at each time point, 5 mL of buffer was removed and filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. The amount of drug released was determined by HPLC measurements on an HP1100 instrument against risperidone standards., 64921=Drug content in 3 mg samples of microspheres was measured dissolving the microspheres in 10 mL hexane and analyzing the solutions on an HP 1100 HPLC against rapamycin standards. Drug content was determined to be 5.0\ufffd0.5 percent. Due to the very low aqueous solubility of rapamycin, in vitro release studies were performed with these microparticles in a 25/75 ethanol/water elution medium. Approximately 3 mg of microparticles were placed in 50 mL test tubes. 30 mL of elution solution was added to the test tubes. This volume of solution was sufficient to dissolve 100 times the mass of drug loaded into each tube. The test tubes were placed in a constant temperature water bath, and kept at 37\ufffd C. for the duration of the test. To determine drug release from the microparticles at each time point, 1.5 mL of eluting solution was removed and filtered through a 0.2 mm filter. The amount of drug released was determined by HPLC measurements on an HP1100 instrument against rapamycin standards. Measurements were performed in duplicate. Averaged results over a 7 day period are tabulated below. An equivalent (to what was in the drug loaded microspheres) mass of free rapamycin added to this elution medium completely dissolves in less than 24 hours., 38151=In a further embodiment of the present invention the polymeric waxes and blends thereof can be used in tissue engineering applications, e.g. as supports for cells. Appropriate tissue scaffolding structures are known in the art, such as the prosthetic articular cartilage described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,311, the porous biodegradable scaffolding described in WO 94/25079, and the prevascularized implants described in WO 93/08850 (all hereby incorporated by reference herein). Methods of seeding and/or culturing cells in tissue scaffoldings are also known in the art such as those methods disclosed in EPO 422 209 B1, WO 88/03785, WO 90/12604 and WO 95/33821 (all hereby incorporated by reference herein)., 53148=DSC measurements found a melt temperature of 52.41\ufffd C., and a specific heat of 76.14 J/gm. GPC measurement determined a number average molecular weight of 2100, and a weight average molecular weight of 8800. The 1H NMR showed the following peaks: \u03b4 0.86 triplet (3H), 1.26 multiplet (28H), 1.61 multiplet (4H), 1.95 multiplet (2H), 2.32 multiplet (2H), 2.45 multiplet (4H), 4.16 multiplet (2H), 4.34 multiplet (1H), 5.28 multiplet (2H)., 46221=In the examples below, the synthesized polymeric waxes were characterized via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. DSC measurements were performed on a 2920 Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter from TA Instruments using aluminum sample pans and sample weights of 5-10 mg. Samples were heated from room temperature to 100\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./minute; quenched to \u221240\ufffd C. at 30\ufffd C./minute followed by heating to 100\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./minute. For GPC, a Waters System with Millennium 32 Software and a 410 Refractive Index Detector were used. Molecular weights were determined relative to polystyrene standards using THF as the solvent. Proton NMR was obtained in deuterated chloroform on a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer using Varian software., 17192=A This application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/896,004, filed on Jun. 29, 2001., 59548=Films were prepared by melt compression of the drug/polymer blend using a Carver laboratory press (Model # 2696Fred S. Carver Inc., Menomonee Falls, Wis.). A 4\u2033\ufffd4\u2033\ufffd0.03\u2033 sheet of poly(tetrafluoroethylene), or PTFE, was placed on the bottom platen of the press. Approximately 2-gms of polymer blend was placed on the PTFE sheet. 250 \u03bcm metal shims were placed around the blend to control the thickness of the polymer blend film. The polymer blend and shims were covered with another 4\u2033\ufffd4\u2033\ufffd0.03\u2033 sheet of PTFE. The platen temperature was raised to 80\ufffd C., which is above the melt temperature of the polymer. The compression pressure was in the range of 1000-2000 psi and the hold time was 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the system was cooled by circulating water around the compression mold., 51974=GPC measurement determined a number average molecular weight of 2000, and a weight average molecular weight of 6000. The 1H NMR showed the following peaks: \u03b4 0.86 triplet (3H), 1.26 multiplet (28H), 1.65 multiplet (6H), 2.35 multiplet (6H), 4.16 multiplet (2H), 4.34 multiplet (1H), 5.28 multiplet (2H).}",
