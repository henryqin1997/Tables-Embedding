In other words, techniques which evaluate the materials but which still enable the materials to be utilized in formation and utilization as sputtering targets. A non-destructive technique which has received recent interest is ultrasonic testing. For instance, ultrasonic testing technologies are described in PCT International Application Number PCT/US99/13066 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,481. General principles of ultrasonic testing technology are also described in a Non-Destructive Testing Handbook (A. S. Birks, R. E. Green, P. McIntire, Non-Destructive Testing Handbook, Ultrasonic Testing, Second Edition, Vol. 7, American Society for Non-Destructive Testing, 1991.)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. Although the invention is described herein for methods of utilizing ultrasonic evaluation of materials, it is to be understood that various aspects of the invention can be utilized with other evaluation methods. For instance, the data analysis procedures can be utilized with other methods in which a sample material and reference are exposed to a common examination method, and wherein results obtained from the sample are compared with results obtained from the reference. The term \u201ccommon examination method\u201d refers to a method which is the same in technique, but not necessarily the same in time or apparatus. It is noted that the flat-bottom-hole equivalent (FBHeq) described above is an exemplary defect equivalent that can be utilized in methods of the present invention, and that other defect equivalents could be utilized in methodology of the present invention. For instance, the inclusions formed in the reference standard of FIG. 12 could be utilized to",
