A Display Control Remote (DCR) control board 78 is also connected to the CPM control board 70 providing operation and diagnostic information on both an alphanumeric and liquid crystal display. Interconnecting the control boards is a shared communication line 80, preferably a shielded coaxial cable or twisted pair similar to that used in a Xerox Ethernet\ufffd Communication System. For a more detailed explanation of an Ethernet\ufffd Communication Ser, reference is made to pending applications U.S. Ser. No. 205,809; U.S. Ser. No. 205,822 and U.S. Ser. No. 205,821, all filed Nov. 10, 1980 and incorporated herein as references.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Explanation: Moves the task identified by $FOUND-- ID from the DEAD state to the QUEUED state, using the priority specified in $PRIORITY-- VALUE. ##SPC1## Outputs: None $FOUND-- ID Task to insert Inputs: $PRIORITY-- VALUE Priority of task to insert Primitive: $P-- STS $INSERT Explanation: Causes the Scheduler to indicate which task is to be given the next slice. Outputs: $CURRENT-- ID Inputs: $CURRENT-- ID Primitive: $P-- STS $SCHEDULE Explanation: Resets the Scheduler so that execution slices are allocated starting with the SYSTEM task and continue with the rest of the QUEUED tasks. Outputs: $CURRENT-- ID Inputs: $SYSTEM-- ID Identifier of $SYSTEM-- TASK Primitive: $P-- MTS $RESET Explanation: Sets up the Scheduler's internal data bases to include required system-related tasks. The system requires three operating system tasks: $SYSTEM-- TASK (priority=X'40'), $LEVEL TASK (priority =X'20'), and BOTTOM task (priority=X'00'). Note that most of the above Primitives will not perform properly with less than two tasks in the QUEUED state, so these three tasks must not be altered with Scheduler Primitives once the system is running. Outputs: None Inputs: None Primitive: $P-- MTS $INITIALIZE Explanation: Modifies the Scheduler's priority associated with the task identified by $CURRENT-- ID to the value contained in $PRIORITY VALUE. Note: If the desired priority is the same as the current priority, this primitive performs a NO-OP. Outputs: None $CURRENT-- ID The task to change priority Inputs: $PRIORITY-- VALUE The new Priority Primitive: $P-- MTS",
