    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the above-described releasable, surgical clamp is merely an illustrative embodiment of the principles of this invention and that other releasable, surgical clamps may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. It is contemplated that the clamping force can be varied depending on the selection of the continuous wire material and the overall length of the clamp. The length of the opposing jaws and retainer can also be varied in combination with the lengths of the resilient arms. As also depicted, the opposing jaws of the releasable clamp can be biased to either an open or a closed position. This bias or load can be translated by the resilient arms depending on whether the resilient assembly exerts a spreading or contracting load on the resilient arms thereof. FIGS. 9 through 12 depict still another embodiment of releasable clamp 10 and applicator 42 in various open and closed positions engaging and clamping vessel 40. In this embodiment, releasable clamp 10 is comprised of a continuous U-shaped flat wire. FIGS. 9 and 10 show respective top and side views of the releasable clamp with push rod 44 and engagement finger 45 inserted in the open space of the closed clamp. In FIG. 11, the engagement finger is used to spread resilient arms 20 and 21 apart when slide pin 46 is extended",
