The P implant for the underlying P region 18 is on the order of 1\ufffd1014 to 1\ufffd1016 dopant atoms per cm-2. The N+ implant for the source and drain is higher in dopant concentration with a lower implant energy level to form the shallower N+ doped regions. The P- doped low barrier contact can be provided under both the source and drain for a simpler fabrication process. The P+ contact 20 is formed after the N+ implant.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. SOI MOSFETs in accordance with the invention improve operating characteristics and speed through use of the low barrier body contact, and the inclusion of non-fully-depleted SOI MOSFETs along with fully-depleted SOI MOSFETs in one SOI integrated circuit can be accommodated using the recessed channel structures along with multiple threshold voltage implants. Further, improved ESD for protection for SOI circuits is readily provided by forming bulk transistors directly in the underlying substrate and through the use of device segmented islands or mesas. In accordance with another feature of the invention, an ESD protection device can be built into the silicon film in thermally isolated segments to increase the ESD current handing capability. FIG. 10 is a plot illustrating a special problem of SOI ESD protection, namely, SOI ESD failure voltage does not increase significantly with increasing protection device width. This prevents the attainment of good ESD protection by simply enlarging the device width of an SOI transistor as is routinely done for bulk IC ESD protection. The problem lies in the filamentary current flow in the ESD devices under the",
