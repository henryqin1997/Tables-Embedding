It will be appreciated that in order to dispense a wide range of product, including relatively hard ice cream, considerable pressure is required to be applied to the container 26. The apparatus can be used at air pressures of the order of 45 p.s.i. giving a pressure on the container of the order of one tonne. By the use of such pressures it has been found that the consistency of the discharged hard ice cream is improved. Instead of the use of a compressor as a source of compressed air, the compressed gas may be supplied from another source such as a compressed gas container. Moreover instead of a refrigerator 40 cooling may be by use of expansion, and hence cooling, of a compressed gas supply, for example a nitrogen supply. The pneumatically operated arrangement described has several notable features. When a product container is being changed and hence the bellows no longer contains compressed air, the charge of compressed air in the bellows at the commencement of discharge of a fresh container is relatively quick. The apparatus may dispense a wide range of product including product containing solids such as fruit and/or nuts. Dispensing of the product may be manual by operation of the lever 35 to",
