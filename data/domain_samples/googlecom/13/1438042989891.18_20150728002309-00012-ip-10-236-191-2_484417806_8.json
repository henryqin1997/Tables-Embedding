Such terminals are well known; see, for example, section 19.1 of the book \"Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics\" by Newman and Sproull, published 1981 by McGraw-Hill. The invention also relates to a method of storing alphanumeric data in such a terminal.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific arrangement described above. The terminal may include further bit planes to permit more than two independent layers to be handled, including an image layer in which non-coded pel data is supplied directly from the host 10. Even given the restriction to six bit planes, by suitable design of the decoder the invention permits these to be flexibly assigned to whatever purpose is currently required. For example, they could be divided into three alphanumeric layers, three two-bit graphics layers, or any combination of these. Alternatively, the four bit planes provided for graphics could be used for image data supplied in non-coded form. These assignments are all made possible by the method of the invention which uses a bit plane similar to the others, rather than a separate and smaller store, for the storage of low resolution color information. Since there are, in this second mode, six bits defining each pel (i.e. mapping to the same pel position on the CRT screen), the six intensity signals on the output lines 40 can be directly defined without the use of a look-up-table, giving the full range of 64 colors. Thus, the output of each serialiser 21 to 26 is applied to a respective input of the gates 43. Since these gates 43 are enabled by the mode select signal, the signals from the serializers pass",
