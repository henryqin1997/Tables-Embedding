Using trigonometry, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the solution for X' and Y' can be derived by solving the common altitude leg Y' from the tangent of the two angles as follows:, 62413=In this embodiment, stylus 930 has a uniform (non-coded) reflective band wrapped around its circumference, for example near its base. Reflected light appears as a Gausian distributed wave front, as illustrated in FIG. 11. FIG. 11 illustrates two different diameter styli for both pen stylus 1131 and eraser stylus 1132, and their corresponding Gausian beam widths 1151 and 1152, to illustrate the operation of a stylus diameter measurement component of the data capture system of FIGS. 8 and 9. As will be appreciated, the width of the wave front (I 151 or 1152) depends upon the diameter of the stylus reflector. By knowing the coordinate position of the reflecting stylus and its beam width, the embedded microprocessor can calculate the diameter of the stylus. Because the beam width can decrease as the stylus moves further away from the IAD sensors, both the coordinate position and the beam width are used in calculating the representative diameter. Knowing the representative diameter instead of embedded bar codes on the stylus, the processor can then assign meaningful characteristics to the stylus such as color or function.}",
