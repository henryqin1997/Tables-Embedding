FIG. 5 shows the amplitude distribution of the reflection coefficient. In this case, the function of the mirror is given by the following equation: ##EQU6## with: ##EQU7## x and v are the coordinates of the current point of the mirror in the rectangular system of axes Oxy, \u039412 is the distance between the plates 1 and 2, \u039422A is the distance between the plates 2 and 2A, \u03b1x and \u03b1y are the local angles of inclination of the plate 2 relative to the plate 1, \u03b2x and \u03b2y are the angles of inclination of the plate 2A relative to the plate 1. The three plates 1, 2 and 2A are rectangular in shape. The plate 1 may be displaced parallel to the axis X--X (arrows 7) and the plates 2 and 2A may be deformed (for example by fluid pressure) to assume cylindrical shapes (shown in dashed line). The generatrices of the cylindrical shapes of the two plates 2 and 2A are orthogonal. FIG. 4 is a schematic showing an embodiment of the mirror of the invention with three partially or highly reflecting plates 1, 2 and 2A. From the foregoing it will be understood that using the FIG. 1 mirror with two rectangular plates fixed along two opposite edges, and therefore of",
