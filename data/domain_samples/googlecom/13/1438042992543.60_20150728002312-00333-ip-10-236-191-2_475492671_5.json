    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations At the clip 135b moves forward, its legs encounter the flared groove portion 202 in the inner clip crimping surfaces of the jaws. The grooves guide the feeder and clip into the center of the jaws aligned with the jaw angle. The clip moves the clip stop end portion 198 of the pawl member 192 out of the way and the instrument has returned to the position shown in FIG. 11. The post 50 on ratchet yoke 44 has moved out of the cut out 96 into the slot 92 when the instrument is in the state shown in FIG. 13. The ring handles have been squeezed as far as they can be. Now as the ring handles are released, the compression spring 83 forces the driver link 62 distally. The biasing spring 127 pulls the jaw member 107 distally with the driver link and, through the slot 220 and tab 153, the jaw member pulls the cartridge forward as well. Hence, initially all elements move together until the rear 111 of slot 110 in the jaw member encounters the tab 120 in the closure member then the cartridge and jaw member stop moving. At this point, the instrument has returned to the state shown in FIG. 12 but without a clip present between the jaws. The driver link 62 will continue to move until the tab 210 hits the distal portion of slot 212 in",
