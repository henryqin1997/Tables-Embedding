    "textAfterTable": "Flexible Plan You're billed monthly for each user account. You can add and remove accounts at any time and pay only for the accounts you use during that month. You can cancel service at any time without penalty. Recommended for: Small organizations with a variable size workforce. Annual Plan You're billed monthly at a discounted rate. To earn the discount, you commit to paying a full year's subscription for your team or company. If your team grows, you can purchase more licenses and your monthly rate goes up. You can reduce licenses or monthly payments only when renewing your plan at the end of the year. If you cancel your subscription before the year is up, you still pay for the full year. Recommended for: Organizations with a constant or growing workforce. The Annual Plan isn't available when purchasing Google Apps Unlimited online. For more plan options, Apps Unlimited customers can contact a Google Sales representative or local reseller. Questions What are rates in other currencies?
