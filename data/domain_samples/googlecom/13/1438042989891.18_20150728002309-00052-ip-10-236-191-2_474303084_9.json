    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{61742=The rope 20 of adhesive composition may be cut or sheared to any desired length to provide slugs 10, each having ends 13 and 15 as shown in FIG. 1. This cutting may occur away from or at the construction site, so as to form slugs 10 of different lengths corresponding to varying depths of boreholes. Referring to FIG. 5, for instance, rope 20 may be inserted into borehole 32 in structure 30 as far as possible, and then cut or sheared at the entrance of the borehole leaving a slug 10 whose length substantially corresponds to the depth of the borehole. Alternatively, a precut slug 10 may be inserted into the borehole. A driving tool (not shown) is then used to drive an anchor pin 34 into the borehole 32. A typical anchor pin 34 may be threaded, and may have a flat or pointed forward end 35. A typical driving tool uses rapid rotational motion to spin the anchor pin into the borehole. The driving tool may operate at about 500-3000 rpm, suitably about 1000-2500 rpm, desirably about 1400-2000 rpm. Some driving tools employ a combination of hammering (axial motion) and rotational motion. In one embodiment, a slug 10 may be physically attached to the end of a driving tool, and inserted into the borehole during use of the driving tool., 71074=Suitable amine compounds include amines, aliphatic amines, aminoethylpiperazine, amido amines, cycloaliphatic amines, and the like. Preferred aliphatic amines include Mannich bases. One suitable Mannich base is sold by Air Products Co. under the name ANCAMINE\ufffd1856. Other suitable aliphatic amines include ANCAMINE\ufffd1767 and ANCAMINE\ufffd1768.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the embodiments of the invention described herein are presently preferred, various modifications and improvements can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims, and all changes that fall within the meaning and range of equivalents are intended to be embraced therein. In one embodiment, the adhesive rope 20 can be cut or sheared to produce an individual slug 10 corresponding to the depth of the borehole 32, before or after the slug is inserted into the borehole. The cutting or shearing can be accomplished using a putty knife or other suitable instrument. Then, to facilitate self-retention of the adhesive slug 10 in the borehole, the putty knife or other instrument can be used to smear the exposed end of the slug 10 against the inner wall of the borehole. The adhesive action of the slug 10 in contact with the wall of the borehole, coupled with some penetration into the wall, helps maintain the slug 10 in its desired position in the borehole prior to driving an anchor pin. To manufacture the adhesive rope 20, the ingredients of the first part 12 can be mixed in a first mixer, and the ingredients of the second part 14 can be mixed in a second mixer. The separate mixers can be drum tumblers, sigma blade mixers, planetary mixers, extrusion mixers, press mixers,",
