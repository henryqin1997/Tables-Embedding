    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{63348=The contact elements between the semiconductor and the paired electronic device to which it is mated may take many forms. One preferred form is the composite resilient contact discussed above, with a soft core and a hard, resilient shell. Another preferred form is a resilient contact made in some other manner. A useful such contact is described in co-pending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/852,152, entitled \u201cMicroelectronic Spring Contact Element\u201d, filed May 6, 1997, inventors Eldridge, Khandros, Mathieu and Pedersen. The corresponding PCT application was published Nov. 20, 1997 as WO 97/43654. The contact elements need not be resilient, either. For example, solder columns could be used for this connection. See, for example, FIG. 8 of the Parent application and associated discussion., 32661=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/114,589, filed Jul. 13, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,330,164., 43082=The position of the base of a resilient contact element on a semiconductor device can be varied with significant freedom. Referring to co-pending, commonly assigned priority application Ser. No. 08/955,001, filed Oct. 20, 1997, entitled \u201cElectronic Component With Terminals And Spring Contact Elements Extending From Areas Which Are Remote From The Terminals,\u201d a product is described for creating a resilient contact base at some distance from the original semiconductor terminal, and creating a resilient contact at that remote location. That application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Of course, a resilient contact can be fabricated just at the terminal as well., 74547=Connecting material 97 may suitably be an elastomeric material such as silicone rubber. Carrier 92 may suitably be a multilayer ceramic substrate, with terminals on opposing faces connected by interconnecting circuitry or routing material 96. A detailed discussion of useful carriers and connection methods may be found in co-pending, commonly assigned patent application Ser. No. 08/602,179, filed Feb. 15, 1996, entitled \u201cMethods of Mounting Spring Contacts to Semiconductor Devices,\u201d also published as WO97/16866 on May 9, 1997., 37604=Recent advances in chip packaging now permit a semiconductor die to be positioned a short distance away from the corresponding PC board, module, or other connection device. In particular, the use of small spring structures such as MicroSpring\u2122 contact structures using FormFactor technology, positions the IC on the order of 20 mils (500 microns or 0.5 mm) above the PC board. Construction of suitable devices is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/340,144, filed Nov. 15, 1994, entitled \u201cContact Structure for Interconnections, Interposer, Semiconductor Assembly\u201d, inventors Igor Y. Khandros and Gaetan L. Mathieu, (hereinafter the \u201cParent\u201d case). That application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The corresponding PCT application was published May 26, 1995 as WO 95/14314., 58283=The resilient contacts as described above can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes. In a preferred form, the contact extends from the surface of the semiconductor (or other substrate) some 35-40 mils (875-1000 microns=0.88-1 mm). Capacitors are commercially available from Novacap (Valencia, Calif.) that are 50\ufffd80\ufffd20 mils, 29 nanofarads. Other useful capacitors can be as small as 20\ufffd40\ufffd20 mils (e.g. a 10 nf capacitor from AVX Olean Advanced Products Division, 1002 Seneca Avenue, Olean, N.Y. 14760). This is a useful amount of capacitance if the capacitor can be positioned quite close to the active circuit. The 20 mil height means that the capacitor can easily fit within the height of the resilient contacts., 104467=FIG. 20 shows another example of an interconnect assembly. This interconnect assembly 1401 includes two stop structures 1404 and 1405, each of which contain circuit elements which are coupled to electrical circuit elements in the substrate 1402. The substrate 1402 also includes a post or other contact element 1403A which is coupled mechanically and electrically to a resilient contact element 1403., 64896=The semiconductor device need not mate directly with a conventional PC board. It is particularly advantageous to provide a socketing mechanism where resilient contacts are bonded to an appropriate substrate, which is then mounted so a semiconductor can be securely positioned in contact with the resilient contacts. Such a socket is described in detail in a co-pending, commonly assigned patent application, filed Jun. 30, 1998, which is a divisional/continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/533,584, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,451. This U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,451 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The corresponding PCT application was published May 23, 1996 as WO 96/15551. The socket can be secured to a PC board or other support by means of solder balls or other appropriate connection elements. FIG. 5 is taken directly from that application where it was FIG. 3., 38442=In the Parent case, FIG. 32 illustrates a capacitor positioned between a semiconductor device and a support PC board. An alternative description of making spring members can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/526,246, filed Sep. 21, 1995, entitled \u201cComposite Interconnection Elements for Microelectronic Components and Methods of Making Same\u201d, commonly assigned with the present application. The corresponding PCT application was published May 30, 1996 as WO 96/16440. These disclosures detail bonding a flexible material to an electronic component such as a semiconductor device, forming it into a springable shape, then coating it with a hard material to form a resilient, free-standing electrical contact structure. Such resilient contacts preferably extend some 20 to 40 mils from the surface of a semiconductor wafer. The resilient contact can be connected to terminals on a second electronic component such as a PC board in a variety of ways, such as by soldering., 104936=The stop structure 1404 includes a ground shield 1411 which is coupled to a ground bus or other circuit in the substrate 1402. As used herein, the term circuit element includes a ground shield or plane. Thus, a stop structure may include a ground shield in accordance with the present invention as shown in FIG. 20. The stop structure 1414 also includes a capacitor having conductive plates 1413 and 1415 which are coupled electrically to at least one circuit element in the substrate 1402., 100950=FIG. 19 shows an example of an interconnect assembly 1301 which includes a stop structure 1310 that houses a circuit element, in this case a capacitor, which is coupled to circuitry in the integrated circuit of the substrate 1302. The stop structure 1310 is designed to define the minimum vertical separation between the substrate 1302 and the substrate 1303 when the resilient contact elements 1304 and 1305 are brought into mechanical and electrical contact with their corresponding contact elements 1306 and 1307 in the substrate 1302. The contact elements 1307 and 1306 are contained within an insulating material 1308 which may be a conventional dielectric material used in fabricating integrated circuits. It will be appreciated that the interconnection to various other circuit elements within the integrated circuit in the substrate 1302 is not shown in FIG. 19, which is a cross-sectional view through the stop structure 1310 and the substrate 1302. The stop structure 1310 is a multilayer structure including several dielectric layers and several conductive layers which may be metal layers. In the example shown in FIG. 19, metal (or other conductive) layers 1314 and 1318 are separated by an insulating layer 1316 to form a capacitor. The metal layers 1314 and 1318 as well as the insulating layers 1316 and 1322 are encapsulated within an insulating layer 1312. The stop structure 1310 itself may resemble a post or cylinder or other shapes (e.g. rectangular, arbitrary pattern, zig-zag of connected rectangle, etc.) along the surface of the substrate structure which is completely covered by the encapsulating insulating layer 1312. This insulating layer may be a polyimide material or silicon dioxide or other insulator. The metal layer 1318 is coupled electrically in one embodiment by a solder ball 1321 to a post or other contact element 1320 in the substrate 1302. The metal layer 1314 is coupled by a post structure 1314A which extends into the substrate 1302. In this manner, the capacitor in the stop structure 1310 is coupled electrically to a circuit element in the substrate 1302. It will be appreciated that there will be a number of well known techniques which may be employed in fabricating the stop structure 1310 to include an electrical element, such as the capacitor. In one example, the post structures 1314A and 1320 may be formed in the substrate 1302. Then a dielectric layer 1322 may be formed and patterned to allow an opening for the solder balls, such as the solder ball 1321. Alternatively, a metal layer 1318 may be sputtered upon the entire surface, filling the opening in the insulating layer 1322. Then the metal layer 1318 is patterned in the form shown in FIG. 19, and another insulating layer is deposited over the metal layer 1318. This insulating layer is then patterned to create an insulating layer 1316 and then another metal layer is deposited upon the surface and patterned to create the metal layer 1314. Finally, an insulating layer or other passivating layer is applied and patterned to create the insulating layer 1312 in order to complete the formation of the stop structure 1310., 105502=The stop structure 1405 also includes a ground shield 1421 coupled electrically to a ground circuit in the substrate 1402. The stop structure 1405 also includes a capacitor formed by the conducting plates 1427 and 1429 which are electrically coupled to at least one circuit element in the substrate 1402. In addition, the stop structure 1405 includes conductive elements 1423 and 1425 which provide reference voltages, such as Vss and Vdd which may be bussed through the stop structure to electrical components in the stop structure or to electrical components outside of the stop structure.}",
