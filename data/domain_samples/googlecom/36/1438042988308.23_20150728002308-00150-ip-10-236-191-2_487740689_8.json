No. 4,953,305, issued on Aug. 4, 1990, entitled VEHICLE COMPASS WITH AUTOMATIC CONTINUOUS CALIBRATION, assigned to the present assignee and incorporated herein by reference. Interface circuit 44 preferably is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) essentially incorporating the individual circuits of the prior interfacing circuitry in a conventional manner to reduce the cost of the compass system. Circuit 44 converts the analog electrical signals supplied by sensing windings 60 and 62 to 8-bit digital signals (count values). These digital signals represent the magnetic field strength, in milligauss, detected by sensing windings 60 and 62 representing the two channels of compass information. In the preferred embodiment, each count of these count values represents five milligauss of magnetism. The digital signals are supplied to microprocessor 42 over serial communication line 45.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above description is considered that of the preferred embodiments only. Modifications of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art and to those who make or use the invention. Therefore, it is understood that the embodiments shown in the drawings and described above are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of protection of the invention, which is defined by the following claims as interpreted according to the principles of patent law. Shown in FIG. 19 is an alternate embodiment of the compass system of the present invention in which GPS receiver 47 is replaced by a conventional RF transmitter/receiver or communication circuit 47' which is capable of communication with remote communication stations 75. Remote land-based stations 75 are located in each of the different variation zones, and are positioned such that the remote station closest to the vehicle is in the same variation zone as the vehicle. In this embodiment, the operator of the vehicle can request information relating to variation correction by operating one of buttons or actuators 38 of console 12 (FIG. 5). Normally, such a request would be made when the geographic area of operation of the vehicle is undergoing charge due to extensive travel. By pressing the appropriate button 38, a request signal is transmitted by transmitter/receiver 47' which is received by the remote station 75 closest to the current location of the vehicle.",
