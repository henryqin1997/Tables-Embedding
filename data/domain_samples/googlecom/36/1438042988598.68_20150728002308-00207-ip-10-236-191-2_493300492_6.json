    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{43065=When a pacemaker is first implanted in a patient, or thereafter, the value of the AV interval is set by an attending physician or cardiologist to a value that is selected to optimally assist the patient's heart as it performs its critical function of a pump. For many patients, such AV interval value is a value that is somewhat longer than the natural conduction time of the heart, thereby affording the patient's heart as long a time period as possible before stepping in with the pacemaker generated stimulation pulse (V-pulse). Such action further serves to lengthen the battery life of the pacemaker, because it reduces the number of stimulation pulses that the pacemaker generates, and thereby conserves the limited energy available in the pacemaker battery. However, for other patients, it may be desirable to set the AV interval value at a value that is less than the natural conduction time of the heart, thereby assuring that a V-pulse is generated with most every cardiac cycle. Such patients typically suffer from a cardiomyopathy condition, and the repeated stimulus improves the ability of the ventricular tissue to produce an effective contraction. See Applicant's copending application entitled IMPLANTABLE PACEMAKER HAVING ADAPTIVE AV INTERVAL FOR PROVIDING VENTRICULAR PACING, Ser. No. 07/975,747, filed Nov. 13, 1992, which application is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims. As also described above, it is seen that the invention provides an automatic AV interval adjustment procedure that is automatically invoked when needed, and that can be automatically suspended if invoked too often. The invention also provides, as seen from the above description, an AV interval adjustment sequence, or technique, that quickly and automatically searches for the desired AV interval value--a value that is just less than or just greater than the natural condition time interval--and attaches a prescribed margin thereto, thereby assuring that the desired AV interval value is maintained while avoiding fusion. Additionally, it is seen that the prescribed margin may be adaptively changed, as required, in order to minimize the frequency at which the adjustment technique is invoked. As further described above, it is seen that the invention provides such adjustment of the AV interval while avoiding fusion, i.e., the issuing of a V-pulse on top of an R-wave. As described above, it is thus seen that the present invention provides an implantable pacemaker that automatically adjusts its AV interval to a value that is just less than, or just greater than, the natural conduction time of a patient's heart.",
