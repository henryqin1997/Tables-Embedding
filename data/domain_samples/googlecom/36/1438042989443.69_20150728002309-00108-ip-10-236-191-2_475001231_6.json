Accordingly, the present invention extends to all embodiments of the invention which fall within the broad scope and spirit of the invention as described herein. In use of the device shown in FIG. 8, the device is initially set up in the first position as shown where the sample application pad 84 is in contact with the first end or origin of the chromatographic medium 81. The sample is applied to the application pad 84 and flows up the chromatographic medium into the absorbent pad 82. After an appropriate period of time, the second member is moved to the second position as shown where the conjugate pad 85 is brought into contact with the first end of origin of the chromatographic medium 81. Sample application pad 84 is positioned above the absorbent pad 82 and since the absorbent pad is overlaid with the barrier membrane 83, sample pad 84 is out of liquid contact with the chromatographic medium in this position. Addition of reagent to conjugate pad 85 applies conjugate to the first end or origin",
