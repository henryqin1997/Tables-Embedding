The novel sling 10 is positioned in such a fashion whereby two nerve ends or stumps (24 and 26) are aligned and placed on its body (see FIG. 2). The sling 10 is then wrapped around the nerve ends or stumps (24 and 26) and aligned with tabs [(12, 14) and (16, 18)] in face-to-face engagement. Circumferential fasteners (25 and 27) are then placed over the aligned tabs (12, 14) and (16, 18), respectively to secure the sling 10. The elongate aligned tabs (12, 14) and (16, 18) are then trimmed and the wide central tabs (20, 22) are simultaneously mated for the final sealing process (see FIG. 6). As depicted in FIG. 5, the sling 10 is sealed by surgical clips (30, 32, 34, 36 and 38) to facilitate nerve anastomosis. If desired, the sling 10 can be preimpregnated with nerve growth stimuli such as nerve growth factor prior to the procedure. Furthermore, the sling material enables the anastomosis of nerves that are literally waving in the breeze. The elongate tabs and/or central wide tabs are secured by micro or mini surgical clips.
