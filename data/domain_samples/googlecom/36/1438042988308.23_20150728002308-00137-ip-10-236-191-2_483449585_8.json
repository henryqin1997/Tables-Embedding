In a second group of embodiments, the pre-formed surface is structured so that it is optically active to radiation whose wavelength falls within the range from 350 to 700 nanometers., 41147=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. PCT/GB83/00340, filed 21 Dec. 1983., 44514=The surface structure of the pre-formed surface and in particular the dimensions of the surface relief pattern will be selected according to the nature of the species which is to be assayed. In general, we have found three ranges of surface depth (peak-to-trough measurements) to be advantageous. In the first, the grating or protuberance or each of the gratings or protuberances, in the event several are employed, have a depth in the range 10 to 50 nanometers. In the second, the depth is in the range 50 to 200 nanometers; and in the third, the depth is in the range 200 to 2000 nanometers. With the first of these ranges, the pitch (period) of the each grating(s) or the periodicity of the protuberances is advantageously greater than their depth; the structure thus corresponds, in general, to that of a shallow grating. With the second and third ranges, the pitch (period) of the or each grating or the periodicity of the protuberances is advantageously of the same order as their depth.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Referring next to FIG. 3, an article in accordance with this invention is shown in the condition after it has been contacted by a sample in step (b) of the method of the invention. The article comprises a substrate 10 formed of polymethylmethacrylate which is about 1 millimeter thick. The active (upper) surface of the substrate includes a layer 11 of aluminium of thickness 20 nanometers. This is covered by a passive film 13 of aluminium oxide (thickness one nanometer or less). A monomolecular layer of antigen molecules 12 is covalently bonded to the film 13 of aluminium oxide and is thus immobilised. A layer of antibodies 14 is attached to the antigen layer 12. This layer 14 is also monomolecular and is about ten nanometers thick. Isolated antigens 15 have been bound by the antibodies 14. The substrate 10 with the layers 11, 13, 12 and 14 constitutes one embodiment of the article of this invention. The pre-formed surface is in effect defined by the surface of layer 13; this is in the form of a single grating of depth 50 nanometers and of pitch (period) 250 nanometers. The article is observed, in carrying out the method of the invention, with monochromatic light which is polarised in a plane perpendicular to the lines of the grating; the angle of incidence of the illumination is varied and it is found that there is a sharp reduction",
