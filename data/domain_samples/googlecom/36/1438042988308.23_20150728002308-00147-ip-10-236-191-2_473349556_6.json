Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. Double Draw Bonus Awards-Optionally, the Double Draw Royal Bonus is awarded when the player draws a royal flush on both hands. Cards must be drawn to the royal flush to be awarded the Double Draw Royal Bonus. The award for the Double Draw Royal would be determined by the operator and/or the manufacture. In the case the royal flush is dealt with the first initial five cards, giving both hands a royal flush, and no cards were drawn, the award would be the amount from the pay schedule for royal flush, not the Double Draw Royal Bonus. The Award-Each winning hand is paid according to a pay schedule. The awarded hands coincide with standard video poker games. The pay schedule will vary depending on the desired win percentage by location or manufacture. The game will automatically hold cards for optimum play but the player may change hold or draw cards on either or both hands. This will increase the speed of the game. The Draw-Each hand is its own individual hand. Deck \"A\"",
