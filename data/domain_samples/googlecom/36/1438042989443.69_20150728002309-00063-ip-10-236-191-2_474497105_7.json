    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26474=U.S. Pat. No. 4,862,245 issued Aug. 29, 1989 to Pashby et al. (\"the '245 patent\") illustrates an LOC arrangement on a semiconductor die 30. With reference to FIG. 5 herein, with such an arrangement, a lead frame (periphery not shown) has a plurality of leads 36 which extends over the semiconductor die 30 toward a central or axial line of bond pads 34. A plurality of bond wires 32 make the electrical connection between the inner ends of leads 36 and the bond pads 34. In wirebonding, the bond wires 32 are attached, one at a time, to their respective bond pads 34 on the semiconductor die 30 and extend to a corresponding lead or trace end 36 on a lead frame or printed circuit board (not shown). Bond wires such as wires 32 are generally attached through one of three industry-standard wirebonding techniques: ultrasonic bonding--using a combination of pressure and ultrasonic vibration bursts to form a metallurgical cold weld; thermocompression bonding--using a combination of pressure and elevated temperature to form a weld; and thermosonic bonding--using a combination of pressure, elevated temperature, and ultrasonic vibration bursts. Film-type alpha barriers 38 are provided between the semiconductor die 30 and the leads 36, and are adhered to both, thus eliminating the need for a separate die paddle or other die support aside from the leads 36 themselves., 29754=U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,853 issued Oct. 12, 1993 to Michii (\"the '853 patent\") illustrates an LOC arrangement on a semiconductor die 40 which does not use bond wires. With reference to FIG. 6 herein, in such an arrangement, the leads 42 are extended over the semiconductor die 40 toward centrally located bond pads 44 (shown in shadow). The leads 42 are held in position on the semiconductor die 40 by dielectric tape 46. The leads 42 extend to a position over their respective bond pads 44 wherein the leads 42 are bonded directly to their bond pads 44. Thus, the '853 patent eliminates bond wires and the problem associated therewith.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described in detail preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention defined by the appended claims is not to be limited by particular details set forth in the above description as many apparent variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary semiconductor die assembly 210 of the present invention, as viewed from above to illustrate the manner in which electrical contact points 114a (bond pads) of a die 12 have been rerouted through traces 22 (shown in broken lines under a dielectric) to a more open, widely-pitched array configuration exhibiting relatively larger contact locations 114b for bonding to solder bumps or other conductive elements carried by lead fingers 18, as aligned by loose-tolerance (\ufffd2 mil) alignment equipment. FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary semiconductor die assembly 110 of the present invention, as viewed from above to illustrate the manner in which the lead fingers 18 of an NULLF lead frame have been configured to directly connect to an array of electric contact points 14 (bearing solder bumps or other conductive elements) of a die 12 which have previously been configured for flip-chip, face-down bonding of die 12 to a conventional conductor-carrying substrate such as a printed circuit board of an MCM module. When the semiconductor die assembly 10 is complete, it is preferably substantially completely encapsulated in an encasing material",
