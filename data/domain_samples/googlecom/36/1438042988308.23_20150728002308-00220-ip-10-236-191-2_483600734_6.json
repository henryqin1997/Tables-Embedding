The optimum molecular weight lies between 1500 and 3500 with preference given to polymers with a molecular weight of 2500., 58659=For any particular polymer, the degree of fractionation is dependent not only on the degree of neutralisation and the type of cation but also upon the concentration of the polymer and the choice and amount of the alcohol or other solvent. The alcohol is preferably isopropanol but propanol and other alcohols, especially C2 to C5 alcohols, may be used. The proportion water:alcohol or other solvent by weight is preferably from 1:0.2 to 1:5, most preferably 1:0.5 to 1:2 with best results generally being achieved, especially when the solvent is isopropanol and the cation is sodium, when the proportion is about 1:1. The proportions should be selected such that, having regard to the degree and nature of neutralisation, each of the phases will have a polymer concentration of at least 5%, generally at least 10% and preferably at least 15% by weight of the phase., 28580=According to the invention a dispersion of pigment or other particulate material in an aqueous medium contains a dispersing agent for the particulate material which is a water soluble polymer formed from one or more ethylenically or other unsaturated monomers and contains acid groups selected from carboxyl, sulphuric and sulphonic groups, or is a water soluble salt thereof, and has a polydispersity of below 1.5 and has a low molecular weight. Mw is normally at least about 1,000, preferably at least 1500, and can be up to about 50,000 although it is generally up to 20,000 and preferably it is up to about 5,000 or about 6000. Particularly preferred products are those having PD below 1.4 and Mw 1,000 to 4,000., 40640=It is known to include relatively low molecular weight acidic polymers in detergent compositions in order to sequester, for instance, calcium and to act as what is termed a \"detergent builder\". We have surprisingly found that the low PD polymers of this invention have improved detergent building properties compared to the corresponding polymers of higher PD and so according to a sixth aspect of the invention detergent compositions contain, as detergent builder water soluble polymer formed from one or more ethylenically or other unsaturated monomers and contains acid groups selected from carboxyl, sulphuric and sulphonic groups, or is a water soluble salt thereof, and has a polydispersity of below 1.5 and has a low molecular weight. Mw is normally at least about 1,000, preferably at least 1500, and can be up to about 50,000 although it is generally up to 20,000 and preferably it is up to about 5,000 or about 6000. Particularly preferred products are those having PD below 1.4 and Mw 1,000 to 4,000., 69743=The results show that the most effective sodium polyacrylates for china clay dispersants lie between a molecular weight of 1000-3000. Preference been given to a molecular weight of approximately 2000., 63035=The viscosity of the product at 25% was 12.1 cS (suspended level viscometer, No. 2, 25\ufffd C.). GPC analysis showed Mw=1740, Mn=1321, Polydispersity=1.32., 34896=The preferred molecular weight for the homopolymer is about 3,600 and the preferred molecular weight for the copolymer is about 2,500. The proportions by weight of acrylic acid to AMPS are preferably 99:1 to 50:50., 19974=This application is a continuation-in-part of our application Ser. No. 612,516 filed May 21, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,422., 38948=According to a fifth aspect of the invention a drilling or packer fluid includes, as dispersant, a low molecular weight polymer containing acid groups and having PD below 1.5 and, preferably, the dispersing agent is polyacrylic acid having PD below 1.5 and Mw in the range 1000 to 50,000 and that is such that the polymer is effective as a dispersant or thinner. Mw is generally below 20,000 and preferably below 10,000. Mw 1000 or 1500 to 5000 is generally preferred with best results around 1500 to 4000. The acid groups may all be carboxylic acid groups (e.g. polyacrylic acid) or may include sulphonic acid groups (e.g. acrylic acid--AMPS copolymers).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Drilling muds were formulated of 25 ppb bentonite, 220 ppb barites, 4 ppb gypsum, 2 ppb Ca(OH)2 and the viscosity of the mud after addition of various amounts of polymers was determined. When the polymer was polyacrylic acid Mw about 3000 and PD about 1.6 the minimum viscosity was obtained at a dose of about 1.2 ppb. When the polyacrylic acid was fractionated into fractions each having PD in the range 1.1-1.4, both fractions gave a lower viscosity at a lower dosage, the higher molecular weight fraction giving a low viscosity over a wide range of dosages while the lower molecular weight fraction gives the lowest viscosity. EXAMPLE 12 To compare the effect of PD on the polymers when used as detergent builders in conventional detergent compositions the calcium tolerance of the polymers was determined in a Hampshire Test using a calcium ion selective electrode. In this test the highest possible value is required. When the polymer was polyacrylic acid Mw about 3000 PD about 1.6 the value (in Moles Ca2+ required per mole of polymer) was 0.625 but when the polymer was polyacrylic acid of similar molecular weight but PD 1.18 the value was 0.780. EXAMPLE 11 When the monomer consisted of sodium vinyl sulphonate the initial polymer is in the sodium form and this can be part neutralised by acidic ion exchange resin and then fractionated using isopropanol.
