Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be determined by reference to the following claims. Using the transformed roll, pitch and yaw commands and the fed back variables, autopilot 44 produces roll, pitch, and yaw outputs \u03b4a, \u03b4e, and \u03b4r, respectively. These outputs must now be applied correctly to the fins, depending upon the direction of rotation caused by transformation matrix T, to produce the four fin commands \u03b41 -\u03b44. The appropriate transformation is as follows: ##EQU4## In effect, Equation (6) transforms the fin mixing and the inverse coordinate transformation into a single step. It can be seen that a positive aileron (roll) output \u03b4a will deflect the fins so as to produce a positive rolling moment. A positive elevator (pitch) output \u03b4e will deflect the fins to produce a negative pitching moment in the autopilot pitch plane, no matter how that plane is oriented with respect to the physical missile. Similarly, a positive rudder (yaw) output \u03b4r will deflect the fins to generate a negative yawing moment, conforming to conventional airframe nomenclature. Flight control system 60 includes transformation controller 70 and transformation blocks 71-74. Transformation controller 70 receives the steering command Ac from guidance and navigation system 40, examines the components ac and bc, and computes the transformation matrix T. In the",
