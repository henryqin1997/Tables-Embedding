U.S. application Ser. No. 07/772,217, filed concurrently herewith by G. H. Beall et al. under the title LITHIUM DISILICATE GLASS-CERAMICS SOME OF WHICH ARE SELF-GLAZING, discloses the preparation of glass-ceramic articles wherein lithium disilicate comprises the predominant and, frequently, the sole crystal phase. The glass-ceramics disclosed therein consist essentially, in weight percent, of 8-19% Li2 O, 0-5% Na2 O, 0-7% K2 O, 0-8% Na2 O+K2 O, 0-10% CaO, 0-6% SrO, 0-6% BaO, 2-12% Na2 O+K2 O+CaO+SrO+BaO, 0-7% ZnO, 0-11% Al2 O3, 1.5-11% ZnO+Al2 O3, with a molar ratio (Na2 O+K2 O+CaO+SrO+BaO):(ZnO+Al2 O3) between 0.075-1.25, 65-80% SiO2, and as a nucleating agent 1.5-7 % P2 O5 and/or 0.0001-0.1% Pd. Glass-ceramics which developed surfaces exhibiting high gloss during the crystallization of the precursor glass into a glass-ceramic are prepared from compositions consisting essentially, in weight percent, of 9-18% Li2 O, 0-7% K2 O, 0-8% CaO, 0-6% SrO, and 0-6% BaO, 2-10% K2 O+CaO+SrO+BaO, 0-7% ZnO, 0-10% Al2 O3, 1.5-10% ZnO+Al2 O3, with a molar ratio (K2 O+CaO+SrO+BaO):(ZnO+Al2 O3) between 0.1-0.8, 65-77% SiO2, and as a nucleating agent 2-6% P2 O5. The utility of adding 0.01-7% total of CdS, cadmium sulfoselenide, or a transition metal oxide to impart color to the glass-ceramic articles is also described in that application.

Particles of glass having the base composition of Glass No. 7 to which colorant T was included were prepared in mesh fraction 3A. Particles of glass having the base composition of Glass No. 7 to which colorant U was included were prepared in fraction 4. Those glass particles were scattered atop the molten glass body in the steel mold and that body then introduced into an annealer operating at 600\ufffd C. Thereafter, the glass body was subjected to a heat treatment comprised of heating from R.T. to 980\ufffd C. at 100\ufffd C./hr, maintaining the temperature for two hours, and then cooling at furnace rate. Batch ingredients for Glass No. 7 of Table I were compounded, ballmilled together, and charged into a platinum crucible. The crucible was transferred to a furnace operating at about 1425\ufffd C., the batch was melted for about 4 hours, and thereafter poured into a steel mold.
