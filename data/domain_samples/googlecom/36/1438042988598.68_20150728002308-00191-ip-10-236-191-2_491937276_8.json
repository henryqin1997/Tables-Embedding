    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24809=It has been postulated for at least 40 years, however, that it may be possible to design a nonvolatile, nondestructive read-out (\"NDRO\") memory in which the memory element is a single ferroelectric field effect transistor (\"FET\"), thereby reducing at least some of the complexity of conventional 2T-2C operation. See Shu-Yau Wu, \"A New Ferroelectric Memory Device, Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor Transistor\", in IEEE Transactions On Electron Devices, pp. 499-504, August 1974; S. Y. Wu, \"Memory Retention and Switching Behavior Of Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor Transistors\", in Ferroelectrics, Vol. 11, pp. 379-383, 1976; and J. R. Scott, C. A. Paz De Araujo, and L. D. McMillan, \"Integrated Ferroelectrics\", in Condensed Matter News, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 15-20, 1992. Because the ferroelectric memory effect measured in the early devices of Wu was only a temporary, single state effect rather than a long-lived, two state effect, it is now believed that this effect was charge injection effect rather than an effect due to terroelectric switching., 82617=To make each of the MIS structures 400, a prime grade (100)-oriented p-type silicon wafer 410 having a resistivity of 6-10 \u03a9-cm was cleaned by dipping in a H2 O2 /NH4 OH/H2 O solution (volume ratio 1/1/8) at 70\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. The wafer was rinsed in deionized water, and dried. Then the wafer was dipped in 20:1 buffered HF solution for 20-30 seconds, rinsed in deionized water and dried., 27676=To reduce interface problems, structures have been designed in which an insulating oxide layer, such as CeO2 or Y2 O3, is sputter-deposited on the semiconductor substrate and the gate oxide before depositing the ferroelectric layer and gate. Such an integrated structure is referred to in the art as a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor FET (\"MFIS-FET\"). Recently, a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor FET device (\"MFIS-FET\") has been reported that appears to show true ferroelectric memory behavior. See Tadahiko Hirai et al., \"Formation of Metal/Ferroelectric/Insulator/Semiconductor Structure With A CeO2 Buffer Layer\", in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 33, Part I, No. 9B, pp. 5219-5222, September 1994; Tadahiko Hirai et al., \"Characterization of Metal/Ferroelectric/Insulator/Semiconductor Structure With A CeO2 Buffer Layer\", in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 34, Part I, No. 8A, pp. 4163-4166, August 1995; Tadahiko Hirai et al., \"Crystal and Electrical Characterizations of Epitaxial Cex Zr1-x O2 Buffer Layer for the Metal/Ferroelectric/Insulator/Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor\", in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol.35, Part I, No. 9A, pp.5150-5153, September 1996; Yong Tae Kim et al., \"Memory Window of Pt/SrBi2 Ta2 O9 /CeO2 /SiO2 /Si Structure For Metal Ferroelectric Insulator Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor\", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 71 No. 24, Dec. 15, 1997, pp. 3507-3509; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,374 issued Apr. 28, 1998 to Jong Moon. It is believed that an insulator layer located on the silicon substrate between the substrate and the ferroelectric thin film avoids the problems caused by a ferroelectric-semiconductor interface. Related integrated structures, in which the ferroelectric is structurally integrated with the transistor element, contain the equivalent of a floating gate electrode located between the semiconductor and the ferroelectric, and are sometimes referred to as a metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor (\"MFMIS-FET\") or a metal-ferroelectric-metal-semiconductor (\"MFMS-FET\"), depending on the presence of an insulating layer., 54683=Formula (1) includes all three of the Smolenskii type compounds discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,519,234, issued May 21, 1996 to Araujo et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully incorporated herein. The layered superlattice materials do not include every material that can be fit into formula (1), but only those which spontaneously form themselves into crystalline structures with distinct alternating layers. It has been shown that certain layered superlattice materials possess characteristics well-suited for conventional nonvolatile memory applications, such as high polarizability, high resistance to fatigue, low leakage current, low imprint, and suitable coercive voltage values., 83074=An EMOD method according to the invention was used to deposit a ZrO2 insulator layer 436 on silicon substrate 412. A 0.2M n-octane based solution of zirconium 2-ethylhexanoate was diluted to 0.1M by adding n-butyl acetate. A liquid coating of the 0.1M solution was applied using a spin-on technique, with a coater speed of 1500 rpm for 40 seconds. The coating was dried at 160\ufffd C. for one minute, then at 260\ufffd C. for four minutes. The spin-coating and drying steps were repeated twice, for a total of three coats. The solid coating was then furnace-annealed for 60 minutes at 800\ufffd C. in oxygen flowing at 5 l/m, with 10 minutes \"push\" and 10 minutes \"pull\". Measurements using Auger electron spectroscopy (\"AES\") and transmission electron microscopy (\"TEM\") indicated that the ZrO2 -layer 436 had a thickness of about 13 nm. As a result of the fabrication steps, oxide layer 434 of SiO2 having a thickness of 7 nm was formed by oxidation of silicon substrate 412., 23918=It has been known since at least the 1950's that if a practical ferroelectric memory could be made, it would provide a fast, dense, non-volatile memory that could be operated at relatively low voltages. See Orlando Auciello et al., \"The Physics of Ferroelectric Memories\", Physics Today, July 1998, pp. 22-27. The principal type of ferroelectric memory being explored today is the non-volatile ferroelectric random access memory or NVFRAM. Ibid. A disadvantage of the NVFRAM is that, in the process of reading it, the information it holds is destroyed and, therefore, the read function must be followed by a rewrite function. Destructive reading followed by rewriting generally requires operating a memory with two transistors and two capacitors (\"2T-2C\"), which reduces overall circuit density and efficiency, as well as increase manufacturing costs., 80291=The final precursor solution was applied onto the substrate using a spin-on technique. As indicated in Table 1, two liquid coatings were applied to most samples; however, three liquid coatings were applied to one set of samples. Just prior to use, the final liquid precursor was diluted to 0.1 molar concentration by adding n-butyl acetate. A first spincoat of 0.1 molar solution of the strontium bismuth tantalum niobate precursor was deposited on bottom electrode 318 at 1100 rpm for 40 seconds. This was dried for one minute at 160\ufffd C., and at 260\ufffd C. for four minutes. The first spincoat annealed at 800\ufffd C. for 10 minutes with an oxygen flowrate of 5 liters/minute, with 10 minutes \"push\" and 10 minutes \"pull\". This sequence of the spin-coating and drying was repeated for a second spincoat. After drying the second spin-coat of the two-coat samples, the wafer was annealed at 800\ufffd C. for 60 minutes with an oxygen flowrate of 5 liters/minute, with 10 minutes \"push\" and 10 minutes \"pull\". With the three-coat samples, the wafer was annealed for only 10 minutes after the second coat; then the sequence of spin coating and drying was repeated for a third time, and finally the wafer was annealed at 800\ufffd C. for 60 minutes. Platinum was sputter-deposited to make top electrode layer 322 with 200 nm thickness. The platinum and strontium bismuth tantalum niobate layers were ion-milled to form the capacitors, and then ashing was performed, followed by a second O2 anneal for 30 minutes at 800\ufffd C. The capacitors were patterned variously so that each composition of ferroelectric included a series of MFM capacitors with surface areas, AMFM, of 4301, 6940, 10207, 16286, 29559 and 46759 square microns., 67053=In substrate preparation steps 202, wafer 20 is cleaned to remove contaminants, preferably by dipping the wafer into H2 SO4 for 30 minutes. Then in step 204, the wafer is dipped into 10:1 buffered HF solution for five minutes, which removes any natural oxide that may have formed on the wafer. A field oxide 24 is grown in a furnace using conventional techniques, preferably to a thickness of 500 nanometers (nm). In step 208, source/drain regions 26 and 28 and channel region 30 of FET 12 are then formed by a conventional patterning and doping methods. This includes the usual photo resist, etching and strip steps for removal of the field oxide followed preferably by a phosphorous diffusion step. Preferably, the doping of channel region 30 is in the range of 2\ufffd1015 to 1017 atoms/cm3, and most preferably in the range of 1016 to 1017 atoms/cm3, which provides a resistance of about 1 ohm to 5 ohms. Preferably, the doping of the source/drain regions is in the range of 1019 to 1020 atoms/cm3., 51880=U.S. Pat. No. 5,519,234, issued May 21, 1996 to Araujo et al., incorporated herein by reference, discloses that layered superlattice compounds, such as strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT), have excellent properties in ferroelectric applications as compared to the best prior art materials and have high dielectric constants and low leakage currents., 84130=A platinum layer with a thickness of about 200 nm was sputter deposited on ZrO2 insulator layer 436. Then the platinum layer was ion-milled to form electrodes 438, followed by a furnace-anneal in oxygen for 30 minutes at 800\ufffd C. After that, the top of the wafer was covered with photoresist while the back side of the wafer was cleaned in a 20:1 buffered HF solution for about two minutes and rinsed in deionized water. Aluminum layer 440 having a thickness of 600 nm was sputter deposited onto the back of wafer 410 using a DC sputtering tool. After removal of the photoresist, the wafer was then furnace-annealed in nitrogen for 30 minutes at 450\ufffd C. The MIS capacitors had surface areas, AMIS, of 4301, 6940, 10207, 16286, 29559 and 46759 square microns.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations There has been described a novel MFM-MIS FET memory device and a method for fabricating such a ferroelectric NDRO memory device in an integrated circuit. The MFM capacitor is separated by an interlayer dielectric layer from the FET and the semiconductor substrate. This provides flexibility in the design and manufacture of the size areas and capacitance of the MFM and MIS capacitors. The analysis of the measurements on the examples presented herein show that the hysteresis memory window in an embodiment of the invention can be increased by decreasing the capacitance ratio, CMFM /CMIS and that the capacitance ratio can be influenced by changing the area ratio, AMFM /AMIS, the composition of the ferroelectric and insulating materials, and the thicknesses of the ferroelectric and insulating thin films. It should be understood that the particular embodiments shown in the drawings and described within this specification are for purposes of example and should not be construed to limit the invention, which will be described in the claims below. For example, the invention contemplates that the insulator may comprise a wide range of materials that can be deposited using an EMOD technique. Similarly, the ferroelectric thin film in the ferroelectric MFM capacitor of the invention may be made of any ferroelectric material.
