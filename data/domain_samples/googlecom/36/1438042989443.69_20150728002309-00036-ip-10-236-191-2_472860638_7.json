This desideratum clashes with the requirement to avoid collisions which, with IR transceivers is particularly onerous on account of the fact that it is difficult to detect collisions owing to the half-duplex communications protocol inherent in IR transmission. Such a requirement is met by assigning time slots for each of the IR transceivers and using polling techniques, thus allowing the interrogation device to address a portable tag at will by including the portable tag's ID in the data stream transmitted thereby.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the method claims that follow, alphabetic characters used to designate claim steps are provided for convenience only and do not imply any particular order of performing the steps. It will further be appreciated that whilst the communications protocol has been described with particular reference to its implementation in a portable ID badge for tracking movement of a person and allowing short messages to be transmitted thereto, it may equally well be employed in other applications and is clearly not restricted to such a system. Thus the invention provides a very simple communications protocol for use by a portable IR badge allowing a badge to receive data for only a short time following transmission of data by the badge. Owing to the sparse transmission rate when the badge is stationary and the fact that a badge can only be addressed by a reader following transmission by the badge to the reader, the badge can be active continually. This obviates the need for \u201cwake up\u201d circuitry and simplifies the IR receiver in the badge. FIG. 10 is a flow diagram showing the principal operating steps carried out by the reader during bi-directional communication with the badge. Thus, initially, the reader is in \u201creceive mode\u201d and remains so until a message is received. Such a message may be transmitted by a badge or, alternatively, fed to the reader via the network 28 (shown in FIG. 1). In either",
