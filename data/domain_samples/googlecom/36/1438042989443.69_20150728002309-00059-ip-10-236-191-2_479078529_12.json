    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6399=Referring to FIG. 21, there is illustrated a graph of the frequency tuning ranges as a function of the value of N as taken from Table 1. Lines 268 a, 268 b, 268 c and 268 d represent the upper sideband frequency ranges for each value of N from one to eight, respectively, and lines 270 a, 270 b, 270 c, 260 d represent the lower sideband frequency ranges for each value of N from one to eight, respectively. As can be seen from Table 1 and FIG. 21, all but the lowest two frequency ranges (represented by lines 270 a and 270 b) overlap and thus a continuous frequency range from about 637.5 MHz to about 2.3 GHz is available, and other discrete frequency ranges can be provided. FIG. 21 illustrates that the wide band programmable LO architecture of the invention provides an equivalent to an oscillator with a center frequency of 1468.75 MHz, and a tuning range of \ufffd57%. In other words, the frequency synthesizer of the invention provides a substantially increased frequency tuning band compared to that of the original VCO (57% overall versus 15% for the VCO). The frequency synthesizer of the invention may provide a wide-band programmable LO that may cover almost two octaves in frequency while maintaining the same tuning sensitivity (because tuning in fact occurs within each narrow band that are cascaded to provide a synthetic wide band, as shown in FIG. 21), thereby maintaining good phase noise.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40140=The present state-of-the-art in frequency synthesis relies on either integer-N or fractional-N architectures realized in a phase lock loop (PLL) circuit having a phase detector, a low-pass filter, and a programmable divider in the feedback loop. One example of a conventional frequency synthesis circuit including a PLL with a programmable division factor frequency divider, a phase comparator with filters, a reference frequency oscillator and a reference divider is described in German Patent DE10131091 to D. Gapski, issued Jul. 18, 2002. Another example of a frequency synthesizer including a multiband frequency generator coupled to a multiple VCO configuration oscillator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,785,525 to Ries, issued Aug. 31, 2004. An example of dual frequency synthesis for communication and signal strength monitoring is described in GB2254971 to W. Torbjorn, published Oct. 12, 1992. In addition, several examples of direct digital frequency synthesis are described in U.S. Patent Application 2004264547 to Hinrichs et al, published 2004-12-30, U.S. Patent Application 2004176045 to Frank, published 2004-Sep.-9, and European Patent EP0409127 to Watanabe Nozomu, published 1991-Jan.-23., 35314=This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/543,418 filed Feb. 10, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. This application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(a) to Taiwanese Application entitled \u201cProgrammable Radio Transceiver\u201d filed February 2005 which in turn claims priority to the above-identified U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/543,418., 39115=There have been attempts made to construct LC resonant circuits with bondwires, as discussed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,806,785 to Traub, issued Oct. 19, 2004. The '785 patent discloses the use of a bond wire to form an inductor that is part of a narrowband oscillator circuit, describing the oscillator circuit as including voltage-variable capacitances, bondwire inductors, and a de-attenuation amplifier.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such and other alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure and are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only and are not intended to be limiting. The scope of the invention should be determined from proper construction of the appended claims, and their equivalents. ). FIG. 36 If the comparator detects a difference in the digital data, it may initiates the macro model 306 to execute a software algorithm that computes adjustments, as discussed above. The macro model may compute new settings for transmitter chain components, such as, for example, the programmable attenuator 422, the VGA 424, or the frequency synthesizer 104. The adjustment may result in, for example, a frequency and phase shift due to a digital input to the programmable frequency synthesizer 104, signal attenuation due to an input to the programmable attenuator 424, or a variable gain adjustment due to an input to the programmable VGA 422. In addition, the macro model may signal that the test data may be re-sent to the transmitter 102 for another iteration of testing (step 440 in ) as the new initial",
