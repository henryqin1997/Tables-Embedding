    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{256710=Suspension cultures of the cotton variety B1644 were developed according to the method of Example 5. Suspension cultures were then plated onto an agar medium as described in Example 6, but supplemented with the herbicide (antibiotic) kanamycin (25 mg/l). Most of the cells in the population died, but a few (1 to 5%) were tolerant and survived. These were selectively subcultured onto agar-solidified media supplemented with increasing concentrations of kanamycin, until the final concentration reached 50 mg/l. Embryos were then developed from this callus, and those resistant embryos were germinated into kanamycin resistant plants., 226940=Plant segments were placed in a medium containing an Agrobacterium vector containing a selectable marker such as resistance to an antibiotic, kanamycin, for 1 minute to 24 hours to transfer the gene to the cells of the explant. The explants were then removed and placed on agar-solidified callus growth medium (MS medium supplemented with 2 mg/l NAA and incubated for 15 to 200 hours at 30\ufffd C., on a 16:8 hour light:dark regime., 204989=First, plasmid pRK252 was modified to replace the gene conferring tetracycline-resistance with one conferring resistance to kanamycin from the transposon Tn903 [Oka et al., J. Mol. Biol. 147 217-226 (1981) incorporated herein by reference], and was also modified by replacing the unique EcoRI site in pRK252 with a BglII site (see FIG. 20 for a summary of these modifications). Plasmid pRK252 was first digested with endonucleases SalI and SmaI, then treated with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I to create flush ends, and the large vector fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Next, plasmid p368 was digested with endonuclease BamHI, treated with the large fragment of DNA polymerase, and an approximately 1050-bp fragment isolated after agarose gel electrophoresis; this fragment containing the gene from transposon Tn903 which confers resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin [Oka et al., J. Mol. Biol. 147 217-226 (1981) incorporated herein by reference]. Both fragments were then treated with the large fragment of DNA polymerase to create flush ends. Both fragments are mixed and incubated with T4 DNA ligase overnight at 15\ufffd C. After transformation into E. coli strain HB101 and selection for kanamycin resistant colonies, plasmid pRK252/Tn903 is obtained (see FIG. 19)., 80589=In 1902, Haberlandt [\u201cKulturversuche mit isolierten pflanzenzellen,\u201d Mat. KI. Kais. Akad. Wiss. Wien 111 62, incorporated herein by reference] postulated that plant cells possessed the ability to produce entire plants and predicted that this would someday be demonstrable in cell cultures. In 1965, Reinert [\u201cUntersuchungen uber die morphogenese an Gewebekulturen,\u201d Ber. dt. Bot. Ges. 71 15] and Steward et al. [\u201cGrowth and organized development of cultured cells/II. Organization in cultures grown from freely suspended cells,\u201d Am. J. Bot. 45 705-708] working independently, confirmed the occurrence of in vitro somatic. embryogenesis. (Both references are incorporated herein by reference.) In experimentally manipulating somatic embryogenesis it is believed that two components of the culture media, an auxin and the nitrogen source, play crucial roles., 228000=Embryos were placed in a medium containing an Agrobacterium vector containing resistance to kanamycin for 1 minute to 24 hours to transfer the gene to the cells of the embryos. The embryos were then removed and placed on agar-solidified callus growth medium (MS medium supplemented with 2 mg/l NAA and incubated for 15 to 200 hours at 30\ufffd C., on a 16:8 hour light:dark regime., 229670=The method of Examples 18, 19 and 20 were used to transform plants, embryos and callus of the following cotton varieties: SJ2, SJ5, SJ-C1, GC510, B1644, B1654-26, B1654-43, B1810, B2724, COKER 315, STONEVILLE 506, CHEMBRED B2, CHEMBRED C4 and SIOKRA., 161244=The procedure of Example 1 was repeated to the extent of obtaining callus capable of forming somatic embryos. Pieces of about 750-1000 mg of actively growing embryogenic callus was suspended in 8 ml units of liquid suspension culture medium comprised of MS major and minor salts, supplemented with 0.4 mg/l thiamine HCl, 20 g/l sucrose, 100 mg/l of inositol and naphthaleneacetic acid (2 mg/l) in T-tubes and placed on a roller drum rotating at 1.5 rpm under 16:8 light:dark regime. Light intensity of about 2000-4500 lux was again provided by fluorescent lights (cool daylight)., 214877=Construction of a Bacillus thuringiensis protoxin chimeric gene with the CaMV 35S promoter was achieved by construction of a CaMV 35S Promoter Cassette Plasmid pCIB710 was constructed as shown in FIG. 27. This plasmid contained CaMV promoter and transcription termination sequences for the 35S RNA transcript [Covey et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 9 6735-6747 (1981) incorporated herein by reference]. A 1149-bp BglII restriction fragment of CaMV DNA [Hohn et al. In: Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology 96 194-220 and Appendices A to G (1982) incorporated herein by reference] was isolated from plasmid pLVlll (obtained from Dr. S. Howell Univ. California-San Diego; alternatively, the fragment can be isolated directly from CaMV DNA) by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis as described earlier and mixed with BamHI-cleaved plasmid pUC19 DNA, treated with T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into E. coli. The BamHI restriction site in the resulting plasmid has been destroyed by ligation of the BglII cohesive ends to the BamHI cohesive ends. The resulting plasmid, called pUC19/35S, was then used in oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to insert the BamHI recognition sequence GGATCC immediately following CaMV nucleotide 7483 in the Hohn reference. The resulting plasmid, pCIB710, contains the CaMV 35S promotor region and transcription termination region separated by a BamHI restriction site. DNA sequences inserted into this BamHI site will be expressed in plants by the CaMV transcription regulation sequences. pCIB710 does not contain any ATG translation initiation codons between the start of transcription and the BamHI site., 143133=The Acala SJ2 was obtained from a the cross AXTE1\ufffdNM 2302. The Acala SJ4, SJ5, SJ-C1, B1644, B1654-26, B1654-43, B3991, GC356, GCS10, GAM1 were obtained from the cross C6TE\ufffdNM B3080. Acala Royale was obtained from the cross [C6TE\ufffdNM B3080]\ufffd[AXTE 1-57\ufffdTEX E364]. Acala. Maxxa was obtained from the cross [S196\ufffd1900-1]\ufffd[12302-4\ufffd(C6TE\ufffdB7378)]. Acala Prema was obtained from the cross [ATE-11\ufffdNM49-2]\ufffd[C6TE\ufffdNM B3080]., 164682=The method of Example 1 was repeated with cotton varieties B1654-26, B1654-43, B3991, Acala Royale, B4894, COKER 315, STONEVILLE 506, FC 3027, CHEMBRED B2 and CHEMBRED C4., 217972=Construction of a deleted Bacillus thuringiensis protoxin gene containing approximately 725 amino acids, and construction of a chimeric gene containing this deleted gene with the CaMV 35S promoter was made by removing the COOH-terminal portion of the gene by cleaving at the KpnI restriction endonuclease site at position 2325 in the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Plasmid pCIB10/35Sbt (FIG. 29) was digested with BamHI and KpnI, and the approximately 2.2-kb BamHI/KpnI fragment containing the deleted protoxin gene isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. To convert the KpnI site at the 3\u2032 end to a BamHI site, the fragment was mixed with a KpnI/BamHI adapter oligonucleotide and ligated. This fragment is then mixed with BamHI-cleaved pCIB10/710 (FIG. 28)., 162945=The procedure of Example 6 was repeated except that suspension cultures were formed by transferring 750-1000 mg of embryogenic calli to a DeLong flask containing 15-20 ml of the MS liquid medium containing 2 mg/l NAA. The culture containing flask was placed on a gyrotory shaker and shaken at 100-110 strokes/minute. After three weeks the suspension was filtered through an 840 micron nylon mesh to remove the large cell clumps for plant growth, as in Example 4. The less than 840 micron suspension was allowed to settle, washed once in the MS liquid medium and resuspended in 2 to 5 ml of the MS liquid medium. The suspension was subcultured by transfer to fresh medium in a DeLong flask containing 1-2 ml of suspension and 15 ml of fresh MS liquid medium. The cultures are maintained by repeating this procedure at seven to ten day intervals. At each subculture only the less than 840 micron suspension was subcultured and the large clumps (840 microns or greater) were used for plant growth., 197394=To prepare the Agrobacterium vector there was fused the CaMV gene VI promotor and protoxin coding sequences. A derivative of phage vector mp19 [Yanish-Perron et al., 1985] was first constructed. The steps are shown in FIGS. 16 and 17. First, a DNA fragment containing approximately 155 nucleotides 5\u2032 to the protoxin coding region and the adjacent approximately 1346 nucleotides of coding sequence are inserted into mp19. Phage mp19 ds rf (double-stranded replicative form) DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases SacI and SmaI and the approximately 7.2-kb (kilobase pairs) vector fragment was purified after electrophoresis through low-gelling temperature agarose by standard procedures. Plasmid pKU25/4, containing approximately 10 kb of Bacillus thuringiensis DNA, including the protoxin gene, was obtained from Dr. J. Nueesch, CIBA-S Geigy Ltd., Basle, Switzerland. The nucleotide sequence of the protoxin gene present in plasmid pKU25/4 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 below. Plasmid pKU25/4 DNA was digested with endonucleases HpaI and SacI, and a 1503 bp fragment containing nucleotides 2 to 1505 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and purified. This fragment contains approximately 155 bp of bacteria promotor sequences and approximately 1346 bp of the start of the protoxin coding sequence. Approximately 100 ng of each fragment is then mixed, T4 DNA ligase added, and incubated at 15\ufffd C. overnight. The resulting mixture was transformed into E. coli strain HB101, mixed with indicator bacteria E. coli JM101 and plated. One phage (mp19/bt) was used for further construction below., 145020=The cultures are maintained at a temperature of about 25 to about 35\ufffd C., preferably about 30\ufffd C. and with a light/dark cycle of about 16 hours of light and about 8 hours of dark. It is preferred to have a light intensity of about 2000 to 4000 lux, more preferably about 3000 to 4000 lux., 141474=The methods briefly described herein have been successfully employed to induce somatic embryo formation in cotton of the species Gossypium hirsutum by tissue and suspension cultures and, ultimately, to obtain mature plants from hypocotyl and cotyledon derived callus cultures of Acala varieties of Gossypium hirsutum including Acala SJ2, Acala SJ4, Acala SJ5, Acala SJ-C1, Acala B1644, Acala B1654-26, Acala B1654-43, Acala B3991, Acala GC356 (plants not obtained), Acala GC510, Acala GAM1, Acala Royale, Acala Maxxa (callus only formed), Acala Prema, Acala B638 (plants not formed), Acala B1810, Acala B2724, Acala B4894, Acala B5002 (plants not formed), non Acala \u201cpicker\u201d Siokra, \u201cstripper\u201d variety FC2017, Coker 315, STONEVILLE 506, STONEVILLE 825 (plants not formed), DP50 (callus only formed), DP61 (callus only formed), DP90 (callus only formed), DP77 (callus only formed), DES119 (callus only formed), McN235 (callus only formed), HBX87 (plants not formed), NBX191 (callus only formed), HBX107 (callus only formed), FC 3027, CHEMBRED A1 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED A2 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED A3 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED A4 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED B1 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED B2, CHEMBRED B3 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED C1 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED C2 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED C3 (callus only formed), CHEMBRED C4, PAYMASTER 145 (callus only formed), HS26 (callus only formed), HS46 (callus only formed), SICALA (plants not formed), PIMA S6 (plants not formed) and ORO BLANCO PIMA (plants not formed). Cultures have been transformed to normal plants with novel traits or properties., 201933=Next, a plasmid was constructed in which the 3\u2032 coding region of the protoxin gene was fused to CaMV transcription termination signals. The steps are shown in FIG. 18. First, plasmid pABDI DNA was digested with endonucleases BamHI and BglII and a 0.5 kb fragment containing the CaMV transcription terminator sequences isolated. Next plasmid pUC19 [Yanisch-Perron et al., Gene 33 103-119 (1985) incorporated herein by reference] was digested with BamHI, mixed with the 0.5 kb fragment and incubated with T4 DNA ligase. After transformation of the DNA into E. coli strain HB101, one of the resulting clones, called plasmid p702, was obtained which has the structure shown in FIG. 18. Next, plasmid p702 DNA was cleaved with endonucleases SacI and SmaI, and the larger, approximately 3.2 kb fragment isolated by gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pKU25/4 DNA was digested with endonucleases AhaIII and SacI, and the 2.3-kb fragment (nucleotides 1502 to 3773 of SEQ ID NO: 1) containing the 3\u2032 portion of the protoxin coding sequence (nucleotides 1504 to 3773 of SEQ ID NO: 1) was isolated after gel electrophoresis. These two DNA fragments are mixed, incubated with T4 DNA ligase and transformed into E. coli strain HB101. The resulting plasmid was p702/bt (FIG. 18)., 165225=The method of Example 1 was repeated with cotton varieties Acala Maxxa, Acala Prema, B2086, FC 3027, DP50, DP61, DP90, DP77, DES119, McN235, HBX191, HBX107, CHEMBRED A1, CHEMBRED A2, CHEMBRED A3, CHEMBRED A4, CHEMBRED B1, CHEMBRED B3, CHEMBRED C1, CHEMBRED C2, CHEMBRED C3, PAYMASTER 145, HS26 and HS46 except embryos and plants were not developed from the callus., 82348=Beasley reported the formation of callus in ovule cultures of cotton in 1971 [\u201cIn vitro culture of fertilized cotton ovules,\u201d Bioscience 21 906-907 (1971), incorporated herein by reference]. Later, Hsu et al. [\u201cCallus induction by (2-chlorethyl) phosphoric (CPA) acid in cultured cotton ovules,\u201d Physiol. Plant 36 150-153 (1976), incorporated herein by reference] observed a stimulation of growth of calli obtained from ovules due to the addition of CPA and gibberellic acid to the medium. Callus cultures from other explants such as (a) leaf [Davis et al. \u201cIn vitro culture of callus tissues and cell suspensions from okra (Hibiscus esculentus) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), \u201cIn vitro 9 395-398 (1974), both incorporated herein by reference] (b) hypocotyl [Schenk et al. \u201cMedium and technique for induction and growth of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant cell cultures,\u201d Can. J. Bot. 50 199-204 (1972), incorporated herein by reference] and (c) cotyledons [Rani et al. \u201cEstablishment of Tissue Cultures of Cotton,\u201d Plant Sci. Lett. 7 163-169 (1976), incorporated herein by reference] have been established for Gossypium hirsutum and G. arboreum., 157719=Seeds of Acala cotton variety SJ2 of Gossypium hirsutum were sterilized by contact with 95 alcohol for three minutes, then twice rinsed with sterile water and immersed with a 15% solution of sodium hypochlorite for 15 minutes, then rinsed in sterile water. Sterilized seeds were germinated on a basal agar medium in the dark for approximately 14 days to produce a seedling. The cotyledons of the seedlings were cut into segments of 2-4 mm2 which were transferred aseptically to a callus inducing medium consisting of Murashige and Skoog (MS) major and minor salts supplemented with 0.4 mg/l thiamine-HCl, 30 g/l glucose, 2.0 mg/l NAA, 1 mg/l kinetin, 100 mg/l of m-inositol, and agar (0.8% w/v). The cultures were incubated at about 30\ufffd C. under conditions of 16 hours light and 8 hours darkness in a Percival incubator with fluorescent lights (cool daylight) providing a light intensity of about 2000-4000 lux., 156395=Using the above procedure and with reference to FIG. 9, there is shown variable cell colonies which is consequence of transformation. There exists cotton cells 20 exhibiting resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. With reference to FIG. 10, transformed calli are shown developing into somatic embryos on an antibiotic MS medium. FIG. 11 exemplifies transformed somatic embryos established to have kanamycin resistance and transformed to have resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. FIG. 12 exemplifies cotton plants obtained by inoculating tissues with Agrobacterium containing a mutant AroA gene and thereafter growing the tissues on non-selective media. FIG. 13 shows germinating somatic embryos of variety B1644 obtained from suspension cultures treated with the vector pCIB10/BTA-5, and selected on kanamycin (50 mg/L) or G418 (25 mg/L) supplemented media. FIG. 14 shows plantlets developed from the embryos of FIG. 13. FIG. 15 shows a plantlet of the variety Siokra developed from transformed embryos exhibiting a resistance to kanamycin., 228879=Callus was placed in a medium containing an Agrobacterium vector containing resistance to kanamycin for 1 minute to 24 hours to transfer the gene to the cells of the embryos. The callus was then removed and placed on agar-solidified callus growth medium (MS medium supplemented with 2 mg/l NAA and incubated for 15 to 200 hours at 30\ufffd C., on a 16:8 hour light:dark regime., 218778=A deleted protoxin gene containing approximately 645 amino acids was made by removing the COOH-terminal portion of the gene by cleaving at the BclI restriction endonuclease site at position 2090 in the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Plasmid. pCIB10/35Sbt (FIG. 29) was digested with BamHI and BclI, and the approximately 1.9-kb BamHI/BcII fragment containing the deleted protoxin gene isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. Since BclI creates a cohesive end compatible with BamHI, no further manipulation is required prior to ligating this fragment into BamHI-cleaved pCIB10/710 (FIG. 28). The resulting plasmid, which has the structure pCIB10/35Sbt(BclI) shown in FIG. 31 was selected on kanamycin., 199007=Next, a fragment of DNA containing the CaMV gene VI promotor, and some of the coding sequences for gene VI, was inserted into mp19/bt. Phage mp19/bt ds rf DNA is digested with BamHI, treated with the large fragment of DNA polymerase to create flush ends and recleaved with endonuclease PstI. The larger vector fragment was purified by electrophoresis as described above. Plasmid pABD1 [described in Paszkowski et al., EMBO J. 3 2717-2722 (1984) incorporated herein by reference]. Plasmid pABD1 DNA is digested with PstI and HindIII. The fragment approximately 465 bp long containing the CaMV gene VI promotor and approximately 75 bp of gene VI coding sequence was purified. The two fragments were ligated and plated as described above. One of the resulting recombinant phages, mp19/btca contained the CaMV gene VI promotor sequences, a portion of the gene VI coding sequence, approximately 155 bp of Bacillus thuringiensis DNA upstream of the protoxin coding sequence, and approximately 1346 bp of the protoxin coding sequence. To fuse the CaMV promotor sequences precisely to the protoxin coding sequences, the intervening DNA was deleted using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of mp19/btca DNA. A DNA oligonucleotide with the sequence 5\u2032-TTCGGATTGTTATCCATGGTTGGAGGTCTGA-3\u2032 was synthesized by routine procedures using an Applied Biosystems DNA Synthesizer. This oligonucleotide is complimentary to those sequences in phage mp19/btca DNA at the 3\u2032 end of the CaMV promotor [nucleotides 5762 to 5778 see Hohn Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology 96 193-235 (1982) incorporate herein by reference] and the beginning of the protoxin coding sequence (nucleotides 156 to 172 in formula I above). The general procedure for the mutagenesis is that described in Zoller et al. [Methods in Enzymology 100 468-500 (1983) incorporated herein by reference]. Approximately five micrograms of single-stranded phage mp19/btca DNA was mixed with 0.3 mg of phosphorylated oligonucleotide in a volume of 40 \u03bcl. The mixture was heated to 65\ufffd C. for 5 min, cooled to 50\ufffd C., and slowly cooled to 4\ufffd C. Next, buffer, nucleotide triphosphates, ATP, T 4 DNA ligase and large fragment of DNA polymerase were added and incubated overnight at 15\ufffd C. as described by Zoller et al. [Methods in Enzymology 100 468-500 (1983) incorporated herein by reference] . After agarose gel electrophoresis, circular double-stranded DNA was purified and transfected into E. coli strain JM101. The resulting plaques are screened for sequences that hybridize with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, and phage are analyzed by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Among the resulting phage clones were ones which have correctly deleted the unwanted sequences between the CaMV gene VI promotor and the protoxin coding sequence. This phage is called mp19/btca/del (see FIG. 17)., 78273=This application is a divisional and continuation in part of Ser. No. 07/680,048 filed Mar. 29, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,802 which was a continuation of Ser. No. 07/122,200 filed Nov. 18, 1987, now abandoned, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 186801=An Acala cotton suspension culture was subcultured for three to four months in T-tubes with the medium (MS medium containing 2 mg/l NAA) being changed every seven to ten days. After any medium change thereafter the cells can be allowed to settle and harvested for transformation. The supernatant was removed by pipeting and cells transformed with the Agrobacterium strain LBA 4434. The Agrobacterium strain LBA 4434 [described in Hoekema et al., Nature 303 179-180 (1983), incorporated herein by reference] contains a Ti plasmid-derived binary plant transformation system. In such binary systems, one plasmid contains the T-DNA of a Ti-plasmid, the second plasmid contains the vir-region of a Ti-plasmid. The two plasmids cooperate to effect plant transformation. In the strain LBA 4434, the T-DNA plasmid, pAL1050, contains TL of pTiAch5, an octopine Ti-plasmid and the vir-plasmid in strain LBA4434, pAL4404, contains the intact virulence regions of pTiAch5 [Ooms et al., Plasmid 7 15-29 (1982), incorporated herein by reference] . Strain LBA 4434 is available from Dr. Robert Schilperoort of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Leiden, The Netherlands., 89303=FIG. 13 shows germinating somatic embryos of variety B1644 obtained from suspension cultures treated with the vector pCIB10/BTA-5, and selected on kanamycin (50 mg/L) or G418 (25 mg/l) supplemented media., 160944=The procedure of Examples 1 and 2 was repeated with Acala cotton varieties SJ4, SJ5, SJ2C-1, GC510, B1644, B2724, B1810, the picker variety Siokra and the stripper variety FC2017. All were successfully regenerated., 149515=In this procedure, suspension concentration is normally from about 750 to 1000 mg of callus parts to 8 ml callus growth medium such as the second callus growth medium (MS medium supplemented with NAA), and allowed to grow in suspension. In a preferred embodiment, the suspension of the callus is inserted in T-tubes and placed on a roller drum rotating at about 1.5 rpm under a light regime of about 16 hours of light and about 8 hours of dark. Growth is for about 3 to 4 weeks., 159405=The somatic plantlets which were formed from somatic embryos were transferred onto Beasley and Ting's medium which contained 1200 mg/l ammonium nitrate and 500 mg/l casein hydrolysate as an organic nitrogen source. The medium was solidified by a solidifying agent (Gelrite) and plantlets were placed in Magenta boxes., 152455=The segments are placed in a medium containing an Agrobacterium vector containing a code (genetic marker) such as resistance to an antibiotic, such as for instance kanamycin for a time sufficient for the vector to transfer the gene to the cells of the explant. Generally, contact times ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours may be used and may be accompanied with intermittent or gentle agitation. The explants are then removed and placed on agar-solidified callus growth medium such as a MS medium supplemented with NAA (2 mg/l) and incubated about 15 to 200 hours at 25 to 35\ufffd C., preferably 30\ufffd C., on a 16:8 hour light:dark regime.}",
