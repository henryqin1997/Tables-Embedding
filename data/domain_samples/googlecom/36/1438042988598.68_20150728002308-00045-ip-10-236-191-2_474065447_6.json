    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6084=In another embodiment of the present invention, an interference filter provides transmission for a first passband in the 1.5 \u03bcm range corresponding to a payload channel wavelength and for a second passband in the 1625 nm range corresponding to a service channel wavelength. The alternative embodiment is based on the following equation: t n = 1 - 0.06 \ue8a0 [ ( N - 1 ) 2 - n + 1 ( N - 1 ) 2 ] 2 ( 2 )}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{81021=FIG. 9 is an exemplary transmission spectrum normalized to 1.55 \u03bcm for the single cavity, thirty one layer, interference filter shown in FIG. 7. As can be seen, a high transmission spike is present at \u03bb/\u03bb0=1.0 which corresponds to a wavelength in the 1.5 \u03bcm range (approximately 1550 nm) and a relatively ripple-free transmission characteristic at approximately 0.845 which corresponds to a wavelength in the 1.3 \u03bcm range (approximately 1310 nm). Thus, a single cavity interference filter with a pair of quadratically chirped stacks provides high transmittance at a first passband in the 1.5 \u03bcm range and at a second passband in the 1.3 \u03bcm range which can correspond to a payload channel wavelength and a service channel wavelength, respectively, within an optical network., 60997=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/071,537, filed Jan. 15, 1998., 88524=FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary transmission spectrum for the single cavity, 119 layer interference filter having the optical thickness values listed with reference to FIG. 10. As can be seen, a high transmission spike is present at approximately 1550 nm while a relatively ripple-free transmission characteristic is present in the 1625 nm range. Thus, a single cavity interference filter with a pair of quadratically chirped stacks provides high transmission at a first passband in the 1550 nm range and at a second passband in the 1625 nm range which can correspond to a payload channel wavelength and a service channel wavelength, respectively, within an optical network., 87363=where tn is the optical thickness associated with a particular layer, N is the total number of layers used to form an individual stack or mirror and n is the number of the particular layer within the stack. In this embodiment, the wavelength, distance from the payload channel range (1550 nm) to the service channel range (1625 nm) is approximately 75 nm. This is much shorter as compared to the distance between the same payload channel and the service channel in the 1.3 \u03bcm range which is approximately 240 nm. Because of this short distance, equation (2) includes a change in the magnitude of the chirp from 0.15 to 0.06. In addition, the number of layers in each cavity increases to approximately 119 where layers 1-59 form a first stack or mirror, layer 60 corresponds to a low index spacer material, and layers 61-119 form the second stack. FIG. 10 lists exemplary optical thickness values for the single cavity filter where layers 1-59 corresponds to the first stack, layer 60 corresponds to the spacer, and layers 61-119 correspond to the second stack., 89441=Again, the interference filter can also be formed by depositing cavities having quadratically chirped stacks on top of other cavities having quadratically chirped stacks similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 7. For example, the 119 layer cavity described with reference to FIG. 11 can be deposited on top of another cavity with a coupling layer therebetween to form a multi-cavity interference filter. The resulting transmission spectrum for such a multi-cavity filter broadens the transmission of wavelengths in the 1550 nm range shown in FIG. 12 while retaining the relatively ripple-free transmission characteristic corresponding to wavelengths in the 1310 nm range. The multi-cavity filter increases and squares the passband associated with the payload channel wavelengths while retaining the relatively ripple-free transmission characteristic associated with service channel wavelengths in the 1625 nm range., 81832=The interference filter in accordance with the present invention can also be formed by depositing cavities having quadratically chirped stacks on top of other cavities having quadratically chirped stacks. For example, the thirty one layer single cavity filter 30 described with reference to FIG. 7 can be deposited on top of another cavity, and so on, to form a multi-cavity interference filter. An additional coupling layer is deposited between the cavities. The resulting transmission spectrum for such a multi-cavity filter broadens the transmission of wavelengths in the 1550 nm range while retaining the relatively ripple-free transmission characteristic corresponding to wavelengths in the 1310 nm range. This is beneficial because the sharp peak at 1 of FIG. 9 is too narrow to tune a particular optical source associated with a payload channel wavelength (1.5 \u03bcm range).}",
