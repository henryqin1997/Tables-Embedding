[0079] For example, the width (W) of a slit may need to be reduced or the length (L) may need to be increased to avoid interference should the independent imaging systems be placed closer to one another reducing the angle a in the process. W/L<(M1 tan \u03b1)/(M2\u2212M1) [0078] The apparatus and method as described thus far had the drawback that two scans are needed, one for obtaining depth from laser pattern projection and another for obtaining surface texture from photographic illumination, before a realistic 3D shape with high resolution depth and texture is acquired. Multiple sequences of scanning makes it difficult to capture a person's face in 3D, for example, since a means to hold the same pose for an extended period of time has to be put in place. In order to speed up the scanning process two independent imaging systems 1 are introduced along with corresponding lighting or laser attachments 2 in FIGS. 15 and 18. The aforesaid independent lighting systems 2 must not interfere with one another; for example, laser projected from the lighting source 2 on the left in FIG. 15 should not be visible by",
