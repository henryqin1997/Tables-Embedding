    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33895=[0021]FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate two different embodiments of transmit and receive antennas for multi-protocol use, such as GSM 1900 MHz and WCDMA 1900 MHz, or TDMA 850 MHz and GSM 850 MHz., 40818=[0031] When the diode 1 is off and the diode 2 is on the antenna of system 1 is at the TX frequency band (WCDMA 1900 MHz) and the antenna of system 1 is at the RX frequency band (WCDMA 1900 MHz). When the diode 1 is on and the diode 2 is off the antenna of system 2 is at the RX frequency band (GSM 1900 MHz) and the antenna of system 2 is at the TX frequency band (GSM 1900 MHz)., 25051=[0004] The use of one antenna has been preferred due to the fact that the radiation pattern has been found to be impaired when there is another antenna nearby that operates on the same frequency. This case is shown in FIG. 2, where it is assumed that the WCDMA 1900 antenna 2A is transmitting, and that the GSM 850/1900 antenna 2B on the same mobile station is coupling in undesired energy from the WCDMA 1900 antenna transmission. The result is that the electromagnetic energy propagation pattern of the WCDMA 1900 antenna 2A is interfered with. The same situation can exist when the antenna 2B is transmitting, and undesired energy is coupled into the antenna 2A., 35844=[0024] Exactly how the antenna is tuned out of its resonance band depends on several factors, including ease of use, complexity and cost. It is assumed that some control device 10 is available to supply a detune signal to a node 12 in the antenna circuitry 2A or to a node 14 in the antenna circuitry 2B. The control circuit may be a CPU or a DSP device of the mobile station. The nodes 12 and 14 are assumed to contain some means for detuning the antenna circuitry away from the normal resonant frequency of the antenna circuitry. This is accomplished when the other antenna circuitry is transmitting in a frequency band that overlaps the operational frequency band of the antenna circuitry. As an example, and assuming that the WCDMA antenna circuitry 2A is transmitting, then the GSM 850/1900 antenna circuitry 2B is detuned to, for example, 1500 MHz. The end result is that the GSM 850/1900 antenna circuitry 2B appears as a high impedance to the WCDMA 1900 MHz transmission, and has a minimal impact on the RF propagation of the WCDMA 1900 MHz transmission., 23834=[0002] Multi-mode mobile stations are commonly available. During the use of a multi-mode mobile station it may be the case that the two supported cellular systems operate in the same center frequency band (for example, Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) 1900 MHz and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)1900 MHz.) Also, the IS-95 and TDMA systems may all operate in the same frequency band. Furthermore, in the 850 MHz band there are the AMPS, 850 TDMA, 850 GSM and CDMA systems, 30295=[0011] A multi-mode mobile station in accordance with these teachings has, for each mode operating within at least one common range of frequencies, a transmitter circuit chain that includes an antenna circuit that operates in the common range of frequencies and a controller. The controller is responsive to a first one of said transmitter circuits transmitting, for electronically detuning a second antenna circuit of the mobile station such that the second antenna circuit is mis-matched to the first antenna circuit so as to minimize coupling of the transmitted signal from the first antenna circuit into the second antenna circuit. For example, the common range of frequencies may include 1900 MHz or 850 MHz., 35577=[0023] It is pointed out that while FIG. 3 shows the use of the two ASICs 4 and 5, that a single ASIC could be employed that contains the circuitry for both the WCDMA 1900 MHz and the GSM 850/1900 MHz systems., 29425=[0010] A method is disclosed for operating a multi-mode mobile station, wherein each mode shares at least one common band of frequencies. The method includes transmitting a signal from a first antenna circuit of the mobile station in the common band of frequencies and, while transmitting, electronically detuning a second antenna circuit of the mobile station such that the second antenna circuit is not resonant in the common band of frequencies. As an example, the common band of frequencies includes 1900 MHz. The step of detuning includes varying an impedance of at least one component that forms a part of the second antenna circuit, where the at least one component can be a stripline, or a PIN diode, or a FET diode. The at least one component can also be a normally active component that is put into a passive state., 24357=[0003] In a typical case one antenna is used for transmitting and receiving in both of the cellular systems. As an example, and referring to the dual mode system 1 shown in FIG. 1, the WCDMA 1900 MHz and the GSM 1900 MHz RF (Radio Frequency) subsystems, which may be embodied in the same ASIC or in separate ASICs 4 and 5, can each have their own transmit (TX) chain and associated power amplifier (PA). The working assumption has been that only one antenna 2 is used that has a single feed point (FP). For this to be true the GSM and WCDMA branches are coupled to the antenna 2 by an antenna switch (SW) 3., 40505=[0030]FIG. 6A shows the case where the TX and RX bands of the same protocol are located on the same antenna (2A or 2B). In this case, and by example, WCDMA 1900 MHz RX and TX are on antenna 1, and the GSM 1900 MHz RX and TX are on antenna 2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0041] Thus, while described in the context of presently preferred embodiments, it should be appreciated that these teachings may be implemented in various ways, and that the teachings of this invention are not intended to be limited in scope to only the presently preferred embodiments that were described above. [0040] These teachings are not limited to only two frequency bands and two antennas, but may be employed as well with tri-mode and higher mobile stations wherein it may be desirable to detune or desensitize more than one antenna circuit when transmitting on another antenna circuit. [0039] It is further noted that the two frequency ranges or bands may be identical and coincident with one another such that they totally overlap one another, or they may only partially overlap one another. In this latter case the antenna resonant frequency detuning of the unused antenna circuit may only be done when operation of the other antenna will result in a transmission within the overlapped portion corresponding to a common range of frequencies within the two frequency bands. [0038] The teachings of this invention can be applied to different antenna combinations, such as a Planar Inverted F-Antenna (PIFA) and helical types of antennas. The antennas may be internal or external to the mobile station. The antennas 2A and 2B for each of the operational modes may be physically",
