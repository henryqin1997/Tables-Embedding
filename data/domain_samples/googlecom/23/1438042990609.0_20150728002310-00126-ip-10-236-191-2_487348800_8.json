The statement stored in the join result holding part 217 is utilized for a conventional database retrieval processing (FIG. 6, block 633). Then, in order to return the changed color of the target list box to the original color, the list box mask is cleared (FIG. 10, block 367). FIG. 14 shows a screen in which a joining operation is actually completed and it is seen that the field which was displayed in the second grey color state returns to the normal display state. When it is determined that there is no place which is valid for dropping within the window (block 359), reject is effected and the processing ends (block 365). When it is determined that the place is valid for dropping within the window (block 359), a window for joining (FIG. 4, window 530) is displayed and join processing is effected (block 361). In other words, by delivering information of the source field and information of the target field to the join operation manager 229, a database query statement (join portion) is generated and is stored in the join result holding part 217. When the window is not valid for dropping (block 355), reject processing is effected and the processing ends (block 363). When the",
