Preferred memory controllers are disclosed in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application, FLASH EEPROM SYSTEM, Ser. No. 07/963,837, filed Oct. 20, 1992, and DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SOLID-STATE MEMORY SYSTEM, Ser. No. 07/736,733, filed Jul. 26, 1991. Relevant portions of both disclosures are incorporated herein by reference., 30083=The PCMCIA card has the form factor approximately the size of a credit card and is externally connectable to a host computer system via the PCMCIA interface. Originally, these cards were intended as memory card add-ons for portable or mobile computing systems. Soon thereafter their standards were expanded to accommodate other peripherals such as modems, network adapters, and hard disks. Thus, PCMCIA Type I card is 3.3 mm in overall outside thickness, less than 5.5 cm in width, and less than 9.0 cm in length. Types II and III have similar dimensions, except Type II card is 5 mm thick and Type III card is 10.5 mm thick. Revision 1.0 of the technical specification dated September 1990, is a memory-only standard for memory card applications. Revision 2.0, dated September 1991, is a standard with added input/output (I/O) capabilities and software support suitable for other non-memory types of peripherals., 29607=Indeed, a series of industry \u201cPC Card Standards\u201d are now being promulgated by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), Sunnyvale, Calif., U.S.A. Excerpts of the current PCMCIA Standards, Edition Release 2, dated November, 1992 are incorporated herein by reference. These standards set mechanical (Types I, II and III) are technical (Revision 1.0, 2.0) specifications for a memory card and its connection to a host., 69598=The daughter card's native interface connector 24 generally has pins that include connections to ground, voltage supplies, serial data in and/or out, timing, control lines, select lines, address and register lines, test pins as well as a signal that acknowledges the presence of a daughter card. Depending on selective implementations of these pins, as many as 32 pins or 24 pins or down to about 10 pins may be used in the connector 24 and its mate connector 14. In a minimum pin implementation, data, addresses and commands are multiplexed into a serial stream before being passed across the native interface 12, 24. Once across, the serial stream is demultiplexed into their respective components. Serial protocols between a memory controller and a memory device has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,172,338 and co-pending application Ser. No. 07/776,733, filed Jul. 26, 1991. Relevant portions of these two references are incorporated herein by reference., 28589=There is currently underway an effort to apply non-volatile Flash EEPROM memory systems for mass storage applications. For example, they are intended to replace either of the existing fixed or removably floppy magnetic disk systems, or both. Such systems are disclosed in commonly assigned and copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/684,034, filed Apr. 11, 1991, COMPUTER MEMORY CARD HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF EEPROM INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIPS AND MEMORY SYSTEMS WITH SUCH CARDS and Ser. No. 07/736,732 filed Jul. 26, 1991, COMPUTER MEMORY CARDS USING FLASH EEPROM INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIPS AND MEMORY-CONTROLLER SYSTEMS. Relevant portions of these disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. It is now becoming possible to fabricate a few megabytes of Flash EEPROM on a single semiconductor integrated circuit chip. As a result, several megabytes to tens of megabytes of memory can readily be packaged in a physically compact memory card, the size of an ordinary credit card., 25008=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/050,429, filed Jan. 15, 2002, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/887,197, filed Jun. 21, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,381,662, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/241,222, filed Feb. 1, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,724, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/781,539, filed Jan. 9, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,145, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/462,642, filed Jun. 5, 1995, now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/398,856, filed Mar. 6, 1995, now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/151,292 filed Nov. 12, 1993, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/115,428 filed Sep. 1, 1993, now abandoned. Each of the foregoing patents and applications are hereby incorporated herein by this reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the embodiments of this invention that have been described are the preferred implementations, those skilled in the art will understand that variation thereof may also be possible. Therefore, the invention is entitled to protection within the full scope of the appended claims. The feature that a daughter card can be restricted to operate with designated host systems lends itself to many security applications. The analogy as an electronic key and lock system is apparent. For example, this feature can be advantageously employed to provide controlled distribution of commercial software, including computer codes and audio and video materials. The daughter card could be used as the distribution storage medium and, by imposing restriction of use with specific host systems, licensing agreements can be enforced, and unauthorized proliferation can be eliminated. In another embodiment, the identifying data includes an assignable identity code for identifying the daughter card. For example, in combination with data security and/or encryption software and hardware in the comprehensive controller or optional functional components, a secret key can be encoded on the daughter card that allows it to communicate with designated host systems or mother cards only. A preferred implementation is the application of the RSA public-key data encoding scheme in which a matched pair of keys is used. A disclosure of the RSA encryption is given by U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,829, and relevant portions thereof are incorporated herein by reference.",
