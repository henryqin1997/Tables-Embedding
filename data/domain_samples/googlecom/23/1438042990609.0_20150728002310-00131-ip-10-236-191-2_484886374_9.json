Suture retaining washer 1312 is substantially the same as the suture retaining washer 612 described above, except that body 645 and upwardly projecting extensions 655 are omitted, and the at least one suture hole 65 is formed directly in the side wall of downwardly projecting extension 650. Preferably at least two suture holes 65 are provided, and the two suture holes are aligned with one another so as to receive a single suture loop 615 therethrough, such as is shown in FIG. 26. Preferably each suture hole 65 has its entrances and rounded somewhat so as to permit the suture to be slidingly adjusted therethrough prior to fully tightening down bone screw 9. However, suture retaining washer 1312 may, optionally, be constructed so that the head of the bone screw will lock the suture to the washer when the bone screw is fully tightened down. Suture retaining washer 1312 may be secured directly to a bore segment 20, 21 if desired, or it may be secured to a bone plate which is disposed between suture retaining washer 1312 and a bone segment 20, 21. Suture retaining washer 1312 is preferably formed so that it has a diameter substantially the same as the head of a bone screw 9 passing therethrough, so that the washer can fit beneath the head of the bone screw and thereby present a minimal peripheral profile.}",
