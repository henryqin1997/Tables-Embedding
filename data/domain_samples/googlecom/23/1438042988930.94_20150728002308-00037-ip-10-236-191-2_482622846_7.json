It is of course preferable that compression of the signals at a transmitting station, and decompression of the signals at a receiving station, be effected without the necessity of additional equipment., 26596=It is advantageous in many cases to compress video signals by \"lossy\" compression techniques. Such techniques enable the attainment of an increased compression ratio. Such lossy compression techniques are disclosed, for example, in the article \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Gregory K. Wallace et al, submitted in December 1991 for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, as well as a paper by the same name, and of the same authors, that appeared in the April 1991 issue of Communications of the ACM.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been disclosed and described with reference to a limited number of embodiments, it will be apparent that variations and modifications may be made therein, and it is therefor the aim of the present invention to cover each such variation and modification as falls within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The compression of the 8\ufffd8 blocks in this manner thereby employs a wavelet compression technique. The basic compression strategy is one dimensional, first horizontally and then vertically. It takes the pixels, in any given row, for example, and turns that data into a pyramid structure. The apex of the pyramid (i.e. the bottom as illustrated in FIG. 5) corresponds to the average of the pixels, and proceeding toward the base of the pyramid, the differences are taken with respect to the averages of smaller pairs of numbers. The 64 numbers obtained by this technique, i.e. the numbers in the rows and columns of the second substitute matrix, are then encoded by conventional run length encoding techniques for transmission. While, as above discussed, there are some similarities between the compression in accordance with the invention and compression in accordance with the JPEG, the JPEG standard arranges calculated data in a matrix in a manner different than in accordance with the invention, and the JPEG standard calculates the numbers to be encoded and transmitted in manner different than the present invention.
