    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in example specific embodiments, many additional modifications and variations would be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, many modifications may be made by those skilled in the art to the example devices, including for example to the number, size, shape and placement of various chambers, as well as the type, number and configuration of filling manifolds. Other modifications may be made for example to the methods, including the addition of or changing the order of various steps. It is therefore to be understood that the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described. Thus, the present embodiments should be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. The hydrogel filler material gels upon reaching body temperature. Any load placed on the device may be distributed or shared among the different chambers. A pressure gauge on the device or a transducer capable of transmitting a signal to a remote device, indicates to the physician when the chambers have been filled to a desired amount, such that the surgeon stops the flow of the filler material into the chambers after the desired pressure is reached. It is contemplated that the filling (or stoppage thereof) may be somewhat automated, such that filling stops automatically upon a pressure or volume range reaching a pre-set level. Filling may also be stopped by rotating the ball valve 90",
