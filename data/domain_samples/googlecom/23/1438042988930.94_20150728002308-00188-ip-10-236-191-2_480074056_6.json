A standard rubber/plastic compounding 2-roll mill was heated to 325-400\ufffd C. The resin (usually in the form of pellets or granules) was added to the heated roll mill. After about 10 minutes, the resin banded on the rolls (i.e., it melted and fused to the rolls). The coupling agent was then added to the roll mill. After another five minutes, the cellulosic or lignocellulosic fiber was added to",
