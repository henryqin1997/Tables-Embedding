Here an extruder forces the hot liquefied matrix resin through an appropriately shaped die and the inlay resin is introduced into the extruder passage at the downstream end of the extruder worm. To mix the matrix and inlay resins the extruder worm is provided with radially projecting paddles or vanes. Thus the extent of veining or marbleizing is determined mainly by how fast the extruder worm is rotating. When it turns rapidly the veining is fine and when it turns slowly the veining is coarse.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In FIG. 3 the system-is identical to that of FIG. 1 but the inner end of the shaft 5 is pulled back from the axis 10A to be offcenter therein. This system is useful where the matrix-resin mass in the circular-section passage 10 is twisting about the axis 10A due to the effect of the worm 2 as it produces a marked surface patterning. FIG. 2 shows a similar arrangement, but here the shaft 5 has an enlarged frustoconical head 8 formed with a plurality of such openings 7. A bearing 14 is provided to support the shaft 5 in the die 3, and here the axis 5A runs at an acute angle of about 55\ufffd to the axis 10A which it intersects. Otherwise this embodiment is identical to that of FIG. 1. According to the invention the axis 5A is radial to a center axis 10A of the passage 10 and the shaft 5 is journaled in the die 3 so that it can be rotated about this axis 5A by a drive illustrated schematically at 11. Such rotation of the nozzle assembly 4 causes the offcenter opening 7 to eject its inlay resin into the matrix-resin mass in the passage 10 at a location that moves within this matrix-resin mass. An actuator 12 can even be provided to move the nozzle 4 along its axis 5A, that is radially of the die axis 10A,",
