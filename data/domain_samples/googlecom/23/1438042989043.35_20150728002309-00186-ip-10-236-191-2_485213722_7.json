As described previously, the Key Record 307 includes a specific Key ID and a Key value. The Geo-Encrypt function 700 is accessed to geo-encrypt the retrieved Key Record 307 using the Location ID 140 and Export Key ID 1102. It should be appreciated that in this context the Key Record 307 corresponds to the Plaintext being geo-encrypted in the foregoing description with reference to FIG. 7. This results in a Cipher Key Record 1112 that comprises the geo-encrypted Key Record 307 1 along with a corresponding Cipher Key 526, IV 708, and Shape Parm 509. The Sign sub-function 1114 is used to digitally sign the Cipher Key Record 1112 using the private key 308 stored in the key table of the device, and thereby provide the Signature 116. In a preferred embodiment, the Sign sub-function 1114 uses public-key cryptography, as noted above.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{151144=More specifically, the Cipher Key Record 1112 is geo-decrypted using the Geo-Decrypt function 720 with Shape Parm 509, Export Key ID 1102, Cipher Key 526, IV 708, GPS location signal 727, and Cipher Key Record 1112 as inputs to recover the Key Record 307. A Provider ID Verification sub-function 1160 will then determine whether the Provider ID 1152 corresponds to either the Owner ID of the deciphered Key Record 307 or a Geo-encryption Key Authority (GKA) (i.e., an accepted key authority). If the Provider ID 1152 corresponds to one of these, i.e., the Owner ID or the GKA, then the Signature 1116 for the Key Record 307 is validated using a Check Signatures sub-function 1170. The Check Signatures sub-function 1170 validates the Signature 1116 for Key Record 307 using the public key associated with the Provider ID, which would be obtained from the key table using Provider ID 1152 and possibly other information to identify the key. If the Signature 1116 proves to be valid, the Key Record 307 is added to the key table 406 by sub-function 1166. Conversely, if the Provider ID Verification sub-function 1160 determines that the Provider ID 1152 corresponds to neither the Owner ID of the deciphered Key Record 307 or the GKA, the key table 406 is not updated. It should be noted that the public key associated with Provider ID 1152 might itself be validated using a certificate stored with the key in the key table or obtained using any of several methods without altering the scope and spirit of the invention., 42842=This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/699,832, filed Oct. 30, 2000, for SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR USING LOCATION IDENTITY TO CONTROL ACCESS TO DIGITAL INFORMATION, and co-pending patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described a preferred embodiment of a system and method for delivering encrypted information in a communication network using location identity and key tables, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain advantages have been achieved. It should also be appreciated that various modifications, adaptations, and alternative embodiments thereof may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The invention is further defined by the following claims. Key management is often the weakness of a cryptographic system. The present invention addresses this weakness by allowing for the dynamic management of all keys over a network in a secure manner that is transparent to the user and by allowing for the use of public-key cryptography. Also, unlike DRM systems that require separate steps to access both the Ciphertext and the key or license required for decryption, the present invention uses a single digital data acquisition step. The present invention enables producers to actively control and participate in the encryption of their proprietary data, even after release from their protected domain, through their ability to own and control keys in receiver devices 400 and to multi-lock keys so that data can only be unlocked by a final receiver 400 and not by intermediate distributor devices 320. Specifically, digital information can be encrypted in such a way that it can",
