One disadvantage of the circuit of FIG. 5 arises from the direct application of the video signal plus pattern noise S+PN to 1H delay 56. With certain types of delay devices, such as, for example, charge coupled delay devices, high-amplitude noise spikes in the applied signal may be partially attenuated in 1H delay 56 whereas such noise spikes are not attenuated in the undelayed signal fed to subtractor 52. When this occurs, the two sources of pattern noise differ by the amount of attenuation imposed by 1H delay 56. This prevents full cancellation of the pattern noise in pattern noise processor 88. The presence of a low-pass filter upstream of the delay device may be effective to reduce the amplitude of such noise spikes and thus improve the cancellation of pattern noise. Otherwise, the operation of the pattern noise processors of FIGS. 2 and 5 are the same. Referring again momentarily to FIG. 2, it is not necessary to locate low-pass filters 50 and 54 upstream of 1H delay 56 and subtractor 52. Referring now to",
