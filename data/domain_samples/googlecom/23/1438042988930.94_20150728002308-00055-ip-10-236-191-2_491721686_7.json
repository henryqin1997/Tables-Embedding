    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the above has generally described the present invention according to specific systems, the present invention has a much broader range of applicability. In particular, the present invention is not limited to a particular kind of data schema, but can be applied to any data model where an improved or optimized analysis is desired for use with customer centered data warehousing systems and applications. Thus, in some embodiments, the techniques of the present invention could provide access to many different legacy business, governmental and educational databases of all kinds. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. Conclusion In many embodiments, the multi-dimensional model is mapped to a particular relational data model, called the schema, which can be a star schema, or others. A schema is a database organization corresponding to a data model. Records in dimension tables of a relational database can be mapped to a plurality of indices of the dimensions in multi-dimensional model, and the records in a database fact table can be mapped to the measures or data points in the multi-dimensional model. In many embodiments, the data model provides operational performance analysis used in a plurality of corporate-wide decision support applications. Various applications, tools, systems, frameworks, database managers and the like can be embodied as re-usable products based on the meta model, i.e., the multi-dimensional model, and the data model, i.e., the schema",
