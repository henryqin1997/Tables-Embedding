In machine wear analysis, if the machine fluid, such as oil or the like is variated or agitated, it may affect the results which are obtained or make if difficult for the sensors to sense the particles in the fluid. In such environments, a reservoir (not shown) could be provided for storing the fluid prior to analysis so that the fluid is allowed to settle before application to the measurement cells. In the embodiment of FIGS. 8 to 11, instead of using data relating to the metallic particles, the metallic particles could be those ignored and the other particles such as contamination particles could be those specifically considered so the parameter of those particles is determined to provide information concerning the systems which produce the particles. The processor 20 may include image processing software for determining the size of the particles from the first image after the metallic particles in the second image are correlated with and identified in the first image. Thus, by mapping the reflected image on the transmitted image, opaque particles can be identified and the size and other parameters of the opaque particles determined to provide indication of machine wear.
