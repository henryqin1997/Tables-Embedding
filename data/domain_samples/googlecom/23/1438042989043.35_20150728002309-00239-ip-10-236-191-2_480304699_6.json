No. 854,346, filed Apr. 21, 1986, now abandoned., 32177=The reagent may be contained in the spreading layer, the hydrophilic layer and/or the reagent layer which is introduced separately. When the reagent is unstable and it is denatured by contact with air, this reagent is preferably added to an inner layer such as the hydrophilic layer or the reagent layer. When two or more reagents are employed, all reagents may be added to one layer or two or more layers. In the case that the reagent is contained in the spreading layer, it is preferable that the spreading layer is first laminated on the hydrophilic layer, and then the reagent solution is applied thereon as described in the specifications of Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 59-171864, EP 0,162,301 A and EP 0,162,302 A., 27515=The hydrophilic layer is the layer to accumulate the detectable species produced by the reaction with a reagent, and consists of a hydrophilic polymer binder alone or together with other components such as reagents and additives. The hydrophilic layer may also function as a water absorption layer which absorbs water to swell and which receives and accumulates the detectable species, and as a registration layer which contains a mordant having negative charge or positive charge capable of immobilizing the detectable species and which absorbs water to swell. Examples of the hydrophilic polymer binder usable for the hydrophilic layer are gelatin including acid treated gelatin and deionized gelatin, gelatin delivatives such as phthalated gelatin and hydroxyalkyl acrylate grafted gelatin, agarose, pulluran, pullulan derivatives, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. They are disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 59-171864 and EP 0,142,849 A. Thickness of the hydrophilic layer in dry state is usually about 2 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, preferably about 3 \u03bcm to about 50 \u03bcm, particularly preferable about 5 \u03bcm to about 30 \u03bcm. It is preferable that the hydrophilic layer is substantially transparent. This hydrophilic layer may contain the light-scattering particulates described later, and in addition, a part of or whole reagents, a pH buffer composition, a macromolecular pH buffer, a base polymer, an acid polymer, a macromolecular mordant, etc., to be known may also be contained in this layer., 52050=As a comparative slide, the following one was used. A reagent layer being 15 \u03bcm in dry thickness and having the same composition as Example 4 except that titanium dioxide particulates were not added was provided on the PET film in the same manner as Example 4. 8 g of titanium dioxide particulates (Rutile type, particle size; 0.20-0.35 \u03bcm) was added to an aqueous gelatin solution containing 1 g of deionized gelatin, and mixed well. This suspension was applied on the above reagent layer so that its dry thickness became 10 \u03bcm, and dried to form a light-shielding layer. Light transmittance at the wave length of 500 nm and its vicinity of the light-shielding layer was 1.7%. On the light-shielding layer, the same adhesive layer and spreading layer as Example 4 were provided in the same manner as Example 4. The comparative element thus obtained was cut into square pieces, and each piece was placed in the plastic mount to form a chemical-analytical slide for glucose determination in the same manner as Example 4.}",
