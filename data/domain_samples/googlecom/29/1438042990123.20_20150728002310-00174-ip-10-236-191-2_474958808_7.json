An entire disk surface can be dedicated to servo positioning data, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,864,740 to Sordello et al. granted Feb. 4, 1975. Alternatively, servo data can be written in sectors on the same medium surface containing the working data. This technique is called embedded servo and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,185,972 to Sipple, granted May 25, 1965., 20520=This application, entitled TRI-PHASE SERVO PATTERNS, is a continuation-in-part to U.S. application Ser. No. 932,814, filed Nov. 19, 1986, and now U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,135; and a continuation-in-part to U.S. application Ser. No. 800,019, filed Nov. 20, 1985, and now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be clear that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and attain the advantages mentioned as well as those inherent therein. While a presently preferred embodiment of the invention has been described for the purposes of this disclosure, numerous changes can be made which will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention disclosed and as defined in the appended claims. The present invention can be practiced in connection with recording media other than magnetic disks. For example, in any medium capable of assuming two distinguishable states or conditions, including, but not limited to optical systems, servo patterns can be formed in the recording medium as longitudinal arrays, with neighboring longitudinal arrays consisting or servo patterns longitudinally offset from one another. The above described technique for electronically positioning a transducer 20 during the laying of servo tracks can also be used in a system where the mode of reading and writing information is optical rather than magnetic. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the modifications of the present invention necessary for such a mode change. Such modifications are within the scope of the present invention. To make the reverse order of erasure more effective, a second disk (not shown) can be used with sets of data information on both sides of the second disk using",
