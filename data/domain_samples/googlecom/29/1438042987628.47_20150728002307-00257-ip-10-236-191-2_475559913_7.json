No. 820,535 of Robert J. Proebsting, which is incorporated herein by reference. This circuit is illustrated in the fragmented schematic plan view of FIG. 3 wherein corresponding circuit elements are designated by corresponding reference characters. The process for fabricating the circuit of FIG. 3 is described in detail in copending US. Pat. application Ser. No. 567,459 of Crawford and Biard, entitled Binary Decoder filed Jul. 25, 1966, and assigned to the assignee of the present application. The specification of said copending application entitled Binary Decoder\" is incorporated herein by reference. The process generally involves using a single diffusion step to form all of the diffusions of the circuit which are shown in dotted outline and are lightly stippled for emphasis. For example, diffusion 30 forms the common drain for the transistors in the left-hand output column, thus forming product term output P diffusion 32 forms the common drain for the transistors in the second output column, thus forming product output P and diffusion 34 forms the common drain for the transistors in right-hand output column, thus forming product term output P Diffusions 36 and 38 form the common sources for these transistors. Similarly, diffusions 40, 42 and 44 form the drains of the transistors in three output rows which form the sum of product term outputs SP SP and SP respectively. Diffusions 46 and 48 form the common source diffusions for all transistors in the sum of product term generator 16., 9744=IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, April 1965, pp 1107, 1108. 307/304 Moore et al, Metal Oxide Transistor Decode Circuit, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, November 1966, pp 703 & 704. 307/304 Primary Examiner-Stanley T.
