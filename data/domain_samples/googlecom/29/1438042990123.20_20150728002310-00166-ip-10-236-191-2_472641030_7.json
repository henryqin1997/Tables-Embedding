    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the scope of this invention is to be limited only by the appended claims. It is a great advantage to have the user's manual located in a readily accessible manner on controller 2 housing. The user need not go look for the manual in some remote space when some question arises as to the programming or operation of controller 2. In addition, the manual storage is done in an out-of-the way, unobtrusive location, thus enhancing the probability that it will be used for this purpose. . FIG. 2 The rear surface of controller housing 4 includes a rearwardly protruding pocket 96 for holding a user's or operator's manual 98. The depth and size of pocket 96 is Sufficient to allow pocket 96 to be received in the pocket receiving space 83 provided on bracket 6 between side walls 84. Thus, when controller housing 4 is in place on mounting bracket 6, the space 83 between housing 4 and the planar surface 82 of mounting bracket 6 is used to conveniently store the user's manual 98. See the phantom line illustration in The rear surface of controller 2 housing has a bayonet type slot structure 90 for receiving tabs 88 on mounting bracket 6. Basically, each tab 88 is initially received into an open rectangular portion",
