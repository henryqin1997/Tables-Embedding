Nos. 60/268,519 and 60/268,578 both filed Feb. 14, 2001., 37326=In addition to high-voltage transmission lines 102, power distribution system 100 includes medium voltage power lines 120 and low voltage power line 113. Medium voltage is typically from about 1000 V to about 100 kV and low voltage is typically from about 100 V to about 240 V. As can be seen, power distribution systems typically have different voltage portions. Transformers are often used to convert between the respective voltage portions, e.g., between the high voltage portion and the medium voltage portion and between the medium voltage portion and the low voltage portion. Transformers have a primary side for connection to a first voltage and a secondary side for outputting another (usually lower) voltage. Transformers are often referred to as a step down transformers because they typically \u201cstep down\u201d the voltage to some lower voltage. Transformers, therefore, provide voltage conversion for the power distribution system. This is convenient for power distribution but inconvenient for data communication because the transformers can degrade data signals, as described in more detail below., 26687=Moreover, accessing data signals on a power lines is a potential safety concern. Medium voltage power lines can operate from about 1000 V to about 100 kV which can generate high current flows. As such, any electrical coupling to a medium voltage power line is a concern. Therefore, a need exists for a device that can safely communicate data signals with a medium voltage power line and yet provide electrical isolation from the medium voltage power line.}",

Words which have been used herein are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitation. Further, although the invention has been described herein with reference to particular structure, materials and/or embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the particulars disclosed herein. Rather, the invention extends to all functionally equivalent structures, methods and uses, such as are within the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art, having the benefit of the teachings of this specification, may affect numerous modifications thereto and changes may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The invention is directed to directed to a power line coupler and a power line bridge that communicate data signals across a transformer that would otherwise filter the data signals from passing through the transformer. Further, the power line coupler provides high electrical isolation between the transformer primary side and secondary side. The power line coupler can be used to provide data services to residences and service providers. Possible applications include remote utility meter reading, Internet Protocol (IP)-based stereo systems, IP-based video delivery systems, and IP telephony, Internet access, telephony, video conferencing, and video delivery, and the like. at",
