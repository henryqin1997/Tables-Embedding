Lipman; Macmillan Co.; New York, 1912; and The Micro-Organisms Of The Soil; Sir E. John Russell; Longmano, Green & Co.; London, 1923. However, this use consisted for the most part of one or two specific microorganisms or a \"grab bag\" mixture of soil cultures that were not specifically identified or quantified. Some were nothing more than composted manures carrying groups of microorganisms typically found in such waste. The beneficial activity of such unquantified mixtures on the soil resulted in increased crop yields. More recently, there have been more sophisticated microbial formulations and specific characteristics of individual formulations documented. See, e.g., Bilogical Control Of Plant Pathogens; K. Baker, S. Cook, W. H. Freeman & Co.; San Francisco, 1974; Beneficial Bacteria Enhance Plant Growth; T. Suslow, J. Kloepper, M. Schroth, T. Burr, U. California Dir. Agri. Su.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those who are skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications can be made to the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the foregoing description be taken in an illustrative sense, and that the scope of protection be defined by the appended claims. The use of the humectant in these formulations allows a long term thin film application to be made to a crop. Spraying can be made days before an expected frost and still provide excellent thermal stability to both the foliage and crop and at the same time be establishing improved internal organic and inorganic chemical balance to the crop. It has also been observed that the use of foliar sprays consisting also of specific microbial formuations, humic and fulvic acids, and humectants does also provide significant frost/freeze protection to the foliage and crops. This protection is mainly due to the fact that a tenacious thin film of moisture containing high numbers of highly active beneficial microbes provides microbial nucleation sites that effectively allows ice crystals to form. These ice crystals provide a thermal protective barrier against temperatures lower than the freezing point of water. (3.) The greatly increased numbers of beneficial bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes in the soil, 106 to 109 counts/dry gram soil, will raise the temperature in the rhizosphere. This coupled with the greater root mass insulation barrier slows",
