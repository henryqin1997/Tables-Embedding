It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. this is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims. From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to obtain all the ends and objectives herein set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure. FIG. 17 reveals a fourth embodiment generally designated by the reference numeral 310, wherein telescopingly extensible shaft means 311 and 312 are employed as in the case of previously described embodiment 60. However, mode 310 contemplates that the telescoped shaft members bridging through the middle ear terminate in loop-like bases similar to loops 218, 242 previously described in conjunction with embodiment 200. In FIG. 16 a third embodiment has been generally designated by the reference numeral 300. The tympanic membrane assembly 302 is similarly extensibly axially coupled to an oval window assembly 304 to form a bridge across the middle ear. However, assembly 302 includes a ball and socket tympanic membrane anchor as in the case of embodiment",
