Services may extend kinds, so a particular service may use properties and values not included in this document. Extensibility One approach that might help is to use the client libraries we provide rather than to try to construct kinds by hand. The client libraries provide various methods for adding and changing data in an entry of a given kind; see the client library documentation for details. It may be hard to figure out exactly what information you need to include when creating an entry of a particular kind, especially because some elements in the kinds contain other kinds.
