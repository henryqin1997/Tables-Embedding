    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29558=Iontophoresis, therefore, is an active method or system for transdermal delivery of pharmacologically active drugs or ligands in general. Active delivery systems are very different and distinguishable from passive drug delivery systems. Passive systems rely on natural forces and pressures such as diffusion, solubility and/or concentration density gradients for transportation and delivery of the drug or ligand into the tissues of the body; characteristically, passive systems require direct intimate contact of the drug or ligand with the skin of the subject for days or even weeks at a time and rely upon a slow, continuous, delivery of the drug in limited concentration to achieve the therapeutic effect. A detailed description of the variety of uses and inherent limitations of passive drug delivery systems and an evaluation of polymeric formulations for passive devices is provided in Water-Soluble Polymers, N. M. Bikales Editor, Plenum Press, 1973 and in Controlled Release Polymeric Formulations, D. R. Paul and F. W. Harris Editors, American Chemical Society, 1976., 72530=The polymeric matrix 140 illustrated in FIG. 3c is another variant of the structural organization illustrated in FIG. 3a but shows an even more tortuous series of interstitial spaces and a much greater disparity of diameters between the pores 142 and the interconnecting channels 144. The matrix 160 as seen in FIG. 3d is a more extreme example of that in FIG. 3b. The total porosity has been markedly reduced and the differences in size between the comparably large pores 1662 and the greatly diminished interconnecting channels 164 have grown. Assuming, for illustrative purposes only, that the polymeric compositions forming the matrices of FIGS. 3b and 3d are identical, it is apparent that the matrix of FIG. 3d is comparably more dense, less porous, and has a greater variety of size for its pores and interconnecting channels to that in FIG. 3b. While the matrix organization of FIG. 3a may be most desirable, it is expressly understood that all the structural and organization matrices illustrated by FIGS. 3a-3d are useful in the present invention; moreover all other structural variations in format are also suitable for use as the polymeric matrix so long as the minimal critical criteria are met., 86173=The preferred method of making the gel matrix follows the process of U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,907 and comprises making a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone (hereinafter \"VP\") and allylamine (hereinafter \"AlA\") by free-radical polymerization. As used hereinafter, the term copolymer is coextensive with the definition in the prior art patents and includes all polymerizations of vinyl pyrrolidone monomer with any olefinic amine regardless of carbon chain length so long as it contains at least one unsaturated bond regardless of molar proportions. It is preferred that the unsaturated bond be in the alpha position as exemplified by allylamine. Reaction between the VP and the AlA is expected to occur at any molar ratio of VP:AlA ranging from 1:2 to greater than 1000:1, the preferred VP:AlA molar ratio ranging from 5:1 to 100:1 with a 25:1 ratio being optimal. The formed copolymer can have an average molecular weight ranging from 100 to 2 million daltons but preferably has a molecular weight in the range from 1,000 to 50,000 daltons, with an optimum molecular weight in the range from 5,000 to 25,000 daltons. It will be appreciated that the heaviest average molecular weight compositions for the copolymer are obtained when the VP:AlA molar ratio approaches infinity. However, with increasing molecular weight, the copolymer also becomes increasingly viscous and difficult to manipulate. For this reason, the 5,000-25,000 dalton compositions are most desirable., 66841=The matrix material is preferably a polymeric composition which may be composed of a single monomer which has been cross-linked or be comprised of a copolymer (formed by the union of at least two distinct compounds) which is itself then cross-linked by one or more specific agents to form a polymer. The geometric configuration of the polymeric matrix may be varied to meet the user's need or convenience, but it is preferable that the average thickness of the matrix be minimized--most preferably in the range of one to two millimeters, or failing that, be kept as thin as possible. Although two different chemical formulations are described herein as the preferred compositions for use as the polymeric matrix, the essential criterion which renders a composition, formulation, or material suitable for use within the present invention remains porosity, hydrophilicity, the ability to support a confluent aqueous phase, and demonstrable evidence of an initial ohmic resistance of (exclusive of conveyance means) not more than 500 ohms in the presence of one or more electrically conductive salt solutions whose concentration in total is not substantially more than 1.0% weight-to-volume. For this reason, many presently known compositions, formulations, and materials (natural and synthetic) now used for non-therapeutic applications, are expected to be suitable for use within the present invention. Many are polymers described in the literature both specifically and as general classes of compositions. Exemplifying such compilations are the texts of Yale L. Meltzer entitled Water Soluble Polymers, Development Since 1978, Noyes Data Corporation, 1981 and Water-Soluble Polymers, Noyes Data Corporation, 1972. As has been shown by these texts, the different classes of polymers believed useful as polymeric matrices in the present invention include the following: acrylamide polymers, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid polymers, alkyds, butadienes, carboxylic products, cellulose ethers and other cellulose products, epoxy products, ethylene oxide polymers an related products, fluoropolymers, formaldehyde products, gelatin and gelatin products, inorganic products, natural gums, polyamides and polyamids, polyesters, polyethylene, glycol derivatives, polyethylamine and related products, polysiloxanes and related products, polyurethane products, polyvinyl, alcohol and related products, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and related products, and similar polymeric compositions which do not easily fit into one of the aforementioned classes. As will be recognized, the two preferred specific embodiments of polymeric matrices useful in the present electrode apparatus as reservoirs are individually from different classes: to wit, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymer and a methacrylate polymer. Each of these will be described in detail., 38090=Only recently has there been any departure from the classical approach with regard to the materials which may be suitable for use as the reservoir in an iontophoretic electrode. For example, Jacobsen et al., demonstrated that some gels comprising as karaya gum and other polysaccharides are nominally useful as reservoir materials if the thickness-to-width ratio is restricted to about 1:10 [U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,274]. A secondary development by Jacobsen et al., was an electrode having a discrete chamber or enclosure for the dispersion of a drug within a liquid carrier prior to driving the ions through a microporous membrane for migration into the subject [U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,092]; this particular device has been commercialized by Motion Control, Inc. and commercial embodiments are now available to the public. The use of agar-agar gels in a cup-like receptacle for ionized drug delivery has also been described [U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,529]; unfortunately, agar-agar has been found to degrade upon addition of galvanic current and thus delivers degradation byproducts such as proteins and iodine to the targeted site concomitantly with delivery of the drug. Often these byproducts are unwanted or are undesirable in the subject., 103113=The subject is a human person having a peripheral motor nerve deficit. The muscle tissue is to be stimulated directly using direct current applied via the electrode assembly of FIG. 1. The transmitting or stimulating active electrode is placed over the involved muscle. The indifferent active electrode is positioned at the same site parallel to the first at a distance of 3-4 centimeters. Direct current is applied to each electrode as a square waveform with a frequency of 1-10 hertz and a pulse duration in the range from 500-1000 microseconds with a current intensity of 20-40 milliamperes for 30 minutes. The working ranges allow for adjustments to be made with respect to the location, size and condition of the muscle being stimulated. The DC electrical stimulation retards atrophy of the musculature and prevents adhesion of the muscle to the surrounding connective tissues via repetitive contractions., 90770=The preferred method of making the polymeric matrix gel combines concentrated copolymer solutions ranging from 20-40 weight percent of the final preparation with a cross-linking agent in concentrations from 0.05-1.00 weight percent and a surface active agent added in concentration of 0.1-1.0%. The preferred cross-linking agent is glutaraldehyde. Other cross-linking agents suitable for use are dialdehyde derivatives of short chain, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as malonic acid, succinic acid and adipic acid. The combining of cross-linking agent and aqueous copolymer/surfactant solution as a reaction mixture is best performed at room temperature followed preferably by casting of this fluid reaction mixture into a mold or other tangible form of specified geometry and predetermined dimensions for gelation. A gel matrix of firm consistency is formed within a time period controllable for up to 30 minutes, but is preferably formed within 3-10 minutes reaction time. The factors controlling the speed of gelation are: the concentration of copolymer in the reaction mixture; the concentration of cross-linking agent in the reaction mixture; and the pH of the reaction mixture. Increasing the concentration of the copolymer and/or cross-linking agent shortens the time required for gelation. Similarly, increasing the pH of the mixture decreases gelation time. Conversely, lowering the concentrations of copolymer and/or cross-linking agent or lowering the pH of the reaction mixture increases gelation time., 37443=This melange, comprising the electrode proper, was then placed over the target area. The skin in this area was previously massaged with the ionized ligand in ointment form, or washed with a towel previously soaked in the medicated solution if it was dispersed in a fluid. Galvanic current was conveyed to the reservoir material using alligator chips attached to the tin foil backing and/or by lead wires attached to the current source. [Shriber, W. J., A Manual of Electrotherapy, 4th ed., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1978; Kovacs, R., Electrotherapy And Light Therapy, 6th ed., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1949, p. 156]., 25680=Another, completely different, application of electrical energy is low-voltage neuromuscular stimulation to restore or improve the function of efferent motor nerve units. In these neuromuscular applications, alternating current (AC) sources are used to directly stimulate the efferent motor nerve structures in the muscle tissue and are often supplemented by direct current (DC) stimulation of denervated muscles. Neuromuscular stimulation is most beneficial in those instances in which natural muscle function is lost or diminished due to trauma; the use of electrical current offers restoration of function using artificial stimulation, directly encourages volitional effort on the part of the patient to maintain the muscle's contractility and nutritional requirements, and acts as partial blockers of noxious inputs. Although the earliest experimental work was performed by Reid in 1841 at the University of Edinborough, much controversy regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of electrical muscle stimulation followed which was resolved only about forty years ago [Fischer, An Jour. Physiol. 127: 605 (1939); Gutman et al., Lancet 1: 169 (1942); Liebesny, Arch. Phys. Ther. 23: (1942); Hines et al, Arch. Phys. Ther. 24: 69 (1943)]. Today, the recognized therapeutic values include: restoration of tone to injured muscles; prevention of intermuscular and intramuscular adhesions; the ability to keep the tendons and other parts moving so they do not become adherent to contiguous structures; and, above all, the ability to increase the blood supply to the injured tissues thereby accelerating the rate of repair by rapidly promoting absorption of waste products., 31579=Unfortunately, subsequent research and development of iontophoretic apparatus has focused predominantly on the parameters of using galvanic current with relatively little attention, if any, to the effects and deficiencies of the material serving as the reservoir holding the ionized drug in the electrode and/or the condition of the skin or targeted tissue in the person receiving the medication [Kovacs, R., Electro Therapy And Light Therapy, 6th ed., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1949, pp. 153-165]. As a result, a series of axiomatic principles for iontophoresis have evolved and been so generally accepted as being now virtually incontestible. These axioms are: (1) Ions move at a fixed rate of speed which increases with the voltage applied to the electrode; as a corrollary, the current intensity (in millamperes) used in iontophoresis should generally be the maximum current that can be tolerated by the patient with a minimal of discomfort. (2) Ions, without regard to molecular weight, cannot and do not migrate far below the surface of the skin (epidermis and dermis) and consequently medication via iontophoresis is essentially a local or intradermal form of treatment; systemic effects, if any, are an exception and are not to be expected. (3 ) The time necessary for ionized drug transfer will vary with the characteristics and the potency of the specific drug; a therapeutic treatment period, regardless of electrode construction will vary nominally from five minutes to several hours or even days in duration. (4) The reservoir material in the electrode containing the ionized drug in solution should be an absorbent material of substantial thickness or take the form of a medicated water bath; the concentration of all drugs in solutions retained and held by the reservoir material within the electrode should be one percent or less as no advantage is gained by increasing the concentration of the drug in solution above this 1% level. [Kovacs, R., Electrotherapy And Light Therapy, 6th ed., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1949; Kahn, J., Low Voltage Technique, 3rd ed., New York, 1978; Shriber, W. J., A Manual Of Electrotherapy, 4th ed., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1978].}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated that the modes described above comprise active ligand delivery systems in combination with passive delivery systems, and with means for electrical stimulation of nerves and muscles. The effects of using active ligand delivery systems with these other AC and DC therapies provide benefits unavailable and unknown heretofore. Each individually and in combination is within the scope of the present invention as a whole. Recognizing that many operational parameters may be now selected to meet the user's need or convenience, the invention is not to be restricted in form or limited in scope except by the claims appended hereto. The HEMA and PVP polymeric compositions, being nontoxic and biocompatible, provide matrices which may be surgically implanted in vivo within tissues. The electrode, comprising the conductive member and the polymeric matrix (containing a pharmacologically active ligand), may be implanted subcutaneously in tissues with major benefits. For example, any surgical procedure with a likelihood of post operative scarring can be effectively controlled by implanting a polymeric matrix containing beta-aminoproprionitrile fumarate into the tissue immediately before closing the surgical field; the electrical leads from the conductive member will extend from beneath the skin to an external source of electrical energy. Application of direct current will deliver sufficient quantities of the drug locally to prevent scarring; during interim periods, the matrix will act passively to continuously deliver small amounts of the drug as well.
