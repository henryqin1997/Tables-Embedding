The processor/controller 64 includes non-volatile memory 61 for a plurality of purposes, one of which is to report back to a central processing unit and to provide a record of gaming device activity as a function of several parameters. The processor/controller is influenced by the spin button 52 as mentioned above and the max bet button 54 as well as being operatively conditioned by input 24 via tokens, coins, currency, credit cards or other similar instrumentalities. Quit button 50 and cash out button 48 also drive the processor/controller 64. The processor/controller also controls the first and second displays which, if mechanical contrivances are operatively coupled to stepping motors 60, 62 and, if video depictions, are driven by software by a graphic user interface emanating from the processor/controller and to the monitor displays. Referring to FIG. 3, a second variation 100 of the machine is shown. Like numerals directed to like parts will not be belabored. As before, the first display 6 has",
