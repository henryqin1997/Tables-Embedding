    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7899=Analysis of single labeled neuron number revealed no significant difference (p<0.05) between control and light treated groups, suggesting no difference in labeling efficacy between groups (FIGS. 3 a, b, c). The average number of HM labeled neurons is 8,860+/\u22123408 in the control group and 13,270+/\u22123236 in the light treated group, which is comparable to the number of CST axons reported in the lower thoracic region of the spinal cord [Brosamle, C. et al., J Comp Neurol 386:293-303 (1997); Hicks, P. et al., Exp Neurol 56: 410-420 (1977)]. The average number of fast blue labeled neurons is 128.9 +/108.6 in the control group and 130.9+/\u2212119.8 in the light treated group, which is comparable to the number of neurons found in the motor cortex after injection of a retrograde tracer into the ventral, uncrossed portion of the CST at vertebral level L4 [Brosamle, C. et al., J Comp Neurol 386:293-303 (1997)]. Fast blue has been shown to spread approximately 2 mm from its injection site [Kalderon, N. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93:11179-11184 (1996)], therefore neurons in laminae IH-VI, where ventral CST axons terminate; may have taken up the tracer. Since crossed and uncrossed axons of the CST originate from the same area of the motor cortex [Brosamle, C. et al., supra (1997)], it is likely that these fast blue labeled neurons are from the ventral, uncrossed CST that was not lesioned in the surgical procedure. The uncrossed CST axons, however, do not play a significant role in motor function in the rat [Whishaw, Q et al., Behav Brain Res 134:323-36 (2002)].}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59721=Light therapy (LT), also known as photo-biomodulation or low power laser irradiation (LPLI), is a non-invasive treatment which evokes biological effects via the absorption of light. LPLI has been shown to increase neuronal survival and regeneration in the peripheral nervous system [Anders, et al., Surg. Med, 13:72-82 (1993), Snyder, et al., Surg. Med, 31:216-222 (2002)]. Investigation has shown that LT, through the absorption of light by a cellular photoreceptor, rather than a heating effect on the cell [Anders, et al., Surg. Med. 13:72-82, (1993), and Mochizuki-Oda, et al., Neurosci. Lett. 323:207-210 (2002)]; can modulate ATP, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, depending on the treatment parameters applied [Saperia, et al., Biochem. Biophys: Res. Commun. 138:1123-1128 (1986); Greco, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 163:1428-1434 (1989); Lam, et al., Lasers Life Sci. 1:61-77 (1986); Funk, et al., J. Photochem. Photobiol. B:BBiol. 16:347-355 (1992); Mochizuki-Oda, et al., Supra (2002)]. Unlike treatment of acute SCI with corticosteroids, LPLI is not associated with side effects of increased infection risk and/or glucose intolerance., 122555=These measurements suggest that LT promotes significant improvement in specific CST controlled functions after lesioning, and demonstrate particular improvement in functions mediated by innervation from the L1-L3 vertebral level. Although in some cases the percentage of injured neurons that regrow is small, studies have shown that functional improvement can be found with very small amounts of axonal regrowth. [Kalderon & Fuks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:11179-84 (1996), Nash et al., J. Neurosci., 22:7111-20 (2002), Kalderon & Fuks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:11185-90 (1996), Bregman, Functional Neural transplantation., eds. Dunnett & Bj\ufffdrklund (Raven Press, New York, pp. 489-529 (1993)), The examples described above and in further detail below confirm the observable functional improvements seen., 141836=One week prior, and 1 and 9 weeks after dorsal hemisection surgery, the same rats undergoing retrograde labeling were trained and then tested on two functional tests. One test required rats to walk across a ladder beam (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio) that recorded the length of time required to cross the beam as well as the number of footfalls. This test was videotaped for confirmation. Rats also underwent footprint analysis: handpass were dipped in ink and the rats walked across sheets of white paper. Base of support, stride length and angle of rotation were analyzed as described previously [Kunkel-Bagden, E et al., Exp Neurol 119:153-164 (1993); Hamada Y, et al., J Neurochem 66:1525-1531 (1996)]., 141257=Beginning immediately after transection of the CST, half of the rats (randomly assigned; n=15/group), were transcutaneously irradiated at the lesion site for a total of 14 consecutive days with an 810 nm diode laser (Thor International, UK; 150 mW output through a delivery fiber optic, 2,997 seconds treatment time/day). Dosage was 1589 J/cm2 per day (irradiance=0.53 W/cm2, 450 J)., 37038=This application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/820,443, filed Apr. 7, 2004, now abandoned, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/460,421, filed Apr. 7, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 133877=An incoherent broad band white light was directed at the surface of the skin in the low thoracic region of five adult Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/Kg, I.P.(intraperitoneal)) prior to all measurements. A smart, tissue-activated optical fiber probe [Ilev, I et al., Proc Spie 4616:220-228 (2002)] was inserted sequentially into the skin, sub-cutaneous connective tissue layer, deep connective tissue layer, muscle and the spinal cord within the vertebral column. At each of these layers, a transmission spectrum in the range of 500-1200 nm was collected while white light was applied to the skin surface., 116011=In another embodiment, injured rat spinal cord is transcutaneously irradiated at the lesion site for a total of 14 days with an 810 nm diode laser (Thor International, UK) with 150 mW output through a delivery fiber optic (2,997 seconds treatment time/day). The daily dosage was 1589 J/cm2 (irradiance =0.53 W/cm2, 450 J)., 57837=Although axons have the ability to regrow following injury, the spinal cord environmental factors may affect this regrowth. Studies of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients suggest that secondary immunological and vascular effects of SCI cause a greater impairment to recovery than the primary insult to the spinal cord. [Fitch, et al. J. Neurosci., 19:8182-8198 (1999), Dusart and Schwab, Eur. J. Neurosci., 6:712-724 (1994), Koshinaga and Whittemore, J. Neurotrauma, 12:209-222 (1995), and Popovich, et al., J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., 61:623-633 (2002)] Researchers have investigated the invasion and activation of immune cells as a potential mediator of secondary injury, including neutrophils, macrophages, microglia, astrocytes and T and B lymphocytes [Dusart and Schwab, Eur. J. Neurosci., 6:712-724 (1994)]. These cells are primarily activated or drawn into the lesion area by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expressed following injury [Barholdi and Schwab, Eur. J. Neurosci., 9:1422-1438 (1997), Beneviste, Am. J. Physiol. 263:C1-C16 (1992), Klusman and Schwab, Brain Res., 762:173-184 (1997), Pan, et al., Neurosci. Res., 68:315-322 (2002)]. Recent evidence suggests that alteration of cell invasion and activation after SCI may improve functional recovery of spinal cord patients. Vascular effects from breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), cytotoxic swelling, hemorrhage and neovascularization may also play a role in the recovery of spinal cord patients. Other secondary phenomena include calcium-, free radical-, nitric oxide- and glutamate-mediated cell injury. It is not known whether the neuronal and axonal changes that occur with SCI, such as demyelination, Schwannosis and Wallerian degeneration, are primary or secondary to these pathological processes.}",
