Various features of the invention have been particularly shown and described in connection with the illustrated embodiment of the invention, however, it must be understood that these particular arrangements merely illustrate and that the invention is to be given its fullest interpretation within the terms of the appended claims. Although the preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described in connection with a particular type of cell, it can be adapted for use with a variety of anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, and current collectors. The manner in which cells are constructed can be governed by the choice of these materials. Gravure printing is preferred because it allows for metering the thickness of the application of inks. Ink can be repeatedly applied to the desired thickness with the most constant and exact application. Another preferred method of applying ink is flexographic printing. Other methods are known to one of ordinary skill in the art that include rotary screen printing and letter press. The printing method is a function of the amount of ink required for the specific application. Existing converting equipment (besides printing, coating, and laminating) allows other operations to be performed in-line, such as folding, die cutting, embossing, and inserting. For example, a battery, a capacitor, and a coil can be printed on a flexible film across the web, then folded",
