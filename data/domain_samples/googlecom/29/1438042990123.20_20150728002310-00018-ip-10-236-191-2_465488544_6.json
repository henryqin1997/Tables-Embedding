This has the effect of slipping the data by 1/6 chip with respect to the PRC. As the processor is executing the algorithm at a multiple of the sample rate, greater resolution is possible.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention embodiments herein described are done so in detail for exemplary purposes only, and may be subject to many different variations in design, structure, application and operation methodology. Thus, the detailed disclosures therein should be interpreted in an illustrative, exemplary manner, and not in a limited sense. In sum, the implementation described provides a means for realizing a digitized direct sequence receiver using modest computational processors. Excellent performance is achieved for interference rejection using digital filters which have no parallel in the analog art. Real time and parallel phase alignment of the PRC code is possible limited only by the computational burden of the product. Dynamic thresholding techniques improve detection and trip allowing the signal to be detected and demodulated at low signal to noise ratios. Reallocatable computational resources provide the means to allow for frequency uncertainty in the transmitter without suffering excessive noise bandwidth penalties in the receiver. Following detection, the DSP resources can be reassigned in real time to drop some of the less interesting channels to free up computational resources. The resources can be directed toward better filters centered on the received signal to effectively center the noise bandwidth on the signal thus maximizing SNR. Feedback is provided from the demodulation or revisit firmware as to the success of detecting preamble at tripped channels. A False Positive trip counter is maintained for each trip algorithm and an adaptive threshold is kept to",
