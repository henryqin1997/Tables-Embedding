The first base key 20 a preferably has a length no greater than the threshold number of bits, t (e.g., 64 bits), and is based on a pseudo-random function of at least a first pre-shared key 20 c and a first computed private key 20 d. It should be understood that the first base key 20 a may be based on additional information, such as specified IPSEC control parameters. The first pre-shared key 20 c is not sent between the first and second network devices 12, 14, but is rather previously distributed to and shared by each of them. Preferably, but not necessarily, the first computed private key 20 d is a Diffie-Hellman key created through the well-known Diffie-Hellman algorithm. For more information on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and its keys, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,770 to Hellman et al. and \u201cNew Directions in Cryptography,\u201d Diffie et al., IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-22, No. 6, November 1976, both of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{43655=Other members of the IPSEC suite of protocols include the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (\u201cISAKMP\u201d), the ISAKMP Domain of Interpretation (\u201cDOI\u201d), and OAKLEY. ISAKMP provides detailed protocol descriptions and packet formats for IKE. The packet formats are created through the use of over a dozen different payload formats, which may appear in various combinations. Each payload holds a particular type of data used in key exchange, and contains a pointer to the next payload in the packet. By stringing together a series of these payloads, ISAKMP packets can contain all of the data necessary for a particular IKE message. ISAKMP also defines the processing requirements for each header. For more information on ISAKMP, see RFC 2408, specifically incorporated herein by reference., 45067=OAKLEY describes a family of canonical key exchange sequences and the security properties of each. Only a subset of the OAKLEY exchanges are used with IKE. The strengths of various encryption groups are presented as well. OAKLEY also discusses deriving new keys from existing keys and some protocol issues, such as how to handle message timeouts and how to format certain values. Overall, OAKLEY focuses on the mathematical side of key exchange, and serves as a guide for implementing protocols. For more information on OAKLEY, see RFC 2412, specifically incorporated herein by reference., 44495=Some packet formats and field values are not defined in ISAKMP, but instead are defined in the ISAKMP DOI. The ISAKMP DOI (also referred to as the IPSEC DOI, or just the DOI) defines an IPSEC-specific interpretation of certain parts of ISAKMP headers and payloads. For example, the DOI defines how to interpret ISAKMP fields that refer to specific encryption and authentication algorithms, and defines packet formats for holding IP addresses. For more information on ISAKMP DOI, see RFC 2407, specifically incorporated herein by reference., 80570=More specifically, IPSEC defines two security services, each having an associated header that is added to an IP packet that it protects. The two security services are an Authentication Header (\u201cAH\u201d) and an Encapsulating Security Payload (\u201cESP\u201d) header. The AH provides authentication and integrity protection for IP packets. For more information on the AH, see RFC-2402, specifically incorporated herein by reference. The ESP provides encryption protection as well as optional authentication and integrity protection. For more information on the ESP, see RFC-2406, specifically incorporated herein by reference. It should be understood, however, that more or fewer security services may also be used with IPSEC and the network security system of the present invention., 42109=IKE also allows the use of a public-key infrastructure, which is an architecture that allows entities to place their public key(s) into certificates. These certificates are data structures that bind the public key(s) to the entity. The binding is achieved by having a trusted third party (i.e., a certification authority (\u201cCA\u201d)) digitally \u201csign\u201d an entity's certificate. Typically, the CA will first verify that the public-key belongs to the entity through some out-of-band means, such as a phone call or a physical meeting. Thus, any second entity that trusts the CA will be reasonably assured of the certificate's veracity. By the establishment of a hierarchy of CAs, anyone with Internet access will be able to verify the public key of an entity that offers a certificate. Entities may store their certificates in public databases to ease retrieval. IKE typically uses such a public-key infrastructure in order for participants to authenticate themselves to one another when using public-key cryptography. The public-key infrastructure currently being standardized for the Internet is based on the framework set forth in the International Telecommunications Union Recommendation X.509, specifically incorporated herein by reference. For more information on Internet X.509 security certificates, see RFC-2459, specifically incorporated herein by reference. For more information on X.509 security certificate management, see RFC-2510 and RFC-2511, both of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference., 40812=The applications of IPSEC are numerous, including virtual private networks (\u201cVPNs\u201d), secure remote access, email privacy, and electronic commerce. However, in order for two network devices to communicate securely, they must be able to exchange keying material, typically over an insecure channel. Indeed, secure key exchange is an integral prerequisite of the IPSEC set of Internet security standards, and a comprehensive suite of protocols for allowing secure key exchange have been developed. The IPSEC standard for secure key exchange is the Internet Key Exchange (\u201cIKE\u201d) protocol. IKE allows two hosts to derive session keys via a series of messages that provide authentication and protection against flooding, replay, and spoofing attacks. IKE relies on the same cryptographic innovations that power most network security systems: public-key cryptography, such as Diffie-Hellman exchanges and RSA public-key/private-key pairs, symmetric-key cryptographic ciphers (e.g., data encryption algorithm (\u201cDES\u201d), triple DES (\u201c3DES\u201d), and international data encryption algorithm (\u201cIDEA\u201d)), and hashing algorithms for authentication (e.g., MD5 and secure hash algorithm (\u201cSHA\u201d)). For more information on IKE, see RFC 2409, specifically incorporated herein by reference., 40084=As known in the art, Internet Protocol is a common addressing protocol designed to facilitate the routing of traffic within a network or between networks. For more information on IP, see RFC 791, specifically incorporated herein by reference. Currently, a number of security options exist for Internet users implementing IP, including the Internet Protocol Security (\u201cIPSEC\u201d). IPSEC is a set of protocols for implementing security for communications on networks through the use of cryptographic key management procedures and protocols. For more information on IPSEC, see Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d), Requests For Comments (\u201cRFC\u201d) 2401, specifically incorporated herein by reference.}",
