Rather, the examples serve as a basis for understanding the inventive method and device of dynamically advertising selective information. The situations where the device is introduced and the characteristics by which the advertising information may be dynamically altered may be changed to any advertising situation without departing from the intended purpose of the invention as described herein. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above device and methods may incorporate any changes with sound engineering and advertising judgment without departing from the general scope of this invention. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. [0065] With reference now to FIG. 5, the intelligent advertising device 1 may monitor wireless communication signatures, which may be cellular phone signatures. The logic processing unit 9 may include electronic circuitry adapted to read the signatures from passers-by whether in vehicles or otherwise. In that the use of electronic circuitry to monitor wireless communication signatures is well known in the art no further explanation will be offered at this time. In this embodiment, the intelligent advertising device 1 may gather information",
