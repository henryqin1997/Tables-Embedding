    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17755=The finest cloth dolls made during the period 1870-1910 came from Germany with Kathe Kruse as one of the first to make dolls that looked like real children. In 1919 Madame Lenci of Italy commissioned well-known Italian artists to create a series of doll faces. A patented process using pressed felt formed these dolls which were also dressed in elaborate coordinating felt clothes., 16601=Dolls have been made of a vast selection of materials from cookie dough and wood and wood pulp to fabrics and compositions of all types, including the most advanced plastics. The present invention concerns itself with both composition, cloth and plastic fabrics and cloth over plastic substrates in the manufacture of dolls. Historically, well known early cloth dolls have included the \"Mothers Congress Doll\" (imprinted features), \"Kaptin Kiddo\" (1909 comic strip doll) and \"Dolly Dingle\" rag and paper dolls used to promote newspapers. \"Liberty Belle\" with a bell dress was designed to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the United States. Liberty of London made cloth dolls of historical characters from druids to archbishops (1920). Coronation dolls of George VI and his Queen were made in 1936. Cloth \"Kewpie\" dolls were introduced in the 1930's (U.S. Pat. No. 1,785,800). Movie box office fame resulted in Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse \"Character Dolls\" whereas classic rag dolls were modeled after characters in child classic books, i.e. Raggedy Anne and Raggedy Andy., 14601=This is a continuation of my co-pending application Ser. No. 848,389 filed Apr. 4, 1986, abandoned., 18156=In 1939 a series of dolls produced by Effanbee were called \"America's Children\", \"Look-alike\" and \"Portrait Dolls.\" Dewey Cochran developed several basic face shapes to complement these doll concepts. Three sets of 30 of these dolls were used to represent the history of America. Effanbee currently produces vinyl plastic \"representative\" dolls of famous personages including Winston Churchill, Teddy Roosevelt, and movie stars such as John Wayne and Clark Gable. Shirley Temple \"resemblance\" dolls were the most successful personality dolls of the 1930's.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the specification and drawing figures there has been set forth preferred embodiments of the invention and although specific terms have been employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being defined in the following claims. The methodology of the invention is not applicable solely to the doll, mannequin, humanoid and animal toy arts in its head and/or whole body look-alike reproductions. It may utilize two camera front and side (or back) simultaneous photography. It applies to other imprinted fabric items bearing look-alike human and animal representations, bas relief imagery for T-shirts and other articles of apparel, whole body fully-clothed representations and silhouette representations, posturized representations and humorous combinations of head and body art and craft forms. The computer methodology of the invention can also manipulate the realistic human image information to produce idealized, dollized and babyized representations of human subjects. The imprinted fabric items bearing look-alike human and animal representations may be supplied directly to craft artisans in kit form for hand finishing. Further, the head and body representations can be printed out as print transfers on sheet plastic materials and waxed paper materials and heat-transferred to print-accepting fabric materials covering head and body substrates. The application of needlework and other hand crafting media to imprinted flat fabric items can lend a three-dimensional shading appearance to such items and accentuate features.",
