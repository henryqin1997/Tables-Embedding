No. 08/226,783, filed Apr. 12, 1994, which is now abandoned., 46664=One method of determining the position of mobile units, such as freight hauling vehicles, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,926 (the '926 patent), entitled DUAL SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM, issued May 21, 1991, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and which is herein incorporated by reference. The system of the '926 patent relies upon the theory of trilateration in, for example, the determination of mobile vehicle position. Trilateration prescribes that if the position of three objects are known relative to each other, and the distance from each these three objects to a fourth object is known, then the three dimensional position of the fourth object can be determined within the coordinate frame which described the position of the first three objects.}",

No - Relays will not be recommended in conjunction with suggested swaps.Window Specifies the maximum time during which a tractor under load will be allowed to wait at a swap location for a swap opportunity.Swap Lead Time Indicates the amount of time required by a dispatch operator to coordinate a swap operation among the drivers involved (e.g. 1.5 hrs.). Swaps will not be recommended if insufficient time exists for such coordination.Cutoff Time Limits the time period in which position information received via satellite is allowed to be used in computing pick-up ETA, delivery ETA, and so forth.Time Remaining to Delivery Prevents loads from being swapped when less than the specified time remains prior to delivery of at least one of the loads to be swapped.Minimum",
