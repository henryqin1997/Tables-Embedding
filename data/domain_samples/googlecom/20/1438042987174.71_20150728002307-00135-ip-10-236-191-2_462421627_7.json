One way to optimize the synchronization task, is to maintain a list or log of all modifications to the catalog. A transaction list is then distributed to customer sites, rather than the entire catalog., 35438=H. Pajak, Electronic Library, European Patent Application No. 472070 (filed Aug. 9, 1991) discloses an electronic library metaphor on a computer workstation that includes shared books with data base metaphor, a reference books metaphor, and a card catalog metaphor in one system that allows large object oriented data base be organized and accessed in an exclusive environment and that allows access to screen icons, creates a visual hierarchy of related and shared objects, and allows mutually exclusive access to the metaphors within the library., 72972=Catalog Collection Item: The item that defines the information collection node, contains information about the specific piece of information that is returned to the user when requested. May consist of one or more Info Items., 36850=An Information Retrieval System, European Patent Application No. 774722 (filed Nov. 15, 1996) provides a system in which design and content are separated. In this system, an information retrieval server (IR) indexes and searches stories in titles. INdexing takes place when a title is released to the network by a publisher workstation. The IR server inter-relates title, section, and story objects by their globally unique identifiers and creates a routing table which is used to located objects across multiple database partitions. The IR search service is requested in two different way at customer runtime. The first way is the resolution of the search objects to retrieve matching stories. The retrieved stories are concatenated and poured into the area defined by the dynamic control when the title is viewed. In the second way, the IR search service is requested when a search is initiated by a customer using a \"find\" dialog to search across all stories in one or more titles, both dynamic and static., 108783=FIG. 6 is a block diagram of information platform favorites breakdown according to the invention. More specifically, FIG. 6 identifies the flow with regard to client viewing and manipulation of favorites 2880. This operation is discussed in greater detail below., 36006=S -Y Hsu, Process For Identifying Simple and Complex Objects From Fused Images And Map Data, U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,970 (May 20, 1997) discloses a method of identifying and/or extracting an object from multiple fused information sources, such as amps and images. The systems allows a user to integrate information freely from multiple sources, such as maps, socioeconomic data, and various types of images. Data is first retrieved and then processed to transform its pixel representation to a region representation. The region representation is then refined by merging mechanisms, such as segmentation. The identified and/or extracted object can then be visualized by the user. Features or objects can then be extracted using the user's expert rules and confidence levels, which confidence levels may be derived by fuzzy logic.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the claims included below. An Active-X interface allows the client to retrieve a generated fully structured HTML document of the original one. It also allows the client to retrieve information about any block in the document using regular expressions. The retrieved data may be requested as text only or as HTML. A list 363 of high level blocks is created from these virtual and non-virtual HTML tags. These blocks resemble sections, subsections, paragraphs, tables, images, sentences. The HTML Parser creates one container for all the virtual and non-virtual HTML tags and enumerates all the tags properly in the document. For instance, all rows are numbered within a table. All row elements are numbered within a table. The Text Parser combines all the virtual HTML tags from all the parsed paragraphs and then passes them back to the HTML Parser. The Paragraph Parser generates virtual HTML tags and returns a list of such tags to the Text Parser. The Paragraph parser then uses the Line and Phrase calculators 367, 368 to identify the possible structure of the paragraph; if it is a table, it creates an HTML",
