In this approach, all the components and the method of operations are virtually the same as in the above-described embodiment with one exception. The light-pipe knife 44 is replaced with a smoothing knife 44' having a vertical plane 66 through which a curing laser beam 68 scans immediately behind and parallel across the width of the smoothing knife 44'. As depicted in FIG. 7, as the smoothing knife 44' moves forward the bottom edge 46 thereof pushes the polymer 12 ahead of it and only the exact thickness desired moves into the space between the bottom edge 46 and the surface below it as in the previous embodiment. Because of its extremely high viscosity, however, as the polymer 12 emerged from behind the bottom edge 46 is cannot immediately seek a new natural level; and, before it can, it is cured by the scanning laser beam 68 from the laser source 70. In this embodiment, rather than producing a full 1-dimensional array of light beams 34 as in the case of the light-pipe knife 44, the smoothing knife 44' moves forward in a series of one-row steps. At each adjacent row of a layer, the laser source 70 is caused to move the modulated laser beam 68 from side to side immediately behind the smoothing knife 44' to create the curing 1-dimensional",
