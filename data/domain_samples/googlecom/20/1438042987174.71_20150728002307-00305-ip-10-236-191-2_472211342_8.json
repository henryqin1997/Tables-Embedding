Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. As shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, any of the above-described embodiments can be assembled with the electrically conductive leads 640, 641 that extend from the sides of the integrated modules 600 being spaced at a sufficient distance such that two integrated modules can be placed close to each other with the leads 640 overlapping for space optimization. In a preferred embodiment that allows all of the integrated modules for a particular application to be manufactured identically, the leads 640 extending from one side of each module could be offset relative to the leads 640 extending from the opposite side of each module such that when two identical modules are placed immediately next to each other the leads will overlap and allow the two modules to be moved closely together. It will be understood that in all of the above-described embodiments of the invention, the lower portion of the integrated module including the side",
