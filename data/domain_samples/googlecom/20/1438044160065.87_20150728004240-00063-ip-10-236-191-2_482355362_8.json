The crystallization of an amorphous silicon layer is also achieved by depositing Ni atoms to a predetermined density, such as about 7\ufffd1013/cm2 to 2\ufffd1011/cm2 on the layer instead of using a Ni layer. The present invention reduces the surface roughness of the crystallized layer by crystallizing an amorphous silicon layer by MIC, wherein a metal layer, such as a Ni layer, is deposited on amorphous silicon., 31490=This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 1998-15806, filed on Apr. 28, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 43729=FIG. 16A shows TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) view of poly-Si layers crystallized by MIC with Ni deposition of 2\ufffd1011/cm2 average and its TED (Transmission Electron Diffraction);, 74531=FIG. 14 shows Raman spectrum of a poly-Si layer crystallized in accordance with Ni density. Referring to FIG. 14, sharp peaks around 520 cm\u22121 mean that crystallization of silicon is achieved. According to Ni thickness, positions of the Raman peaks are slightly shifted. The degree of crystallization is minutely affected by varying Ni density from about 2\ufffd1011/cm2 to 7\ufffd1013/cm2 when annealing is carried out for 5 hours at 520\ufffd C. In this case, the degree of crystallization of a poly-Si layer is over 90%., 51497=An amorphous silicon layer of 2000 \u212b is used for recrystallization. An optical band gap of amorphous silicon is 1.8 eV. Dark electroconductivity and photo conductivity are about 4.5\ufffd10\u221210 S/cm and 3.0\ufffd10\u22126 S/cm, respectively. Activation energy of conductivity appears to be about 0.78 eV. A Ni layer is deposited by RF sputtering on an amorphous silicon layer prepared for crystallization. Then crystallization is achieved by annealing under nitrogen ambience., 68108=A crystallization characteristic of silicon by varying Ni thickness is surveyed. FIGS. 4 to 13B explain the results of the test for crystallizing an amorphous silicon layer by varying average Ni thickness from 0.4 to 2.5 nm. Ni layers of 0.4, 0.7, 1.3 and 2.5 nm are deposited on an amorphus silicon layer of a bout 2000 \u212b. Thereafter, amorphous silicon is crystallized by annealing under N2 ambience for about 5 hours at about 520\ufffd C., 73972=FIGS. 14 to 16B show the results of the test for crystallizing an amorphous silicon layer after Ni atoms in density of about 2\ufffd1011/cm2 and 7\ufffd1013/cm2 have been deposited on the amorphous silicon layer. Amorphous silicon is crystallized by depositing Ni on amorphous silicon of 2000 \u212b and by annealing the layer under N2 ambience for about 20 hours at 500\ufffd C. The Ni layer need not be evenly distributed on the entire surface so long as the above indicated density is achieved., 67465=Relating to the above results, the crystallization characteristic of the poly-Si layer crystallized by Ni induced crystallization becomes better as the annealing temperature increases. When Ni induced crystallization is carried out by depositing Ni of about 0.4 nm on amorphous silicon of about 2000 \u212b and annealing the layers for about 5 hours, crystallization is achieved at the annealing temperature of 480\ufffd C. Thus, as the annealing temperature becomes high, so does the degree of crystallization to provide an excellent poly-Si layer., 31371=This is a continuation-in-part application of application Ser. No. 09/115,498, filed Jul. 14, 1998., 52364=When a small quantity of Ni, which is unable to form a film is deposited to be distributed on the amorphous silicon layer with predetermined density, distribution density of Ni varies between about 2\ufffd1011/cm2 and 7\ufffd1013/cm2 on the amorphous silicon layer to crystallize the amorphous silicon layer. In this case, it is desirable to control RF power under 10 W for sputtering., 73069=Ni having thicknesses of about 0.4, 0.7 and 1.3 nm is used to crystalize an amorphous silicon layer by annealing for 10 hours at 500\ufffd C. As Ni thickness increases 0.4 to 1.3 nm, so does the amount of Ni at the surface from about 1.5\ufffd1020 atoms/cm2 to 4\ufffd1021 atoms/cm2. A small quantity of Ni peak at the interface between crystalline silicon and a glass substrate explains that the crystal growth by the NiSi2 phase change from amorphous silicon to the substrate stops at the glass substrate., 75431=FIG. 16A shows TEM(Transmission Electron Microscopy) view of poly-Si layers crystallized by MIC with Ni deposition of 2\ufffd1011/cm2 and its TED (Transmission Electron Diffraction). FIG. 16B shows the TEM and TED for Ni deposition of to 7\ufffd1013/cm2. FIG. 16C shows the TEM and TED for Ni deposition of 0.3 \u212b average. Analyses of the TEM images and TED images of the three crystallized layers show that they have a good crystalline quality, respectively. Each crystallized silicon layers show that a plurality of crystalline grains of stick shapes constitute a network wherein width and length of each grain are about 150 nm to several microns., 43957=FIG. 16B shows TEM and TED views of poly-Si layers with Ni deposition of 7\ufffd1013/cm2 average;}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in a method of crystallizing an amorphous silicon layer of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention, provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents. Moreover, comparing to a related art, the speed of crystallizing silicon is increased and metal contamination by MIC is reduced. Accordingly, the characteristics of TFT using crystallized poly-Si are shown. The present invention of crystallizing silicon is carried out by depositing an induced substance for crystallization to least thickness or density on an amorphous silicon layer by MIC. Thus crystallization of silicon is maximized and surface roughness of crystallized silicon is reduced. Although suggesting a technique of crystallizing an amorphous silicon layer by depositing Ni, the present invention is also applied to the cases of using noble metals, such as Au, Ag, Al, Sb, In, and transition metals, such as Ti, Cu, etc., forming silicides with Si. During crystallization, the sizes of grains and the shapes of crystalline phase depend on Ni amount. Accordingly, in a crystallizing model of depositing Ni by MIC, the sizes of the grains after crystallization depend on the displacements of crystallizing nuclei. Moreover, in a crystallization processing using a very thin Ni",
