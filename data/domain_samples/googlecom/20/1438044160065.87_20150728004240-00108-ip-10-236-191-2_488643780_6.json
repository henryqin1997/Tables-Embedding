Although specific embodiments are disclosed herein, it is expected that persons skilled in the art can and will design alternative header generation systems that are within the scope of the following claims either literally or under the Doctrine of Equivalents. SUMMARY Steps 600-606 ensure that the speed and efficiency advantages of the access check system of the present invention do not result in security holes. The increased speed of the present invention is thereby implemented only when, from a security standpoint, it is safe to do so. Decision block 604 operates to determine if a user-token has been deleted from the user-token cache. If a user's level of access to server 100 is modified or eliminated, the user-token associated with the user is removed from the user-token cache by the operation of server 100. This occurrence is identified by the operation of decision block 604 and processing accordingly proceeds to step 606. In step 606, access-cache 400 is flushed of all access-permissions containing the deleted user-token. Processing then continues to decision block 600 where the security steps of 600-606 are again initiated. In step 602, access-cache 400 is flushed of all access-permissions containing the file-name of the modified",
