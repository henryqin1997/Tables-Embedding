No. 08/458,485 titled \u201cInstrumented Laser Diode Probe Connector\u201d, filed Jun. 2, 1995., 80745=FIG. 13 illustrates another embodiment of the probe 1 wherein the laser diodes are an integral part of the disposable section of the probe 1. In this embodiment, the probe 1311 contains an array of the surface emitting laser diodes 1312, each of which laser diodes generates a beam of light centered about a selected wavelength. Probe 1311 also contains a light detector 1313 capable of receiving the wavelengths of light emitted by the laser diodes contained in the array 1312.The probe 1311 also contains a connector (not shown) to enable the probe 1311 to be connected to the cable 3, in a manner analogous to that shown in the other embodiments described above. The probe 1311 is positioned juxtaposed to the patient's perfused tissue (such as the finger 1314 shown in FIG. 13), and operates either in the transmission mode with the array of laser diodes 1312 on one side of the finger 1314 and the light detector 1313 on the other side of finger 1314, or in the reflectance mode where all the sensor elements 1312, 1313 are positioned on the same side of finger 1314. As can be seen from FIG. 13, the array of laser diodes 1312 includes a diffuser 1315 held in place by mount 1316. The diffusion of the light output is to ensure that the light generated by the array of laser diode light emitting devices 1312 is safe and cannot cause harmful effects if a patient were mistakenly to apply the light output from probe 1311 directly into the patient's eyes. As shown in FIG. 13, the light beams produced by the laser diodes in the array 1312 pass through the arteriolar bed 1317 located in finger 1314 and the change in the path length of these light beams as they pass through the arteriolar bed 1317 is what is measured to determine the concentration of the measured analytes. The close spacing of the laser diodes in array 1312 results in the plurality of light beams produced by the laser diodes traversing substantially a common path through the arteriolar bed 1317 which improves the accuracy of the measurements that are taken.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is expressly understood that the claimed invention is not to be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment but encompasses other modifications and alterations Within the scope and spirit of the inventive concept. The apparatus of the present invention makes use of a monochromatic light source, in the form of surface emitting laser devices, to produce a plurality of high intensity light beams. The light source is mounted in the probe, juxtaposed to the probe attachment site on the patient. The use of monochromatic light ensures that the transmitted wavelength is a known, improves the accuracy of the measurements and simplifies the calibration process.
