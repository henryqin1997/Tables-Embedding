For example, they may be formed with a dopant of arsenic using an implant angle of approximately 0 degrees, dosage of 8\ufffd1014 and energy of about 5 keV. Additionally, photoresist masking may be used to block regions of semiconductor material 60 on a side of the second word/line 74 opposite to that of the first wordline 62 during the formation of extensions 72.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{74258=Although, particular levels and thicknesses may be disclosed for a particular embodiment to forming N-channel devices over active region 24, it will be understood that these parameters are merely exemplary and that alternative geometry's for oxide thickness, implant species or densities may be used for defining devices of alternative specifications. For example, in another example, the oxide thickness for the gate stack might comprise a thermal oxide of 2 nanometers and the N-type extension species of arsenic that may be implanted with a 7 degree angle and an energy level of 5 keV with a dosage of 8\ufffd1014 per centimeter squared. In some cases, the extension regions may be references as lightly doped drain (LDD) regions; however, it may be noted that the dopant concentration of the extension regions may be very close to that of the source/drain regions., 73946=In one example, the gate oxide may be formed with a thickness of 10 nanometers, the polysilicon for the gate with a thickness of 200 nanometers and the implant for the extension regions may be formed using phosphorous of an implant dosage of 8\ufffd1014 per cm2., 46069=This application claims benefit and priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/609,185, filed Jun. 26, 2003, entitled THYRISTER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/415,368, filed Oct. 1, 2002, and entitled IMPLANT APPROACH WITH SELF-ALIGNMENT TO SALICIDE BLOCK; both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 75172=After defining the N-type, extension regions of the second active region 24, it may then be masked while forming P-type extension regions in the first active region 22. The P-type extensions may be formed using, e.g., boron with an implant angle of less than 7 degrees, implant energy of 4 keV and dosage of 4\ufffd1014 per centimeter squared. Additionally, halo implants may be formed using an arsenic dopant of an implant angle of about 45 degrees, energy of 120 keV and dosage of 2\ufffd1013 per centimeter squared.}",

It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such embodiments and changes as fall within the spirit of this invention. , various alternative depths 612 might be formed for the isolation trench. FIG. 15 , dielectric of the isolation trench 212 may be removed for lowering its level and re-defining an alternative depth or floor 612 of the isolation trench. The floor 612 of the isolation trench may be lowered sufficiently to expose ends 622 of anode-emitter 600 facing the trench and laterally distant second wordline 74. Silicide may then be formed to diffuse metal into exposed surface regions of the silicon, including the ends 622 facing the newly defined isolation trench. The metal diffusion might also overlap the interface between the shallow implant anode-emitter 600 and N-base 398. As illustrated in FIG. 15 In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, with reference to , carrier lifetime adjustment species or junction leakage implant may be positioned at an alternative interface region 677 between anode-emitter 600 and N-base 398.
