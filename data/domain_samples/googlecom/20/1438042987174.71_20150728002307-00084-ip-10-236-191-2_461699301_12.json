The code is valid only for a certain time period on a given date (e.g., 9:00 a.m.\u201311:00 a.m. on Jun. 28, 1999)., 188490=It is expected that image input devices will soon become commonplace. The provision of digital cameras as built-in components of certain computers (e.g., the Sony Vaio laptops) is just one manifestation of this trend. Another is camera-on-a-chip systems, as typified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,126 and detailed in Nixon et al., \u201c256\ufffd256 CMOS Active Pixel Sensor Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 31(12), pp. 2046\u20132051 (1996), and Fossum, \u201cCMOS Image Sensors: Electronic Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE Transactions of Electron Devices, vol. 44, No. 10, October 1997. Still another is head-mounted cameras (as are presently used in some computer-augmented vision systems). These and other image input devices are all suitable for use in Bedoop systems., 288364=Consider, for example, a magazine containing watermarked advertising. If the user presents a first ad to the device 12, the watermark is decoded and forwarded to the product handler 16, which responds with a URL corresponding to that ad. The application 28 c then passes that received URL to a web browser 28 b on the device 12, which initiates a link to that internet address. But the handler now knows the magazine the user is reading. By reference to the watermark first received, the handler may discern, for example, that the user is reading the San Francisco edition of the Mar. 14, 2000, Time magazine, and just looked at page 85. Based on this information the handler can query the database 17 for URLs associated with other advertising in that issue. (The database index is structured to permit fast queries identifying all ads in a given magazine issue or other collective data source.) These URLs are passed back to the application 28 c and cached. If the user next presents an advertisement from page 110 to device 12, the application 28 c finds it already has the corresponding URL locally cached. The application then passes the corresponding URL to the web browser. The web browser initiates the link immediately, obviating a data round trip between the application and the remote system., 283422=Combinations and hybrids of the foregoing approaches can of course be used. Moreover, the 60 bit payload length is illustrative only. Longer (e.g., up to 1024 bits) or shorter (e.g., down to 8 bits) payloads can naturally be used., 162896=An electronic money system (e.g., of the sort detailed in U.S. application Ser. No. 60/134,782, filed May 19, 1999) may encode Bedoop data on a card that leads to storage at which random-number tokens (which represent increments of money) are stored. Presenting the card to a Bedoop system launches an application that reads and encrypts the tokens and forwards the encrypted data to the clearinghouse computer of the corresponding bank to learn their remaining value. There the tokens are decrypted and checked for validity (but not redeemed). The bank computer responds to the Bedoop system, indicating the remaining value of the tokens on the card., 30843=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 09/571,422, filed May 15, 2000, (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,947,571) which claims priority to each of the following provisional patent applications:, 193968=One particular embodiment of the arrangement detailed above is a modified version of the Microsoft IntelliMouse with IntelliEye technology. That device includes a multi-element optical sensor integrated on an IC with various detector and processing circuitry, operating in conjunction with a short focal length imaging lens and an LED illumination source (all available from Agilent, as detailed below). The circuitry tracks movement of patterns across the sensor's field of view, by which the mouse's movement can be deduced. The Microsoft product collects 1500 data sets per second\u2014a frame rate much higher than is generally needed for the present applications. Some such embodiments combine the functionality of a mouse with that of a Bedoop image sensor., 54949=Watermarking of printed text can be achieved by slight variations to character shape, character kerning, line spacing, etc., as shown by various writings by Brassil et al, including \u201cElectronic Marking and Identification Techniques to Discourage Document Copying,\u201d Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer, IEEE Comm. Soc Conference, Jun. 12\u201316, 1994, pp. 1278\u20131287; \u201cHiding Information in Document Images,\u201d Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems, p. 482\u20139, 1995; and \u201cDocument marking and identification using both line and word shiffing,\u201d Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '95, The Conference on Computer Communications. Fourteenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies; Bringing Information to People (Cat. No. 95CH35759), p. 853\u201360 vol. 2, 1995., 199062=The sizing of the linear and 2D CCD arrays is left to the designer. If 600 dpi line scan resolution is desired across a four inch scan swath, a 2400 element linear CCD would be used. The 2D CCDs are typically smaller in extent, e.g., having an aperture of 0.25 inches\ufffd0.25 inches. The spacing of the CCD elements is selected based on the size of surface features to be tracked., 196332=The reader is presumed familiar with the workings of the HP CapShare scanner. Such information has been published in the technical literature, e.g., Allen, Ross R. et al, \u201cProcesses for Freehand Image Capture: HP CapShare Technology,\u201d The Society for Imaging Science & Technology PICS Conference, pp. 43\u201346, Mar. 26, 2000. The CapShare scanner employs an optical sensor tracking engine assembly, comprised of part Nos. HDNS2000 (IC sensor chip), HDNS-2100 (lens with light pipe), HDNS-2200 (LED clip), and HLMP-ED80 (639 nm LED), the use of which is detailed in Agilent Application Note 1179, all available from Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif., 469932=It should be noted that the responses triggered by a watermark can be changed over time. This extends the useful life of an encoded object. For example, an encoded link in a magazine ad for a 1999 Ford Explorer that points to a Ford URL related to the 1999 Ford Explorer can be updated to point to the URL for the 2000 model year version when marketing of the new model year vehicles commences., 271902=Consider a case where Nike advertises in Wired magazine. The ad department at Wired agrees to sell space in response to a request from a media buyer at Nike. Wired may start the related watermark work by securing from the operator of system 10 a particular watermark identifier. (This, and most of the following procedures, are effected by computers talking to computers in accordance with instructions provided by suitable software used by the various participants, etc. In the discussion that follows, this software is the registration server 19 although, as noted, product handler 16 could be arranged to perform these functions.) Wired provides the operator an issue identifier (e.g., San Francisco edition of the July, 2000 issue), and internal tracking information used by the magazine. Registration server 19 responds by sending Wired a confirmatory file, by email, that encapsulates the information thus-far (i.e., the watermark identifier, the issue ID, and the magazine tracking information). Server 19 creates a new database record, and parses the received information into corresponding fields of the record., 281432=The Owner ID identifies the customer to whom the watermark is registered (e.g., Nike). This is used for ad effectiveness analysis and billing purposes. The Publication ID identifies the particular publication (e.g., July, 2000, San Francisco edition of Wired Magazine). The Media ID identifies a particular page location within that publication., 118094=In one exemplary embodiment, the blank magazine page stock is Bedoop-encoded prior to printing. The watermarking can be performed by high speed ink-jet devices, which splatter a fine pattern of essentially imperceptible ink droplets across each page. Each page can be differently watermarked so that, on decoding, page 21 of a magazine can be distinguished from page 22 of the same magazine (and page 106 of the Jun. 21, 1999, issue can be distinguished from page 106 of the Jun. 28, 1999, issue). If desired, each page can be further segregated into regions\u2014either in accordance with the actual boundaries of articles that will later be printed on the pages, or in a grid pattern, e.g., of 3 columns across by 5 rows high. Each region conveys a distinct Bedoop code, permitting different portions of the page to lead to different web data.)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the many embodiments to which the above-detailed principles may be applied, it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments are illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of our invention. Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as fall within the scope and spirit of the following claims, and equivalents thereto. From the foregoing discussion it can be seen that, rather than replacing paper with electronic media, perhaps the future lies in giving paper digital attributes\u2014hybridizing the physical experience of paper with the technical advantages of digital media. Such an arrangement makes available a great wealth of new functionality, now accessible through familiar paper items, rather than through a \u201ccomputer input peripheral.\u201d It was once popular to predict that paper documents would be replaced with electronic media. In hindsight, electronic media may be recognized as a poor surrogate for paper. Electronic media conveys information flawlessly, but is lacking in experiential attributes. We can hold paper, stack it, own it, deface it, give it, guard it, etc. It provides an opportunity for physical dominion entirely lacking with electronic media. While the foregoing embodiments have generally employed planar objects to convey the digital encoding, this need not be the case. Objects of other shapes can likewise be employed. Some shapes present relatively straightforward image processing tasks. As noted above, data imaged from a soft drink",
