    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments, and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the claimed invention. In a case, each of the microphones 31a, 31b and 34 are respectively fixed in a corresponding one of the antinoise areas 33, 36 and 43, the filter coefficients corresponding to the antinoise areas 33, 36 and 43 can be periodically updated. When step 203 determines that the selected mode is not the stacking mode, step 205 selects the antinoise areas 33 and 36. Then steps 206 through 208 are carried out. In this case, when step 206 determines that the third antinoise area 43 is requested, the filter coefficients corresponding to all the first, second and third antinoise areas 33, 36 and 43 are supplied from the memory 39 to the digital filter 27. Thus, the signals processed by using the filtered coefficients corresponding to all the antinoise areas 33, 36 and 43 in the digital filter 27 is respectively supplied to the first, second and third signal processing circuit 23a, 23b and 23c via the switch circuit 40. Then, an acoustic wave for canceling the noise present in each of the antinoise areas is output from a corresponding one of the loudspeakers 24a, 24b and 24c. As a result, the noises caused by the operations of the copy machine 10 can be reduced in all the antinoise areas",
