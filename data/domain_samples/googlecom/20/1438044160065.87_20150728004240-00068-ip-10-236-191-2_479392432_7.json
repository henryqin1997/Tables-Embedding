The actual thickness of the piezoelectric layer is most commonly based on a thickness that ranges from \ufffd\u03bb to \ufffd\u03bb based on the speed of sound of the material and the intended center frequency of the array transducer. As would be clear to one skilled in the art, the choice of backing layer and matching layer(s) and their respective acoustic impedance values dictate the final thickness of the piezoelectric layer. The target thickness can be further fine-tuned based on the specific width to height aspect ratio of each sub-element of the array, which would also be clear to one skilled in the art. The wider the kerf width and the higher the laser fluence, the deeper the excimer laser can cut. The number of laser pulses per unit area can also allow for a well-defined depth control. In another aspect, a lower fluence laser pulse, i.e., less than about 1 J/cm2-10 J/cm2 can be used to laser ablate through polymer based material and through thin metal layers., 140867=A KrF excimer laser used in projection etch mode with a shadow mask can be used to create a desired electrode pattern. For example, a Lumonics (Farmington Hills, Mich.) EX-844, FWHM=20 ns can be used. In one aspect, a homogenous central part of the excimer laser beam cut out by using a rectangular aperture passes through a beam attenuator, double telescopic system and a thin metal mask, and imaged onto the surface of the specimen mounted on a computer controlled x-y-z stage with a 3-lens projection system (\u22661.5 \u03bcm resolution) of 86.9 mm effective focal length. In one aspect, the reduction ratio of the mask projection system can be fixed to 10:1., 69477=This application is a continuation application of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 11/109,986, filed Apr. 20, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,368, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/563,784, filed on Apr. 20, 2004, which applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only. In another aspect, prior to mounting the lens onto the stack, the SU-8 layer and the lens can be laser cut, which effectively extends the array kerfs (first and/or second array kerf slots), and in one aspect, the sub-diced or second kerfs, through both matching layers (or if two matching layers are used) and into the lens. A film of SU-8 becomes sticky (tacky) when the temperature of the coating is raised to about 60-85\ufffd C. At temperatures higher than 85\ufffd C., the surface topology of the SU-8 layer may start to change. Therefore, in a preferred aspect, this process is performed at a set point temperature of 80\ufffd C. Since the SU-8 layer is already in solid form, and the elevated temperature only causes the layer to become tacky, then once the adhesive layer is attached to the stack, the applied SU-8 does not flow down the kerfs of the array. This maintains the physical gap and mechanical isolation between the",
