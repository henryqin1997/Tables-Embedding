In FIG. 8, prima cord 100 is illustrated as being looped through each of the apertures located rearwardly within the shaped charges 66 in a conventional manner. Detonating means 101 forms part of the firing head and explodes the prima cord in response to the firing head being contacted or impacted by the sinker bar in accordance with my previously issued U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,706,344 and 4,099,757. The operation of the gravity orientating perforating system is illustrated in FIGS. 7, 8, and 9. In particular, FIG. 9 discloses one position respective to the inside wall surface of the casing which may be engaged by the casing engaging member 80 should the gun tend to axially rotate an amount 92 respective to the drill tubing 24 as the gun assembly is run downhole. Should the gun tend to climb the sidewall of the casing, enlargement 82 will be rotated into engagement with the casing wall, thereby preventing any further rotation. At the same time, the mass W of the gun tends to gravitate the gun back into the upright position seen in FIGS. 7 and 8. Numeral 94 illustrates the included angle between the direction of penetration of spaced shaped charges, while numeral 96 illustrates the horizontal plane. The presence",
