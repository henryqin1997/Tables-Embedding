Various substitutions and modifications have suggested in the foregoing description, and other will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, all such substitutions and modifications are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. When user press the roller 6, the pivot shaft 56 of the roller stage 51 linked with the roller 6 touches the micro switch 9 to activate the third axis input. The roller stage 51 lays against the pole 47 hooked by the elastic member 48. The elastic member 48 produces a rebound force and buffers the pressing force. The roller 6 has an opened lateral side containing an optical means 7. The optical means 7 has a case 71 arranged the accommodation space within the roller 6. The case 71 has a lock plate 72 on outer surface thereof and engaged between two locking plates 55. The case 71 has a circuit board 74 on the inner side thereof and has an infrared transceiver 75 corresponding to a ring 64 of the roller 6. The circuit board 74 is electrically connected to the primary circuit board 43. More particularly, the infrared transceiver 75 is mounted on the circuit board 74 and has",
