The transducers will typically be operated in the 10-100 MHz range and preferably within 36 MHz to 90 MHz and with a mounting angle between 10-80\ufffd with respect to the probe's longitudinal axis and will have an aspect ratio range of 1:6 to 1:1.015. The beveled tips provided on the ultrasonic probes makes it possible for them to penetrate biological tissue when it is necessary to navigate a total occlusion or a near total occlusion., 24789=This application is a continuation-in-part of Application Ser. No. 09/134,744 filed Aug. 14, 1998, now pending.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing it can be seen that the multi-lumen catheter utilized in the apparatus of the present invention permits a physician to switch from a diagnostic imaging probe to a floppy guidewire to a stiff guidewire and then to one or more therapeutic devices without losing the position of the tip of the guidewire. There is no necessity for the physician to remove the entire guidewire from the catheter. This therefore permits the physician to switch back and forth between two different guidewires or between a diagnostic probe and a therapeutic probe carried by the multi-lumen catheter. It is possible to maintain the position of the guidewire through a tortuous path. In addition, the apparatus makes it possible to torque the distal tip of the sheath without rotation of the multi-lumen catheter and thereby avoiding entanglement of the ultrasonic probe and the guidewires. In summary it can be seen that by utilizing closely spaced turns for the tapered coil for the distal extremity of the sheath, it is possible to provide greater pushability while at the same time providing a smaller profile at the distal tip for easier penetration into the complex lesion or atheroma. In addition, there is increased radiopacity, reduced friction and increased flexibility. As hereinafter explained, other therapeutic devices can be introduced through the catheter assembly 601 because of the two additional lumens which are available in the triple lumen catheter 611.",
