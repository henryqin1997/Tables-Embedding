Such other features, modifications, and improvements are, therefore, considered to be a part of this invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims. In a similar manner, brain nodes which cause an individual to be jovial or not depressed can be identified, and caused to be remotely fired by the computer and firing devices 7 mounted under the scalp in a predetermined manner or sequence(s) in order to minimize or prevent depression of the individual. This may eliminate the need for drugs such a Prozac. Alternatively, such drug(s) may be administered after such remote node firings, and the nodes at issue thereafter being monitored as discussed above and a biofeedback being performed to determine the effectiveness of the drug(s) or alternatively to enable a system to be utilized combining drug treatment with remote node firings to more effectively prevent or minimize depression of the individual. Thus, the biofeedback may enable the identified nodes to be fired by the firing devices and/or drug treatment at the proper level to most efficiently treat the disease, illness or state. This invention, including remote firings and/or monitoring, is not limited to these examples, and its potential uses are almost endless. Brain node firings can be remotely controlled in a predetermined manner or sequence(s) (even random or sequential)",
