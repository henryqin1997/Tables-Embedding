    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The carrier element shown in FIG. 8 and incorporated into the data carrier in accordance with FIG. 2, on the other hand, primarily takes the stresses arising during the production of the card into account. This kind of construction may be particularly useful, influenced by various marginal conditions such as the addition of a magnetic stripe on the back of the card. It is completely safe in particular when the data carrier is exposed to stresses which are less strong during its subsequent use due to a shorter period of validity or more careful handling. Depending on which applications the data carrier is produced for, the various types of stress can be selectively taken into account by specially designing the carrier element or specially designing the substrate and by arranging the contact surfaces, the leads and the IC module on the substrate accordingly. In the case of a carrier element as shown in FIG. 4 or FIG. 11, which is embedded in the data carrier as in the view of FIG. 1 or FIG. 3, both the mechanical stresses arising during production and those arising during the use of the card are taken into account in this way, for example. This kind of construction is recommended in particular for data carriers which are subjected to particularly strong mechanical stresses over a longer period of time. As has been shown by extensive experiments, the mechanical stresses present",
