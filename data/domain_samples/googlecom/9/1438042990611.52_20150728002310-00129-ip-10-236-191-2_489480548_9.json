F. Shealy, C. A. O'Dell, G. Arnett J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30 1090-1094). The cold solution of the diazonium salt is added dropwise over a period of min to a stirred solution (at RT) of product of previous reaction, sodium acetate trihydrate (150 g), acetic acid (375 ml). and water (400 ml). The mixture is stirred overnight at RT. Diazo intermediate 58 is collected as a precipitate by filtration., 55479=A computer literature search was performed by Dr. E. Zass to search for compounds with these general formulae. The only examples found which contained a CH2 --OH group, an --SH group, and a heterocycle unit containing either a 6 ring with at least 2 nitrogens, or a 6-5-ring system with at least 2 nitrogens are shown below. These compounds were the subject of British patent applications for compounds with antiviral activity (Eklind, K. I.; Gotthammar, K. B.; Hagbert, C. E.; Johansson, K. N. G.; Kovacs, Z. M. I.; Noren, J. O.; Stening, G. B. UK Pat. Appl. GB 2,122,198 Chem. Abstr. 1984 101 23900m. (Eriksson, B. F. H.; Gotthammar, K. B.; Johansson, K. N. G.; UK Pat. Appl. GB 2,122,197 Chem. Abstr. 1984 101 23899t). ##STR3## In both cases, the number of linking atoms in L (2) is greater than the sum of the linking atoms in X (1) and Y (0). Thus, although these molecules could in principle be used as building blocks to synthesize the oligonucleotide analogs disclosed here, oligonucleotide analogs made from these compounds would likely bind to natural nucleic acids only weakly if at all, due to the different pitch of the helix made by the two strands., 106049=A solution of 1'-pivaloyloxy-5'-benzyloxy-3'-((6-chloro)purin-9-yl)-methyloxypentane (42a, 795 mg, 1.725 mmol) in methanol (50 ml) was saturated at 0\ufffd C. with ammonia, and the mixture heated in a sealed glass tube at 110\ufffd C. for 20 hours. The tube was then cooled to 0\ufffd C., its contents transferred to a flask, and the solvent evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel (CH2 Cl2 /methanol 9:1 as eluant) to yield 1'-pivaloyloxy-5'-benzyloxy-3'-(aden-9-yl)-methyloxypentane (43a, 600 mg, 79%) as a colorless oil., 65241=The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\ufffd C., and a suspension of potassium hydrogen persulfate (30 mmol, in 50 aqueous solution buffered with citrate to pH 5.0) is added. The mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to yield the sulfone. (Trost, B. M.; Curran, D. P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981 22 1287-1290)., 102882=To a solution of methyl 3-(S)-hydroxy-5-benzyloxypentanoate (38, Kitamura, M.; Ohkuma, T.; Inoue, S.; Sayo, N.; Kumobayashi, H.; Akutagawa, S.; Ohta, T.; Takaya, H.; Noyori, R., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110 629-631) (183 mmol) in anhydrous THF (1 l) is added lithium borohydride (7.7 g, excess) at 0\ufffd C. over 15 min. The reaction mixture is stirred at RT for 30 minutes, and then refluxed for 6 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 0\ufffd C., diluted with water (60 ml), and stirred overnight at RT. A white precipitate is removed by filtration, the solvent removed in vacuum, and the residue distilled under vacuum to yield 5-benzyloxy-1,3-pentanediol 39., 90076=This same intermediate can be prepared in optically active form from optically active exo t-butyl 5-norbornene-2-carboxylate synthesized via an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction (Oppolzer, W.; Chapuis, C.; Kelly, M. J., Helv. Chem. Acta 1983, 66, 2358-2361) followed by reduction with LiEt3 BH and hydroboration by the method described above., 123202=Pyridinium chlorochromate (23 g, 107 mmoll is stirred with Celite (22 g) and CH2 Cl2 (140 ml) at RT. To the suspension is added (1S,2S)-norbornan-2-ol (80, 70 mmol; Brown, H. C.; Desai, M. C.; Jadhav, P. K. J. org. Chem., 1982 47 5065-5069) in CH2 Cl2 (70 ml) dropwise over a period of 30 min. The mixture is stirred for an hour at RT, at which point the dark brown suspension is filtered through silica gel (60 g). Chromatography yields (lR)-norbornanone 81., 69153=(a) Where the skeleton already contains an amino group at the appropriate position, the ring system is built up by a series of condensation reactions, different for each base. The preferred method for constructing thymidine and uracil rings is by reaction with 2-methyl-3-ethoxyacryoyl isocyanate and 3-ethoxyacryoyl isocyanate respectively, followed by cyclization in dilute acid. (Farkas, J. \"Synthesis of 5-methyl-2H-1,3-oxazine-2,4(3H)-dione\" Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm. 1979 44 269-274) Adenine, guanine, and other purine rings can also be built up around an amino groups pre-existing in the skeleton., 82941=To a solution of bis-trimethylsilyloxypyrimidine in acetonitrile was added exo-6-pivaloyloxymethyl-2,8-dioxa-[1.2.3]-bicyclooctane (10, 200 mg, 0.877 mmol) in acetonitrile (1 ml). A solution of trimethylsilyltriflate (0.191 ml, 1.2 equivalents) in dichloroethane (1 ml) was then added, and the mixture stirred at RT for 15 hours. The mixture was then poured onto ice cold saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2 Cl2 (3\ufffd10 ml), the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (CHCl3 :methanol 9:1, Rf 0.20) to yield a mixture of anomers of 3',5'bishomo-2-deoxyuridine-3'-pivalate as a white foam (11a, 1:1 mixture, 156 mg, 52%). The beta anomer (11a) is the preferred anomer.

Found C, 55.97%; H, 6.98%; N, 8.00%., 82258=A solution of 3,4-trans 1-methoxy-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-4-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-tetrahydrofuran (9, 500 mg) in toluene (10 ml) with Dowex W 50 cation exchange resin (acid form) was refluxed for 3 hours. The resin was removed by filtration, and the solvent evaporated under vacuum to yield exo-6-pivaloyloxymethyl-2,8-dioxa-[1.2.3)-bicyclooctane (10, 434 mg, 99%) as colorless crystals (from hexane). NMR (CDCl3) 1.20 (s, 9H), 1.57 (s, br, 1H), 1.67 (ddd, J=14,3,2.5 Hz, 1H), 2.30 (m, 2H), 2.51 (m, 1H), 3.81-4.08 (m, 4H), 4.32 (s, br, 1H), 5.44 (d, J=5 Hz), 117306=A solution of triphenylphosphine (730 mg, 2.8 mmol) and 6-chloropurine (430 mg, 2.8 mmol) in dry THF (16 ml) is added to a solution of DEAD (0.42 ml) in dry THF (3.5 ml). The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at RT. To the solution is added enantiomerically pure 2(R)-benzyloxymethyl-3-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-1-propanol (64, 1.9 mmol; Haruda, T.; Hayashiya, T.; Wada, I.; Iwa-ake, N.; Oku, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109 527-532) in THF (9 ml). After the reaction is complete, the solvents were evaporated, and the residue containing intermediate 65 purified by chromatography., 71089=(e) Where the skeleton bears an epoxide group, the preferred method for introducing a base is by nucleophilic substitution by a ring system at the less hindered site of the epoxide (DiMenna, W. D.; Piantadosi, C.; Lamb, R. G. J. Med. Chem. 1978, 21 1073-1076. Kondo, K.; Sato, T.; Takemoto, K. Chem. Lett. 1973, 967-968. Trost, B. M.; Kuo, G.-H.; Benneche, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988 110 621)., 31785=Analogues of oligonucleotides where the phosphate bridging group is replaced by a carboxyl group have also been synthesized (Jones, A. S.; MacCoss, M.; Walker, R. T. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1973 365 365-377). The analogs slowly hydrolyzed upon standing at neutral pH, and the polymer with adenosine formed an undefined complex with polyuridylic acid. Analogously, carbamate analogs of oligonucleotides have been synthesized (Mungall, W. S.; Kaiser, J. K. J. Org. Chem. 1977 42 703-706). Oligonucleotides have been constructed that contain 1,3 propanediol units between normal phosphate bases (Seela, F.; Kaiser, K. Nucl. Acids Res. 1987 15 3113-3129). These last molecules are not isosteric analogs of DNA, and cannot be prepared in the modified structural forms needed to modulate their binding affinity for natural oligonucleotides (vide infra). Finally, a recent abstract (Kawai, S. H.; Just, G.; Chin, J. Abstracts, North American Meeting of the American Chemical Society, #318, Jun. 8, 1988) has suggested that preliminary work may have begun on an oligonucleotide analog containing secondary hydroxyl groups and a bridging unit containing a thioether linkage. This structure again cannot be prepared in the modified structural forms needed to modulate their binding affinity for natural oligonucleotides (vide infra). Further, it appears that to form standard double helical structures with natural oligonucleotides, these molecules must adopt an unfavorable conformation where a polar hydroxyl group is adjacent to a non-polar polymethylene unit. Recently, Miller, T'so, and their coworkers reported the synthesis of compounds that are isosteric analogs of DNA, differing only in that one oxygen of the phosphate group of each subunit is replaced by a methyl group. In all other structural aspects, these molecules are identical to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. These molecules, termed methylphosphonate DNA analogs, or methylphosphonates, lack phosphate-borne negative charges. A patent was recently awarded to the inventors of these molecules (U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863, Sep. 4, 1984). Oligomethylphosphonates show several interesting biological properties. (For a review, see Miller, P. S.; Agris, C. H.; Aurelian, L.; Blake, K. R.; Murakami, A.; Reddy, M. P.; Spitz, S. A.; Ts'o, P.O.P. Biochimie 1985 67 769-776). They appear to cross cell membranes (Miller, P. S.; McParland, K. B.; Jayaraman, K.; Ts'o, P.O.P. Biochem, 1981 20 1874-1880) presumably because of their relative non-polarity when compared to natural oligonucleotides. One diastereomer of oligomethylphosphonate appear to form double helical structures with complementary natural oligonucleotides. Finally, these isomers appear to inhibit the biological action of mRNA coding for proteins, although activity is observed only at high concentrations (compared to those expected based on the proposed mechanism of action)., 30181=However, natural oligonucleotides have two quite undesirable properties. First, they are rapidly degraded in biological environments due to the action of enzymes, particularly deoxyribonucleases (DNases), ribonucleases (RNases), and phosphodiesterases (Plesner, P.; Goodchild, J.; Kalckar, H. M.; Zamecnik, P. C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1987 84 1936-1939)., 63360=Where the carbon skeleton permits the oxygen of uracil or thymidine (or a similar base analog) to form a 5 or 6 member ring via intramolecular attack of the heterocyclic ring oxygen on the activated methanesulfonate intermediate, the pyrimidine ring is preferably protected by an N-mesityl group (Welch, C. J.; Chattopadhyaya, J. B. Acta Chem. Scand. B, 1983, 37 147-150)., 120670=Enantiomerically pure 2(R)-benzyloxymethyl-4-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-1-butanol (71, 1.9 mmol; Harnden, M. R.; Jarvest, R. L., Tetrahedron Lett. 1985 26 4265-4268; Haruda, T.; Hayashiya, T.; Wada, I.; Iwa-ake, N.; Oku, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109 527-532) in dimethylformamide is added to a solution of triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide in dimethylformamide to yield 1-bromo-2(R)-benzyloxymethyl-4-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-1-butane (72. To a solution of 72 in dimethylformamide is added 2-amino-6-chloropurine. After stirring at room temperature (8 hours), 9-((2(R)-benzyloxymethyl-4-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-butan-1-yl)-2-amino-6-chloropurine (73) is isolated and purified by chromatography on silica gel. Acid hydrolysis (2N HCl, reflux, 75 min) converts this compound to 9-((2(R)-benzyloxymethyl-4-hydroxy)-butan-1-yl)-guanine (74), which is purified by chromatography on silica gel., 26466=Second, information is coded in the oligonucleotide by the order of bases in the oligonucleotide strand. This information codes for proteins and nucleic acids necessary for the growth and replication of organisms. Oligonucleotides with defined sequence serve as genes, genetic regulatory agents, intracellular messages, especially for the synthesis of proteins, and possibly intercellular messages (Benner, S. A., FEBS Lett., 1988, in press)., 103649=Pivaloyl chloride (2.070 ml, 17.1 mmol) was added slowly to a solution of 5-benzyloxy-1,3-pentanediol (39, 16.3 mmol) in anhydrous pyridine (35 ml) at -18\ufffd C. (dry ice-acetone bath). The mixture was kept without stirring in a -20\ufffd freezer for 15 hours. The reaction mixture was then diluted with methanol (1 ml) and CH2 Cl2 (50 ml), and extracted with 10% HCl containing copper sulfate (10 g/l) until the blue color in the organic layer was removed. The aqueous layer was re-extracted with methylene chloride, the combined organic layers are dried (magnesium sulfate), the solvent evaporated, and 1-pivaloyloxy-5-benzyloxy-3-pentanol (40) isolated as a colorless oil by flash chromatography on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc 7:3 as eluant; yield 4.05 g, 86% as a colorless oil)., 73713=A mixture of EtOAc (100.0 g, 1.136 mol) and ethyl formate (80.7 g, 1.136 mol) was slowly added with stirring at RT to sodium wire (26.0 g, 1.130 mol) in dry ether (400 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours, and the sodium salt of ethyl-3-hydroxyacrylate was isolated by centrifugation as brownish precipitate (yield after drying, 92 g). The sodium salt was finely ground, suspended in ether (400 ml), and the solution cooled to 0\ufffd C. Acetyl chloride (55.25 g, 0.70 4 mol) was added dropwise at 0\ufffd C. to this suspension. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 24 hours, then poured into aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (200 ml) at 0\ufffd C. The organic phase was separated, washed with water (5\ufffd200 ml), dried (magnesium sulfate) and the solvents evaporated. The resulting oil was distilled under vacuum to yield ethyl-3-acetoxyacrylate (20% overall yield) in a cis:trans mixture (1:1.4 by NMR and gas chromatography)., 76149=DEAD (2.06 g, 11.8 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of triphenylphosphine (3.08 g, 11.8 mmol) in THF (35 ml) at 0\ufffd C. over a period of 5 min. Trans 1-Hydroxy-2-carboethoxycyclohex-4-ene 2a (1.00 g, 5.88 mmol in 5 ml THF) was then added slowly, the mixture was stirred for 5 min, and then benzoic acid (1.44 g, 11.8 mmol, in 5 ml THF) was added. The mixture was stirred at RT for 2 hours. Solvents were evaporated, an the residue purified by chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc:hexane 2:8 as eluant). The product was then distilled under vacuum to yield ethyl cis-2-benzoyloxy-cyclohex-4-enecarboxylate (4, 1.1 g, 71%)., 30873=In an attempt to circumvent these problems, several non-polar polymeric analogs of oligonucleotides containing subunits that lack the phosphate groups have been synthesized. Pitha and his coworkers have prepared a series of linear polymers of vinyl nucleides (Pitha, J.; Pitha, P. M.; Stuart, E. Biochem. 1971 4595-4602. Noronha-Blob, L.; Vengris, V. E.; Pitha, P. M.; Pitha, J. J. Med. Chem. 1977 20 356-359). As polymers, no control is possible in their synthetic scheme over the order of bases in the sequence. Therefore, although biological activity was observed in a variety of these compounds, it is impossible to determine whether these analogs can bind to specific sequences of natural oligonucleotides. Further, in the polymerization process, a new asymmetric center is created over which there is no synthetic control. Therefore, such polymers are complex mixtures of diastereomers., 35484=Only dinucleotides of oligomethylphosphonates can at present be prepared diastereomerically pure (Miller, P. S.; Annan, N. D.; McParland, K. B.; Pulford, S. M. Biochem. 1982 21 2507-2512). Although considerable effort is being invested in efforts to improve methods for preparing methylphosphonates, (Marugg, J. E.; de Vroom, E.; Dreef, C. E.; van der Marel, G. A.; van Boom, J. H. Nucl. Acids Res. 1986 14 2171-2185; Lesnikowski, Z. J.; Wolakanin, P. J.; Stec, W. J. Tetrahedron Lett., 1987 28 5535), there is at present no satisfactory synthetic method to control the chirality at phosphorus in longer oligomethylphosphonates, and their usefulness is limited for this reason., 80883=2-Pivaloyloxymethyl-cyclohex-4-eneol (8, 6.327 g, 29.8 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (250 ml), cooled to -78\ufffd C., and then treated with ozone (ca. 30 min) until the solution was blue. After excess ozone was removed in a stream of nitrogen (45 min), dimethylsulfide (10 ml) was added, and the reaction was warmed to RT and stirred in the dark for 7 days. Analysis by gas chromatography showed a 3:1 mixture of the 2' aldehyde and its corresponding dimethyl acetal. The mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C., and NaBH4 (1.00 g) was added in small portions. After 20 min., 5% HCl (20 ml) was added, half of the methanol evaporated, the mixture was diluted with water (100 ml), and the mixture was extracted with CH2 Cl2 (3\ufffd100 ml). The organic layer was dried (magnesium sulfate), the solvent evaporated under vacuum, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (hexane:EtOAc 6:4) to yield a mixture of 3,4-trans 1-methoxy-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-4-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-tetrahydrofuran (9, 4.85 g, 62%, IR, CCl4, 1732 cm-1) and 1-methoxy-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-4-(2',2'-dimethoxyethyl)-tetrahydrofuran (1.845 g, 20%, IR, CCl4, 1732 cm-1) as colorless oils and as mixtures of anomers., 99627=Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (trihydrate, 70 mg, 0.22 mmol) was added to 2-(trans-t-butyldiphenylsilyloxymethyl)-4-cis-(N-benzoyladen-9-yl)-cyclopentaneethanethiol S-acetate (31, 98 mg, 0.145 mmol) dissolved in dry THF (3 ml). The mixture was stirred at RT for 15 hours. The solvents were then evaporated under vacuum, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (ether:ethanol 4:1 as eluant) to yield 2-(trans-t-hydroxymethyl)-4-cis-(N-benzoyladen-9-yl)-cyclopentaneethanethiol S-acetate (32, 90 mg, 77%) as a white foam. NMR (DMSO-d6) 1.57-1.70 (m, 1H); 1.79-2.31 (m, 6H); 2.33 (s, 3H); 2.39-2.46 (m, 1H); 2.84-2.91 (m, 2H); 3.38-3.49 (m, 2H); 4.68-4.72(m, 1H); 4.87-4.98 (m, 1H); 7.52-7.57 (m, 2H); 7.62-7.67(m, 1H); 8.04-8.06 (m, 2H); 8.60 (s, 1H); 8.73 (s, 1H); 11.16 (s, br., 1H). Anal calc. for C22 H25 N5 O3 S C 60.12%, H 5.73%, N 15.93%; found C 59.12%, H 5.74%, N 15.72%., 112915=The pyrimidine ring was protected by an N-mesityl group (Welch, C. J.; Chattopadhyaya, J. B. Acta Chem. Scand. B, 1983, 37 147-150) through reaction with the hexachloroantimoniate salt of the mesityl cation in CH2 Cl2 with pyridine (2 equivalents) to yield a suitably protected building block precursor (53). This compound could be conveniently stored, and the free thiol-alcohol building block (54) produced immediately prior to coupling by reduction with lithium triethylborohydride using the following procedure., 76902=Pig liver esterase (16 mg, 2000 units) was added to ethyl cis-2-benzoyloxy-cyclohex-4-enecarboxylate (4) suspended in a mixture of t-butanol and water (1:9) at pH 7, and the progress of the enzymic hydrolysis was followed with an autotitrator (maintaining the pH at 7) with 0.5N NaOH). After 36% of the starting material had been hydrolyzed, the reaction was quenched with CH2 Cl2 (3 ml) and extracted with ether (3\ufffd30 ml). The ethereal layers were dried (magnesium sulfate), and the solvent removed under vacuum to yield 1.9 g (63%) of a mixture of (1S,2R)- and (1R,2S) 1-benzoyloxy-2-carboethoxycyclohex-4-ene. The pH of the aqueous phase was adjusted to 2 and extracted with ether (3\ufffd30 ml). The ethereal layers were dried (magnesium sulfate), and the solvent removed under vacuum to yield 982 mg (35.8%) crude (1S,2R)-1-benzoyloxycyclohex-4-ene-2-carboxylic acid (5). This was shown to be essentially free of its enantiomer via gas chromatographic analysis of the 1-norborneol ester, and by NMR in the presence of a europium chiral shift reagent., 34705=However, the methylphosphonates themselves have several undesirable chemical properties. First, substitution of a methyl group for an oxygen at phosphorus creates a chiral center. Therefore, oligomers composed of methylphosphonate building blocks are again complex mixtures of diastereomers. Further, apparently only one diastereomer of a methylphosphonate-linked dinucleotide can bind to a complementary natural oligonucleotide (Miller, P.S.; Yano, J.; Yano, E.; Carroll, C.; Jayaraman, K.; Ts'o, P.O.P. Biochem. 1979 18 5134-5143). The fact that oligomethylphosphonates are complex mixtures of diastereomers may be responsible in part for the low biological activity of these compounds (Murakami, A.; Blake, K. R.; Miller, P. S. Biochem. 1985 24 4041-4046)., 110939=Silver isocyanate (4.166 g, 27.8 mmol, dried in the dark over phosphorus pentoxide at 135\ufffd C.) was suspended in anhydrous benzene (20 ml). To the suspension was added 2-methyl-3-ethoxyacryloyl chloride (2.369 9, 16 mmol) (Shealy, Y. F.; O'Dell, C. A.; Thorpe, M. C., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1981, 18 383-389) in benzene (15 ml). The mixture was heated at reflux for a half hour, and then cooled slowly to RT over a period of 2.5 bours. This procedure yielded a solution of 2-methyl-3-ethoxyacryloyl isocyanate 50 in benzene., 116561=This product could be converted to the protected precursor of the guanosine analog building block 61 by acidic hydrolysis (Y. F. Shealy, C. A. O'Dell, G. Arnett, J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30 1090-1094), followed by benzoylation by the procedure described above. Product 61 could be conveniently stored, and converted to the thiol-alcohol building block (62) immediately before coupling by reduction with lithium borohydride., 75466=Sodium hydride (200 mg) was added to a mixture of the cis and trans isomers of ethyl 1-acetoxy-2-carboethoxycyclohex-4-ene (1.60 g, 7.55 mmol) in absolute ethanol (50 ml), and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at RT. The reaction mixture was neutralized with Dowex W 50 cation exchange resin (acid form), the resin removed by filtration, the solvents removed under vacuum, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (hexane:EtOAc 7:3, Rf=0.40) to yield 1.2 g (94%) trans 1-hydroxy-2-carboethoxycyclohex-4-ene (IR CCl4, 1732 cm-1)., 105211=6-Chloropurine (663 mg, 3.7 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of dimethylformamide (10 ml) and triethylamine (0.57 ml). The mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C., and as solution of 1-pivaloyloxy-5-benzyloxy-3-O-chloromethyloxypentane (41, from 1.09 g of 1-pivaloyloxy-5-benzyloxy-3-pentanol) in dry dimethylformamide (10 ml) was added slowly over a period of 15 min. After addition was complete, the mixture was allowed to warm to RT overnight. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to yield 880 mg (52%) of a colorless oil consisting of a 20:1 mixture of the N9 (42a) and (presumably) the N7 isomer of the desired product., 97842=A solution of lithium triethylborohydride (1M in THF, 0.85 ml, 0.85 mmol) was added over a period of a half hour to a solution of methyl 2-trans-t-butyldiphenylsilyloxymethyl 4-cis-(N.N-dibenzoyladen-9-yl)-cyclopentaneacetate (129 mg, 0.17 mmol) in dry THF (3 ml) at -18\ufffd C. under argon. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 10\ufffd C. More reducing agent (0.2 ml) was then added at 0\ufffd C., and stirring continued at RT for another half hour. The reaction mixture was then hydrolyzed with saturated ammonium chloride (0.5 ml), evaporated, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (ether:ethanol 9:1 as eluant) to yield 2-(trans-t-butyldiphenylsilyloxymethyl)-4-cis-(N-benzoyladen-9-yl)-cyclopentaneethanol (30, 83 mg, 78%)., 28497=For example, the complementary natural oligonucleotide is a readily designed molecule that will bind with sequence specificity to a target natural oligonucleotide. Indeed, oligonucleotides complementary to biologically active oligonucleotides are used as probes and, more recently have been found to inhibit the biological function of the target oligonucleotide, presumably because they form double helical structures specifically with their target oligonucleotide. \"Anti-sense RNA\", RNA complementary to messenger RNA coding for a specific protein, when microinjected into frog eggs, inhibits the expression of the coded proteins (\"hybridization arrest\"). \"Anti-sense\" DNA also is reported to inhibit the translation of complementary mRNA (Paterson, et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1977 74 4370-4374). Anti-sense nucleic acids inhibit the expression of viral genes in cells growing in tissue culture (Zamecnik, P. C.; Stephenson, M. L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1978 75 280-284). \"Hybridization arrest\" of the translation of m-RNA by complementary oligonucleotides has been reported by many other authors, both in vivo (Kawasaki, E. S. Nucl. Acids Res. 1985 13 4991-5003) and in vitro (Minshull, J.; Hunt, T. Nucl. Acids Res. 1986 14 6433-6451) In several cases, natural oligonucleotides have been reported as being taken into cells in tissue culture and displaying antiviral effects. (Zamecnik, P. C.; Stephenson, M. L. 1978 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 75 280-284. Stephenson, M. L.; Zamecnik, P. C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1978 75 285-288. Zamecnik, P. C.; Goodchild, J.; Taguchi, Y.; Sarin, P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1986 83 4143-4146)., 80021=Pivaloyl chloride (1.036 g, 1.1 equivalents) was added at -20\ufffd C. to a solution of 2-hydroxymethyl-cyclohex-4-eneol (7, 1.00 g, 7.81 mmol) in pyridine (10 ml). The reaction mixture was kept at -20\ufffd C. for 20 hours, diluted with methanol and ether (50 ml), and the organic layer extracted with 20 ml portions of 10% HCl containing copper sulfate until the blue color in the organic layer had disappeared. The ethereal layer was dried (magnesium sulfate), the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (hexane:EtOAc 7:3, Rf=0.43) to yield 2-pivaloyloxymethyl-cyclohex-4-eneol (8, 1.54 g, 93%) as a colorless oil. (IR, CCl4 1730 cm-1). 3,4-trans 1-Methoxy-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-4-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-tetrahydrofuran 9 and 1-Methoxy-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-4-(2',2'-dimethoxyethyl)-tetrahydrofuran.}",
