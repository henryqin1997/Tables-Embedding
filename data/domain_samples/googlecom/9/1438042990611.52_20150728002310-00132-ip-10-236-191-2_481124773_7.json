It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained and since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. This invention is clearly new and useful. Moreover, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art at the time it was made, in view of the prior art when considered as a whole. It should also be observed that the continual re-charging of immersing liquid 20 by the relatively pure liquid 68 means that said immersion liquid 20 rarely requires changing. However, after long periods of operation, it may become necessary to open valve 64 (lower right hand corner of the drawing) to allow drainage of immersion liquid 20 through conduit 62. It should thus be understood that the novel system is a substantially closed liquid system. The operating conditions in column 34 may be atmospheric,",
