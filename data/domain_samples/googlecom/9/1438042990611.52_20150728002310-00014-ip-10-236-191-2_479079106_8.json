The disclosed device comprises a trim plate, directly behind the hull bottom in the path direction, which has been inserted into the relative water flow and crossways to it. The trim plate produces at least one main vortex with an upwardly and forwardly directed force component in front of the trim plate. According to SE-C2-502671, this causes the formation of a water volume with an increased pressure acting against a zone of the hull bottom in front of the trim plate. The trim plate is preferably inserted to a continuously adjustable depth, corresponding to 0-3% of the trim plate length and preferably at the most corresponding to 2.7% of its length. Furthermore, the trim plate preferably extends along an essential portion of the hull width and preferably along the whole width of the hull bottom or bottom halves.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, the arrangement or arrangements according to the invention can be connected to a suitable control system of any previously known type, e.g. a computerized control system on board a boat or vessel. If the two above-described strategies are combined, dynamic control of both running trim and list of a running boat can be achieved by means of the invention. When the invention instead is utilized primarily for dynamic control of list of a boat, a pair of arrangements according to the invention are suitably used. Thereby, one of the arrangements according to the invention is attached close to the starboard end of the stern, while the other arrangement is attached closer to the port end of the stern. In this case, the pair of arrangements according to the invention are activated in an individual manner, i.e. the arrangement at the end of the stern of the running boat which is closer to the water surface is activated to a higher degree than the arrangement attached to the opposite end of the stern. However, embodiments of the invention are also conceivable wherein more than two arrangements according to the invention are utilized for the above-described control strategy. For example, when the invention is utilized primarily for dynamic control of running trim of a boat, one single arrangement according to the invention or several cooperating arrangements according to the invention can be used. In this case the",
