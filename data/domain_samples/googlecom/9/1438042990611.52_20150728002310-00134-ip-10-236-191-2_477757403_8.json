Various modification and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broad spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense; the invention is limited only by the provided claims. [0074] Referring now to FIG. 1, pre-routing server 401 would be implemented between adaptor 110 and router 116 and would have access to all machines connected to LAN 128. Moreover, pre-routing server 401 would have additional connection with network routing apparatus and automated systems (not shown). In a virtual queue embodiment, separate types of media would not have to be en-queued in media specific queues until the point of interaction with an agent after agent-level routing has been approved and performed. Information from the virtual queue position of each event can be used to direct the agent in pursuing his or her responses and treatments with regards to which queues to work from etc. There are many possibilities. [0073] In still another embodiment, a gatekeeper (not shown) could be provided on the agent side of pre-routing server 401 and be adapted as an additional screening mechanism. In this case, all events having a special code or pre-set phrase are sent to the gatekeeper, which then filters the events further, perhaps using",
