[0701] Alternatively the tubular extension 601 may be advanced until the tubular extension 601 is distally of the distal end of the filter 602 before retrieving the filter 602 into the catheter body 23. [0700] The tubular extension 601 may be advanced to the distal end of the filter 602 before retrieving the filter 602 into the catheter body 23, as illustrated in FIG. 85. [0699] By defining the guidewire lumen 603 using the tubular extension 601 of the retrieval catheter 600, this serves to isolate the collapsing filter 602 from the guidewire 604, and thus prevents the filter 602 from becoming fixed to the guidewire 604. [0698] The retrieval catheter 600 is particularly suitable for retrieving filters, such as the filter 602 which do not have an inner tubular member to define a guidewire lumen through the filter 602. Filters which do not have an inner tubular member are liable to becoming fixed against the guidewire 604 when the filter is collapsed down. When this occurs it is no longer possible to retrieve the filter while the guidewire remains in situ in the vasculature. [0697]FIG. 263 illustrates another retrieval catheter 600 according to",
