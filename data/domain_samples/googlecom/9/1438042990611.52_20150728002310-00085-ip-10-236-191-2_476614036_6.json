In addition, it is clear that the method and apparatus of the present invention has utility in many applications where universal and efficient offloading is required. It is contemplated that many changes and modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as described. FIG. 4C is a flowchart illustrating a possible logic control of the placing drive for implementing the present invention according to FIG. 2. The process starts in step 190 where the system whether the tray is full. If it is, then the placing drive stops for one cycle for the next tray to be as in step 192, then the as in step 192, then the slider bar is checked whether it has reached any extreme position. If it is, the process stops the pick up drive and reverses the slider bar in step 198. Otherwise, the placing drive moves the belt and suction with the package to the first tray pocket in step 200. Next, the placing drive moves the",
