Different terminals may be used with different input devices and different types of display screens and display screen controllers. Different programs may be used at the different terminals as long as the programs are able to provide the functions of displaying both information input from the local terminal and information input from the remote terminal(s) at the correct places on the display screen. All manner of variations may also be made in the generation and processing of signals by this equipment. Finally, if the communication menu has not been chosen, the routine tests if the user has asked to quit the program (box 650). If so, it notes the request (box 652) and exits the routine. If a connection has not been requested, the program instead gets a parameter with which to later establish a connection (630), which it stores (632). Next, the routine tests if it is a communications menu (box 626). If it is, the program checks whether a connection to a remote system has been requested (box 628). If it has, it attempts to make the connection (box 640) and checks if a connection was successful (box 642). If it was successful, it notes this (box 644) and exits the",
