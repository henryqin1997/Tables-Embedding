An identification code assigned to one section (hereinafter referred to as \"section ID\") is registered in each of the copying machines 1000A to 1000C beforehand. A section ID inputted by a user is compared with the registered section ID, and if both section IDs are identical, the inputted section ID is transmitted to the host computer 2000 via the telephone line 3000., 51928=More specifically, in the case where the maximum number of copies set for the user section ID is 10000 while the total number of copies made in the section so far is 7000, the permitted copy number should be 3000 (10000-7000). The CPU 211 transmits a number smaller than 3000 (100, for instance) as the limiting value data to the copying machine 2-2, so that the permitted copy number is temporarily set at 2900 (3000-100)., 32848=The host computer 2000 monitors the current total number of copies made by each section. When a section ID is received from one of the copying machines 1000A to 1000C via the telephone line 3000 and the current total number of copies made under the section ID is smaller than the upper limit number of copies predetermined for the section ID, the host computer 2000 permits a copying operation to the copying machine into which the section ID has been inputted., 33329=The copying machine, to which the copying operation is allowed, informs the host computer 2000 of the number of copies after the copying operation. The host computer 2000 adds the number of copies to the total number of copies made by the section. If the addition result is larger than the upper limit number, copying will be prohibited under the section ID.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been fully described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. (5-5) A plurality of copying machines are connected to the host computer 1 in the above embodiment, but the present invention may be applied to a supervisory control system in which only one image forming apparatus is connected to the host computer. In such case, the limit number allocated to a received user section ID may be the largest possible number that can be allocated to the user section ID, i.e., the number calculated by subtracting the total number of copies made under the user section ID from the upper limit number of copies which are allowed to make under the user section ID. (5-4) The present invention is applied to a copying machine supervisory control system in the above embodiment, but it may also be applied to a supervisory control system for another type of image forming apparatus, such as a printer. Even when this does not happen, the host computer 1 can grasp the number of copies made by each copying machine 2 from each copying machine ID, so that maintenance can be performed",
