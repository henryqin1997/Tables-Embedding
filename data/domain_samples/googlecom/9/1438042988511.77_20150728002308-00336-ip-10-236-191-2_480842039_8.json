    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the present invention may be used with equal facility and advantage in other non-dilatation catheter devices. Moreover, although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood that the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects. As is readily apparent to those skilled in the art, variations and modifications can be affected while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing disclosure, description, and figures are for illustrative purposes only, and do not in any way limit the invention, which is defined only by the claims. After the air is drawn out of the catheter 1, the valve may be turned to a closed position so as to maintain the vacuum in the catheter by closing off the lumen 23 in the side leg 22. Next, the syringe is disconnected from the valve, and a separate inflation device (not shown) containing inflation fluid may be connected to the valve. Then, the valve may be set so that the inflation fluid in the inflation device will be in fluid communication with the lumen 23 of side leg 22 when the inflation device is connected to the valve. The lumen 5 and the balloon 8 of the catheter 1 may now be inflated by the inflation",
