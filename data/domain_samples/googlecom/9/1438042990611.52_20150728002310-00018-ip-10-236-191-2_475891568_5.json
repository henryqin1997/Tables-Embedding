Further, it is to be understood that although the present invention has been described in a preferred embodiment, various modifications known to those skilled in the art may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention, as recited in the claims appended hereto. Referring to FIG. 9, a graph comparing the Failure Percentage versus Time (Seconds) characteristics of the related art and the alternate embodiment of the proposed invention referred to in FIG. 8. From the graph, it should be apparent, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the mixed oxide approach of the present invention provides a substantial improvement over the related art. Referring to FIG. 8, a graph comparing the Current Density (Amp/cm2) versus Gate Voltage (V) characteristics of the related art and two different embodiments of the proposed invention are depicted. In the preferred embodiment, a combination silicon dioxide layer is grown, of which 50\u212b is grown by means of RTO, and 70\u212b is grown through a furnace.
