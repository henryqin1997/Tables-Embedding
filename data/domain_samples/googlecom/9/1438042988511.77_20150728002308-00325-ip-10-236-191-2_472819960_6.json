The stapling device 60 can be implemented after the appropriate size implant 50, 55 is selected and positioned on the facet joint 100 such that the device 60 engages the facet joint 100 and the implant 50, 55. The stapling device 60 secures the implant 50, 55 in position in the facet joint 100. The stapling device 60 comprises any suitable material that can be heated to allow for some compression, such as Nitinol, or the like. FIG. 6 illustrates an embodiment of a synthetic implant 55 that may be implemented in the facet fusion system. The synthetic implant 55 comprises a fusion portion 57 and a cap 58. The fusion portion 57 is adapted to engage an internal portion of the facet joint. The cap 58 is adapted to engage a posterior portion of the",
