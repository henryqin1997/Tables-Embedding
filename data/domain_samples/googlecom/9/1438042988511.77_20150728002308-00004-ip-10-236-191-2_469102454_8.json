No. 2003/0081281 concerns a Wavelength Division Multiple Access (WDMA) free-space broadcast technique for optical backplanes and interplanar communications for providing free-space optical interconnects between multiple circuit cards in a computer system or networking device. It is intended to provide a stable, optimal alignment between a laser center wavelength and the center of a Gaussian bandpass filter in order to optimize power transmission through free-space and reduce optical crosstalk interference in optical networks.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as examples and that many other embodiments are possible within the spirit and the scope of the present invention. It will be appreciated that since circuit boards configured with fiber optical links of the present invention do not communicate via a backplane or other physical communication connection, a system in which circuit boards are deployed off the backplane is possible. This is of particular advantage in applications where design requirements and space limitations impact control system configuration. A non-limiting example may be guided missiles, where aerodynamics and missile size are of the utmost importance. Although the description herein relates to transceivers dedicated to a single optic fiber, it will be readily appreciated that using transceivers with two or more optical fiber connections associated with the appropriate number of optical fibers and alignment mechanisms is within the scope of the present invention. Such transceivers may be deployed on one, some or all of the electronic components associated with the system. Therefore, an upgraded system with a mixture of boards communicating: solely through the backplane; optically with single-fiber dedicated transceivers solely and in combination with the backplane; and optically with multi-fiber transceivers solely and in combination with the backplane, is fully within the scope of the present invention. , fiber optical links of the present invention may be used to establish optical",
