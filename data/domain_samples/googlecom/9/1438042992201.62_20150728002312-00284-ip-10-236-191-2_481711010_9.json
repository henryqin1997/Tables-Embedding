Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations may be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made herein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. After new aggregate group 244 registers at new host address and port number 234 but prior to aggregate group 200 disconnecting its component parts, a post-departure callback notification may be sent to primary facet object 204. At this point, the component parts of aggregate group 200 are considered stale since a new active aggregate group 244 exists at new host address and port number 234. The post-departure callback notification allows aggregate group 200 to perform internal final processing before its component parts are delinked and garbage collected and prior to unblocking any messages at current host address and port number 222. FIG. 9C illustrates post-movement callback notifications. After new aggregate group 244 registers at new host address and port number 234, a post-arrival callback notification may be sent to new version 242 of primary facet object 204 at new host address and port number 234.
