A61f 1/22 U.S. Cl. 3--1 19 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A prosthetic heart valve has a cage for guiding the movable disc mounted on a frusto-conical, annular retaining ring circumscribing the valve ring. The retaining ring is covered by a cloth suture ring. The movable disc closely overlays the downstream cloth/metal margin so that seating pressure inhibits thrombus growth. The cloth suture ring is relatively thin and wide. In one embodiment the outer cloth is loosely woven to encourage tissue ingrowth., 32057=Comparative Study of Some Prosthetic Valves for Aortic and Mitral Replacement, by C. A.
