            "(a) The legislature finds that: (1) The public interest requires that consumers be protected from abuses in commerce which deprive them of the full value and benefit of their purchases of goods and services or which deceive them regarding the availability and nature of goods or services for sale. (2) These abuses create an unhealthy climate for business and restrict the economic growth of the Commonwealth. (3) The consumer often does not have sufficient information to make a rea-soned judgment regarding available goods or services. (4) Other practices in commerce need to be instituted or restricted in order to protect the interests of consumers. (5) In addition to the general public, merchants themselves, especially small business people, are consumers of goods and services from other mer-chants and can benefit from a curb on unethical marketing practices. (6) Consumers and merchants alike benefit from an orderly market envi-ronment in which both parties are aware of their rights and obligations. (b) It is the purpose of this article to: (1) Prohibit practices by merchants which deceive, mislead, or confuse the consumer. (2) Clarify the relationship between consumers and merchants and their re-spective rights and obligations. (3) Require or restrict commercial practices in order to further an orderly market environment. (4) Provide a mechanism for resolving disputes between merchants and consumers. (5) Provide civil and criminal remedies and penalties for violations of this article.",

(2) Protecting the consumer from the use of deceptive methods, acts, or practices in the sale of goods or services. (3) Fostering competition. (4) Promoting effective representation of consumers\u2019 interests in all branches and levels of government. (b) A consumer counsel is designated within the office of the Attorney Gen-eral to coordinate preventive and remedial consumer protection programs of the Commonwealth government and to vigorously prosecute those who violate the consumer protection laws of the Commonwealth.",

For the purposes of this section, the Commonwealth court issuing an injunction shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued, and in such cases the Attorney General, acting in the name of the Commonwealth, may petition for recovery of civil penalties. Where the conduct constituting a violation is of a continuing nature, each day of such conduct is a separate and distinct violation. In determining any amount of the civil penalty under this article, the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of the harm caused by the conduct constituting the violations, the nature and persistence of the conduct, the length of time over which the conduct occurred, and the assets, liabilities and net worth of the person, whether corporate or individual. (b) Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each violation, which shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the Common-wealth by the Attorney General.
