A rotor is positioned within the ceramic cylinder and includes a magnetic structure having pole pieces and windings thereon. A plurality of magnets are connected in a spaced relation about the inner surface of the piezoelectric cylinder. The rotor rotates relative to the stator and the rotor windings cause the ux flow through the magnets of the stator to be changed thereby exing the piezoelectric element to generate an output voltage., 8105=Hmm NE, MW@ J.
