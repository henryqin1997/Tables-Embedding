    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73352=An ibutton is a computer chip that is housed in a cylindrical housing (such as a steel canister). The housing is designed to withstand the harsh conditions of outdoor environments. The ibutton may be incorporated into a ring or other wearable itemfor instance, ibuttons may be affixed to badges, watches, rings, key chains and the like. The chip within the housing includes a microprocessor and may also contain computer memory, a clock or sensors. Such ibuttons are used by contacting the ibuttons with readers (e.g. \u201cblue dot receptors\u201d) that are cabled into the serial ports of associated computers. A suitable ibutton for practicing the illustrative embodiment consistent with the present invention is the Java\u2122 Ring produced by Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. Java is a trademark or registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and in other countries. A suitable reader is the DS1402 blue dot receptor from Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. The reader may also be a proximity detector.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described with reference to an illustrative embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate the various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the intended scope of the present invention as defined in the claims. For example, the present invention may be practiced with secure electronic devices other than smart cards or ibuttons. Moreover, the currency tokens on the secure token device need not be MONDEX-compatible; rather alternative varieties of tokens may be used. It should further be appreciated that funds may also be passed from individual users to managers of business units. The managers of business units may continue to push funds up until a budget secure token devices 290 is reached. The budget secure token device 290 may then pass the funds to the currency secure token device 200. In other words, the fund flow depicted in 10 is reversed. In various points of time, it may be useful to perform a roll up so that unused card money would be pushed back up the hierarchy to the central corporate bank (step 97 in FIG. 6). The timing of rollups is configurable by the organization. Some of these funds include those that have been accumulated by service providers. FIG. 17 illustrates the general flow of funds back to the currency secure token device. The user pays for the service provided by a service",
