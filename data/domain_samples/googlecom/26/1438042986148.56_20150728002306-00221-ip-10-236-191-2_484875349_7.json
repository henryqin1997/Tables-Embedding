For example, \u201cLP-P1\u201d means that the wafer W is transported from any one of the first to fourth load ports 102, 114, 116 and 118 to the first substrate holder 124 a. Further, since the substantially-identical operations are repeated in the period between 350 sec. and 1917 sec., the processing contents are abbreviated as shown in FIG. 10.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Note, in the above-mentioned embodiment of the invention, the processing apparatus employs the transfer units each having two arm parts provided with, at respective ends thereof, with the substrate holders, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 7. In the modification, the present invention is applicable to the apparatus having the transfer units each having the single arm part provided, at the leading end, with two substrate holders, accomplishing the advantageous effects. As can be understood from the above descriptions, according to the apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to improve the throughput of the whole apparatus remarkably. That is, not only does the above-mentioned relationship (T1\u2248T2\u2248T3/number of load lock chambers\u2248T4/number of vacuum processing chambers) collapse, but also the cycle times of the individual units are increased. Therefore, it will be understood that the apparatus of the 2nd. comparative example has also a remarkably-small throughput in comparison with that of the apparatus of the invention. the cycle times T4\u2033 of the first and second vacuum processing chambers 158 and 164 are 96 seconds respectively. the cycle times T3\u2033 of the first and second load lock chambers 130 and 132 are 110 sec. respectively; and the cycle time T2\u2033 of the second transfer unit 156\u2032 is 50 sec.; the cycle time T1\u2033 of the first transfer unit 124\u2032 is 45 sec.; In the second comparative example, There is no change between the number of action steps",
