Whilst in the preferred embodiment of the invention a single adjustable region is provided in the seat, back it will be appreciated that more than one adjustable region may be provided if desired. It will be noted that a single panel 9 is utilized within the preferred embodiment of seat. With this arrangement, there is an automatic and smooth transition from the lumbar region to the upper back region regardless of the state of adjustment of the lumbar region. However, the invention is not limited to this configuration and it may, under some circumstances, be desirable to limit the extent of the lumbar region panel to the lumbar region itself. If increased lumbar support is required, the adjusting means is appropriately adjusted to draw the cross members 18,19 towards each other. This action will cause the central regions 15 of the springs to bow forward and carry forward with them the panel material therebetween. This will increase the \"firmness\" of the lumbar region of the seat as required. If, after such adjustment, less lumbar support is subsequently required the adjusting means is simply operated to allow the cross members 18 and 19 to move apart under the inherent resilient effects of the",
