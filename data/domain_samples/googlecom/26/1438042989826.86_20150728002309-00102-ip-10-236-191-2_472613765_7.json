No. 07/510,699, filed Apr. 18, 1990, now abandoned., 38263=Immediately after the buffer film has been deposited, the silicon is cooled to about 750\ufffd C., and the oxygen pressure is raised to about 200 milli Torr and the YBCO film is deposited by laser ablation method. With changes in silicon substrate temperature and oxygen pressure YBCO could be deposited by sputtering, by e-beam deposition, by evaporation, by molecular beam epitaxy, or by the forms of chemical vapor deposition. Laser ablation of YBCO is described by Koren et al. in \"Highly Oriented As-Deposited Superconducting Laser Ablated Thin Films of Y1 Ba2 Cu3 O7 on SrTiO3, Zirconia, and Si Substrates\", Applied Physics Letter 53(23) Dec. 5, 1988. The YBCO compound can be 1-2-3, 2-4-8, or other combinations depending on pulsing variations in the ablation technique., 35527=The spin-etch technique for cleaning and terminating the surface of the substrate is described in Fenner et al. \"Silicon Surface Passivation by Hydrogen Termination: A Comparative Study of Preparation Methods\", Journal of Applied Physics 66(1), July 1989, 419-424. As described therein, the wafer surface oxide is etched using an HF-Alcohol reagent in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature while the wafer is spinning.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, various modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Other oxide superconductors besides Y-Ba-Cu in a 1-2-3 or 2-4-8 ratio can be prepared. Any of the rare earth elements can be substituted for Y in the above compounds. Also some or all of the Ba can be replaced by Ca or Sr. In addition, some of the Cu can be replaced by transition metals and by Zn and Ga. Other oxide superconductors that could be deposited include the many Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu systems and their variants. The Ba (Pb, Bi) O3, (Ba, K) BiO3 and the n-type superconductors, such as, Nd2-x Cex CuO4-y could also be prepared. While the invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiment, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. For example, the YSZ film can grow on silicon surfaces having other crystallographic orientations (such as 111) by laser ablation deposition. Further, other superconducting material can be deposited using the process in accordance with the invention. Transmission electron micrographs reveal coherent growth of the YSZ on the silicon and of the YBCO on the YSZ, highly textured (100) cubic-fluorite structure YSZ, and YBCO with a high degree of C-axis orientation. X-ray diffraction of the films indicates a high degree",
