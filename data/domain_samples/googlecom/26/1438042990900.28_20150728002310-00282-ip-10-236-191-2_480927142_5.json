A variation of this approach was to add a substance such as glucono delta lactone, which required further reaction with the food mass before acid developed. Most commonly such an acidulant reacted with water present in the food and hydrolyzed into acid. This is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,992,116 (Louis Sair) and British Pat. No. 1,138,765, published Jan. 1, 1969. However, the dispersion still had to be relatively quick to avoid problems with concentrations of acid produced from undispersed concentrations of acid-producing substances., 45052=The moisture content was less than 13% based on lactic acid weight. In this example, the lactic acid was plated onto the calcium lactate, but then drum packed prior to fat coating. In the interim handling, fines were generated and the malto dextrine (aqueous solution) was sprayed into a fluid bed of the calcium lactate, using a GPCG-500 unit, to reduce the amount of fines. Conditions of spraying were about 3 bar atomization pressure, 60\ufffd C. and 40\ufffd-45\ufffd C. inlet and outlet air temperatures, and a spray rate of about 1000 ml./min. The substrate prior to fine reduction, had the following particle size distribution:, 28154=The lactic acid preferably is applied to the calcium lactate by spray applying the acid into a fluidized bed of the calcium lactate. Although there are many fluidized bed apparatus which can be used, one suitable such apparatus is a spray fluid bed applicator marketed by Glatt Air Techniques, Inc., Model GPCG. A similar type unit is sold by Aeromatic, Inc. of Bernardsville, N.J. The Glatt unit and technique for using it are described in copending application Ser. No. 337,722, filed Jan. 7, 1982 and assigned to assignee of the present application, now abandoned. The disclosure of Ser. No. 337,722 is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The mixture was stuffed into casings at an internal meat temperature of approximately 50\ufffd F. The resulting sausage was smoked until an internal temperature of the meat reached 137\ufffd F. This was accomplished by raising the temperature of the smokehouse slowly over a five-hour period. The meat was held at 137\ufffd F. for 15 to 30 minutes to complete the heat release phase. The internal meat temperature was then lowered to between 110\ufffd-120\ufffd F. and held for 9-10 hours during smoking. Then the internal meat temperature was raised to 139\ufffd F. and held for one hour. The final processing step included showering the sausage with water, chilling it, vacuum packing it and finally refrigerating it. The sausage using encapsulated lactic acid displayed the following pH history: 0 hours, 6.0; 5 hours, 5.6; 24 hours, 5.0; 48 hours, 4.9. A control product employing lactic acid starter culture displayed the following pH history: 0 hours, 6.0; 5 hours, 5.7; 24 hours, 5.2; 48 hours, 4.9.
