The entirety of all references noted herein is expressly incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 7, the prosthesis may be provided with tine members that have varying thicknesses. In this embodiment, the prosthesis includes an expander nut 98 and tine members 100, 102, 104 and 106 of varying thicknesses. As illustrated, tine members 100 and 102 are provided with thicker cross sections relative to tine members 104 and 106, forming a prosthesis with more than one effective diameter. The prosthesis includes a first, minor diameter 112, measured in a first direction about tine members 104 and 106. The first, minor diameter is preferably in the range of about 10 to 18 mm. A second, major diameter 114, is measured in a second direction substantially transverse to the first diameter 112 about tine members 100 and 102. The second, major diameter is preferably in the range of 13 to 23 mm. In this configuration, tine members 100 and 102 will be expanded, upon turning of a bolt member coupled to central bore 110, to a larger diameter relative to tine members 104 and 106. The thickness of the individual tine members in the minor diameter may range from 1to 3 mm. The thickness of the individual tine members in the major diameter may range",
