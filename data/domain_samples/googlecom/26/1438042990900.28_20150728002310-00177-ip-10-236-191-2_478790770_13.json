    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6551=For the preparation of a patch with the required amount of rhGH the volume of each droplet was calculated according to the concentration of the rhGH in the solution and accordingly the syringe's plunger displacement which is required per one droplet printing was adjusted, wherein the range of 0.035-0.105 mm corresponded to 0.09-0.18 \u03bcl. This range of displacement was fed into a Basic program that controls the printing. Next, the Backing layer film (DOW BLF2080\u2122, The Dow Chemical Company, Mich., USA) was placed flat with the bright side up on a flat metal block. The syringe containing the rhGH solution was loaded into the XYZ dosing machine, which then placed measured rhGH drops on the backing liner. It should be noted that within a few minutes the drops started to dry consecutively. Once the 144 dots array of printed droplets was formed the printing of new array started on a new position. According to this procedure it was possible to form up to 6 arrays on a 5.5\ufffd1.6\u2033 backing liner. Sections, 2\ufffd2 cm2, of the printed 144 dotted arrays (e.g. FIG. 8) were kept at 4\ufffd C. in close vials.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45972=Compositions or devices in the form of specific types of patches adapted for the transdermal delivery of dry powder or lyophilized drugs have been disclosed for example in EPB 912239 to PowderJect Research Ltd. that discloses \u201cMethod for providing dense particle compositions for use in transdermal particle delivery\u201d., 102448=Generally preferred embodiments of the present invention typically incorporate methods and apparatus described in International Patent Application WO 02/092163 entitled \u201cMonopolar and bipolar current application for transdermal drug delivery and analyte extraction,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and incorporated herein by reference. For example, this application describes maintaining the ablating electrodes either in contact with the skin, or up to a distance of about 500 microns therefrom. The application further describes spark-induced ablation of the stratum corneum by applying a field having a frequency between about 10 kHz and 4000 kHz, preferably between about 10 kHz and 500 kHz., 116974=SC group (Group 3)\u20141692 \u03bcg/hr/ml absolute AUC value, and 1128 \u03bcg/hr/ml normalized AUC for 0.1 g rhGH., 139247=Male rats (300-325, Sprague Dawley, Harlan laboratories Ltd., Israel) were deprived of food and received water as libitum 48 hr prior to patch applications. Streptozotocin (55 mg/kg in citric buffer, 0.1 M, pH 4.5) was injected intraperitonally (IP) to the rats 24 hr prior to patch applications in order to induce diabetes. The rats were considered diabetic if 24 hours following streptozotocin injections the glucose levels were above 300 mg/dl, urine glucose was found to be positive and urine ketones were found to be negative. The diabetic rats were premedicated with IP injections of 10% ketamin/2% xylazine solution at a ratio of 70:30, 1 ml/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with either isofluorane or halothane gas. The abdominal skin hair was shaved carefully, and was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. After 30 min, transepidermal water loss measurements (TEWL, Dermalab Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) were performed to check skin integrity. Skin micro-channeling was performed by the use of the ViaDerm instrument with the conditions described above. TEWL was then measured again to control the operation. The treated skin was covered with Lispro (Humalog\ufffd) or Regular (Humulin\ufffdR) 1.5 IU insulin-printed patches. SC injections of 0.4 IU served as a positive control. Blood samples were withdrawn from the tip of the rat's tail at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hr post application, and glucose level was determined., 45598=EP 0391172 describes a transdermal patch having a matrix composed of a water-insoluble material that contains islands of solid particles of drug in a water-soluble/swellable polymer and an underlayer that controls the amount of water vapor passing from the skin to the matrix. The matrix is said to be activated by water vapor from the skin., 100347=For still other applications, an integrated electrode/medicated pad cartridge is used, to provide a practical apparatus as disclosed in International Patent Application WO 02/092163 which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and incorporated herein by reference and is also denoted MicroDerm. In these applications, the cartridge comprises an electrode array, a controlled unit and a medicated pad. Accordingly, no template is typically required. The user places the electrodes against the skin and this contact is sufficient to initiate current flow or spark formation within the electrode and the subsequent formation of micro-channels. An adhesive strip, coupled to the bottom of the medicated pad, comes in contact with and sticks to the skin when the electrodes are placed against the skin. A top cover on the medicated matrix is coupled to the electrode region of the cartridge, such that as the electrode region, fixed to the handle, is removed from the skin the top cover is pulled off the medicated pad and the pad is concurrently folded over the treated region of skin. This type of application eliminates the need for the user to touch any parts of the electrode cartridge or the medicated pad, thus substantially reducing or eliminating the likelihood of the user contaminating the apparatus., 48465=Electroporation is also well known in the art as a method to increase pore size by application of an electric field. Electroporation is disclosed as a means for transiently decreasing the electrical resistance of the stratum corneum and increasing the transdermal flux of small molecules by applying an electric field to increase the size of existing pores (Chizmadzhev et al., Biophysics Journal, 1998, 74(2), 843-856)., 143319=The stability testing was performed according to the pharmacopoeial method (European Pharmacopoeia, 4th edition, 2002. Somatropin 01/2002:0951, p. 1937-1939). At time points of 0, 1, 2, and 3 months, rhGH was extracted to a phosphate buffer solution (0.025 mM), and the solution was analyzed for rhGH amount, and for the presence of high MW protein aggregates and dimers. The analysis of high MW protein aggregates and dimers was conducted by size exclusion (SE) HPLC using TSK gel G2000 SW\ufffd1 (30 cm\ufffd\ufffd 7.8 mm, 5 \u03bcm), and Pre-column-TSK-Gel (6 cm\ufffd\ufffd 6 mm). The mobile phase was phosphate/2-propanol solution (97 volumes of 0.063 M Buffer phosphate pH 7.0, and 3 volumes of 2-propanol), and the detection was performed at 214 nm. The solution was also analyzed for other impurities and degradation products by reversed phase (RF) HPLC using C4 column and a mobile phase of 0.05M Tris-hydrochloride buffer solution, pH 7.5. The detection of degradation products was performed at 220 nm., 92655=In preferred embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus for enhancing transdermal delivery of an agent using RF energy is as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,232 and continuations thereto (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,597,946 and 6,611,706; WO 02/085451; WO 02/092163, the content of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth), comprising: an electrode cartridge, optionally removable, comprising at least one electrode and a main unit wherein the main unit loaded with the electrode cartridge is also denoted herein ViaDerm., 125503=Male Guinea pigs (500-800 grams, Dunkin Hartley, Harlan laboratories Ltd., Israel) and Male rats (350-400, Sprague Dawley, Harlan laboratories Ltd., Israel), were premedicated with IP injections of 10% ketamin/2% xylazine solution at a ratio of 70:30, 1 ml/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with either isofluorane or halothane gas. The abdominal skin hair was shaved carefully, and was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. After 30 min, transepidermal water loss measurements (TEWL, Dermalab Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) were performed to check skin integrity. Skin micro channeling was performed by the use of the ViaDerm instrument with the conditions described above. TEWL was then measured again to control the operation. The treated skin was covered with the rhGH patches and blood samples were withdrawn from a preinserted carotid cannula in guinea pig or from the rat's tail at predetermined times post application. The serum was separated by centrifugation and analyzed for rhGH by Elisa kit (DSL-10-1900, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc. Webster, Tex., USA). The transdermal delivery of rhGH was compared to that of subcutaneous hGH delivery., 51043=The Device for Transdermal Drug Delivery and Analyte Extraction of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,232, and various improvements to that invention including those disclosed in WO 02/092163 and WO 02/085451, are also referred to hereinafter in the specification by the term \u201cViaDerm\u201d., 144639=Male Guinea pigs (500-800 grams, Dunkin Hartley, Harlan laboratories Ltd., Israel) were premedicated with IP injections of 10% ketamin/2% xylazine solution at a ratio of 70:30, 1 ml/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with either isofluorane or halothane gas. The abdominal skin hair was shaved carefully, and was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. After 30 min, transepidermal water loss, measurements (TEWL, Dermalab Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) were performed to check skin integrity. Skin micro-channeling was performed by the use of the ViaDerm apparatus with the following conditions: The skin was treated with an applied voltage of 330V, frequency of 100 kHz, two bursts, 700 microsecond burst length, and no current limitation. The density of the microelectrode array used in this study was 100 microelectrodes/cm2. The device was applied twice on each location, so the density of the micro-channels was 200/cm2. TEWL was then measured again to control the operation. The treated skin was covered with the rhGH-printed patches and blood samples were withdrawn from a preinserted carotid cannula at the following times post application 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hr. The serum was separated by centrifugation and analyzed for rhGH by Elisa kit (DSL-10-1900, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc. Webster, Tex., USA). The delivery of rhGH in printed patch without additives was compared to that of rhGH in printed patch containing sucrose or trehalose., 163396=The ViaDerm apparatus that was used to generate micro-channels in the pre-clinical and clinical studies described herein is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,232 and International Patent Applications WO 02/085451 and WO 02/092163. In brief, ViaDerm is comprised of the following:, 46952=Methods for transdermal delivery of Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide (GHRP) are disclosed in WO 98/08492 to Novo Nordisk. Methods for transdermal delivery of growth hormone releasing peptide are also disclosed in conjunction with iontophoresis in scientific publications by Singh et al. (J. Controlled Release, 33, 293-298, 1995); Lau, et al. (Pharmaceutical Research 11, 1742-1746, 1994); Kumar et al. (J. Controlled Release 18, 213-220, 1992); Ellens et al. (Int. J. Pharm. 159, 1-11, 1997). In those publications, the onset of the electrical current induces the influx of GHRP across the skin, and cessation of the current terminates the influx of the peptide.}",
