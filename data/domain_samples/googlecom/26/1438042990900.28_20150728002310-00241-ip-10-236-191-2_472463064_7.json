P., et al., \"Integration of Acoustic and Visual Speech Signals Using Neural Networks,\" November 1989, IEEE Communications Magazine (1989)., 40821=a) Petajan, E. D., et al., \"An Improved Automatic Lipreading System to Enhance Speech Recognition,\" ACM SIGCHI-88, 19-25 (1988);, 86998=Averaging layer 240 comprises 10 neuron cells, each associated with a specific row of the classification layer and, hence, with a specific one of the ten allowable utterances. The values in each output row of classification layer 230 is indicative of the likelihood of that particular utterance having occurred during a 290 ms interval corresponding to that cell. These 72 inputs are combined by the corresponding neuron cell in the averaging layer to produce a value at its output representative of the probability that that utterance was spoken any place during the input stage 210 observation window of 1000 ms., 85149=The architecture of a TDNN network is shown in FIG. 14 as used in a VO embodiment of a speech classifier 200 based on reading the visual facial markers only was implemented using the five distance features previously described. No acoustic data was used for this embodiment. The delay line input stage 210 comprises five delay line 103 units each with 100 output taps, each delay line 103 storing one of the five components of the visual vector provided by vector generator 14 of FIG. 1. The delay lines were simulated in software. The time increment, \u03c4, between stored values is 10 ms so that the input time sequence window spans 1000 ms., 40979=b) Pentland, A., et al., \"Lip Reading: Automatic Visual Recognition of Spoken Words,\" Proc. Image Understanding and Machine Vision, Optical Society of America, Jun. 12-14 (1984); and, 107256=Each of the three networks were trained using the backpropagation algorithm for finding the set of weights causing minimum error for the training set examples. A learning rate constant of \u03b7=0.001 and momentum constant of a \u03b1=0.9 was used for the VO and AO cases while constants of \u03b7=0.0002 and \u03b1=0.9 were used for the full AV case. The full AV network was constructed by merging the AO and VO trained networks and adding cross-model connections between the hidden A and V layers and the classification layer. Learning was allowed to progress until the training error over the last few hundred training epochs showed negligible change. The software simulation of the spectrum analyzer 24, lip and mouth position vector generator 14, and TDNN speech classifier 200 running on a Sun Sparcstation 2 computer manufactured by Sun Microsystems, Inc. 2550 Garcia Avenue, Mountain View, Calif. 94043-1100. Training took approximately 20 seconds per epoch for the most complicated full AV network and less for the others. At every 50 epochs of training, the weights in the network were recorded and the testing set error was computed. FIG. 23 shows the progression of error reduction as a function of the number of training epochs used for VO, AO, and full AV cases. The dotted line represents the error when using the testing set of input data while the solid line is the error observed when using the training set for testing. As might be expected, the latter set generally produced lower errors., 86136=The classification layer 230 comprises 10 rows, one for each of the utterances to be detected and 72 neuron cells long. Each neuron accepts a field of 40 input lines: four rows from hidden layer 220 with ten contiguous hidden layer neural outputs. Each of the ten resulting rows has 72 neuron cells corresponding to the 72 possible values available from the time shifted output of the hidden layer. Each value at the output of the neurons in a given row of classification layer 230 corresponds to the probability that its corresponding utterance occurred during one-out-of-72 time intervals of 290 ms spaced at 10 ms intervals and spanning the original (input stage) data window of 1000 ms. The 290 ms resolution results from the 20 ms window used as an input to hidden layer 220 and the subsequent 10 unit window used as in hidden layer 220., 81462=The number of delay elements per delay line has to be sufficient to ensure that a complete utterance epoch is spanned by the total delay of (n-1) \u03c4, for the delay line structure with n output taps. For the class of utterances used, a span of 100 elements of 10 ms delay (1000 ms overall) was found to be adequate. Shorter spans of observation might degrade classification by not including the entire epoch and longer spans might degrade classification by including too much superfluous data., 89483=The AO TDNN classifier 200 output layer 240 comprises one column of 10 neuron cells 241, each cell connected to a distinct feature row of classification layer 230, a fan-in of 72. The values at the output of averaging layer 240 are each representative of the probability that its corresponding utterance occurred somewhere within the 1000 ms data window presented in input stage 210., 41372=Petajan, et al. used thresholded images (pixels) of a talker's face during the production of a word together with a dictionary of pre-stored labelled utterances and a standard distance classifier for visual recognition., 87632=The acoustic only (AO) speech recognition system uses the same type of architecture as the VO system architecture shown in FIG. 14 with parameters adjusted to accommodate the 14 component log mel scale spectral feature vectors provided by spectrum analyzer 14 of FIG. 1 at intervals of 10 ms. Thus, the delay line input stage 210 had an array of 14 rows with 100 data values as inputs to hidden layer 220. Each row corresponds to a 1000 ms of log mel scale values from one of the set of 14 output filters of spectrum analyzer 14., 101601=FIG. 21c shows an exponential activation function, f(z)=ez/T, where T is a positive value \"temperature\" parameter that effectively varies the base value, e1/T, that is exponentiated by input value z. The exponential form of activation function is used to form the estimated probability of a set of unknown variables (the set of allowable utterances) in accordance with Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstincture of Cognition, Vol. 1: Foundations, Rumelhart, et al., The MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1986, Chapter 6, pp. 194-281. The exponential activation function is used in the M-P type neuron cells of NCA 2 of classification layer 230.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the preceding description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as a specific number of utterances, data samples, devices, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the an that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits have not been shown in detail, or have been shown in block diagram form only, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. The relative insensitivity of the AxV system to acoustic noise was demonstrated by a simulation in which pink noise with a standard deviation of 0.4 was added by adding a random variable to each A vector produced by the spectrum analyzer. Under these conditions, the AO network had an overall accuracy of 43% while the AxV network had an accuracy of 74%. This improved accuracy was achieved without adjustment of any free parameters such as modifying the ratio of acoustic to visual evidence. Similar performance for the AxV system has been demonstrated when the \"ROI\" technique was used in which no fiducial markers are required. Although it is reasonable to expect that the full AV system with an overall accuracy of 87% should be better than the AxV system with its measured 91% accuracy because the full AV system can learn associations at a lower (hidden layer) level the test results indicate otherwise.
