    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56311=The polyurethane foam desirably has a halogen concentration derived from the di-substituted halogenated phenyl monomer of at most about 10%, preferably at most 3%, more preferably at most 2%, and most preferably at most about 1% to greater than 0%, preferably greater than about 0.05%, more preferably greater than 0.1%, and most preferably greater than about 0.15% by weight of the foam. Preferably the halogen is chlorine, bromine, iodine or mixture thereof. More preferably the halogen is bromine. Halogens may be incorporated into the foam from additional halogenated monomers present in the polymer polyol such as chlorostyrene, dichlorostyrene, bromostyrene or by halogen containing fire retardants added to the foam. The total halogen concentration of the foam can be determined by atomic flame emission, atomic absorption, atomic fluorescence or atomic emission spectroscopy described in Instrumental Methods of Analysis, H. H. Willard, et al., Wadsworth Pub. Co., pp. 127-176, 1981, incorporated herein by reference., 41340=The polyols employed may have hydroxyl numbers which vary over a large range, the polyols being selected based upon the desired polyurethane foam properties that are desired. In general, the polyols can have a hydroxyl number that ranges from about 20 to about 1000. Preferably the hydroxyl number is at least about 25, and more preferably at least about 30 to preferably at most about 600, and more preferably at most about 450. The hydroxyl number is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required for the complete hydrolysis of the fully acelated derivative prepared from 1 gram of polyol., 58469=The foam desirably has a flammability rating which is as good or better than a \"Bx\" of 100 mm/min as required by Fed. Reg. 38 No. 5 3--3, Nov. 6, 1973, for automotive seating. Preferably the foam has a rating of SE/NBR602, more preferably a rating of SE, and most preferably a rating of DNI. The numerical flame spread rating described herein is not intended to reflect hazards presented by this or any other material under actual fire conditions., 59165=The polymer polyol of this example is made using a reactor equipped with a thermocouple, temperature control, stirrer and a feed port. The reaction is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of about 125\ufffd C. and at a pressure ranging from about 275 to about 325 kPa. The reactants and products are constantly agitated throughout the reaction. Initially, the reactor, which is at room temperature, is charged with 1075 parts by weight (pbw) polyol A (glycerine initiated block polyether polyol which is formed from 86% by weight propylene oxide (PO) and 14% by weight ethylene oxide (EO), the polyol having an OH number of about 37.4 mg KOH/g) and 75 pbw of stabilizer (the condensation product of 1 mole of vinyl trimethoxysilane and 3 moles of a glycerine initiated block polyether polyol formed from 87% by weight PO and 13% by weight EO and having an OH number of about 47.9 mg KOH/g) This initial charge is then heated to the reaction temperature (i.e., 125\ufffd C.). A slurry of 11.4 ppw VAZO 67 initiator (2,2'-azo-bis(2-methylbutanenitrile available from E. I. Dupont de Nemours and Co. in 650 ppw polyol A, is then fed into the reactor at a rate of about 3.4 pbw/min. After the VAZO slurry has been fed into the reactor for about 2 minutes, a monomer feed consisting of about 600 pbw styrene, 480 pbw acrylonitrile, 120 pbw DERAKANE 510A and 36 pbw dodecylmercaptan is fed into the reactor at a rate of about 13.7 pbw/min until exhausted (i.e., about 90 minutes). 120 pbw of DERAKANE 510A is equivalent to adding about 70 pbw of MEDTA. Once the monomer feed has been exhausted the feed rate of the VAZO slurry is raised to about 8.2 pbw/min until exhausted (total feed time of VAZO slurry is about 135 minutes). After finishing feeding the VAZO slurry, residual monomers are stripped by applying a vacuum to the reactor for three hours while maintaining the temperature at 125\ufffd C. The polymer polyol formed is subsequently cooled to room temperature and removed from the reactor.}",

The results of these tests show that the polyurethanes made using the polymer polyols of this invention have surprisingly improved flame retardancy at reduced halogen (i.e., bromine) levels than the comparative examples. For example, the polyurethane foam of Example 5 displays improved flame retardancy compared to the polyurethane foam of Comparative Examples 3 and 4, even though the foam of Example 5 contains about half the amount of bromine present in the polyurethane foam of Comparative Examples 3 and 4. Also, the polyurethane foam of Example 8 has a better overall burn rating",
