Lett., Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 406\u2013407, 1993, has been known as an antenna having an operating frequency band in a wide band. FIG. 31 is a schematic view showing this disc monopole antenna. This disc monopole antenna is configured to include a planar monopole 101 connected to a coaxial line 102. Specifically, the planar monopole 101 is disposed as to be upright with respect to a metal plate 103 at a position away from the metal plate 103 by a distance L. It is possible to provide optimum matching so as to have a desired characteristic by adjusting the distance L.}",

The contents of these applications are incorporated therein by reference in their entirety. Although the antenna device according to the present invention has been described in detail, the present It is to be understood that modification and variation of the present invention may be made without departing from the sprit and scope of the present invention. Although explanation of the monopole antenna, wherein the radiating conductor 11 is connected to an unbalanced line, such as a micro-strip line, has been made, the present invention is not limited to the monopole antenna, and two pairs of radiating conductors 11 and antenna bodies 10 may be disposed to employ the antenna according to the present invention as a dipole antenna. In this case, one signal line of the balanced lines is connected to one of the radiating conductor 11 or one of the antenna body 10, and the other signal line of the balanced lines is connected to the other radiating conductor 11 or the other antenna body 10. Unbalanced lines may be modified into balanced lines through baluns, and the respective balanced lines may be connected to the respective radiating conductors 11 or the respective antenna bodies 10. .
