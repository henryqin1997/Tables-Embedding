    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93246=The flow chart of FIGS. 20 and 21 describes the response of the heartbeat module in processor LMP A to the receipt of a timeout message from the timer module. During block 1201, a determination is made based on the value of a Recovery Flag, of whether a recovery operation is in progress. If recovery is not in progress, execution proceeds to decision block 1202 to determine whether a subsequent decision block 1203 has been executed for all elements of the LMPstatusPMP table. Assuming a negative deterination, execution proceeds to block 1203 during which the ith element of the LMPstatusPMP table is checked and non-zero Pulse Count entries are decremented. Execution proceeds to decision block 1204, where a determination is made of whether the Pulse Count entry is in fact already equal to zero. If it is, execution proceeds to block 1205, where the actual state entry is changed to the unequipped state. Execution proceeds to decision block 1206 where a determination is made based on the SpareGroup table whether processor LMP A can spare for the failed processor. A negative determination in either of the decision blocks 1204 or 1206 results in a branch back to decision block 1202. If the determination made in block 1206 is positive, i.e., LMP A can spare for the failed processor, execution proceeds to blocks 1207 and 1208 (FIG. 21) where the Recovery Flag is set to True and LMP B is set equal to the logical identity of the failed LMP. Execution proceeds to block 1209 and the message PumpUp.RestoreLMP (LMP A, LMP B) is sent to the active database processor (LMP OCD). This logs the intention of LMP A to assume the identity of LMP B. Execution proceeds from block 1208 (as well as from decision blocks 1201 or 1202), to block 1210 during which processor LMP A's heartbeat message, HeartBeat.PulseMessage (LMP A, PMP A, State A), is broadcast to all processors. Execution proceeds from block 1210 to block 1211 and the heartbeat timer (implemented by the timer module) is reset., 95261=The flow chart of FIG. 22 describes the response of the heartbeat module in processor LMP A to the receipt of the HeartBeat.Start (LMP A, PMP A, State A) message typically from the cold start module also in processor LMP A. Execution begins with block 1301 where the Recovery Flag is set to False. Execution then proceeds to block 1302 during which processor LMP A's heartbeat message--HeartBeat.PulseMessage (LMP A, PMP A, State A) is broadcast to the other processors. Execution then proceeds to block 1303 and the heartbeat timer (implemented by the timer module) is reset., 96123=The flow chart of FIG. 24 describes the initialization of an unequipped processor. During block 2101, the processor's PMP is determined based, for example, on switch settings within the processor or on a ROM entry. PMP A is set equal to the determined PMP. Execution proceeds through blocks 2102 and 2103 where the heartbeat module initialization procedure and the processor communication module initialization procedure are respectively invoked. Then during block 2104, a PumpUp.ColdStart (PMP A) message is broadcast. By convention, only the active database processor will respond., 68714=In the exemplary arrangement 100, the line processors 21 through 24 are all in the active state and each forms a distinct failure group because the required individual circuits and connections to the user teleterminals are expensive and are therefore not duplicated. Line processor 21 comprises a processor 21-1, e.g. the Motorola 68000 processor, and associated memory 21-4 (including, for example, both random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM) as required). A direct memory access (DMA) unit 21-2 is included as a means of conveniently reading memory 21-4. Line processor 21 further includes a codec 21-6 which converts information from the analog speech format presented from the handset of user teleterminal 11 to the conventional 64 kilobits per second PCM speech representation. Such encoded speech information, as well as digital information received directly from the keyboard or switchhook of user teleterminal 11, is transmitted to bus 10, by the cooperation of processor 21-1 and memory 21-4, in the form of packets via a bus interface 21-3 (of conventional design for interfacing bus 10). The various units comprising line processor 21 are interconnected by an internal bus 21-5 in a conventional manner. Packets received from bus 10 including headers defining that the packets are to be received by processor 21, are transmitted via bus interface 21-3 for storage by memory 21-4. Such packets are further processed and transmitted either as encoded 64 kilobits per second speech samples to codec 21-6, for subsequent transmission in analog form to the handset of user teleterminal 11, or as digital information for display by user teleterminal 11 or to control other elements, e.g., a ringer, of user teleterminal 11. Each of the other line processors 22 through 24 is of similar construction. (Of course, if the user teleterminals are equipped to directly handle speech in the digital, 64 kilobits per second PCM format, the codecs, such as codec 21-6 in line processor 21, are not required.), 92697=The flow chart of FIG. 19 describes the response of the heartbeat module in processor LMP A to the receipt of a Heartbeat.PulseMessage (LMP B, PMP B, State B) from processor LMP B. During the blocks 1101, 1102, and 1103, the LMPstatusPMP table entries for LMP B are set as follows: (1) the PMP entry for LMP B is set equal to PMP B in accordance with the message, (2) the Pulse Count entry for LMP B is set to the reset value, e.g., five, and (3) the Actual State entry for LMP B is set to State B in accordance with the message., 97379=The flow chart of FIG. 26 describes the response of the cold start module to the receipt of a ColdStart.RestoreLMP (S-record) message. During block 2301, the program text and data included in the received S-record is loaded into the associated memory of the processor. Execution then proceeds to block 2302 and the message PumpUp.AckSrecord (LMP A) is transmitted to the database processor (LMP OCD) to acknowledge the receipt of the S-record., 55312=Even though the trend toward distributed processing has been a factor of increasing significance in system design from the initial development of the microprocessor, most current distributed systems employ centralized maintenance and configuration control. A typical system is the distributed signal processing system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,281, issued on Oct. 25, 1983, to G. A. Works. In the Works system, redundant elements comprising signal processors, mass memories and input-output controllers are interconnected by redundant busses. One signal processor element in the system is initially designated as the executive and assigns processing tasks from a mass memory to other elements. When a failure is detected, the executive verifies the failure, isolates the faulty element and reassigns the task to another spare element. If another element is not available, the executive reconfigures the system to permit degraded operation using the available elements. The executive element is fault monitored by one of the other elements which is capable of assuming the role of executive as required. The individual elements are addressed by the executive using a virtual addressing technique for each element., 95857=The flow chart of FIG. 23 describes the initialization of a heartbeat module. During block 1401, all the elements of the LMPstatusPMP table are cycled through and are set to the initial settings: PMP=0, Pulse Count=0, and Actual State=Unequipped., 102904=The flow chart of FIG. 33 describes the response of a cold start module in a processor being initially equipped for service to ColdStart.IdentifyOCD (LMP Sender) message from the pump up module in the active database processor. During block 2401, the LMP Sender identity received in the message is assigned as the identity of the active database processor (LMP OCD)., 96726=The flow chart of FIG. 25 describes the response of the cold start module to the receipt of a ColdStart.ChangeIdentity (LMP, State, SpareGroup) message by processor LMP A. During block 2201, the SpareGroup for LMP A is defined to be the SpareGroup received in the message. During block 2202, the logical identity of processor LMP A is changed to the LMP received in the message. During block 2203, the state of the processor is set to be the state received in the message. Execution then proceeds to block 2204 and the transmission of heartbeat messages is begun by invoking the local routine HeartBeat.Start (LMP A, PMP A, State A).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the above-described fault recovery methods and distributed processing arrangements are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention and that other methods and arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, in the fault recovery methods previously described, only processors in a standby state are allowed to replace failed active processors. In an alternative method, for example in an arrangement including no standby processors, one active processor having a given logical identity defining the performance of functions in the arrangement, can in addition assume the logical identity and perform the functions of a failed active processor. In such case, the operational processor broadcasts separate heartbeat messages for each logical identity and distinct entries are stored in each of the LMPstatusPMP tables of the other processors in the arrangement. The flow chart of FIG. 33 describes the response of a cold start module in a processor being initially equipped for service to ColdStart.IdentifyOCD (LMP Sender) message from the pump up module in the active database processor. During block 2401, the LMP Sender identity received in the message is assigned as the identity of the active database processor (LMP OCD). The flow chart of FIG. 32 describes the initialization of the processor communication module. During block 4001, interrupt vectors are set up and programs are initialized to",
