Each of compression modules 910 1-910 N operates on the same piece of trace data that is to be transmitted. In general, compression modules 910 1-910 N can represent any set of compression methods that can be used to compress a set of bits. In one embodiment, compression modules 910 1-910 N can be based on such compression-based methods as delta compression, bit-block compression, run length encoding, variable bit-block compression, or the like. Bit-block compression, run length encoding, and variable bit-block compression are described in greater detail in Faloutous et al., \u201cDescription and Performance Analysis of Signature File Methods for Office Filing,\u201d ACM transactions on Office Information Systems, Vol. 5, No. 3, July 1987, pages 237-257, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other bit compression methods can also be used by the present invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. It is understood that the functions accomplished by the invention as described above can be represented in a core which is embodied in programming code and transformed to hardware as part of the production of integrated circuits. Also, the invention may be embodied as a combination of hardware and software. The program code can be disposed in any known computer usable (e.g., readable) medium including semiconductor memory, magnetic disk, optical disc (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, etc.) and as a computer data signal embodied in a computer usable (e.g., readable) transmission medium (e.g., carrier wave or any other medium including digital, optical or analog-based medium). As such, the code can be transmitted over communication networks including the Internet and intranets. For example, this can be accomplished through the use of general programming languages (e.g., C, C++, etc.), hardware description languages (HDL) including Verilog HDL, VHDL, Altera Hardware Description Language (AHDL) and so on, or other programming and/or circuit (i.e., schematic) capture tools available",
