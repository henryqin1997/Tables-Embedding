Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. As has been described in detail above, there is provided a video coding apparatus which allows an operator to perform a coding operation efficiently and tirelessly within a short period of time. If no user code is written in the specific user code location of postal matter, a plurality of user code candidate areas which are considered to include a user code are displayed, thereby helping the operator to quickly find the user code. Therefore, the eyestrain can be reduced, and the operation efficiency can be improved. Since the user code input area is set immediately below the image display area of the specific user code location, the operator need not visually check the entire image display area and move his/her eyes. Therefore, the operator can quickly input a user code without eyestrain. As described above, according to the above embodiment, when a user code is written in a specific user code location (located, for example, immediately below a red frame+a red frame) of postal matter, the result of recognition obtained by the character/code &",
