    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. ##SPC1## The object code for the programs used in the VAV system coordinator (VSC) 11 is attached as Appendix A. In addition to providing the usual annunciators for \"heat\", \"cool\" and \"fan\" on Display 13 to indicate operation of system components, Display 13 also provides visual indication of certain diagnostic problems, called errors. Non-transparent errors indicate invalid data (storage failure, SF) or component failures or temperature sensors out of range (hardware failure, HF). In addition a transparent error, supply air temperature out of range, may exist. This error is not displayed and is cleared via the communication bus connected to the given VSC and need not be discussed further in this application. Diagnostics The air temperature at a given VSC 11, 36, 40 and 48 can be measured locally or via a remote sensor. This data is read from Display 13 via the extra temp switch S4. An additional function that is provided is the high limit time guard. This function presents an individual heating relay from being reenergized for",
