No. 11/139,768, filed May 27, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,168,993, entitled COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTOR WITH FLOATING WIRING BOARD FOR IMPARTING CROSSTALK COMPENSATION BETWEEN CONDUCTORS, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 31412=In spite of recent strides made in improving mated connector (i.e., plugjack) performance, and in particular reducing crosstalk at elevated frequencies (e.g., 500 MHz\u2014see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/845,104, entitled NEXT High Frequency Improvement by Using Frequency Dependent Effective Capacitance, filed May 4, 2004, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference), channels utilizing connectors that rely on either these teachings or those of the '358 patent can still exhibit unacceptably high alien NEXT at very high frequencies (e.g., 500 MHz). As such, it would be desirable to provide connectors and channels used thereby with reduced alien NEXT at very high frequencies., 58165=One exemplary implementation of this arrangement is illustrated and described in co-assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/088,044, filed Mar. 23, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. The implementation illustrated therein employs supports posts that support the contact wires of pair 3 as they cross over and under the wires of pair 1. However, there may be some manufacturing difficulties with this implementation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. Although exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein. Further, those skilled in the art will recognize the reciprocity that exists between the differential to common mode crosstalk induced on a first pair, when a second pair is excited differentially, and the common mode to differential signal induced on the second of these pairs when the first of these pairs is excited common-modally, with the common mode to differential crosstalk equaling the differential to common mode crosstalk multiplied by a constant, that constant being the ratio of the differential to common mode impedances. Consequently, when an improvement occurs, due to the current invention, in the differential to common mode crosstalk between two pairs when one of these pairs is excited differentially, a corresponding improvement occurs in the common mode to differential crosstalk between these two pairs, when the other of these pairs is excited common-modally. to include crossovers in pairs",
