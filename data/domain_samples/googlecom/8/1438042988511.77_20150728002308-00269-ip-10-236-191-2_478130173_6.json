The configuration illustrated in FIG. 4 differs from that illustrated in FIG. 3 in that the spacing between adjacent pairs of hair-lifting teeth 16.1, 16.2 is greater, there being, in each space between adjacent pairs of hair-lifting teeth, a single plain tooth 26, i.e. 3 a tooth without hair-lifting formations. Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a comb 10.1 which is similar to the comb 10, the same reference numerals being used to indicate the same or equivalent parts. The comb 10.1 differs from the comb 10 in that it is double-sided, having a series of plain teeth 24, without hair-lifting formations, which extend from the spine 12 on that side thereof which is opposite the teeth 16. It is to be noted that all that is required to lift precisely measured streaks of hair from a scaled out section of hair during a highlighting or other hair-beautifying procedure, is to bring the comb down onto the section of hair and then to lift it again. No \"rocking\" of the comb (in the length-wise direction of the spine) is necessary to ensure that all",
