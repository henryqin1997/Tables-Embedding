A layer adapted in its thickness to the wavelength of microwaves and with adapted dielectric constant produces a homogeneous distribution of the radiation in large-volume microwave instruments. In addition to its use in photodynamic cancer therapy, the device according to the invention is also suitable for the irradiation of plaque and stenosis areas in photodynamic angioplasty. If the second generation is already almost homogeneous, as is the case, for example, for spherical organs, the intensity fluctuations are reduced by a factor of 1/(1-R) as can be demonstrated by way of an estimation employing geometrical series, that is for R=90%, for example, by a factor of 10. FIG. 4 shows the relative light intensity (space irradiance) at the wall as a function of the shift x of the radiator toward the wall and of the reflectivity of the layer. For R=90%, the light intensity is almost",
