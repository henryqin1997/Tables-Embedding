S., and J. K. Salisbury, \u201cThe Intuitive Telesurgery System: Overview and Application.\u201d Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, San Francisco Calif., April 2000). This is because a small mechanism of changing a direction of a forceps by transmitting a driving force to a forceps tip from an actuator disposed in a base of the forceps can be relatively easily realized by use of the wire driving.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention has been described above based on the examples shown in the drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the above described examples. For example, the opening/closing of the forceps tip may be performed by driving the forceps tip by a wire, an electromagnetic solenoid or the like. Moreover, besides the one that opens and closes, the forceps tip may be one mounting a laser surgical knife or a camera. is a perspective view showing a small-sized slave robot in which the active forceps of the foregoing embodiment is held by an active trocar 9 developed as a positioning robot for a surgical tool. The active trocar 9 is a mechanism of determining three degrees of freedom in position of a tip of the held surgical tool by use of back-and-forth movement by a parallel link mechanism, left-and-right inclination by swinging of the entire parallel link mechanism and elevation by a ball screw linear movement mechanism similar to the back-and-forth movement mechanism 2 a. Moreover, together with a mechanism of determining three degrees of freedom in posture of the supporting part 3 a of the active forceps of the foregoing embodiment, the active trocar 9 can freely determine six degrees of freedom in position and posture of the forceps tip 10 in the abdominal cavity. For an arm for disposing this slave robot on an operated part, for example, a",
