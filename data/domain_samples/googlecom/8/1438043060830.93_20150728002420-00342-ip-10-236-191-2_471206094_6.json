[0020] In view of the foregoing, it is known that the signal selector 120 can send PWM brightness control signal from either the portable device 10 or the docking station 20 to the panel of the portable device 10. In response to correctly mounting the portable device 10 on the docking station 20, the brightness of the portable device 10 can be controlled by pushing a button on the docking station 20. Alternatively, the brightness control can be carried out by software. [0019] The device for controlling brightness switching of the invention further comprises a microprocessor 150, and a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) 140. The DAC comprises an input pin coupled to an output pin of the microprocessor 150 and an output pin coupled to the output of the operational amplifying buffer 130. The microprocessor 150 is adapted to execute a program for generating a PWM brightness control signal to control the brightness of the portable device 10. In another embodiment, the DAC 140 is integrated into the microprocessor 150. [0018] The transistors 204, 205, 207, and 210 are served as inverters. As such,",
