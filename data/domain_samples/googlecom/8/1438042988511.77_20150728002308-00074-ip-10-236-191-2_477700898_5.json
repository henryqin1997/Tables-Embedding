    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Although the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications, additions, substitutions and deletions not specifically described may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, the toothedges can be connected to the circular-sawblade in different ways; also, the individual teeth can be formed as knives and cutters, etc. Also the circular-sawblade can be varied. Through that the saw by the controllable action of the teeth by itself is finding its determined way through the workpiece. The circular-sawblade as earlier has been pointed out is only exposed to small stresses and therefore this organs can be made very thin, possibly also being replaced by spokes, etc. Regarding arrangements for manual or automatic control many variations with known technics for steering and control can be developed. As a matter of course such variants are included in the invention. The motor-power is transferred to the driving wheel 64A which is driving the saw. Thus, the power is directly transferred to the teeth and their cutting action. Accordingly, the power from the motor is used efficiently without specific losses. Also at the same time, a stretching of the sawblades is initiated. This is a definite advantage in relation to conventional band-saws, where the stretching of the blades is reached by hard pretensioning.",
