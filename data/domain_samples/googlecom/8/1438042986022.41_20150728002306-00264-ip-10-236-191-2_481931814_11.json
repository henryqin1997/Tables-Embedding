Thus the present invention is useful with a plurality of different robot types. Although the assembly/mechanism 1000 is shown as fitting over the pendant 135, other methods of providing functional connectivity between assembly/mechanism 1000 and pendant 135 are also possible. For example, the assembly/mechanism 1000 may be formed as a box, with an open end, so that the pendant 135 may be inserted into the box., 212283=The present invention provides for using bar codes to convey information regarding the weld. Bar codes are well known and are not described in detail herein. FIG. 11 illustrates the use of bar codes for programming the robots. The robot 100 would have a bar code scanner 1110 near the welding torch 123. The bar code scanner may be affixed to the arm of the robot 100 in any convenient manner. For example, the bar code scanner could be mounted on a plate which is attached to the gooseneck, such as is illustrated for the infrared sensors in FIG. 9. In one embodiment, the robot 100 enters a compartment and scan for the bar code 1101, and reads the information from the bar code 1101. The bar code is preferably printed on a label with an adhesive backing which will stick to the workpiece. The bar code 1101 contains information regarding the particular weld to be performed, such as the starting and ending points of the weld, or whether one or all of the corners of a compartment are to be welded, which corner is to be welded, the welding voltage and current, the type of gas, the torch angle to be used, the type of welding to be done (MIG, TIG, etc.) or whether welding or cutting is to be done, the welding program(s) to be used, etc. This information is then used by the controller 230 or the robot 100 to set up the welding operation., 213725=In another embodiment, an operator places bar codes 1102 and 1103 containing the information at the starting and ending points, respectively, of the weld. Bar code scanners 1110 work over a substantial distance and therefore the bar code need not be placed exactly at the weld but a bar code 1104 can be simply placed near the weld, such as at an entrance to the compartment 202F. The robot 100 or the controller 230 has a scanning program which causes the torch 123, and therefore the bar code scanner 1110, to move in a predetermined pattern (such as back and forth) over the workpiece so that the bar code scanner 1110 can scan the entire surface of the workpiece and read any bar codes 1101. This allows the robot 100 or the controller 230 to read the bar codes without the operator having to select a welding program which is appropriate to get into a compartment so that the bar code scanner 1110 can read any bar codes in the compartment. Rather, the bar code labels are placed on the top surface where they can be easily scanned, and the labels contain information as to which program should be used to scan or weld within the compartment., 209470=The present invention solves this problem by providing a mechanism which is installed over the pendant 135 for the robot 100. FIG. 10 illustrates the universal programming mechanism. The mechanism 1000 has a plurality of solenoids 1001A-1001P. These solenoids are arranged so that the solenoids 1001A-P are over the buttons 135AA-135AP, respectively, of the pendant 135 when the mechanism 1000 is placed over and fastened to the pendant 135. Fastening of the mechanism to the pendant may be accomplished by any number of standard techniques in the art. The controller 230 would then implement the desired program by activating the appropriate solenoids 1001A-P so as to cause the appropriate buttons 135AA-135AP on pendant 135 to be pushed at the proper time. For example, to position the robot arm, the controller 230 would activate solenoid 1001B which would press button 135AB on pendant 135 to instruct the robot to move the arm in a certain direction at a certain speed until a specified point had been reached. When the robot indicated, by signal or LED display, or other means, that the command had been executed, then controller 230 would deactivate solenoid 1001B and possibly activate solenoid 1001P to cause the robot 100 to store the coordinates of the point that had been reached; This process is repeated until the controller 230 has programmed the robot 100 for the desired welding operation. In a similar manner, controller 230 can cause the robot 100 to recall a previously stored program and execute the program, or use change position commands to modify the program., 182565=As disclosed herein, in one embodiment of the present invention, information regarding component and compartment size and position are extracted from a CAD program on another computer. However, there are different types of CAD programs and the information may not be in a usable form in some of the CAD programs. Therefore, in another embodiment of the present invention, the CAD drawing 1201 of the component 200 or compartment is printed out. FIG. 12 illustrates this method of off-line programming of the robots. Preferably, the drawing is printed out at a specified scale, such as 1 inch equals 1 foot, 1 centimeter equals ten centimeters, etc. Then, a transparency 1202 is created which shows the movements 1203A-1203D of the robots 100A-100D, respectively, with respect to the travel path of the cart. The transparency 1202 is then placed over the scaled drawing 1201 and the offset coordinates for the particular component/compartment are determined by the operator by visual inspection. The operator then inserts these offset coordinates into the program. Although this method may not be as precise as directly downloading the information from a CAD program, it provides information which is satisfactory because the touchsense and the change position features of the present invention readily compensate for any minor errors. This method can also be used for determining zones so that one can also program and print out the cart movement and use the transparency to determine if a particular cart movement will place the workpiece in the proper position for welding., 24857=This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 09/317,417, filed May 24, 1999, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/021,851, filed Feb. 11, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,906,761, which is a divisional of Ser. No. 08/368,705, filed Jan. 4, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,627., 77838=The memory in each robot 100 can store approximately 15000 steps or commands. In the preferred embodiment, a job, also sometimes referred to herein as a movement program, consists of a series of smaller programs, or subprograms. A robot can store about 1000 jobs. Each program consists of a series of steps and may be called from any job. A program is a group of move, weld, and sequence commands, as shown below, and may be, for example, an actual welding operation on a specified area, may be a robot arm or torch positioning operation, or may be a wire cutting and nozzle cleaning procedure. In the example shown below, the JOB 76 consists of three welding programs (34, 25, 30) plus three other programs (5, 440, 4) and two libraries (2, 3). A library is a group of sequencing commands, as shown below. Note that a program or library can be called more than once by the same job.}",
