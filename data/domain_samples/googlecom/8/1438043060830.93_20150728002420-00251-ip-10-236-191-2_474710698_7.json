No. 10/612,272, filed Jul. 2, 2003, by Valery Kagan, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 143588=The heater coil may be coiled in a serpentine pattern disposed on or adjacent a surface of the article and provide a magnetic field in alternating directions (with respect to position) across the article. The heater coil may be formed in a cylindrical pattern wrapped around a three dimensional article and provide a magnetic field in the same direction (with respect to position) inside the coil. In various embodiments, the electrical conductor can be a hollow element or a solid element and it can take various shapes and forms, such as spiral, serpentine, loop, spiral or loop serpentine. The conductive coil can have a variable pitch (distance between turns) which will effect the resulting magnetic field generation. Depending on available space and desired heating power, the shape and distance between coils can be varied to vary the heating power density. A description of basic heater coil designs is found in S. Zinn and S. L. Semiaten, \u201cCoil Design and Fabrication\u201d a three part article published in Heat Treating, June, August and October 1988.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the preceding description of certain preferred embodiments is provided in terms of description, and not limitation. Modifications and substitutions can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as subsequently claimed. Based upon the present disclosure, the skilled person can control the shape of the individual current pulses and the on/off timing of the current pulses in order to deliver a desired current signal to a heating element. In general, the energy delivered to the heating element is dependent on both the frequency of the pulses (number of pulses per unit time) and the shape of the pulses (the amount of energy provided in high frequency harmonics). Thus, if more energy is required to be delivered to the heating element, then the frequency of the pulses can be increased and/or the shape of the individual pulses can be modified to provide more high frequency harmonics. Furthermore, if a higher input voltage is provided, then the pulse frequency can be reduced and/or the shape of the pulses can be modified so as to reduce the amount of high frequency harmonics. In another embodiment, the on/off is controlled such that each current pulse includes at least one steeply varying portion having a maximum rate of change of at least 5 times greater than a maximum rate of change of a sinusoidal signal",
