    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{127096=PDI MetaObject web service 1538 may act as the primary interface for all calls against PDI 1506 from SOAP enabled client application interface 1520. Web service 1538 may provide access to metadata objects in a MetaObject Factory and may be registered by default with UDDI registry 1546 hosted on PDI 1506. MetaObjects and MetaObject factories are described in more detail below., 152375=In one embodiment, PDIRAPI 2314 and MetaObject factory 2316 are collectively referred to as \u201cthe metadata API.\u201d The metadata API provides access to a framework that uses metadata to manage and exchange data that may be in a multi-networked, multi-enterprise environment. PDIRAPI 2314 may work with factory 2316 to deliver data and metadata to applications (not shown). PDIRAPI 2314 may also package repetitive and/or common tasks that are not available in factory 2316., 135172=Application layer 1706 includes an application layer software 1720, a security API 1722, web content 1724, portal code 1726, an application framework API 1728, a remote invocation method (RIM) framework 1730, security containers 1732, metadata containers 1734, portal containers 1736, framework containers 1738, server side application logic 1740, and a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) 1742. Application layer software 1720 includes a JBOSS application server, a JRE, and a Rhino Javascript engine., 149793=Some of the most commonly used, customer-specific information may be stored in database 2202 without database modification. Database 2202 may also be extended through templates that can be understood by metadata, thereby permitting the metadata to be extended to satisfy the need for custom data., 120050=Architecture 1400 also includes an application messaging interface 1420 with a client application API (Application Programming Interface) 1422, a corporate firewall 1424 with internal corporate security layers 1426, a web layer 1428 with an API layer 1430, a de-militarized zone (DMZ) 1432 with a firewall 1434, a database layer 1436 with automated synchronization services 1438, automation processes 1440 for pattern recognition, part matching, or cleansing, and database adapters 1442, data sources 1444-1446, and a content management toolset 1448., 134738=Web layer 1704 includes a web layer software 1716 and a web layer pass through 1718. Web layer software 1716 includes a JRE, a log, an rinetd SSL tunnel, which can be used to redirect Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections, and an Apache application. Web layer pass through 1706 includes static content and an rinetd tunnel to application layer 1706., 319127=A server-side filter rule is a rule that can be applied during a server-side query evaluation. The rule should be included in the application requested query. For example, assume that the user performs a query for a fixed resistor with a RESISTANCE VALUE of 10 ohms and there are 1000 such parts in the PDI. The application can be configured to obtain the first 250 of these 1000 parts. It is noted that if a rule is applied after a dataset of 250 parts is created it is possible that none of the 250 parts will be returned leaving the other 750 parts untested and a return of 0 parts to SpinSelect., 131715=At this time, a dynamic lookup will happen to match the returned part numbers and manufacturer names against data (not shown) hosted on portal 1504. If a match occurs, a cache record will be stored in dynamic mapping cache 1526 on portal 1504, the cache record will retain the part number mapping and associated returned content. Cache 1526 will also retain the reference ID returned from the service. This reference ID may then be used in future queries as a fast lookup mechanism for subsequent queries. A date time stamp may be associated with the cache record. Records in cache 1526 may be dropped after aging over a predetermined range of time., 152919=Each MetaObject factory 2316, 2320, 2326, 2332, and 2340 may make use of metadata stored in the respective repositories 2318, 2324, 2330, 2338, and 2342 to access and manage information contained in nodes 2304-2310. MetaObject factory 2316 may also provide limited support for offline use, metadata cache, interacting with nodes 2304-2310, and managing data flow to and from factories 2320, 2326, 2332, and 2340., 360146=With respect to the row identified by Ref ID C1, it is noted that the Input contains MPN and CPN (with multiple CPN values in the database). Here, the scrubbing process finds that the MPN [12065C562KATMA] is mapped to two CPN [AFC2410-0005-00 and AFC2410-0023-00]. Since this is a scrub for equivalency, it does not matter which one is used. For this example, the input CPN is used, and a control interface, e.g., a drop down option, can be provided to give the user the option to select a different CPN., 140096=In some embodiments, a new plug-in may be introduced to affect the available process flows without needing specific process flow definitions. This is especially useful in environments that host many plug-in applications. The process flow API may also include methods for fetching a list of plug-in applications that can be activated based on the active plug-in application. It may be up to host application 1812 to use this information in an appropriate manner., 146153=AFW 1800 may also include a history API (not shown), which can be used by applications to denote the steps users have taken. A history file can then be used to debug customer problems. In addition, the history file can be used to reproduce the steps taken by users. AFW 1800 may also include a logging API (not shown) that maintains a set of debug log statements. The logging API may use an optional local property file to enable logging., 133634=Imported customer content may be stored in imported private content 1564 on PDI 1506. Private content section 1564 will provide support for content from multiple data sources. In addition, section 1564 will provide support for MetaObjects, which allows customers to define objects on the fly as required for a given data source schema., 352267=With respect to row identified by Ref ID C2, it is noted that the Input is missing the CPN. Here, the scrubbing process will find that that MPN [12065C562KATMA] is mapped to two CPN [AFC2410-0005-00 and AFC2410-0023-00]. Since this is a scrub for uniqueness, either, or none may be used. An automatic selection may be performed, or the mechanism can be set such that one is not automatically selected. Instead, the user can be provided with a control interface, e.g., a drop down option, with which one of two CPN can be selected., 179487=The Search Parameters Tab 2906 is tab that contains a part table with two columns. The left column contains parameter names for the selected taxonomy node. The right column contains the values to search upon. Once a set of parametric values has been entered, the user can press the Search button above the part table to search the selected database. The results of the search will be displayed in the Search Results tab described below. The Clear button above the part table is used to clear the attributes of the parameter for new searches., 128810=Interfaces, protocol bindings, and deployment details of network services hosted on PDI 1506 may be described using Web Services Description Language (WSDL). WSDL files can be created to describe the interface and protocol bindings for registered network web services in UDDI registry 1546 in a uniform manner. WSDL files may be created from any native Java, Net, JSP, and/or Cobra based API or website. Once a WSDL file is created, an associated web service code with SOAP messaging may be automatically created. The newly created client or server service can then be registered in UDDI registry 1540 as an available service., 132978=SpinData 1554 on PDI 1506 may include millions of the most actively used components. Event log 1560 on PDI 1506 may be used to view all event messages generated by applications and PDIs. When event notification service 1562 on PDI 1506 receives notifications from applications and/or PDI processes, it routes the events to the appropriate receivers or logs as required. Service 1562 may link application and PDI error codes to a standardized error code listing. Event notification service 1562 may also interpret codes to associate additional information to the code., 138492=Data may be passed from one plug-in to another using a selection object 1814 in some embodiments. A selection object can be thought of as a container of data. In one embodiment, selection objects are derived from the selection object API. The derived selection object is then defined to contain the data necessary to define the selection. In one embodiment, each plug-in registers the type of selection objects that it can read and write. This information may be used by the process flow API to determine all of the plug-in applications that can make use of objects produced by a given plug-in application., 135812=Data layer 1708 includes a data layer software 1744, an LDAP repository 1746, database(s) 1748, a metadata repository 1750, file objects 1752, and metadata bindings 1754. Data layer software 1744 supports Microsoft SQL 2000 enterprise edition and Oracle 8i database platforms. It also includes XML parsers, JavaMail, and an LDAP directory. Database(s) 1748 communicates with metadata containers 1734 using XML/JDBC protocol. Metadata repository 1750 communicates with containers 1734-1738 and application logic 1740 using JDBC protocol. Metadata bindings 1754 support connections to Microsoft SQL, Oracle 8i, IBM DB2, text, PTF, XML, Microsoft Excel, and CSV (Comma Separated Value) sources., 132432=If, instead, the services of the content providers are registered in UDDI registry 1532 on portal 1504, then static mappings can be created. Static mapping cache 1528 on portal 1504 serves as a fixed mapping cache between data on portal 1504 and other web services. Cache 1528 can be automatically pre-built. Records in cache 1528 will be retained until they are dropped manually or programmatically. Thus, unlike cache 1526, cache 1528 will not age., 142596=Plug-in manager 1810 may also maintain a call stack (not shown). In some embodiments, host application 1812 has the responsibility of calling the call stack API to inform plug-in manager 1810 when (a) a plug-in should be activated; (b) the active plug-in should be cancelled; (c) the active plug-in has finished and the previous plug-in should be reactivated. The call stack API provides methods for these types of plug-in transitions as well as query methods to enable host application 1812 to obtain information about the current call stack, active plug-in, etc., 143951=An active plug-in can lock plug-in manager 1810 from activating another plug-in or deactivating itself. This permits long processes to finish. The plug-in application, however, may allow a user to cancel a long operation. Host application 1812 may be notified of the lock and request that the active plug-in cancel its current operation., 171489=In addition to the core parametric values, a UPN property may be added. The UPN may be defined by an administrative entity, e.g., at the central database server, and may be transparent to the user. The UPN is an internal part identifier associated to parts found in SpinCircuit database 2704. C-Surfer 2708 may be used interactively or through a query process to search for a part in SpinCircuit database 2704 (e.g., by UPN, manufacturer number, core part parametric, or any combination and set of property values)., 238197=Once a BOM has been loaded and data source and mapping configurations have been set, e.g., one to one (1:1), part matching can be performed. This provides a quick way to validate the parts. If all parts are found to have correct information, then no further processing of the BOM may be desired. This same functionality (1:1 Part Matching) can also be performed in conjunction with the scrubbing tool. The 1:1 matching can be configured to match one or more of the BOM columns to mapped data source columns. The 1:1 matching process will annotate the displayed data with a status column indicating the match status., 118917=Client desktop environment 1402 may also include other applications, such as a scrubbing tool, which is described herein as \u201cSpinScrubber\u201d, an exchange tool, which is described herein as \u201cSpinConnect\u201d, and a gateway tool, which is described herein as \u201cSpinServices\u201d. SpinScrubber is an EDA tool integrated application that \u2018scrubs\u2019 schematic designs for component validity within the supply chain according to business rules and preferences. SpinScrubber also allows for rapid component replacement if required. SpinConnect provides BOM exchange capability with many product data management (PDM) systems. SpinServices is a gateway to content services within an organization's corporate library process for new part requests. A SpinCircuit application framework 1416 and plug-ins 1418 are also included in client desktop environment 1402. Further details regarding client desktop environment 1402, application framework 1416, applications 1404-1412, and other applications residing on client desktop environment 1402 are described below., 144800=In one embodiment, each plug-in is designed for a specific use and advertises the category it belongs to. Plug-in manager 1810 may use the category to ensure that only appropriate plug-ins for host application 1812 is loaded. When host 1812 initializes it's instance of plug-in manager 1810, it passes the category of plug-ins it wishes plug-in manager 1810 to load. Plug-in manager 1810 then loads all appropriate plug-ins of the specified category. Before a plug-in is loaded, plug-in manager 1810 may verify that a user is entitled to use the plug-in. If the user is entitled to use the plug-in, then it is loaded. If the user is not entitled to use the plug-in, then it is not loaded or presented to the user., 128545=All message routing may utilize queue 1544 for the storage, forwarding, and receipt of JMS compliant SOAP messages to and from PDI 1506. Queue 1544 may reside on the web and application layer of PDI 1506., 144335=Plug-ins are registered with plug-in manager 1810 in some embodiments. The registration may include information on (a) one or more plug-in categories, (b) application label, (c) application icons, (d) input selection objects, (e) output selection objects, (f) input messages handled, and/or (g) output messages generated. Plug-in manager 1810 may use the plug-in registration API to register a plug-in as it is loaded., 360683=With respect to the row identified by Ref ID C2, it is noted that the Input is missing the MPN value. The scrubbing process will find that the CPN [AFC2410-0023-00] is mapped to a single MPN [12065C562KATMA]. Since only one MPN is found, that MPN value will be used., 130312=MetaObject service 1538 can generate a request to an appropriate service registered in UDDI registries 1532 or 1546. The schema of the service will be mapped to the schema of the PDI requests and an XSLT file will be generated. At runtime, the outgoing query requests to each service are converted into the appropriate format for that specific service. Likewise, they are transformed back on the response., 148565=MetaObjects are conceptual objects that have an object-oriented encapsulation of metadata. Each MetaObject may have a class, attribute(s), method(s), event(s), exception(s), table(s), column(s), table association(s), schema(s), and/or rule(s). In some embodiments, all access to databases are performed through the use of MetaObjects. Applications and business services 2212 may access and manage documents as well as information related to or about those documents through MetaObjects instantiated through PDIRAPI 2208 or directly from MetaObject factory 2218. PDIRAPI 2208 is an entry point into MetaObject factory 2218 for client applications., 125332=PDI 1506 includes an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) based authentication SOAP enabled service 1536, a MetaObject web service 1538, a PDI sync service 1540, a PDI to PDI sync service 1542, a swift message queue 1544, a private UDDI registry 1546, XSLT mappings for private data sources 1548, a Microsoft\ufffd SQL server enterprise edition software application 1550, an Oracle\ufffd 8i software application 1552, SpinData 1554, a dynamic mapping cache 1556, a static mapping cache 1558, an event log 1560, an event notification service 1562, imported private content 1564, XML import DTD (Document Type Definition) 1566, pre-built SpinAdapters 1568, custom SpinAdapters 1570, BAAN API 1572, PTC API 1574, and client private content 1576.

PTC is the name of a product data management (PDM) solution. A PDM solution is an example of a type of data source for BOM and component information., 124911=Portal 1504 includes XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) transformations 1522, a supplier management pipeline 1524, a dynamic mapping cache 1526, a static mapping cache 1528, a sync provider service 1530, a UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) registry 1532, and a SOAP enabled web service 1534., 126560=Service 1536 may use LDAP-based client server protocol for all authentication requests against PDI 1506. LDAP service 1536 may provide access to a read-only directory hosted on a data layer of PDI 1506, which in turn provides support for users, roles, groups, taxonomy, a PDI network domain, and other PDIs in the domain. Service 1536 may also handle multi-master replication and allow writes and updates to be performed against all PDIs within the PDI network domain., 149279=MetaObject factory 2218 may act as facilitator, mediator, and/or translator of information contained in MetaObjects. It may also isolate applications and business services 2212 from the details of database structure and access. MetaObject factory 2218 may also provide backwards-compatible support to older or custom applications where backwards compatibility is necessary and/or problem resolution to applications where backwards compatibility is unavailable., 172687=Optional user-specific (\u201cMyActive\u201d) part database (not shown) and Preferred Part Table (PPT) databases 2710 can be configured and created. The user-specific database may contain company specific information and additional taxonomy not covered by SpinCircuit database 2704, while PPT database 2710 may contain a list of company preferred parts., 77822=The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/400,440, filed on Jul. 31, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/402,206, filed on Aug. 9, 2002, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes as if fully set forth herein., 180948=Once a search is performed the C-Browser will activate (e.g., show) the Search Results tab 2910. This tab corresponds to a part table showing all of the parts found in the search. Each part will be displayed horizontally in rows. The columns will be used to display a basic set of the part parametric. The part list will be scrollable up and down via a scroll bar to the right. Hot Logic components will be identified via an icon next to the UPN. Search results will show information, such as UPN, Manufacturer, Manufacturer Part Number (MPN), Description, Package, and Data Sheet URL, and/or L in respective order. Datasheet are implemented as URL tags. Selecting it will launch a web browser and send the user to the URL. If a part does not have an URL, the field will be blank. Datasheet URL status and the URL location will be retrieved from the Active Parts database., 118020=SpinMatcher 1408 is designed to \u2018match\u2019 BOMs at the individual component level with supply chain information to ensure validity and facilitate optimization. SpinConsole 1410 is a management environment for PDIs. SpinConsole 1410 allows for dynamic loading and management of data into an organization's PDI network for the purpose of content cleansing, validation, and optimization., 171148=Schematic capture tool 2702 drives the need for component information. When a symbol is instantiated on a schematic page, properties that represent the part's core parametric values need to be added to the symbol instance that uniquely identifies the physical part that the symbol instance represents., 173547=CIS tool 2812 may be used to search PPT database 2810 for a desired part. If the user is unable to find the desired part in PPT database 2810, the user can use C-Surfer tool 2808 to search a SpinCircuit database 2804 (e.g., over the Internet) for the required part. Once the part is found in SpinCircuit database 2804, the part's UPN, and some of the other database field values are returned to CIS tool 2812. CIS tool 2812 can then add a new part entry in PPT database 2810., 128104=PDI to PDI sync service 1542 may provide a master or multi-subscriber replication mechanism. Service 1542 may leverage the same port configurations as that of service 1540. In addition, service 1542 may also be registered with UDDI registry 1546. Further, access to view and administer service 1542 may be limited to local administrators as with service 1540., 143507=A plug-in is considered modal in the stack of active plug-ins, e.g., when the plug-in application is pushed to make another plug-in application active, it becomes dormant and is not reactivated until all subsequently activated plug-in applications are popped from the stack. Thus, a plug-in may perform background tasks while another task is active by launching another instance of host application 1812., 118455=SpinSelect 1412 is a component search, research, and selection tool that influences choices according to business rules and preferences. SpinSelect 1412 can be fully integrated into electronic design automation (EDA) tools 1414 to facilitate design for supply chain by blending multiple approved vendor lists (AVL) from internal and external sources such as electronic manufacturing solution (EMS) providers., 130771=When a user subscribes to a content providing service such as Silicon Expert 1584 or Total Parts Plus 1580, that user will have the ability to immediately start querying against that service for all fields listed as available to that user for that service. A MetaObject Factory (not shown) on portal 1504 will receive a request to query against a field listed as being in that given service. The MetaObject Factory on portal 1504 will then call a UDDI interface to determine the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the given service. The MetaObject Factory will also call the XSLT engine associated with the service and pass the request for content to the given service. The request will be made against the given API hosted by the content provider and a response will be returned including a given set of part numbers and manufacturer names as well as associated third-party content., 117498=SpinAdmin 1404 manages user access, application and file permissions, and external participant access. SpinDirector 1406 provides a \u2018work in progress\u2019 file storage and retrieval space where information can be collaboratively and securely exchanged with specified internal and external project participants. SpinDirector 1406 also manages information flowing in and out of other applications, and provides access to outsourced services sanctioned from service partners., 120745=Java Message Service (JMS) messaging technologies may be used to route messages from applications 1404-1412 to web layer 1428. Application API 1422 may use standard ports for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communication to allow for transversal of corporate firewall 1424. Applications 1404-1412 may be written with Java programming language. API layer 1430 may include software for retrieving information from a PDI and may be written with Java Server Pages (JSP). Services 1438, processes 1440, and adapters 1442 provide the workflow, process automation, and data transformation engine for managing content within a PDI. A combination of exact systems and fuzzy logic pattern recognition logic may be used to perform part number and manufacturer alias mapping., 145595=Application message service (AMS) 1818 may enable external application 1820 to communicate with applications derived from AFW 1800. In one embodiment, AMS 1818 is implemented using sockets and integrated with plug-in manager 1810. AMS 1818 may communicate received messages with plug-ins by creating a selection object designed for the specific message. Plug-in manager 1810 is then used to activate the first plug-in that is capable of receiving the message selection object., 292788=To address input MPNs with inconsistent punctuation, SpinMatcher uses a fuzzy logic query intelligence to eliminate incorrect spaces, slashes, and dashes in MPNs. The resulting MPN is an EDI orderable part. For example, SpinMatcher can match the MPN CRCW-1206-001-FT with CRCW1206-001F-T using fuzzy logic., 137951=Plug-in manager 1810 may contain one or more application entitlements (not shown) and various APIs (not shown), such as an application API, a selection object API, a process flow API, an application call stack API, and a plug-in registration API. In one embodiment, one or more applications are derived from the application API. The application API contains three entry points that allow the derived applications to be placed in any frame-based applet, application, or other plug-in-based application., 127549=PDI sync service 1540 on default PDI 1506 may provide support for the request, receipt, and processing of all PDI sync-based update requests from portal 1504. PDI sync service 1540 may initiate and maintain an outbound connection to portal 1504 utilizing certain default protocols and port configurations. Service 1540 may also be registered with UDDI registry 1546. In one embodiment, only a local administrator will have access to view and administer service 1540., 153497=MetaObject repositories 2324, 2330, 2338, and 2342 may be structured to provide any metadata about the respective node 2304, 2306, 2308, or 2310. Metadata for each node may include a data dictionary and one or more data sources. Factories 2316, 2320, 2326, 2332, and 2340 may utilize the data dictionary and data sources to perform data queries and process business rules. A data dictionary contains metadata that describes particular elements of data. It may include, for example, business attributes, which provide typing of other elements. Examples of data sources include Microsoft\ufffd SQL Server, Oracle\ufffd Server, etc. In other embodiments, MetaObject repositories 2324, 2330, 2338, and 2342 may also provide metadata about information and processes that are permitted to interact in a multi-network environment on the respective nodes 2304-2310 and publications and subscriptions that describe what information is available to users of a node., 150550=Client-side API (not shown) may permit a user to instantiate a single instance of a MetaObject interface for MetaObjects in multiple PDIs and personal data sources. This permits the user to enumerate results from multiple data sources, and/or combine them for consolidated presentation to the user. PDIRAPI 2208 may permit cache-controlled and free-threaded access to MetaObjects, which allows users to perform multi-tasked, asynchronous manipulation of data. A proof-of-concept business service (not shown) for the importing and exporting of bulk data may also be included in system 2200., 137457=AFW 1800 includes a plug-in manager 1810, which may be used by a host application 1812 in an enterprise desktop environment (EDE) to load and activate plug-in applications 1802-1804. One of the plug-in applications 1804 can use plug-in manager 1810 to contain its own internal plug-in application 1802. Plug-in application 1802 may be used to customize the external plug-in application 1804., 150136=Metadata in MetaObject repository 2206 may include objects such as stored procedures, business services, operating system (O/S), hardware, etc. This makes systems diagnostics possible. Metadata may also be stored in a user repository (not shown). The user repository may include objects such as part lists, which permit applications to utilize personalized document sources., 360982=With respect to the row identified by Ref ID C3, it is noted that the Input is missing the CPN value. The scrubbing process finds that the MPN [12065C562KATMA] is mapped to two CPN [AFC2410-0005-00 and AFC2410-0023-00]. Since this is a scrub for equivalency, it does not matter which one is used. For this example, since no CPN was defined, the first CPN is used, and a control interface, e.g., a drop down option, can be provided to give the user the option to select a different CPN., 172058=Further in the design process, the user may initiate the C-Scrubber 2706 from the schematic capture tool 2702 to pass parts used in the design. Additionally, the user may pass parts stored in the bookmark for C-Surfer 2708 to C-Scrubber 2706. Parts passed to C-Scrubber 2706 may be validated using SpinCircuit database 2704 and a validated Parts List may be derived. The validated parts list may be sent to a BOM manager (not shown) for additional functions such as used by a Contract Manufacturer (CM) to quote the cost of building the finished product., 143221=In one embodiment, plug-in manager 1810 performs all activation, deactivation, and selection object notification tasks. Host application 1812 need only initiate the process as a result of host events triggered by the application interface.}",
