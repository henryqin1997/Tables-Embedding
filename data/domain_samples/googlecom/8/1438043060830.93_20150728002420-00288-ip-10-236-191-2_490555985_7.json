For example, AT&T Bell Laboratories has developed a system which makes tiny adjustments to the spacing between words so that every copy of a document utilizing the system is \u201cunique.\u201d These electronic adjustments are detectable by computers only because they are too small for the human eye to notice. By way of another example, DIGIMARC, a company in Portland, Oreg., recently announced a system that encodes data into an image by carefully adjusting the digital representation of individual pixels. As in the AT&T system, the encoded data is not noticeable to the eye and enables some traceability of unauthorized copyright uses. See, S. Steinberg, editor of Wired Magazine, Los Angeles Times column, p2, part D, Aug. 31 (1995)., 40215=This application is a division of copending application Ser. No. 08/731,291, filed Oct. 11, 1996, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/543,161, filed Oct. 13, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,152. The present specification is copied from the '152 patent and does not include the subject matter added in the '291 divisional application., 42540=Even the U.S. Commerce Department recognizes that serious copyright problems exist with the burgeoning growth of electronic data transfers between networked computers and particularly through the Internet. Early in September 1995, for example, the Commerce Department issued a white paper entitled \u201cIntellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure.\u201d The paper highlights the need to protect copyrighted information that is resident in cyberspace, where unauthorized users can copy original works of authorship, including movies and books, by pressing a couple of keystrokes. See, V. Sussman, Copyright wrong? A fight brews over who gets to own the future (cyberspace), U.S. News & World Report, Sep. 18, 1995, v119 n11 p99(1).}",

Letters Patent is: The invention thus attains the objects set forth above, among those apparent from preceding description. Since certain changes may be made in the above apparatus and methods without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawing be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. In one embodiment of the invention, the server 202 includes an internal memory 202 b, connected to the communication section 202 a, that stores selected information about the DOCUMENTs registered thereon. For example, licensing terms to the DOCUMENT 204 can be stored within the memory 202 b. A relay section 202 c operates to relay such terms to the processor 220 in response to a license request signal prompted by the user 216. A data comparison section 220 d operates to compare the user's reply to the licensing terms, and to generate and transmit the requested auxiliary permissions when the response signals correspond to the requisite terms specified in the license information stored in memory 202 b (or alternatively in the DOCUMENT).
