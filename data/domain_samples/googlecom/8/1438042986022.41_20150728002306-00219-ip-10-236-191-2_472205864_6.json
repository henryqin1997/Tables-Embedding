    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described above, in accordance with this invention, an adequate positive color video signal can be obtained by sensing the positive image of an ordinary object. In addition to that, a positive color video signal is obtainable from a negative image on a negative film with a good linear characteristic and a rich tone gradation, without ruining signals and without degrading the S/N ratio. In the latter case, control signals are output from the negative/positive control part to change the amplifying degrees of the color signal amplifiers; to invert the phases of the subcarriers which are output from the subcarrier generator with a 90 degree phase difference between them; to invert the phase of the luminance signal supplied to the luminance signal amplifier; and to change the amplifying degrees of the chrominance signal and luminance signal amplifiers. More specifically, the operation in this mode is performed as follows: A control signal is output from the negative positive control part to lower the amplifying degrees of the color signal amplifiers. The phases of the subcarriers which are output from the subcarrier generator at the phase difference of 90 degrees are inverted before they are supplied to the encoder part. The phase of the luminance signal is inverted before it is supplied to the luminance signal amplifier. After that, the amplifying degree of the chrominance signal amplifier and that of the luminance signal amplifier are increased. It is",
