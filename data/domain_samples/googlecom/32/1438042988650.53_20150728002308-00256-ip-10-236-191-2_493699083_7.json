The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. Alternative Embodiments Although it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the purpose of the present invention can be accomplished in some manner by using software alone and a hash table, the separate memory hardware or CAM 408 provides significant advantages including saving instructions that would be necessary for hashing the counter at node addresses, avoiding displacing data out of the cache since the CAM 408 is a memory which is separate from the regular cache/memory system, avoiding the possibility of introducing an additional cache miss during the load of the prefetch address 416, and saving the possible latency for loading the prefetch address 416 where a single instruction is used to both load the prefetch address 416 and accomplish the prefetch 418. Another explanation of the process of FIG. 4B is illustrated by the recurrent data structure 500 and CAM or hash table 502 diagramed in FIG. 5. The objective is to prefetch some number of data nodes ahead of the data node currently being visited. In the example of",
