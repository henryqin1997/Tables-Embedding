    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The results presented above show that the agglomeration specified according to this invention results in the fact that much lower pressing forces can be used than in the related art to produce tablets with a sufficient breaking force. The mixture with the agglomerates produced in this way leads to improved flowability and a smaller fines fraction, which in turn leads to improved processability and reduced machine wear as well as an increased tabletting output. compares compressed products produced on the basis of isomaltulose (same as palatinose). This shows the pressing force, the breaking force and the sensory properties of isomaltulose compressed products produced from a fraction having a particle size of 100=m and collidone 30. The use of a fraction having particles with a diameter of \u2266100 \u03bcm n preferably \u226650 \u03bcm, especially \u226630 \u03bcm, is especially important in the case of isomaltulose, because isomaltulose fractions with particle sizes>100 \u03bcm show a marked tendency toward a perceptibly rough surface in compression. FIG. 3 shows a breaking force comparison between isomalt ST and isomalt GS, both in agglomerated form. It can be seen here that there is no significant difference between these two forms of isomalt. In a sensory evaluation, the dissolving properties of the GS variant in the mouth were evaluated as slightly better. FIG. 2 shows a breaking force comparison between compressed products",
