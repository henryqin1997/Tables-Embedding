    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed a typical preferred embodiment of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, the terms are used in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. The invention has been described in considerable detail with specific reference to these illustrated embodiments. It will be apparent, however, that various modifications and changes can be made within the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the foregoing specification and as defined in the appended claims. The safety shutter and intensity/blanking outputs are both monitored and checked for consistency with internal logic nodes using a simple but reliable exclusive OR gate, as known to the skilled. If the proper signal relationships are not maintained, one or more exclusive OR signals will be brought low, disengaging the relay and grounding the safety shutter and intensity/blanking output signals. Logic Sanity Monitor The velocity monitor incorporates a comparator circuit that is used in such a way that the safe condition is high rather than low as described above. However, another circuit monitors this signal and compares it against other signals as a \u201csanity check\u201d. If the signals inside the velocity monitor do not correlate to the X and Y position signals in a realistic fashion, a fault condition is generated. The velocity monitor incorporates a low pass filter. This low pass filter will",
