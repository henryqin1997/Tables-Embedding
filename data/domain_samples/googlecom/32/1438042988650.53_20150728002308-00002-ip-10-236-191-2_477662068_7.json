As indicated, the antimicrobial metal atoms 608 are implanted to a preferred depth 610. It is the concentration (defined in atoms/cm3) of the implanted atoms 608 below the surface 612 that creates a subsurface fungicidal/bactericidal stratum. According to one embodiment of the invention, the antimicrobial metal atoms are implanted to have a density in the range of about 5\ufffd1013 atoms/cm2 to about 5\ufffd1017 atoms/cm2. However, the sufficiency of the concentration of the implanted atoms 608 to impart the desired antimicrobial properties to the cuff 602 depends, in part, on the material from which the cuff 602 is formed, e.g., metal, polymer, ceramic, etc. and in part on the specific antimicrobial metal atoms being implanted., 66995=Of course, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, any of the catheters 806, 900, and 1100 can include a subcutaneous cuff treated with an antimicrobial agent according to the process of the invention. The cuff can be formed and implanted prior to being fitted to the appropriate catheter. Alternatively, the cuff can be fitted to the catheter prior to implanting., 60688=In the case where the cuff 602 is formed from a polyester such as Dacron\ufffd polyester, and where the antimicrobial metal is silver, a preferred concentration of the antimicrobial metal atoms 608 within the subsurface fungicidal/bactericidal stratum is at least about 1\ufffd1015 atoms per square centimeter. The preferred penetration depth 610 of the subsurface fungicidal/bactericidal stratum within the individual polyester fibers is at least about 0.01 microns to about five microns. The penetration of antimicrobial atoms within the bulk porous material can extend as deep as 5000 microns or more, depending upon the porosity of the cuff material. The ion implantation process of the invention is effected over a time period from about one minute to about twenty hours, depending on a selected combination of total surface area to be treated, the desired ion dose and the ion beam current density being employed., 28627=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/006,749, filed Jan. 21, 1993, entitled \"Metallized Polymeric Implants, Method And Apparatus,\" now abandoned which is itself a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/663,361, filed Mar. 1, 1991, entitled \"Metallized Polymeric Implants, Method And Apparatus,\" now abandoned. This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/780,275, filed Oct. 18, 1991, entitled \"Bactericidal Coatings For Implants,\" now abandoned and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/894,822, filed Jun. 8, 1992, entitled \"Infection Resistant Medical Devices And Process\" now abandoned. The above cited patent applications, assigned to a common assignee, Spire Corporation, Bedford, Mass., are incorporated herein by reference., 66574=The dry-coating of the entire length of a rather long polymeric catheter 1100 is illustrated in FIG. 11. A square frame 1102 is shown being mounted to the end of the shaft 340. Depending on the relative sizes of the catheter 1100 versus the frame 1102, one or more catheters 1100 are loosely wound about the frame 1102. Longer catheters or a number of catheters can be processed on larger frames 1102., 30650=It has been estimated that catheter-related sepsis or CRS occurs at a rate of 6 to 8 per 1000 catheter days, with a mortality rate of 10 to 20%. The classically accepted cause of CRS is bacterial migration and colonization along the catheter from the skin entry site. Not surprisingly, most bacteria found to cause CRS, such as the Staphylococcus species, commonly populate the skin., 57166=The surface of the catheters 510 is then exposed to the beam 512 of antimicrobial metal ions so as to create the subsurface graded fungicidal/bactericidal stratum therein. Preferably, the ion beam 512 possesses an energy from about 5 keV to about 200 keV, delivering a dose from about 5\ufffd1013 to about 5\ufffd1017 ions per square centimeter. The above mentioned ion beam energy and ion dose are intended to achieve a current density on the respective surface of the catheter 510 from about 0.01 microampere per square centimeter to about 20 microamperes per square centimeter., 65896=As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the actual construction of the catheter holder 338 of FIG. 3 can vary depending on the device being implanted. By way of example, FIG. 10 depicts the catheter holder 338 formed as a cage. The cage 338 is lengthwise adjustable and is lengthwise provided with a plurality of mandrills 1002 to accommodate and securely hold a plurality of catheter tips 806 and catheters 900, respectively thereon. The catheter holder 338 preferably is rotated during the coating operation and is designed to be moved in translation between the antechamber 302 and the high-vacuum processing chamber 304 prior to the coating operation., 69528=Dose: 5\ufffd1016 ions/cm2}",

It is also intended that the following claims cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention as described herein, and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween. It is in this way the invention attains the objectives set forth above. In particular, a preferred embodiment of the invention provides a catheter including a subcutaneous cuff which is treated with a substantially nonleaching antimicrobial agent. A preliminary clinical study of surface treated large-bore catheters was conducted by Dr. R. Bambauer at the University of Saarland in Hamburg, Germany. To date, seven patients have been exposed to silver-treated temporary hemodialysis catheters with a subclavian vein access for a period of up to 45 days. After removal the components were evaluated. The complication rates, including infection and thrombosis, are normally very high in this type of catheter used for hemodialysis. Test results indicate lack of any thrombus formation or bacterial attachment to the treated surfaces of catheters for the maximum amount of time implanted, 45 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the catheter surfaces clearly show the silver-treated surfaces of the catheters to be free of any platelet deposits. Cellular changes were graded in four areas on a scale of",
