Accordingly, it can be seen that a panel electrification system providing ease of installation and versatility in rearrangement is disclosed. The electrification system includes a large number of conductors which can be provided in utility raceways originally designed for fewer electrical conductors. Additionally, the system provides versatility in connecting outlets to different power supply circuits in the power block without compromising the ability of the system to be retrofit into existing utility raceways Additionally, the system utilizes cables having woven sheathing providing a great degree of flexibility in manipulating the cable around corners. The woven sheathing is attached to a connector using fasteners which provide a quick, secure connection thereby facilitating efficient assembly of the powerway. The panel system includes a power-in 538 including power tap-in 28 (FIG. 35) connected to powerway 520. The power tap-in is the input connection for the entire panel system of FIG. 34. As illustrated in FIG. 36, a T-connection 539 is provided for powerways 520-522 by connecting the T-connector 540 of powerway 520 with an upper port of powerway 521 and the T-connector 541 of powerway 521 to an upper",
