For instance, although the optical assembly of each preferred embodiment comprises distinct and non-overlapping inbound and outbound optical subassemblies, the optical assembly of the instrument could be arranged so that some of the optical devices or elements of the instrument act on both inbound beams and outbound beams. In addition, while the optics of the first and second embodiments constitute two-beam configurations designed to form and recombine two impinging and reflected beams, the invention also applies to three-beam configurations and even multi-beam configurations. The scope of other changes will become apparent from the appended claims. The full-field GDI instrument 110 of the second embodiment exhibits all of the advantages of the full-field GDI instrument 10 of the first embodiment and can be considered fully interchangeable with the instrument 10 of the first embodiment depending upon the preferred light source. In use, a beam of light IB is generated by the spatially-extended low-coherence light source 122 and is collimated by the lens 128 of the beam expander 124 before impinging upon the beam splitter 130 of the inbound optical subassembly 116. The beam splitter 130 splits the inbound collimated beam IB into first and second impinging beams A and B. The first impinging beam A is deflected by the reflective device 142 and then",
