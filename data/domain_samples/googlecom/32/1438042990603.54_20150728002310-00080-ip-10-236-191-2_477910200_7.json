No. 07/899,721 filed on Jun. 17, 1992., 22471=The voltage-controlled oscillator VCO of this embodiment example is accomplished by using an adder as the programmable element and is illustrated in FIG. 2. The phase detector \u03c6 (in FIG. 3) controls the oscillator VCO dynamically by means of the input signals FA, FB. Without the feedback signal f(C), i.e. the loop being locked to the medium frequency f(C), the VCO divides the controlling clock frequency f(PLL) by four. The circuit according to the invention makes all the ratios divisible by four. The ratios, i.e. the ratios between the clock frequency f(IC) of the smart card and the data rate f(D) transmitted by the interface can here be controlled to the values f(IC)/f(D)=372, 512, 744, 768, 1024, 1116 or 1488. Thus, the data rate f(D) does not have to be generated separately, but instead a reference frequency f(PLL) is generated for the phase-locked loop, this frequency being an adequate multiple of the data rate f(D). The phase-locked loop multiplies this number with the value of the reference frequency 4\ufffdn2, yielding 16\ufffdf(D) as output frequency f(UART).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The circuit solutions of FIGS. 2 and 3 are given merely as an example of an implementation of the circuit according to the invention. A person skilled in the art understands that these circuits can be carried out in many other ways, depending on the circuit elements available. Accordingly, the circuits can be partly or entirely accomplished with programs, for instance in an integrated processor. FIG. 3b shows a pulse diagram obtained with a circuit simulation, presenting the operating logic of the phase detector as a time diagram. When the frequency of the input signal f(PLL) is too high, pulses of the output branch FA are generated, as indicated on the left-hand side of FIG. 3b. Accordingly, when the frequency of the input signal f(PLL) is too low, pulses are generated in the output branch FB as indicated on the right-hand side of FIG. 3b. FIG. 3a shows a circuit diagram of the phase detector. The input signals are the PLL input signals and the PLL feedback signal of the phase-locked loop PLL, as mentioned above in the explanation of FIG. 1. Output signals of the phase detector are FA, FB. FIG. 2a shows a diagram of the VCO circuit in greater detail. As mentioned above, VCO has been carried out as an adder, the essential elements of which are two flip-flops FF. The other elements are NAND gates (NA), NOR gates (NO), AND gates (A)",
