If the compression ratio is 1:5, the pressure will be 0.2 kg/cm2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, the 1 arrangement is clean and hygienic, as it ensures that when the specimen collection element is removed from the airtight state in which it is maintained by the lower and upper cups, sample fluid does not get onto the fingers or get splashed around. In addition, the pressurization means that is frequently touched by operators' hands during the specimen collection procedure does not come into contact with the sample fluid, and can therefore be readily maintained in its clean state through repeated use cycles without needing to be specially sterilized, making it possible to conduct specimen collection efficiently and hygienically. A further advantage is that as the specimen plate is about the same shape and size as a normal microscope slide, it can be used with standard staining systems. In accordance also with the specimen collection apparatus according to the invention, the specimen collection element is held in an airtight condition by an upper cup and a lower cup, and a pressurization means is used to increase the air pressure in the upper cup, forcing the liquid portion of the sample in the upper cup to pass through the film filter and spacer and into the lower cup, in the course of which the specimens concerned are retained on the film. Again, therefore, the cushioning effect of the compressed air provides good pressure stability, preventing any deformation and destruction of specimens that might otherwise",
