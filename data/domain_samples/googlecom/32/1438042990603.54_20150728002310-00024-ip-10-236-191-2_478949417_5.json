    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6202=Referring to FIG. 35, if a user selects an applications link 3518, such as under the drilldown navigation bar 2914 depicted in connection with FIG. 29 and other subsequent figures, then the user can be presented with drilldown information about the usage of particular applications. For example, a user interface 3500 can list data regarding the top ten applications used within a specified period, including identity of each application 3502, the number of days in a selected period during which each application was used 3504, aggregate time during which each application was used 3508, total number of users executing each application during the period 3512, and total number of computers on which each application was executed or accessed 3514. As with other reports described herein, this report offers a manager or administrator of an enterprise a very convenient and effective view of the enterprise's computer application usage, to facilitate rapid, accurate decision-making. For example, an administrator can instantly determine whether the enterprise is approaching a concurrent-user limit for an application, so that additional licenses can be purchased before the company is in breach of a contract. A manager can decide what applications should be upgraded to newer, more efficient versions, based on what applications are most heavily used. An information technology manager can determine what package of applications should be deployed as a standard package for the entire enterprise, what applications should be deployed as packages for specific departments, and what applications should be deployed only on an ad hoc basis. Again, the collection and binning of usage information (including not only whether an application is running, but also whether a user is actually interacting with it), and the organization and reporting of that usage information according to user, computer and application, allows a manager to make effective decisions that depend on such information, without requiring administrators to pore over and aggregate event logs that capture all network events.}",

In embodiments such information is selected from the group consisting of unauthorized access, packet sniffing, disablement of functionality, identification of user seeking access, identification of device from which access is sought, identification of usage data or output accessed, time of access, manner of access, manner in which usage data or output is utilized, frequency of access, duration of access, indication of tampering with usage data or output, indication of modification of usage data or output, indication of interference with usage data or output, indication of deletion of usage data or output, or attempts with respect to any of the foregoing.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Although the present invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will, of course, be understood that various changes and modifications may be made in the form, details, and arrangement of the parts without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the following claims. The foregoing are intended to be encompassed herein, as limited only by the claims. In embodiments of the invention a non-technical security officer may be concerned that the IT staff has been bypassing a computer policy. The non-technical officer can log into the server 214 and review a user interface, such as an administration action log. The officer can then review all users' access and modifications that they may have made to the server 214. Likewise the officer can check to make sure administrators are not using the system to gain access to employees' personal use of the computer network. In embodiments of the invention a banking institution can allow employees to access personal or financial information from work computers. The user can type in a password for stock trading, banking, or a website, such as Amazon.com. In some cases an employee may be suspected of improper or illegal action, such as embezzlement, so that investigators want to review the employee's computer usage. In such a",
