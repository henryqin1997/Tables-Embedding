Strongsville, Ohio, U.S.A. The instrument heated the stack to 218\ufffd C. and imposed a static compressive force of 8 kg on the stack. The length of the stack under the initial compressive force was then measured, as was the initial hardness (expressed in terms of \"storage modulus\"). The MER then imposed cyclic stress on the sample stack by sinusoidally varying the initial compressive force by 4 kg rms at a frequency of 30 Hz for 60 hours, while maintaining the 218\ufffd C. temperature. After 60 hours, the final hardness and length under the static 8 kg compressive force were measured, as was the final weight of the sample stack. The storage modulus determination was done in accordance with the method of calculation described in Fitzgerald, et al., \"The Effect of Cyclic Stress on the Physical Properties of a Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Elastomer\" , Polymer Engineering and Science, vol. 32, No. 18 (September 1992), pp. 1350-1357. Results of these tests are presented in Table I below, wherein \"TC\" means thermal conductivity, \"SM\" means storage modulus, \"%\u0394SM\" means the percent change in the storage modulus after 60 hours of cyclic stress and elevated temperature, \"L\" means length of the six-disk stack, \"%\u0394L\" means the percent change in L after 60 hours of cyclic stress and elevated temperature, and \"%WL\" means the percent loss in weight after 60 hours of cyclic stress and elevated temperature., 49054=The hardness of the fuser roll was measured before, during, and after testing on the simulated fusing system using a Digital Exacta hardness tester (Model EX200/300T from New Age Industries, Willow Grove, Pa.) having an IRHD Micro head in accordance with ASTM Standard D1415. This device gives hardness readings in the units of International Rubber Hardness Degrees (IRHD) which are analogous to Shore A units in the range of 30-90 Shore A. Crowning was determined using a Federal Systems 2000 Surfanalyzer with a Model 1200 drive unit and a transverse chisel stylus Model EPT-01040. Thermal conductivity was determined using a Holometrix TCA at 175\ufffd C. Results are reported in Table III., 22302=This is a Continuation-In-Part of application Ser. No. 984,059, filed Nov. 30, 1992 now abandoned., 43269=It is currently preferred, in some embodiments of the invention, to apply the base cushion over a support which has been conversion coated and primed with metal alkoxide primer in accordance with a U.S. Patent Application filed by Allen Kass, Oct. 21, 1993, entitled \"FUSING MEMBER FOR ELECTROSTATOGRAPHIC REPRODUCING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PREPARING FUSING MEMBER\"; the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 29307=An additional difficulty that has faced those attempting to produce metal-filled elastomer fuser members has recently been identified. In the past, it was thought that various materials' suitability for use in fuser roll base cushion layers in terms of their stability during use--i.e., their ability to resist degradation (as evidenced by weight loss), creep, and changes in hardness, during use in fuser rolls-could be determined by subjecting samples of the materials to conditions of continuous high temperature and continuous high stress (i.e., pressure), and then measuring the resultant changes in weight, shape (e.g., length), and hardness (e.g., storage modulus). However, J. J. Fitzgerald et al, \"The Effect of Cyclic Stress on the Physical Properties of a Poly(Dimethylsiloxane) Elastomer\", Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. 32, No. 18, (Sept. 1992), pp. 1350-1357, indicates that such testing does not accurately portray the stability the materials will exhibit during actual use in fuser roll base cushion layers and that dynamic testing, with cycles of loading and unloading is necessary. The publication cites other reports showing the same kind of results in studies of other elastomers. Accordingly, the present inventors have helped to develop a device called a Mechanical Energy Resolver (sometimes alternatively referred to herein as an \"MER\"), which can be used to test samples of materials of interest for use in fuser roll base cushion layers. The device applies heat continuously to maintain the samples at a constant elevated temperature. The device also applies stress to the samples in the form of a compressive force, but does so in a manner such that the amount of compressive force applied varies cyclically (i.e., sinusoidally). The results of such testing consistently correlate with, and therefore reliably predict, the degree of stability a material will exhibit in the base cushion layer of a fuser roll during actual use.}",
