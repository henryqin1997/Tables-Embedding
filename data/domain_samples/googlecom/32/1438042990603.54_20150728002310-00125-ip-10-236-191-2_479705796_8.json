    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in the context of a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than that specifically set out and described above. For example, the memory of the illustrated embodiments has a by-one data organization. However, it is possible to include several by-one blocks to increase the width of the memory. Also, the illustrated embodiments included CMOS circuitry; however a design using bipolar or BICMOS technology or other types of transistor technology is also possible. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. It should be apparent by now that a memory with improved performance has been described. The memory includes memory cells located at intersections of word lines and differential bit line pairs. A row decoder activates a word line in response to a row address. A sense amplifier coupled to each bit line pair then increases the small differential voltage of the bit line pair to positive and negative power supply voltages. The sense amplifier is then isolated from the bit lines so that the bit lines are equalized. The contents of memory cells are stored in corresponding sense amplifiers, and the memory functions as a by-one memory during the remainder",
