The load cell is calibrated according to the expected burst strength., 95667=Suitable photosensitive resins can be readily selected from the many available commercially. They are typically materials, usually polymers, which cure or cross-link under the influence of activating radiation, usually ultraviolet (UV) light. References containing more information about liquid photosensitive resins include Green et al, \u201cPhotocross-linkable Resin Systems,\u201d J. Macro. Sci-Revs. Macro.

The balance should be positioned on a balance table and slab to minimize the vibration effects of floor/benchtop weighing. The balance should also have a special balance pan to be able to handle the size of the sample tested (i.e.; a fibrous structure sample of about 11 in. (27.9 cm) by 11 in. (27.9 cm)). The balance pan can be made out of a variety of materials. Plexiglass is a common material used., 143813=1) An electronic balance with a sensitivity of at least \ufffd0.01 grams and a minimum capacity of 1200 grams.

The balance should also have a special balance pan to be able to handle the size of the sample tested (i.e.; a fibrous structure sample of about 11 in. (27.9 cm) by 11 in. (27.9 cm)). The balance pan can be made out of a variety of materials. Plexiglass is a common material used., 147339=A light microscopy image of a sample to be analyzed such as a fibrous structure or a molding member is obtained with a representative scale associated with the image. The images is saved as a *.tiff file on a computer. Once the image is saved, SmartSketch, version 05.00.35.14 software made by Intergraph Corporation of Huntsville, Ala., is opened. Once the software is opened and running on the computer, the user clicks on \u201cNew\u201d from the \u201cFile\u201d drop-down panel. Next, \u201cNormal\u201d is selected. \u201cProperties\u201d is then selected from the \u201cFile\u201d drop-down panel. Under the \u201cUnits\u201d tab, \u201cmm\u201d (millimeters) is chosen as the unit of measure and \u201c0.123\u201d as the precision of the measurement. Next, \u201cDimension\u201d is selected from the \u201cFormat\u201d drop-down panel. Click the \u201cUnits\u201d tab and ensure that the \u201cUnits\u201d and \u201cUnit Labels\u201d read \u201cmm\u201d and that the \u201cRound-Off\u201d is set at \u201c0.123.\u201d Next, the \u201crectangle\u201d shape from the selection panel is selected and dragged into the sheet area. Highlight the top horizontal line of the rectangle and set the length to the corresponding scale indicated light microscopy image. This will set the width of the rectangle to the scale required for sizing the light microscopy image. Now that the rectangle has been sized for the light microscopy image, highlight the top horizontal line and delete the line. Highlight the left and right vertical lines and the bottom horizontal line and select \u201cGroup\u201d. This keeps each of the line segments grouped at the width dimension (\u201cmm\u201d) selected earlier. With the group highlighted, drop the \u201cline width\u201d panel down and type in \u201c0.01 mm.\u201d The scaled line segment group is now ready to use for scaling the light microscopy image can be confirmed by right-clicking on the \u201cdimension between\u201d, then clicking on the two vertical line segments., 44303=The sanitary tissue products of the present invention may exhibit an initial total wet tensile strength of greater than about 118 g/cm (300 g/in) and/or greater than about 157 g/cm (400 g/in) and/or greater than about 196 g/cm (500 g/in) and/or greater than about 236 g/cm (600 g/in) and/or greater than about 276 g/cm (700 g/in) and/or greater than about 315 g/cm (800 g/in) and/or greater than about 354 g/cm (900 g/in) and/or greater than about 394 g/cm (1000 g/in) and/or from about 118 g/cm (300 g/in) to about 1968 g/cm (5000 g/in) and/or from about 157 g/cm (400 g/in) to about 1181 g/cm (3000 g/in) and/or from about 196 g/cm (500 g/in) to about 984 g/cm (2500 g/in) and/or from about 196 g/cm (500 g/in) to about 787 g/cm (2000 g/in) and/or from about 196 g/cm (500 g/in) to about 591 g/cm (1500 g/in).}",
