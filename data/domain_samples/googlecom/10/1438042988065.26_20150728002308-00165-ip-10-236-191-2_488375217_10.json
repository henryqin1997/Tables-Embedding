    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. For example, any of the network components may employ any of the desired functionality set forth hereinabove. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. Finally, the adaptive filter 406 and optionally the probe 414 may be stored for use at a later time. See operation 628. Following the completion of a frame analysis session it might be desirable for the user to re-apply the same set of adaptive filters 406 synthesized during the current session to other sessions on the same or different network segment. In other words, the analysis session may have resulted in the detection of problems at several network layers and yields the adaptive filter set specific to the problem set. It is likely that this is a chronic problem in the network and exhibits the same symptoms at several points of the network. Rather than start the analysis from scratch, the user can simply retrieve the desired filters set from non-volatile memory and apply it to the frame manager 402. The probe set 414 that had created the filter 406 could be archived along with the adaptive filter 406 to later",
