Therefore, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention which is defined by the appended claims. [0034] After the procedure has been completed, the shaft 12 is withdrawn, allowing the tissue tract to collapse over the newly formed plug which is directly over the blood vessel wall W. [0033] After the shaft 12 has been properly positioned, the wire 30 may be withdrawn, as shown in FIG. 4E, and energy applied through the electrode or other energy applying surface 50. Typically, this is done by connecting the device to a power supply PS, for example, a radio frequency power supply, which delivers energy to the element 50. In the case of radio frequency, preferred frequencies are in the range from 350 kHz to 2 MHz that powers in the range from 5 watts to 100 watts, usually from 5 watts to 50 watts. As illustrated, the radiofrequency power supply PS operates with a \u201cmonopolar\u201d protocol where one pole is attached to the electrode 50 and the other pole to a dispersive pad P placed externally on the patient's skin, preferably on an opposite side of the leg being treated.
