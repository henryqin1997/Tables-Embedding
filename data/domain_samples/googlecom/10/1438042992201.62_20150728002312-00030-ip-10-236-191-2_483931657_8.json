    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{66993=As shown in FIG. 2, a user optionally can add transmitter 211 to the mobile station, providing the user with a two-way communications terminal. Low rate packet data messages may be generated automatically, such as by position reporting, or may be input from an input device, which may be embodied as an external keyboard or message generator. Such low rate packet data can be communicated back through MSAT 105. An optional voice input processor 217 may be included and may be embodied as a semiconductor chip. The voice input processor 217 digitizes and compresses voice signals to a selected bit rate, preferably in the 1200-9600 bps range, depending on the voice quality desired for transmission., 41908=Each mobile station thus receives signals relayed through a satellite at frequencies quite close to the correct frequencies. However, there are some additional Doppler effects caused by the motion of the mobile station. Such additional Doppler effects are typically less than \ufffd100 Hz at frequencies around 1600 MHz, so the received frequency is typically within 100 Hz of the correct frequency, and a carrier tracking loop in the mobile station should be able to easily lock onto the received signal., 39275=The present invention, by its improvements over the prior art, resolves the principal problems with consumer broadcasts over the new communications satellites. Frequency control in mobile satellite communications systems is well known in the art, such as discussed in the analysis of COMSAT Laboratories for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Volumes I and II of \"Final Report: Design of an MSAT-X Transceiver and Related Ground Segment Technology, February 1986\"., 42428=In the return direction, i.e. mobile station to fixed station, relatively unstable local oscillators must be used, typically with 10-6 long term stability, leading to frequency errors of \ufffd2 kHz. Fortunately, each mobile station can phase lock to one or more received channels and can use the phase locked frequency as a frequency reference for the transmit frequency. For example, at frequencies around 1600 MHz, the maximum error in transmit frequency using such relatively unstable oscillators is under \ufffd400 Hz, which includes mobile-generated Doppler effects in both directions, as well as return link satellite-generated Doppler effects., 32057=This patent is a continuation-in-part of patent application entitled, INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS TERMINAL, having Ser. No. 07/963,233 and filing date Oct. 19, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,823. The benefit of the earlier filing date of the parent patent application is claimed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 120., 108737=The GPS L1 frequency at 1575.42 MHz is between the satellite-to-mobile band, 1529-1559 MHz, and mobile-to-satellite band, 1630.5-1660.5 MHz, of mobile satellite systems presently authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. This proximity to the receive frequencies for the present invention make it possible for a GPS receiver to share the antenna and front end with a radio satellite system mobile station, though some additional RF circuitry is required as well as a GPS microchip. Typical GPS microchips include all base band circuitry necessary for receiving and processing GPS transmissions., 110709=The radio satellite network center 117 also provides frequency control for the network, as described in \"Design of an MSAT-X Transceiver and Related Ground Segment Technology Study Final Report, Volume II: MSAT-X Ground Segment Design\", MSAT-X Report No. 131, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., 1986., 40179=There are only a few fixed transmit units. Expensive, highly stable oscillators can be used to minimize frequency errors in the forward direction, i.e. from fixed unit to mobile station. For example, oscillators having 10-9 long-term stability may be used to provide an absolute frequency error of about \ufffd2 Hz at a frequency around 1600 MHz, which results in a minimal frequency uncertainty at the fixed unit.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made to the integrated communications terminal of the instant invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention, and it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of the integrated communications terminal provided they come in the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. A significant aspect of the integrated communications terminal of the present invention is the simplicity of the basic system design, which allows common use of the same receiver antenna and RF electronics for a variety of services and which allows the principal components of the receiver to be embodied on a small number of integrated circuits. The basic electronic components of this invention are capable of being implemented on a small number of integrated circuit chips. The components are therefore small enough to be incorporated into current car radios, hand-held radios, and portable radios presently sold in the mass market, such as the portable WALKMAN\u2122 radio/cassette player sold by SONY Corporation, and do not need to be included in bulky add-on equipment. Further, the present invention also allows ready integration of a variety of communications services useful to the travelling public, and, through integration with U.S. government Global Positioning System (GPS) microprocessors, navigation services and delivery of location-dependent instructions. This integration allows the radio satellite system operator obtain additional revenue to",
