A natural gum rubber seal, between 11/2 in. to 2 in. thick and of about 41 in. external diameter may be used to provide the desired sealing, and the seal may be conveniently adhered to support plate 222 with a known adhesive. A life expectancy of over two years in normal use can be expected for such a seal arrangement. In such a system, a suitable diameter for the container opening may be about 14 in.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In this disclosure, there are shown and described only the preferred embodiments of the invention, but, as aforementioned, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. An exemplary application is one in which three units are employed cooperatively to produce quantities of drilling mud of varying compositions at different times, depending upon the type of strata through which a drill is being operatively driven. Materials such as bentonite, caustic soda, lignite, barium sulfate, or any known drilling fluid additives may be mixed in selected proportions with water to generate such a mud. The various granular materials may be extracted from respective containers, augered through the common conduit 106, and provided to a selected delivery location 108, as generally indicated in FIG. 1, where a supply of water may be added thereto and the mud mixed in a conventional mixer, after which the mud may be pumped to a well-head where the drill is being operated. With obvious and minor modifications, such a supply of mud may be recirculated and the composition thereof altered by appropriate controls over the supply of granular materials and/or water. As will be appreciated, one or more of the containers 102 may contain a liquid carrier material or even a slurry into which granular additives",
