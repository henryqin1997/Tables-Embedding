However, in order to select a desired content, it is necessary to specify and click a thumbnail of a desired content with a cursor from the thumbnail screen that is scrolling as above, or from a flow of a number of thumbnails. It is difficult to select the desired thumbnail from among the moving numerous thumbnails., 40299=However, in the data display method described in the above JP-A-10-187743 as well, since all categories are simultaneously displayed, as is the case with the apparatus with thumbnail display described in JP-A-2004-221672, each thumbnail is displayed in a small size, thus making it difficult to view the displayed content. Therefore, it becomes more difficult to find out the thumbnail of the desired content. Here, although it may be possible to identify the displayed content of the thumbnail without difficulty by bringing a viewpoint closer to the thumbnail, an operation for that purpose (i.e. an input operation for instructing a change in the viewpoint) is needed. Unless the viewpoint is changed, the display state of the thumbnail screen is held unchanged., 35187=In an exemplary apparatus with thumbnail display, the display screen is divided into sections for a TV program, a library, and the Internet starting from the top. In the TV program section, thumbnails for TV channels are arranged and displayed. In the library section, thumbnails for files for each content stored in folders registered in the library of a hard disc (e.g. video-recorded program file, moving image video file, still image file, voice file, Internet data file or the like) are arranged and displayed. In the Internet section, thumbnails for Internet data introduction information are arranged and displayed. (Reference may be made to JP-A-2004-221672 for example.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. In addition, when the \u201con-the-air program\u201d category is the highest rank layer category, a still video image of the program screen at that point of time can be displayed as a TV program thumbnail for every predetermined interval (e.g. seconds or the like). Therefore, for example, every time the thumbnail is displayed, the content of the still video image on the thumbnail changes. Furthermore, when the focus 20 lies on the thumbnail of the TV program, the content of the broadcast received at the point of time may be displayed in moving images. In this embodiment, the category that can be used includes: \u201con-the-air program\u201d, \u201cunwatched program\u201d, \u201crecorded program\u201d, \u201cpicture and still image\u201d, \u201cvoice\u201d, \u201clink collection\u201d, \u201cunread e-mail\u201d or the like, and other categories can also be added to them, and the existing categories can be divided into a plurality of categories as required. , thus making it possible to access the desired content rapidly.
