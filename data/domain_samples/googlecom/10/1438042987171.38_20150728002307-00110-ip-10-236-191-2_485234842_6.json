Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. According to the present invention, the operating state of each tower top amplifier can be monitored while a single power supply line is connected between the base station and each tower top amplifier. Thus, there is no need to employ a device for monitoring the operating state of each tower top amplifier, and a multiplexer and a demultiplexer for collecting the operating states of the tower top amplifiers and transmitting them to the base station and receiving the same so that the overall system is more simple in structure than the prior art and the operating state of each tower top amplifier is more reliably monitored. Therefore, a range of a certain applied voltage can be found, thus easily monitoring the operating state of each tower top amplifier 1 a to 1 n.
