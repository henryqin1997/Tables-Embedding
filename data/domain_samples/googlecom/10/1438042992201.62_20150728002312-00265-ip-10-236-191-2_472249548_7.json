For example, the asset, object, people or animal monitor can provide a warning to the operator if the asset, object, people or animal monitor has received an interrupt from one or more of the individual cargo sensors 1136. If desired, this warning can also include a message that identifies the remedial action to be undertaken by the operator and can be on a individual cargo by cargo basis since each distinct piece of cargo 1134 is monitored individually. Since the present invention enables the monitoring of each individual cargo, a plurality of distinct cargo can each have separate remedial requirements., 156568=In order to ensure that effects caused by jitter of the transmitter or small clock inaccuracies, the impulse radio receiver will typically activate for a predetermined interval surrounding the impulse radio transmitter time. For example, if the transmitter is set to transmit at 1705, the receiver can activate to receive transmitted signals at the interval 1704.999 to 1705.001. In step 1812, the impulse radio transmitter transmits information relating to the object being tracked (e.g., plutonium) and in step 1814 the impulse radio receiver activates during the given time interval, which takes into account any jitter and clock inaccuracies, to receive the transmitted information. The information is related according to the methodologies articulated above., 119025=According to one advantageous embodiment, the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 includes a position determining means, typically including a transceiver which is operably connected to the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114. The position determining means determines the position of the structure 1116, based upon externally supplied location data. According to one advantageous embodiment, the position determining means includes a GPS receiver, such as GPS receiver model number 24080-61 manufactured by Trimble Navigation Limited for receiving signals from a plurality of GPS satellites. Alternatively, the position determining means can include a receiver that is adapted to communicate with one or more LORAN land-based transmitters. Still further, the position determining means can be responsive to location data entered or provided by the operator. Based upon the externally supplied location data, the position determining means can determine the current position of the trailer and can report the current position to the asset, object, people or animal monitor., 83754=Impulse radio is resistant to interference because of its large processing gain. For typical spread spectrum systems, the definition of processing gain, which quantifies the decrease in channel interference when wide-band communications are used, is the ratio of the bandwidth of the channel to the bit rate of the information signal. For example, a direct sequence spread spectrum system with a 10 kHz information bandwidth and a 10 MHZ channel bandwidth yields a processing gain of 1000 or 30 dB. However, far greater processing gains are achieved with impulse radio systems, where for the same 10 KHz information bandwidth is spread across a much greater 2 GHz. channel bandwidth, the theoretical processing gain is 200,000 or 53 dB., 127038=Within the operators interface 1240 is a data entry device 1260, a communications means 1265 for communicating with the asset, object, people or animal monitor's communications means 1250, a display 1270, a memory 1275 and a controller 1280 for controlling the aforesaid., 155818=Upon setting the impulse radio transmitter in 1802 and the impulse radio receiver 1804, a determination is made of the duty cycle requirements in 1806. As mentioned above, the duty cycle may be for plutonium and for a short trip in which the duty cycle would be very short. For example, the clock of the impulse radio transmitter and receiver may be set upon loading into a transportation means to every 5 minutes and the current UTC time is 1700. In this case the impulse radio transmitter would be set to transmit at 1705, 1710, 1715 . . . and the impulse radio receiver having been set to the same internal clock would expect to receive signals from the impulse radio transmitter at 1705, 1710, 17015 . . ., 100757=As depicted, a large number of impulse radio receivers and impulse radio transmitters as well as assets to be monitored can be utilized because of the unique properties of impulse radio systems. If automatic activation and duty cycle adjustment are desired for the transmitters, a transmitter activation and setting controller 1035 is added to the system and in communication with impulse radio transmitter 1010. If complicated asset, object, people or animal correlation is desired, a transmitter and asset ID capture device 1045 is further implemented into the system. Integration can be accomplished with other systems, such as existing inventory control systems and/or asset tracking systems 1040., 103613=As shown in FIG. 11, an asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 is associated with and mounted to a respective structure 1116. Included in and interfaced with the asset, object, people or animal monitor, is an Impulse Radio Receiver 1114 a. The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can be mounted to the structure 1116 in a number of manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 of the present invention can be mounted to the exterior of the structure 1116 a, as depicted in FIG. 11, within the structure or within the walls of the structure. Although the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can be permanently mounted to the structure, the asset, object, people or animal monitor can also be temporarily mounted to a structure. For example, an asset, object, people or animal monitor can be temporarily mounted to a rental trailer in order to monitor the location and status of the rental trailer and its contents. As also shown in FIG. 11 and as described hereinafter, the asset, object, people or animal monitor is adapted to receive signals from the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and communicate, via a first communications link, with a remotely located central station 1112 so as to provide the central station 1112 with information relating to the structure 1116 a and the contents 1134 therein with which the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 is associated., 111425=The information relating to which cargo 1134 and impulse radio transmitter 1132 are being passed through the entrance to the structure is forwarded to the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114. Located in memory 1218 in the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 is a table look-up which correlates which impulse radio transmitter 1132 is attached to which cargo 1134. Therefore, when the information is received by the receiver 1114 a, which was transmitted by the impulse radio transmitter 1132, which is interfaced with the sensor 1126 attached and sensing parameters on the cargo, the information can be passed to the central station 1112 as well as the driver. If a plurality of cargo 1134 are loaded into the structure 1116 a with different monitoring requirements, the base station can usefully determine corrective action on a cargo 1134 by cargo 1134 basis., 153691=As mentioned above, the ability to vary the duty cycle is very important. If the duty cycle can be varied based on varying circumstances a significantly more versatile system can be implemented. One such method of varying the duty cycle is illustrated in the flow chart of FIG. 18. At 1800 a flow chart of setting the duty cycle of the impulse radio transmitter and synchronizing the impulse radio receiver is depicted. At 1802 the impulse radio transmitter is set to a given time that will also be set into the impulse radio receiver. Although any time setting will work as long as the impulse radio receiver and impulse radio transmitter are consistent, it is depicted that the impulse radio receiver is set to the current UTC time. Again, it could be set to local time, a countdown timer or any other temporal means so long as the impulse radio receiver is set to the same timing methodology. Setting the internal impulse radio clock can be accomplished by many means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A wireless setting of the clock can be accomplished by using RF energy to transmit time information to a RF receiver which internally sets the clock according to, for example, UTC time. The same device can be used to set the impulse radio receiver. In one embodiment, the impulse radio transmitter and impulse radio receiver are both within a predetermined range of the clock setting means and thereby are set simultaneously to a synchronous time. For example, both could be in the same warehouse or shipping container and a wireless activating means can activate them both while simultaneously setting there clocks and duty cycles., 101506=Referring now to FIG. 11, an asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1110 according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1110 includes a central station 1112 and one or more asset, object, people or animal monitors 1114 associated with respective structure 1116. As illustrated in FIG. 11, for example, the structures can include one or more open or enclosed trailers 1116 a which are adapted to be hitched to and towed by respective tractors or trucks 1116 b. However, the structures can include other types of structures, both mobile, such as rail cars, shipping structures, towed barges, offshore oil or gas rigs or mobile office or home trailers and immobile, such as storage warehouses, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. By way of example, however, the asset, object, people or animal monitoring system and associated method of the present invention will be described in more detail hereinafter in conjunction with the monitoring and monitoring of trailers, although other types of structures could be effectively monitored and monitored by the asset, object, people or animal monitoring system and method of the present invention., 139382=A concise flowchart of the method of asset monitoring is illustrated in FIG. 15. According to this method the first step at 1510 is to place the impulse radio transmitter 1132 onto cargo being shipped. If a sensor 1126 is being utilized, then it is activated and interfaced with the impulse radio transmitter 1132 at step 1520. In step 1530 a, the impulse radio transmitter is either activated manually or by passing it through entrance 1138 to structure 1116 a. In step 1530 b, the duty cycle is also set for transmitter 1132 either manually or again by passing it through entrance 1138 to structure 1116 a wherein the wireless switch activator 1152 sets the duty cycle. After the impulse radio transmitter 1132 has been attached, activated, set for the desired duty cycle and set for the desire data rate, it is monitored in step 1540. If in step 1540 a predetermined status has been exceeded, corrective action can be taken in step 1550., 99875=As discussed above, when utilized in asset, object, people or animal monitoring of the present invention, the characteristics of impulse radio significantly improve the state of the art. Referring now to FIG. 10, an asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1000 according to the broad usage is depicted. Due to the unique characteristics of impulse radio technology, the major components of the impulse radio can be complimented with or replace existing monitoring devices and monitor assets, objects, people or animals in areas and ways previously thought impossible. The basic components include an impulse radio transmitter 1010 for transmitting monitored information for, for example, an asset 1020. Impulse radio transmitter 1010 transmits information relating to asset 1020 to impulse radio receiver 1030., 124648=The communications means can utilize various types of communications technology, such as satellite, RF, soft radio, cellular or packet radio communications technology, to establish the first communications link without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and the central station 1112 can each include a transmitter and a receiver, hereinafter termed a transceiver, for transmitting data via a terrestrial digital data network, such as via a RAM Mobile communications link established between the asset, object, people or animal monitor and the central station. Alternatively, the asset, object, people or animal monitor and the central station can each include a transceiver for establishing a satellite communications link, as illustrated schematically in FIG. 11. Alternatively, the asset, object, people or animal monitor and the central station can each include a radio frequency (RF) transceiver for establishing an RF communications link. Still further, the asset, object, people or animal monitor and the central station can be directly connected, either electrically or optically, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention., 131842=While the controller 1296 and related memory devices 1294 of the central station 1112 can be organized in different manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, the controller of one embodiment is adapted to manage a large scale relational data base, thereby supporting a variety of tables that link fields containing data of interest to the dispatcher or the owners of the freight., 81500=Impulse radio receivers typically integrate from 1 to 1000 or more pulses to yield the demodulated output. The optimal number of pulses over which the receiver integrates is dependent on a number of variables, including pulse rate, bit rate, interference levels, and range., 125935=FIG. 12 depicts the many components of a preferred embodiment of the present invention and illustrates there interrelationship. Included are an asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 of the present invention which includes a processor 1210 for controlling operations of the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and, more particularly, for controlling the interface between the impulse radio receiver 1114 a, the impulse radio transmitter 1132, the bar code scanning device 1154 and the wireless switch activating means 1152. The asset, object, people or animal monitor also contains the satellite communicator transceiver 1245 for position determination as well as the communication means 1250 for establishing communications between the operator interface 1240 and the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114. Said communications means 1250 also establishes communication between the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and the central station 1112., 90580=Impulse systems can measure distances to extremely fine resolution because of the absence of ambiguous cycles in the waveform. Narrow band systems, on the other hand, are limited to the modulation envelope and cannot easily distinguish precisely which RF cycle is associated with each data bit because the cycle-to-cycle amplitude differences are so small they are masked by link or system noise. Since the impulse radio waveform has no multi-cycle ambiguity, this allows positive determination of the waveform position to less than a wavelength-potentially, down to the noise floor of the system. This time position measurement can be used to measure propagation delay to determine link distance, and once link distance is known, to transfer a time reference to an equivalently high degree of precision. The inventors of the present invention have built systems that have shown the potential for centimeter distance resolution, which is equivalent to about 30 ps of time transfer resolution.

No. 09/083,993, filed May 26, 1998, titled \u201cSystem and Method for Distance Measurement by Inphase and Quadrature Signals in a Radio System\u201d, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 117300=The sensors 1126 of one advantageous embodiment are designed to provide interrupt signals to the impulse radio transmitters 1132 and thereafter transmitted to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a and interfaced with the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 upon the detection of a predetermined event. For example, the sensors 1126 can be designed to compare the sensed condition to a predetermined range of acceptable conditions. If the sensor 1126 of this advantageous embodiment detects that the sensed condition inside a crate or inside the structure in general, exceeds or falls outside of the predetermined range of acceptable conditions, the sensor communicates with the impulse radio transmitter 1132, which transmits to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a which is in communication with the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114, thereby notifying it that a sensed condition is no longer within acceptable limits. For example, the temperature sensor can compare the sensed temperature to the predetermined range of acceptable temperatures and, if the sensed temperature falls outside of the predetermined range of acceptable temperatures, can generate an interrupt signal. The range of acceptable conditions can be selected or set in a variety of manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the range of acceptable conditions can be downloaded from the central station 1112 to the asset, object, people or animal monitor while the asset, object, people or animal monitor is in the field, such as via the first communications link as described hereinafter., 102847=As the above examples illustrate, the structure 1116 has the potential to be mobile. That is, the structures are able to be moved from place to place. However, the structures are typically not able to move from place to place under their own power. Thus, a structure usually includes a source of electrical power for performing a predetermined function, such as a generator for operating the refrigeration unit of a refrigerated trailer. This power source can be utilized to power the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114. Further, if the structure is not mobile, immobile storage facilities typically have power supplies connected therewith that can be used to power the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114., 60664=To better understand the benefits of impulse radio to the present invention, the following review of impulse radio follows Impulse radio, which is not a continuous wave carrier-based system, was first fully described in a series of patents, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,641,317 (issued Feb. 3, 1987), 4,813,057 (issued Mar. 14, 1989), 4,979,186 (issued Dec. 18, 1990) and 5,363,108 (issued Nov. 8, 1994) to Larry W. Fullerton. A second generation of impulse radio patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,677,927 (issued Oct. 14, 1997), 5,687,169 (issued Nov. 11, 1997) and co-pending application Ser. No. 08/761,602 (filed Dec. 6, 1996) to Fullerton et al., 138051=FIG. 14 more clearly depicts the multipath advantage of impulse radio technology. Multi-path is defined as the multiple routes taken by RF energy between the transmitter and the receiver. In the structure depicted in FIG. 14, when an transmission occurs it can \u201cbounce\u201d of the walls of the structure 1116 a, the sides of other cargo 1134 or any other object. When standard radio transmitters transmit in an environment such as a structure, an immense multipath problem exits in that the signals can cancel each other out or create multipath error. Mutlipath error is defined as errors caused by the interference of a signal that has reached the receiver antenna by two or more different paths. Indeed, the larger the number of simultaneous transmissions, the more impossible for a standard radio receiver to receive intelligible information. Due to the unique properties of impulse radio communications, discussed in detail in the above referenced patents, this multipath problem is significantly reduced and can actually take advantage of the multipath effects to enhance the signal. Thus, the impulse radio allows for a large plurality of simultaneous transmissions and therefore the capability for monitoring individual pieces of cargo in a structure wrought with multipath difficulties., 128564=The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 of one advantageous embodiment also frequently determines the location of the structure 1116, such as at predetermined time intervals. The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 embodiment can therefore also determine if it is time to update the location of the structure 1116 and, if so, can prompt the position determining means to update the position of the asset, object, people or animal monitor. The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can thereafter transmit information which identifies the updated location to the central station 1112 or the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can store the updated location until the central station 1112 subsequently requests an update of the location of the structure 1116, at which time the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can provide the central station with the most recent location of the structure 1116. The central station 1112 can organize and prepare reports of varying levels of detail based upon the information received from each respective asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 in order to assist or advise the owners of a fleet while the freight continues along its route. In addition, the central station can display the present and historical location of the respective structure 1116 as an overlay on a computer generated map to further assist the owners of the freight to monitor a particular structure and to assess route usage, asset deployment and other operational parameters of value and interest., 130240=The central station 1112 can also process the received data and, in particular, the data relating to the actual conditions or events sensed by the on-board sensors to detect trends, such as refrigerated cargo which is gradually warming, and/or to detect sensed conditions which exceed or fall outside of acceptable limits. Based upon an evaluation of the received data, the central station can then advise the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and, in turn, the operator of the tractor 1116 b of potential or upcoming problems with the freight, such as by transmitting a warning message to the asset, object, people or animal monitor and, in turn, to the operator of the tractor. In addition, the data received by the central station 1112 which relates to the actual on-board conditions or events can serve as a log for insurance purposes so as to assist the owner of the freight in determining the party responsible and the reasons for any damage which their freight sustained., 132298=According to one advantageous aspect of the present invention, the asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1110 also includes an operator interface 1240 for providing information to and receiving information from an operator. For example, the operator interface can be mounted within the cab of a tractor 1116 b and can be adapted to communicate with the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 disposed within the trailer 1116 a which is hitched or tethered to the tractor. In particular, the operator interface 1240 and the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can each include local communications means, such an impulse radio systems, RF, IR or audio transceiver, for establishing a second communications link. The operator interface 1240 can also include a controller 1280, such as one or more microcontrollers or microprocessors, for controlling the operations of the operator interface and for processing data received from the asset, object, people or animal monitor. Moreover, the operator interface can include a data entry device 1260, such as an optical scanner, an RF tag sensor and/or a keyboard, for allowing the operator to enter data. This operator-entered data can then be transmitted, via the second communications link 1162, to the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 for subsequent processing, storage and/or transmission, via the first communications link 1166, to the central station 1112. For example, the operator can enter and transmit data via the first and second communications links that identifies or otherwise relates to the cargo 1134 stowed within the structure 1116. Thus, the central station 1112 and/or the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 can monitor the status of the cargo and can pinpoint the times at which the cargo was loaded and delivered as well as the condition of each individual piece of cargo 1134. In addition, the operator can enter and transmit messages via the first and second communications links that alert the dispatcher and/or emergency service personnel of a situation, such as a traffic accident or a fire, which demands emergency assistance., 115460=Another factor to consider is the amount of information and the date rate of information that is to be transferred. In the case of the Ebola virus, the desire to monitor 100 parameters may be present. The impulse radio receiver 1114 a must know the amount and rate of the data to be transmitted from the impulse radio transmitter 1132. As the bar code 1150 from the cargo 1134 and the bar code 1630 from the impulse radio transmitter 1132 therewith being loaded are scanned, the scanner communicates with the asset, object, people or animal monitor and informs the asset, object, people or animal monitor of the inventory control number of the crate and the serial number of the impulse radio transmitter. The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114, from its memory, determines the amount of information required from that crate and therefore the data rate transmitted from the impulse radio transmitter 1132. This information is communicated from the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a and to the wireless switch activating means 1235. The wireless switch activating means 1152 then activates the impulse radio transmitter 1132 to transmit at a given data rate. Thus, the impulse radio transmitter and impulse radio receiver are in sync regarding data rates. Modifying the amount of pulses integrated to obtain a data bit varies the data rate. This is fully discussed in the above referenced patents and is incorporated herein by reference. Further, the ability for a wireless switch activating means 1152 to adjust the data rate of the impulse radio transmitter 1132 is well known and can be fully implemented by an individual skilled in the art., 158328=In step, 1908 a determination is made as to whether additional transmitters are transmitting. In step 1910 the impulse radio receiver receives additional impulse radio transmissions, then returns to step 1908 for a determination as to whether or not further transmissions will be made. This can be accomplished by predetermined wait periods, wherein after a given period if no transmissions are received, the impulse radio receiver will not wait for additional transmissions. Or it can be accomplished by expecting a certain number of transmissions and upon receipt of that number of transmissions, the receiver will go into its periodic mode. Additional methods are easily implemented without undue experimentation to those of ordinary skill in the art. In step 1912, after all transmitters have \u201cchecked in\u201d thereby setting their predetermined interval, the impulse radio receiver only activates during the period in which it expects to receive transmissions., 113988=The duty cycle can be varied by many methods. The impulse radio transmitters 1132 can be manufactured so they can be adjusted by a manual method or by the same wireless method used to turn them on. Again, the methods of adjusting the duty cycle are enabled in the aforementioned Impulse Radio patents and the ability to automatically adjust them via a wireless activation device is well known in the art. So as the cargo 1134 passes through the entrance 1138 of the structure 1116 a, its bar code 1150 is scanned by the bar code scanner 1154 located at the periphery to the structure 1116 a entrance. The bar cod scanner 1154 communicates with the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 which determines via its database stored in its memory 1218 that the crate contains toxic material that must be continually monitored. The asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 communicates with the wireless switch activating means 1152 via an interface with the wireless switch activating means 1152, and the duty cycle is set to every five seconds., 106999=In order to conserve impulse radio transmitter 1132 power, it is very important that the transmitters be designed such that it is possible to begin transmission once they are loaded into the structure 1116 or at least at a prearranged time shortly there before. It is well know in the wireless art to be able to remotely activate devices. The wireless switch activation device can be designed to turn on the impulse radio transmitter when it comes within a certain range (i.e., within the perimeter of the entrance 1138 of the structure 1116 a). This design will vary with the size of the entrance to the structure, but the activation distance will be small enough so as not to inadvertently initiate the impulse transmitters. When the cargo 1134 and impulse radio transmitter 1132 attached thereto pass through the entrance 1138 to the structure, they come within range of the wireless switch activation device 1152 and begin impulse radio transmissions., 134612=The data entry device 1260 of the operator interface 1240 can also include an emergency or panic button which, when depressed, transmits a signal to the central station advising the dispatcher of the need for emergency assistance. In addition to the communications means 1265, such as a transceiver, the operator interface can also include a display 1270 and one or more memory devices 1275 for displaying and storing data, respectively., 108671=When transmitting information, each impulse radio transmitter 1132 transmits identifying information. This information can be a serial number. Further, provided at the entrance to the structure is a bar code scanning device 1154. Typically, cargo inventory 1134 is maintained in a database with a given inventory control number. Further, each impulse radio transmitter has a given serial number. One useful embodiment of the present invention is for the serial number to be imbedded in a bar code 1630 on impulse radio transmitter 1132 and for the cargo inventory control number to be imbedded in a bar code 1150 on cargo 1134. When the cargo with the impulse radio transmitter 1132 passes through the perimeter to the entrance 1138 of the structure 1116 a, a bar code scanning device 1154 reads the bar code 1150 of both the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and the cargo 1134 and passes that information to the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114., 136912=FIG. 13 elaborates on the entrance 1138 to the structure 1116 a depicting one possible placement of bar code scanner 1154 and wireless switch activator 1152. The bar code scanner 1154 in this embodiment is affixed to the lower right hand portion of entrance 1138 to structure 1116 a. The scanner 1154 can be permanently fixed to the interior wall or temporarily placed against the wall. The bar code scanner 1154 upon activation continuously scans the entrance perimeter 1138 to the structure 1116 a and when a bar code 1150 on cargo 1134 and/or the bar code on sensor 1126 passes within perimeter 1138, the information is passed to asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114. Similarly, as the bar code 1650 attached to impulse radio transmitter 1132 passes within the entrance 1138 to structure 1116 a, the bar code 1650 information about radio transmitter 1132 is communicated to asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114., 140496=FIG. 16 illustrates a possible impulse radio transmitter 1132 of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. There are numerous ways to attach the impulse radio transmitter 1132 to cargo 1134 within structure 1116 a. Holes 1620 enable strap mounting to the cargo 1134. Also, an adhesive back 1610 enable using adhesive to attach the impulse radio transmitter 1132. Wireless switch activator receiving means 1640 enables the impulse radio transmitter 1132 to receive wireless signals from the wireless switch activator 1152, thereby enabling activation of the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and also setting its transmission duty cycle and transmission rate. Contacts 1650 can be used to interface with the sensors attached to the cargo 1134. As described above, bar code 1630 provides information concerning which transmitter 1132 is transmitting to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a via the bar code scanning device 1154 and processor 1210. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be understood, however, that the invention is not limited thereto, since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. It is, therefore, contemplated by the appended claims to cover any such modifications that incorporate those features or those improvements which embody the spirit and scope of the present invention., 109759=As depicted in FIG. 12, the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 contains in memory 1218 a database of all potential inventory control numbers for both the impulse radio transmitters 1132 and the cargo 1134. A match is then made so that it can be determined which impulse radio transmitter 1132 is associated with which piece of cargo 1134., 127378=Within said central station 1112 is a communication means 1285, a data entry device 1290, a display 1292 and a memory 1294. A controller 1296 controls the operation of the aforesaid. As articulated in greater detail infra, sensors 1126 are attached and interfaced with individual pieces of cargo 1134, and can be utilized to monitor any desired status and are interfaced via sensor interfaces 1140 to impulse radio transmitters 1132. Impulse radio transmitters 1132 transmit information about which transmitter (i.e., the transmitter 1132 serial number) is transmitting, followed by information received from sensors 1126 to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a. The impulse radio receiver 1114 a interfaces with processor 1210 which uses that information in combination with information received from the bar code scanning device 1154, to control the wireless switch activating means 1152 and the information related via communication means 1250 to the operators interface 1240 and the central station 1255., 157365=FIG. 19 describes another method of varying the duty cycles and completing impulse radio transmitter and receiver synchronization. This method requires the impulse radio receiver to be waiting for the first impulse radio transmitter transmission 1902. The impulse radio transmitter begins transmitting by any of the aforementioned methodologies 1904. Upon receipt of the first impulse radio transmission 1906, which contains information about which transmitter is transmitting, the impulse radio receiver is programmed to know the duty cycle of that particular transmitter and when to expect the next transmission. For example, the impulse radio receiver will continuously monitor for the first impulse radio transmission and upon receipt will know that impulse radio transmitter number 1255584us298 is designated to transmit every hour and thereafter will only listen exactly one hour from the time of first transmission., 159337=FIG. 20 is a flowchart illustrating a further implementation of duty cycle variation and synchronization techniques. In this implementation, the receiver \u201clistens\u201d during a predetermined interval as in step 2002. \u201cListens\u201d as used herein means that the impulse radio receiver activates and receives impulse radio transmissions according to the aforementioned impulse radio reception techniques as well as techniques described in the patents incorporated herein by reference. In step 2004, the impulse radio transmitters are set to transmit during an interval which corresponds with the period in which the impulse radio receiver will be listening. For example, the impulse radio receiver can be set to listen for exactly three minutes in a given sixty minute interval. The transmitters will then transmit at least once every three minutes for a short duration (e.g., {fraction (1/10)} second). In this manner, it will be ensured that all transmissions will be heard while only requiring the impulse radio receiver to be listening and thereby using power for 3 minutes during a one hour period and will only require the impulse radio transmitters to transmit for a brief period every three minutes. Thus, in step 2006 impulse radio transmits at its predetermined interval and at step 2008, he impulse radio receiver listens at its predetermined periodic interval and is powered off during the inactive period. It is understood that any interval can be used so long as the impulse radio transmitters transmit at least once every period corresponding to the listen period of the impulse radio receiver., 105252=An impulse radio transmitter 1132 is secured to some type of cargo 1134. As illustrated in FIG. 16, the impulse radio transmitter can be secured by an adhesive 1610 or via mounting holes 1620. The individual cargo items can be large items such as a refrigerator or a number of smaller items on a pallet or in a crate. Further, sensors 1126 can be attached to the cargo 1134 and interfaced with the transmitters 1132 for transmission to the receiver 1114 a. Typically, the sensors 1126 are electrically connected to the impulse radio transmitter 1132 via a sensor interface 1140. For example, an electrical bus, such as an RS485 electrical bus can interconnect each of the sensors and the sensor interface. However, the sensors can be electrically connected to the impulse radio transmitter in a variety of other fashions without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the sensor interface can include an RF, infrared (IR) or audio transceiver for communicating with the sensors via local RF, IR or audio communications links, respectively. Also, the sensor 1126 can be built onto the same circuit board as the impulse radio transmitter, thereby avoiding the need for external interface. The sensors 1126 can be designed to monitor any type of status. For example, if the cargo is temperature critical, the sensor can monitor the temperature of the cargo 1134, pass that information to the impulse radio transmitter 1132, which transmits that information to the impulse radio receiver 1114 a for forwarding to the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114., 40675=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Non-Provisional Application No. 09/407,106, filed Sep. 27, 1999, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Monitoring Assets, Objects, People and Animals Utilizing Impulse Radio,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 131284=The central station 1112 can also produce a variety of reports based upon the received data which are tailored or customized according to the unique business requirements of a particular customer. By more closely monitoring the remotely located structures 1116, and in particular the individual contents of each object within the structure, the central station can provide status reports which allow the owners of the structures to more efficiently utilize the structures, thereby increasing the overall system productivity., 110169=It is illustrative to exemplify the process. Assume you are shipping a plurality of different biohazardous materials. Assume for this example, that cargo 1134 is this biohazardous material. Each refrigerated cargo 1134 must be maintained at a different temperature and humidity level so as to keep the hazardous material safe. Each refrigerated cargo 1134 is given an inventory control number and has a sensor 1126 for monitoring temperature and humidity. At some point prior to shipping, a non-activated and therefore non-transmitting impulse radio transmitter 1132, which also possesses a unique serial number, is physically attached to the refrigerated cargo 1134 and interfaced with the sensor 1126 by, for example, a RS 232 serial cable. When the refrigerated cargo is loaded onto the structure for shipping, it passes through the entrance 1138 to the structure 1116 a. In the entrance to the structure, the switch activating means 1152 wirelessly activates the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and the bar code scanner 1154 continuously scans to read the bar codes of both the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and the cargo 1134., 61331=Uses of impulse radio systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/332,502 (Attorney Docket No. 1659.0720000), entitled, \u201cSystem and Method for Intrusion Detection Using a Time Domain Radar Array, \u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/332,503 (Attorney Docket No. 1659.0670000), entitled, \u201cWide Area Time Domain Radar Array, \u201d both filed on Jun. 14, 1999 and both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. These patent documents are incorporated herein by reference., 112443=Another important aspect of the present invention is its ability to vary the duty cycle and therefore the battery life of the impulse radio transmitter 1132 based on the requirements of the user. This flexibility will determine the parameters of transportation. Methods of varying the duty cycle of impulse radio transmitters have been articulated in detail in the above referenced Impulse Radio patents and, again, is incorporated herein by reference. If the cargo being shipped is, for example, several crates of Ebola virus, it is imperative to know at all times the parameters of the crate; such as temperature, humidity and structural integrity (i.e., is it leaking). In this case, the duty cycle could be an impulse transmission every 5 seconds for continuous update. The increased duty cycle would shorten the battery life of the impulse radio transmitter 1132 and increase the bit rate, thereby decreasing the number of crates 1134 that can be individually monitored; but would be worth the trade off for continual monitoring., 98817=FIGS. 8-10 illustrate the cross correlation process and the correlation function. FIG. 8A shows the waveform of a template signal. FIG. 8B shows the waveform of a received impulse radio signal at a set of several possible time offsets. FIG. 9 represents the output of the correlator (multiplier and short time integrator) for each of the time offsets of FIG. 8B. Thus, this graph does not show a waveform that is a function of time, but rather a function of time-offset. For any given pulse received, there is only one corresponding point which is applicable on this graph. This is the point corresponding to the time offset of the template signal used to receive that pulse. Further examples and details of precision timing can be found described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927, and commonly owned co-pending application Ser. No. 09/146,524, filed Sep. 3, 1998, titled \u201cPrecision Timing Generator System and Method\u201d, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 120157=The asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1110 of the present invention also includes communications means for establishing a first communications link between each respective asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and the remotely located central station 1112. The communications link supports bidirectional communications and can either be a direct link or can be comprised of a chain of communications links which are linked to create the resulting first communications link. Once the communications means has established the first communications link between the central station 1112 and an asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 a, the respective asset, object, people or animal monitor can transmit information related to the location of the trailer 1116 a and information relating to the sensory signals for each individual cargo 1134 within the structure 1116 a. Based upon the information provided via the first communications link, the central station 1112 can monitor the position of the trailer 1116 a and status of the trailer 1116 a and its cargo 1134. Although not illustrated, the communications means can also establish another communications link between the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and an emergency services dispatcher, such as a \u201c911\u201d dispatcher, in the vicinity of the asset, object, people or animal monitor. Accordingly, the asset, object, people or animal monitor can transmit information via this other communications link to the emergency services dispatcher if an emergency occurs. For example, an asset, object, people or animal monitor can transmit information to the emergency services dispatcher via this other communications link if the sensor attached to hazardous material detects a difficulty in the hazardous material being shipped. The emergency services dispatcher can then quickly dispatch assistance to the operator or driver. In addition to or instead of notifying an emergency services dispatcher of the emergency conditions, the asset, object, people or animal monitor can notify the operator or driver of the emergency conditions, such as via a second communications 1162 link established between the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and an operator interface 1164 as described hereinbelow. In one advantageous embodiment, a single tractor 1116 b may tow a number of trailers 1116 a, such as two or three trailers. Or, in an alternate embodiment, one or more warehouses can be communicatively linked. While each trailer can include its own impulse transmitters and receivers and asset, object, people or animal monitors which independently communicates, via distinct communications links, with the central station 1112, the asset, object, people or animal monitoring system 1110 advantageous embodiment can include a master asset, object, people or animal monitor mounted within one of the trailers, such as the trailer directly tethered to the tractor, and one or more slave asset, object, people or animal monitors mounted within respective ones of the other trailers. According to this advantageous embodiment, the slave asset, object, people or animal monitors can each include communications means, such as a local RF transceiver or an impulse radio transceiver, for communicating with the master asset, object, people or animal monitor and for providing the master asset, object, people or animal monitor with information relating to the sensory signals collected from the sensors on-board the respective trailers., 136067=The central station 1112 can also communicate with the operator of the tractor 1116 b, via the communications links established by the asset, object, people or animal monitor 1114 and the operator interface 1240. For example, the central station can redirect the tractor-trailer by transmitting a message detailing the new route and the revised destination via the first communications link from the central station to the asset, object, people or animal monitor which, in turn, retransmits the message, via the second communications link, to the operator interface. In addition, the central station can periodically provide the operator interface with location data which identifies the present location of the trailer 1116 a, such as by street location or by city and state.}",

It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. The present invention can be implemented using the various impulse radio techniques disclosed in the above-referenced impulse radio patent documents, which are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, other impulse radio techniques, such as subcarrier modulation disclosed in above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927 for example, can be used together with the present invention. Conclusion A unique advantage of impulse radio as used in the above embodiments is the ability to transmit nearly simultaneously. In a traditional non-impulse radio transmission, if simultaneous transmissions occurred there would be a very good chance of interference or reception difficulties (i.e., they would \u201cstep\u201d on each other).
