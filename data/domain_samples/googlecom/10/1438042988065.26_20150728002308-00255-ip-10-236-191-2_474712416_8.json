    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The bodies 10 are described only schematically in the figures of the drawings can also have a different shape, in particular, they can be arcuate, spiral-shaped, coiled, or reel-shaped, with the light being introduced into the body at one end and being removed or measured at another end. It is possible with the aid of such bodies, to maximize the number of the internal reflections of the tightly focused beam, which therefore, diverges as little as possible. Over a hundred internal reflections are possible. As such, the measuring signal can indicate possible lime deposits sensitively. It is, therefore, possible for the sensor part ST to be exchanged easily, for example, in the case of damage or contamination. Moreover, sensor parts ST can be used whose elements (surfaces) on which deposits are formed have different shapes and/or are made of different materials. Such construction permits the device according to the invention to be adapted to specific applications to be able to identify as exactly as possible various types of deposits on different bodies. , the device for detecting deposits has a bipartite configuration. A connecting piece AT is located in the interior of a dishwasher. At least the part of the device according to the invention that is exposed to the deposits, for example, scaling, is detachably connected for the purpose of exchange with the connecting piece AT. The detachably connected part of the device",
