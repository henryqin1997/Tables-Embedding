September 1992), 46180=The proportion of spacer particles to abrasive particles are such that the spacer particles are present in a larger amount. Preferably, the ratios of spacer to abrasive particles fall within the range of about 1.5:1 to about 5:1. Most preferably, the ratio of spacer to abrasive particles is approximately 3:1., 56884=The films of the present invention are conformable due to the conformable nature of the substrates selected and the conformable adhesive layer contacting one major surface of the substrate and the conformable conductive and dielectric layers contacting the opposite major surface of the substrate. Preferably, a conformable substrate in a direct print film exhibits a yield point and/or permanent strain when subjected to a maximum tensile stress of about 3.5\ufffd107 N/m2 (2000 lbs./square inch) at room temperature according to ASTM D638-94b (1994), when the caliper used for the test includes the total cross-sectional thickness of the substrate, the thickness of the adhesive, and the thicknesses of the conductive layer and dielectric layer. More preferably, the maximum tensile stress limit is about 1.4\ufffd107 N/m2 to provide more conformable films. Most preferably, the maximum tensile stress limit is about 7\ufffd106 N/m2 to provide even more conformable films. Conformability of the films still require internal integrity. Desirably, the minimum tensile stress limit is about 6.9\ufffd104 N/m2 (10 lbs./square inch) and preferably the minimum tensile stress limit is about 1.7\ufffd105 N/m2 (25 lbs./square inch)., 67895=In those examples where a wire bar coater was used, the stock solution was diluted with a 50:50 blend, by volume, of toluene and methyl ethyl ketone in an amount sufficient to reduce the solids contents thereof to approximately 16.7 weight percent (i.e., 14.6 weight percent polymer and 2.1 weight percent particles). The resultant solution had a viscosity below 10 centipoise., 49058=Non-limiting examples of pressure sensitive adhesives useful with the present invention include those adhesives described in U.S. Pat. Nos.

A presently preferred adhesive is an acrylate copolymer pressure sensitive adhesive formed from a 90/10 weight percent monomer ratio of 2-methylbutyl acrylate/acrylic acid in a 65/35 heptane/acetone solvent system (39-41% solids) and having an inherent viscosity of about 0.7-0.85 dl/g., 17682=This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Applicaton No. 60/007,064, filed Oct. 25, 1995, now abandoned., 40693=Formulations of the conductive layer 14 require a weight ratio from about 5:1 to about 1:1 of pigment:binder with a preference of a weight ratio of 3:1 pigment:binder. When \"Tego S\" conductive pigment is employed, the weight ratio can range from about 3.0:1 to about 4.7:1 pigment:binder. When the DuPont \"Zelec\" conductive pigment is employed, the weight ratio can range from about 1:1 to about 4:1 pigment:binder., 66252=A concentrate of coating material for the fabrication of dielectric layer was prepared using a 3:1 blend of spacer to abrasive particles disposed in an acrylic copolymer matrix. The spacer particles comprised the \"Syloid 74 X-Regular\" amorphous silica material described above. The abrasive particles comprised the \"Imsil A-10\" mined microcrystalline silica described above. The resin comprised the \"Desograph-E342-R\" acrylic copolymer resin described above. The mixture was 34.4 weight percent solids in toluene. The solids component comprised 67 weight percent binder resin and 33 weight percent particles solids (in the 3:1 ratio described above). The particle solids were blended by ball milling for approximately two hours at room temperature. The particle solids were then mixed with binder resin to produce a stock solution of one part of particle solids and one part of a toluene based solution of the resin having 57 weight percent solids. The stock solution was prepared by blending the foregoing together at room temperature and the resultant solution comprised 45.8 weight percent total solids in toluene. Alternatively, a second stock solution was made. None of the examples used this stock solution, but it has proved to be useful in further experimentation. The particle solids were mixed with binder resin to produce a stock solution of two parts of particle solids and one part of a toluene based solution of the resin having 57 weight percent solids. The blending occurred at room temperature, and the resultant solution comprised 41.9 weight percent total solids in toluene., 47208=A coating mixture to prepare dielectric layer 16 can employ solvents such toluene into which the binder, spacer particles, and abrasive particles can be added as solids. The range of total solids in the coating mixture can be from 10 to about 35 and preferably about 15 to 25 weight percent of the total coating mixture. Of the total solids, the binder solids can comprise from about 93 to about 78 and preferably 82 weight percent. Of the total solids, the particles solids (preferably in a 3:1 spacer:abrasive mixture) can comprise from about 7 to about 22 and preferably 18 weight percent., 58216=Films 10 of the present invention can provide an average color density as measured according to a \"Reflective Optical Density of a Status T Method\" under the requirements of ANSI/ISO 5/3-1984, ANSI PH2. 18-1985 published by the Graphic Communications Association of Arlington, Va. of from about 1.0 to about 1.6 O.D. Units. Preferably, the average color density ranges from about 1.3 to about 1.5 O.D. Units. These values show that films 10 of the present invention has an excellent color imaging capability after electrostatic printing directly onto film 10 using electrostatic printers otherwise used for the processes described in Wang et al. and Chou et al. above., 38106=The bulk powder resistivity can range from about 2 to about 15 Ohm-cm with about 2 to about 10 Ohm-cm being preferred and about 6 to about 7 Ohm-cm being presently preferred. With the DuPont pigments, the bulk powder resistivity can be about 2-5 Ohm-cm for \"Zelec 3410-T\" pigments and 4-15 Ohm-cm for \"Zelec 2610-S\" found acceptable for the present invention. The bulk powder resisitivity has been found to be important in controlling the final appearance of the image on the direct print film because materials that are too resistive require the use of a larger amount of conductive pigment can cause an objectionable amount of background color in the final image., 61159=Example 1 was prepared by mixing 85 parts ethanol, 35 parts ethyl acetate, 45 parts of Surcol SP-2 binder at 50% total solids until a clear solution was achieved. Then with good agitation, 14 parts of Zelec ECP 2601-S particles (silicon dioxide core with antimony doped tin oxide coating) was slowly added, followed by stirring for more than one hour. Then the solution was transferred to a \"Kady Mill\" and milled for 30 minutes. The coating solution was applied to unprimed polyvinyl chloride substrate. Coating was at about 800 m/hr. with oven drying at 93\ufffd to 132\ufffd C. for 1 minute., 24165=\"Bulk powder resistivity\" means electrical resistivity of the bulk powder used in the conductive pigment according to the following test described by E. I. DuPont, one of the commercial suppliers of conductive pigments. As described in Capano et al., \"The Application of ZELEC ECP in Static Dissipative Systems\" (Du Pont Chemicals, Deepwater, N.J. September 1992), a cylindrical cell, with electrodes at the top and bottom is used to make bulk powder resistivity measurements. A weighed amount of powder is placed into the cell and then pressed with a laboratory press into a pellet. The resistance between the two electrodes is then measured as a function of the pressure applied and the thickness of powder pellet. The bulk powder resistivities of Du Pont conductive pigments commonly range from about 2 Ohm-era to about 20 Ohm-cm according to this test. Another supplier of conductive pigments, Goldschmidt A. G. of Essen, Germany, identifies bulk powder resistivity as \"specific resistance\" and employs a test method available from Esprit Chemical Company of Rockland, Md. For purposes of this application, the property of \"bulk powder resistivity\" includes the concept of the property of \"specific resistance\"., 60376=Color Density: \"Reflective Optical Density on a Status T Method\"\" under the requirements of ANSI/ISO 5/3-1984, ANSI PH2. 18-1985 published by the Graphic Communications Association of Arlington, Va., 41148=When the pigment to binder ratio falls below 1:1, there is inadequate bulk conductivity of layer 14. When the weight ratio of pigment:binder exceeds about 5:1, there is insufficient cohesive strength of the layer 14 on film substrate 12., 59463=Films 10 of the present invention can provide a 60\ufffd Gloss from about 2 to about 30, with about 7 being preferred. 60\ufffd Gloss can be measured as described in ASTM D2457-90 (1990)., 60272=Color Shift: ASTM D 2244-93 published by American Society for Testing and Materials.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The scope of the invention is indicated by the following claims. Example 6 presents the preferred direct print film of the present invention in part because of strength of ply adhesion of the conductive layer to the conformable substrate. Examples 1-5 are also acceptable for direct print films because of acceptable to very good imaging. The results from Table 2 show that the type of binder and the type of conductive pigment vary the results for direct print films. Without undue experimentation, one skilled in the art can employ the variations shown in the examples to provide an acceptable direct print film according to the present invention.
