Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention. While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in an alternator with a ventilator and a device for controlling and/or monitoring the ventilator, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. The resistor 122 determines the hysteresis of the operational amplifier 110 in the ventilator operation, and the capacitors 118 and 128 are supposed to filter the measuring voltage. The following devices are provided for protection against voltage peaks and for improving the characteristics of the device 15 for controlling and monitoring the ventilator 15: The diode 82 serves for protection against negative voltage peaks, diode 129 serves for stabilizing the supply voltage. The other diodes 111 and 124 protect the inputs of the operational amplifiers 109 and 110 from overvoltage, the diode 124 is realized as a Zener diode. On the other hand, if the connector for the",
