The Instron tester 88 is Model No. 1122 available from the Instron Corporation of Canton, Mass. The Instron tester 88 and the test apparatus 90 are used to quantify the term \"stiffness\" of each tab. The stiffness of each tab is defined as the ability of each tab to resist bending under an applied force. The bending stiffness of each tab is determined by measuring the peak force required to bend the tab through 90 degrees, starting from an initial position wherein the tab is perpendicularly aligned downward From the body-facing surface of the absorbent article., 29916=One of the early patents to teach the use of flaps on a sanitary napkin was U.S. Pat. No. 2,787,271 to Clark. U.S. Pat. No. 3,397,697 to Rickard and U.S. Pat. No. 4,285,343 to McNair provided improvements wherein the flaps overlapped so as to hold the sanitary napkin securely to the undergarment. Since 1953, many versions of sanitary napkins with panty-gathering flaps have been patented. U.S. Patent 4,608,047 to Mattingly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,320 to McCoy, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,589,876, and 4,687,478, both to Van Tilburg, teach the use of flexible flaps.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in conjunction with several specific embodiments, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations which fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. A second method of removing the absorbent article 10 from an undergarment is to remove one of the tabs and then lift the article 10 upward, away from the crotch portion of the undergarment. This sideways removal is facilitated by the presence of the short tabs 26 and 28. The shortness of the tabs 26 and 28, together with the small adhesive areas on each tab, attribute to this easy method of removal. The present absorbent article 10 can be removed from the undergarment using a much simpler and faster method. One method is for the consumer to grasp an end of the absorbent article 10 in one hand while holding a portion of her undergarment 38 in the other hand. She then pulls the absorbent article 10 upward, towards the opposite end, whereby the adhesive bonds are broken from the central portion 20 and from both of the tabs 26 and 28. The absorbent article 10 is then completely separated from the undergarment 38. It should be noted that the consumer can remove",
