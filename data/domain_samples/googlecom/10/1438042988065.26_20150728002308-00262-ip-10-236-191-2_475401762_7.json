The tissue supporting device 10 includes a plurality of cylindrical tubes 12 connected by S-shaped bridging elements 14. The bridging elements 14 allow the tissue supporting device to bend axially when passing through the tortuous path of the vasculature to the deployment site and allow the device to bend when necessary to match the curvature of a lumen to be supported. The S-shaped bridging elements 14 provide improved axial flexibility over prior art devices due to the thickness of the elements in the radial direction which allows the width of the elements to be relatively small without sacrificing radial strength. For example, the width of the bridging elements 14 may be about 0.0015-0.0018 inches (0.0381-0.0457 mm). Each of the cylindrical tubes 12 has a plurality of axial slots 16 extending from an end surface of the cylindrical tube toward an opposite end surface.}",

The typical ductile hinge 20 is not a long narrow beam as are the struts in the known stents. Wall thickness of the present invention may be increased to 0.005 inches (0.127 mm) or greater, while hinge width is typically 0.002-0.003 inches (0.0508-0.0762 mm), preferably 0.0025 inches (0.0635 min) or less. Typical hinge length, at 0.002 to 0.005 inches (0.0508-0.0127 mm), is more than an order of magnitude less than typical strut length. Thus, the ratio of b:h in a typical ductile hinge 20 is 2:1 or greater. This is an inherently stable ratio, meaning that the plastic moment for such a ductile hinge beam is much lower than the critical buckling moment Mcrit, and the ductile hinge beam deforms through normal strain-curvature. Ductile hinges 20 are thus not vulnerable to buckling when subjected to bending moments during expansion of the tissue supporting device 10, 100, 200.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made and equivalents employed, without departing from the present invention. In addition, while ductile hinges 20 are the preferred configuration for the expandable medical device of the present invention, a stent without the defined ductile hinges would also be included within the scope of the present invention. , the strut angle increases to about 20\ufffd to 80\ufffd. FIG. 3 According to one example of the present invention, the struts 18 are positioned initially at an angle of about 0\ufffd to 45\ufffd with respect to a longitudinal axis of the device. As the device is expanded radially from the unexpanded state illustrated in , the angle \u03b81 increases. In this case the device contracts axially from the onset of vertical expansion throughout the expansion. A higher final strut angle \u03b81, can significantly increase crush strength and decrease circumferential recoil of the stent structure. However, there is a trade off between increased crush strength and increase in axial contraction. FIG. 3 , a portion of the tissue supporting device 100 having an array of struts 18 and ductile hinges 20 are shown in the unexpanded state. The struts 18 are positioned initially at an angle \u03b81 with respect to",
