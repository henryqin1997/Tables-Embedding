    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{92632=Electrical stimulation of neural tissue may be implemented by providing pulses to electrodes 38 and 40 (FIG. 12) having amplitudes of 0.1 to 20 volts, pulse widths varying from 0.02 to 1.5 milliseconds, and repetition rates varying from 2 to 2500 Hz. The appropriate stimulation pulses are generated by device 16 based on the computer algorithm illustrated in FIGS. 6-10. Pulses with the selected characteristics are then delivered from device 16 through cable 42, catheter 22, tube 22A and electrodes 38 and 40 to the basal ganglia or thalamus of the brain., 68800=The distal end of catheter 22 terminates in a cylindrical hollow tube 22A having a distal end 25 implanted into a portion of the basal ganglia of the brain by conventional stereotactic surgical techniques. End 25 is provided with microporous portions 27-29 in the preferred embodiment (FIG. 12); however, multiple holes or slits within portions 27-29 could also be used. Additional details about portions 27-29 may be obtained from pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/430,960 entitled \"Intraparenchymal Infusion Catheter System,\" filed Apr. 28, 1995, in the name of Dennis Elsberry et al. and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. Referring to FIG. 11, tube 22A includes an outer cylindrical insulating jacket 30 and an inner cylindrical insulating jacket 32 that defines a cylindrical catheter lumen 34. A multifilar coil or strands of wire 36 is embedded in tube 22A as shown., 71603=A sensor 130 is implanted into a portion of a patient's body suitable for detecting symptoms of the motion disorder being treated. Sensor 130 is adapted to sense an attribute of the symptom to be controlled or an important related symptom. For motion disorders that result in abnormal movement of an arm, such as arm 122, sensor 130 may be a motion detector implanted in arm 122 as shown. For example, sensor 130 may sense three-dimensional or two-dimensional motion (linear rotational or joint motion), such as by an accelerometer. One such sensor suitable for use with the present invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,879 (Vonk et al.). Another suitable accelerometer is found in pacemakers manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. and described in patent application Ser. No. 08/399072 entitled \"Package Integrated Accelerometer\", filed Mar. 8, 1995, in the names of James Sikorski and Larry R. Larson. Sensor 130 also may be placed in device 10 in order to detect abnormal movement resulting from the motion disorder being treated., 86303=The stimulus pulse frequency is controlled by programming a value to a programmable frequency generator 208 using bus 202. The programmable frequency generator provides an interrupt signal to microprocessor 200 through an interrupt line 210 when each stimulus pulse is to be generated. The frequency generator may be implemented by model CDP1878 sold by Harris Corporation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations By using the foregoing techniques for simultaneous drug infusion and electrical stimulation, neural disorders, including motor disorders, can be controlled with a degree of accuracy previously unattainable. Those skilled in that art will recognize that the preferred embodiments may be altered or amended without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, as defined in the accompanying claims. It also is possible to infuse an agent that has an affect upon the neuron population that is not strictly connected in time with the electrical depolarization of the neurons. In this case, the time of application of stimulation and infusion may be completely asynchronous. Or an agent could be infused that diffuses beyond the effects of the electrical stimulation but still has an advantageous effect on the brain independent of the stimulation effects. As an example, FIG. 17 illustrates the same form of tube 22A shown in FIG. 16 implanted adjacent a spinal cord SC. A steroid, or other anti-inflammatory drug, can be infused through portion 27 to reduce inflammation in area IN of the spinal cord, while portion ST, such as the dorsal columns, is electrically stimulated by electrodes 38 and 40 to treat the pain. Alternatively, an antispasmodic could be infused to treat the spasms associated with mechanical back problems while stimulation is applied to the spinal cord to treat the pain. FIG. 18A illustrates various times at which infusion and stimulation can",
