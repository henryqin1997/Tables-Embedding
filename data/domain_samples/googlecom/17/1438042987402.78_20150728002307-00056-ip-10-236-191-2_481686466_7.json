No. 08/700,855 filed Aug. 21, 1996, corresponding to German Patent Application 195 30. 616.3-14, it has already basically been made possible to skip one or more gears when changing gear, in which case, in order to activate the gear wheel clutches, an equal number of shift elements is arranged fixedly in terms of movement with respect to the shift shaft, specifically offset with respect to one another in each case in the circumferential and axial directions. Correspondingly, the selector sleeve is provided with a corresponding arrangement of window-like openings for coupling the respective shift element to the associated gear wheel clutch, the shift shaft and selector sleeve each having a motor-operated actuator element for their drive.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example, and is not to be taken by way of limitation. The spirit and scope of the present invention are to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims. If the shift shaft 12 now reaches the position b after passing through the neutral position N, the brake 20 is moved into the engaged state 20-1 and the shift actuator element 14 is adjusted so that an anticlockwise rotational movement by the difference angle of rotation 17 into the significant angle of rotation position 12-9 is imposed on the shift shaft 12 by the slider section 27 during the activation in the direction of the end position corresponding to the gear speed position d, and the shift rod 31-9 is thus activated by the shift finger 13 into its gear speed position d corresponding to the aimed-at target gear speed. When the shift shaft 12 reaches the position c, the brake 20 is disengaged and the shift actuator element 14 is adjusted so that the shift shaft 12 passes through the region 19 of the neutral position N from c to b--that is to say just before it reaches the gear speed position d of the significant angle of rotation position 12-8--as a result of which an anticlockwise rotational",
