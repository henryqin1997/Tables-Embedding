For example, the nonwoven web can be directed through the nip of cooperating heated bonding rolls as known in the art. The bonding rolls may be point bonding rolls, helical bonding rolls, or the like. Bonding conditions, such as temperature and pressure of the rolls, can vary depending upon the polymers used, and are known in the art for different polymers. For example, for polyurethane/polypropylene multicomponent fibers, the bonding rolls are heated to a temperature from about 120\ufffd C. to about 150\ufffd C. and are set to a pressure of about 300 to about 1000 pounds of force per inch of fabric width (pounds per linear inch or pli). The web can be fed through the rolls at varying speeds, ranging from about 200 feet per minute to about 300 feet per minute. Other thermal treatment stations can also be used, such as ultrasonic, microwave, or other RF treatment apparatus. Through air bonding equipment can also be used, as well as any of the heat sources noted above. It is noted that the mechanical action of typical processing steps, such as crimping and carding, does not split the fibers., 103019=[0073] Mechanical fabric formation processes include hydroentanglement and needlepunching. Such processes are known in the art. In hydroentangling, the web is typically conveyed longitudinally to a hydroentangling apparatus wherein a plurality of manifolds, each including one or more rows of fine orifices, direct high pressure water jets through the fiber web to intimately hydroentangle the fibers and form a cohesive fabric. The hydroentangling apparatus can be constructed in a manner known in the art and as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,706 to Evans, incorporated by reference. The fiber hydroentanglement is accomplished by jetting liquid, typically water, supplied at a pressure from about 200 psig to about 1800 psig or greater to form fine, essentially columnar, liquid streams. The high pressure streams are directed toward at least one surface of the web. The wen can be supported on a foraminous support screen which can have a pattern to form a nonwoven structure with a pattern or with apertures or the screen can be designed and arranged to form a hydraulically entangled fabric which is not patterned or apertured. The web can pass through the hydraulic entangling apparatus one or more times for hydraulic entanglement on one or both sides of the web or to provide any desired degree of hydroentanglement., 73290=[0037] Tables of solubility parameter values for many solvents and some polymers, as well as methods for estimating solubility parameter values for polymers and copolymers, can be found in \u201cPolymer Handbook,\u201d 2nd Edition, J. Brandrup and E. H. Immergut, Editors, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1975, p. IV-337ff, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Paint Technology, 42, p. 76-118 (1970). The use of solubility parameters in determining the compatibility of polymers has been described, for example, by C. B. Bucknall in \u201cToughened Plastics\u201d, chapter 2, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London, 1977., 76292=[0041] The weight ratio of the elastomeric component and the non-elastomeric component can vary. Preferably the weight ratio is in the range of about 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably from about 20:80 to about 80:20, and most preferably from about 35:65 to about 65:35. In addition, the dissociable multicomponent fibers of the invention can be provided as staple fibers, continuous filaments, or meltblown fibers., 110529=[0086] Continuous multifilament melt spun fiber is produced using a bicomponent extrusion system. A sixteen segment hollow pie/wedge bicomponent fiber is produced having eight segments of polyurethane polymer and eight segments of polypropylene polymer. The weight ratio of polyurethane polymer to polypropylene polymer in the bicomponent fibers is 50:50. The polyurethane is commercially available as Morthane PS440-200, a thermoplastic polyurethane from Morton International, and the polypropylene is commercially available as MRD5-1442 from Union Carbide.}",

Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. [0087] Following extrusion, the filaments are subsequently drawn 3 times, thereby yielding a 3 denier multifilament multicomponent fiber. The filaments are thermally treated by directing the filaments through a chamber into which air heated to a temperature of about 75\ufffd C. flows so that the polyurethane and polypropylene segments release and microfilaments of the respective polymers form.

A sixteen segment hollow pie/wedge bicomponent fiber is produced having eight segments of polyurethane polymer and eight segments of polypropylene polymer.
