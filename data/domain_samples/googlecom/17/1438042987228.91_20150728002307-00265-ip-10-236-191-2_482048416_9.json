    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{91256=Approximately 86 kg of cryoprecipitate derived from plasma as described in Example 1, is stored at -70\ufffd C. as a human Factor VIII:C enriched plasma fraction, is dissolved in twice its weight of water and calcium chloride, is added to a final concentration of 50 uM. The pH of the cryosuspension (250 liters) is slowly adjusted to 6.7 with 1M acetic acid. The temperature of the Factor VIII:C solution is gradually cooled to 9.5\ufffd C. as a precipitation occurs over a 20-minute period of continuous mixing. The precipitate, which is predominately fibrinogen and fibronectin accounting for about 50% of the total protein, is removed by centrifugation at 3000\ufffdg for 15 minutes at 9.5\ufffd C. The pH of the resulting cold supernate (225 liters) is adjusted to 7.4 with 1N NaOH, and filtered through a 0.5 to 0.8 micron normal pore size membrane to remove any particles with little loss of Factor VIII:C. To the filtered supernate is added NaCl to 0.8M, CaCl2 to 0.05M, and a Triton X-100/tri-(n-butyl) phosphate mixture (3.3:1 ratio) to 1.3% (v/v) with little loss of Factor VIII:C (17.9 units/ml). This is designated as the cryo-detergent solution., 85187=The hybridoma, prepared as described above, was procured from Genetics Institute, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The cell line as been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, and has the indentification number ATCC HB 11552., 55754=The prior art has taught the addition of organic solvents and detergents to concentrated solutions of polypeptides to disrupt and inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses while preserving the protein structure of the desired polypeptide. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,540,573. Organic solvents containing either Tween-80 or Triton X-100 have been shown to be effective reagents for killing viruses found in concentrated solutions of certain proteins without adversely affecting the bioactivity of the proteins. The use of such solvent-detergent mixtures, however, has been avoided because subsequent removal of the mixture from the concentrated protein has proven to be very difficult. See, for example, Prince, A.M. et al., Lancet, p. 706, Mar. 29, 1981. As a result, other detergents, such as sodium cholate or sodium deoxycholate, are more commonly used. These detergents can be removed from the polypeptide of interest by gel exclusion chromatography on, for example, Sephadex G-25. A drawback to the use of these detergents, however, is that they are strong protein denaturants which can adversely affect the bioactivity of the polypeptide. Such detergents can be used herein in amounts which will not denature the polypeptide to be purified, either in combination with other detergents or with protein stabilizers or both., 85917=The monoclonal antibody is coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-2B as described by March et al, Anal Biochem, 60, 149-152 (1974). The method is as follows. Sepharose CL-2B, pre-swollen, is washed with ten resin-volumes of deionized water, and suspended in one resin-volume of cold (2\ufffd-8\ufffd C.) deionized water. Two resin-volumes of 2.0M sodium carbonate are added to the resin and stirred. For each liter of resin, 60 g of cyanogen bromide is dissolved in 120 ml of acetonitrile and added to the resin with vigorous stirring. After 10 to 30 minutes of incubation, depending upon the rate and extent of activation needed, the resin suspension is suction-filtered and washed five times with two resin-volumes of coupling solution. The resin is immediately transferred to a beaker and added to the dialyzed monoclonal antibody solution. The resin suspension is stirred for two hours at 21\ufffd C. which produces a coupling efficiency greater than 90% with approximately 1 g of monoclonal antibody bound per liter of resin. The resin suspension is stored overnight in the cold, suction filtered, and washed four times with two resin-volumes of cold coupling solution. The resin is transferred to a beaker containing three resin-volumes of 0.2M glycine, pH 8.0, stirred for two hours at 21\ufffd C. to block the remaining reactive sites on the resin, suction filtered, and washed five times with two resin-volumes of a 0.1M sodium acetate, 0.5M NaCl , pH 3.5 solution. The antibody-resin mixture is finally washed four times with two resin-volumes of 10 mM acetic acid, pH 3.5, and stored in one resin-volume of the same solution at 2\ufffd-8\ufffd C. until needed. The antibody-resin mixture has been found to be functionally active when stored over prolonged periods in the acetic acid solution., 35580=This is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/887,387, filed May 21, 1992, now abandoned which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/167,902, filed MAr. 28, 1988, now abandoned which in turn was a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 32,800, filed Mar. 31, 1987 now abandoned., 97460=Approximately 3 liters of the cryo-detergent solution was applied at room temperature from top to bottom through a 100 ml column of mAb-resin (capacity: 1 mg mAb per ml resin) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was washed with 1800 ml of Solution II at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The Factor VIII:C material was eluted off the mAb resin with 450ml of Solution III without human albumin at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The specific activity of the purified Factor VIII:C was then determined by one-stage clotting assays, and protein concentration derived from absorbance at 280 nm and dye-binding techniques. Table 2 below shows the activity of the Factor VIII:C recovered from the indicated starting material., 36390=In recent years, the scientific and medical communities have given increased attention to various polypeptides useful as therapeutic agents and to methods of isolating such polypeptides from the complex source materials in which they are present. An example of such a polypeptide is a blood factor obtained from plasma known as the antihemophilic factor. This blood factor is also identified as Factor VIII procoagulant activity protein (Factor VIII:C). This protein acts to correct the clotting defect in individuals with hemophilia A. It exists in plasma complexed with another protein known as Factor VIII-related protein or Factor VIII:RP. Other designations for Factor VIII:RP are Factor VIII:R:Ag and von Willebrand factor. Because of Factor VIII:C's therapeutic value as a coagulant, it has been regarded as desirable to purify Factor VIII and to isolate Factor VIII:C from Factor VIII:RP. Various procedures have been suggested for the isolation and purification of Factor VIII:C and other polypeptides of therapeutic value. These methods have been generally based on the techniques of immunoaffinity, affinity or ion exchange chromatography. For example, the method in a recent patent for the ultrapurification of Factor VIII:C, Zimmerman & Fulcher, U.S. Pat. No. Re. 32,011, employs such a two-step procedure of affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. Essentially, a Factor-VIII preparation is passed through a column containing agarose beads coupled with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed to Factor VIII:RP. The Factor VIII:C, which is complexed to the von Willebrand factor, is adsorbed onto the matrix while uncomplexed Factor VIII:C moieties and contaminants pass through the column as unbound material. The Factor VIII:C is removed from the bound von Willebrand: antibody complex with a high salt solution containing calcium. The Factor VIII:C solution is desalted and finally adsorbed onto an ion-exchange column, more specifically, agarose beads coupled with positively charged aminohexyl groups. The Factor VIII:C is desorbed from the column with a high salt solution. Although this method is suitable for use in the ultrapurification of a polypeptide, it lacks several important features which would improve the therapeutic safety of the product and facilitate its large-scale production. One distinctive feature of the Zimmerman et al reissue patent is that the monoclonal antibodies are directed to another polypeptide (von Willebrand factor) that is usually in excess and considered associated with the polypeptide of interest (Factor VIII:C). Depending upon the source material, it is possible that as much as 50% of the Factor VIII:C can be in a form not associated with von Willebrand factor. See Amphlett et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,709. The unassociated Factor VIII:C will not be bound by the monoclonal antibodies used in the immunoaffinity step described above, and will consequently be lost in the purification process. To date, there has been no proven advantage for having Factor VIII:C as a product in the uncomplexed form only. Evidence suggests that Factor VIII:C is protected longer from proteolysis by its association with the von Willebrand factor, an important feature when isolating the polypeptide from complex source materials. See Weiss et al, J. Clin., Invest. 60, 390-404, 1977. Hence, instead of being a disadvantage, the association of von Willebrand factor with Factor VIII:C could be beneficial insofar as it may confer stability to Factor VIII:C during the purification steps and may extend the half-life of the polypeptide during its therapeutic administration., 81711=2. Hybrid cell dilutions: for each line use 4 tubes labeled with line's name and marked 1, 8-1, 8-2, 8-3. Dilutions may vary, e.g., 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4. To tube 1 add 0 ml, to others 0.7 ml of RPMI-1640 . Hybrid cells should be healthy and in the log phase of growth. The cells are suspended and 0.7 ml transferred to tube 1 and 0.1 to tube 8-1 mixed and 8-fold serial dilutions are carried out by diluting 0.1 ml from the tube 8-1 into tubes 8-2, 8-3 and discarding 0. 1 from 8-3 tube, so all contain 0.7 ml. Place in 37\ufffd C. bath. It is preferred that all of these dilutions are used for first cloning. The `1` dilution may usually be omitted for subcloning., 76171=Fusion is carried out in the absence of serum in accordance with the procedure developed by Kohler and Milstein. The spleens from two immunized mice are removed by blunt dissection, cut longitudinally, followed by teasing out the cells on a plate into 2 mls of ice-cold RPMI-1640/Glutamine, plate rinsed once with 2 ml of the same buffer to get residual cells, and placed in 10 ml tubes. The debris is allowed to settle out for about 5 minutes on ice and the cells are washed at 4\ufffd C. in 50 ml s RPMI-1640/Glutamine and thereafter suspended in 10 mls of ice-cold RPMI-1640/Glutamine. A count of the cells totaled 2\ufffd108., 77060=The spleen and myeloma cells are mixed in a ratio of about 4 spleen cells to every myeloma cell and brought up to 50 ml RPMI-1640/Glutamine and washed at 10\ufffd C. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet resuspended by flicking the tube. The tube is then placed in a beaker containing 37\ufffd C. water. One ml of 50% w/w PEG 1500 is added gradually to the tube over 1/2 minute while stirring the pellet with the tip of a 1 ml pipette. The mixture is allowed to stand 1 1/2 minutes at 37\ufffd C. with occasional stirring. Five ml of RPMI-1640/Glutamine at 37\ufffd C. is gradually added over a three minute period while stirring. An additional 14 ml of RPMI-1640/Glutamine is added over 1 minute. Followed by 30 ml of 20% FCS RPMI-1640/Glutamine. The cell suspension is centrifugated at 20\ufffd C. for 8 minutes and the pellet is suspended to 1.5\ufffd105 /ml (1.5\ufffd107 spleen cells/plate/20 ml) input spleen cells/ml in 20% FCS RPMS-1640+HAT. Normal mouse peritoneal cell feeders (2.5\ufffd104 /ml) from the same strain as the spleen cell donor is added. 0.2 ml aliquots were placed drop wise in Costar 96 well places (measure out 20 ml/plate). After 7 days 1/2-2/3 of the medium is replaced with HAT+RPMI-1640+20% FCS. Between days 12-28 the medium is replaced periodically with HT & RPMI-1640 & 20% FCS (the medium is replaced when the cells began to turn yellow: -2 days). From day 30 on, the medium is replaced with RPMI-1640+20% FCS., 81456=RPMI-1640, 434 ml, 96643=This example demonstrates that the eluted Factor VIII:C material from the antibody-resin composite is highly purified, although retaining a significant portion of Factor VIII:RP associated with it. A quantity of 1.15 kg of cryoprecipitate was dissolved in twice its weight in water in the presence of 50 uM CaCl2. The pH was adjusted to 6.7 with acetic acid and gradually cooled down to 9.5\ufffd C. The precipitation which formed over a 10 minute period was removed by centrifugation at 4,500 xg for 20 min. The pH of the cold temperature supernate was adjusted to 7.4 with 1M NaOH followed by addition of NaCl to 0.8M, CaCl2 to 0.05M, and a 3.3:1 ratio of Triton X-100; tri-(n-butyl) phosphate mixture to 1.3% (v/v). The solution is referred to below as cryo-detergent solution., 81493=Heat 50 ml of 5% agar solution to 100\ufffd C., and add the heated solution to the RPMI-1640 solution., 83599=6. When discrete colonies appear, clones are `picked` with sterile pasteur pipettes (i.e., the tip is placed over the colony and sucked up using a clean pipette for each colony), and the cells are placed in 150 ul of 20% FCS/RPMI-1640 in 96 well Costar plates., 76821=Myeloma cells of strain P3Ag8653 maintained in 207 FCS/RPMI (glutamine, 2-mercapto ethanol, Gentamycin ) are washed at 10\ufffd C. in 50 ml RPMI-1640/Glutamine and thereafter suspended in 10 ml of room temperature RPMI-1640.}",
