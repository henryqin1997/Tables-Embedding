Additionally, the hybridoma was cultured in mice by the injection of the hybrid cells according to the procedure of Mishell and Shiigi (Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, W.H. Freeman & Co, San Francisco p 368, 1980)., 56142=Anti-(fetal restricted antigen class) antibodies of both polyclonal and monoclonal varieties are generally well known and available either commercially or from publicly available hybridoma deposits. For example, anti-(fibronectin) monoclonal antibodies can be derived from clone samples from ATCC HB 91 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.). Other such antibodies are described in Japanese Patent Application 60091264 (DIALOG database file 351, WPI Acc. No. 85-161617/27) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,867. A preferred procedure for preparation of polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibodies in goats and rabbits is described in the Examples., 104224=Antibodies can be labeled with metallic radionuclides according the procedure of Hnatowich, D. et al. J. Appl. Rad. 35:554-557 (1984) and Buckley, R et al. Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. 166:202-204 (Jan. 1984). In this procedure the antibodies are conjugated with a chelating agent, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), which is capable of forming a chelate with the metallic radionuclide. A suspension of 0.1 mg/mL of the bicyclic anhydride of DTPA is prepared in a dry solvent such as chloroform, ether or dry DMSO. An aliquot is removed to a clean, dry tube sufficient to provide a DTPA to immunoglobulin molar ratio of 1:1 and evaporated under nitrogen. A 10-20 microliter portion of the antibody solution used (10-20 mg/mL) in 0.05M bicarbonate buffer in saline, pH 7.0-7.5, is added to the dry DTPA, and the contents are agitated for 0.5-1.0 minute. The coupled protein preparation is diluted to 0.2 mL with the same buffer solution and purified on a 5 cm gel filtration column with SEPHADEX G-50 gel, using a saline eluant. The coupling efficiency is determined before purification by the addition of \"chelation-grade\" 111 In in 0.5M acetate buffer solution, pH 6.0. Thin layer chromatography is used to separate the DTPA coupled antibody for calculation of the coupling efficiency. The DTPA-coupled antibodies can be stored at 4\ufffd C. until needed for binding with metallic radionuclides such as 111 IN+3, 212 Bi+3 and 68 Ga+3, for example., 35117=This application is a Continuation In Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/274,268, now abandoned, filed Nov. 18, 1988; U.S. application Ser. No. 07/244,969, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,830 filed Sep. 15, 1988; U.S. application Ser. No 7/274,267 filed Nov. 18, 1988 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,440; and U.S. application Ser. No. 07/282,426 filed Dec. 12, 1988 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,270. The inventors of the above-identified applications are ANDREW E. SENYEI and NELSON N. H. TENG. Each of those applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 117593=The positive control (2.5 mL in a polyethylene dropper bottle container) was amniotic fluid containing fetal fibronectin diluted to a concentration of fetal fibronectin of 50 ng/mL in sample diluent solution (0.05M Tris buffer pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.15M sodium chloride, 0.02% Sodium Azide, 5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 500 Kallikrein Units/ml of Aprotinin). This sample diluent solution is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,889 to Jones et al, issued Apr. 24, 1990, which patent is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 77006=A test sample which is to be assayed is removed in the vicinity of the cervical canal and/or cervical os, and the sample is assayed to determine the presence or quantity of fetal restricted antigen in the sample as described. It may also be desirable to determine pregnancy using the presence of pregnancy-indicating hormones in serum or urine. A wide variety of methods are known to a person skilled in the art for determining pregnancy using the blood or urine of a patient. Any reliable method can be used. Procedures for measuring hCG in plasma, serum and/or urine are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,171,783, 3,234,096, 3,236,732, 3,298,787, 3,309,275, 3,485,751, 3,655,838, 3,689,633, 3,862,302, 3,873,682, 3,873,683, 3,833,304, 3,991,175, 4,003,988, 4,014,653, 4,016,250, 4,033,723, 4,071,314, 4,094,963, 4,123,224, 4,123,509; 4,138,214, 4,208,187, 4,210,723, 4,234,561, 4,256,629, 4,268,435, 4,270,923, 4,310,455, 4,313,871, 4,320,111, 4,348,207, 4,371,515, 4,419,453, 4,421,896, 4,493,793, 4,508,829, and 4,665,034, for example. Pregnancy detection by measuring progesterone metabolites in urine (U.S. Pat. No. 3,141,740) or in milk, serum or plasma (Hungary Patent No. T37028, WPI No. 86-023344/04); human placental lactogen in serum or plasma (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,892,841, 4,371,515, and 4,493,793 ); estrogen steroids in urine (U.S. Pat. No. 3,955,928); luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) and/or hCG-like substances in serum, plasma or urine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,016,250, 4,094,963, and 4,320,111); pregnancy specific \u03b21 -glycoprotein (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,065,445 and 4,191,533); LH (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,138,214 and 4,208,187); bovine pregnancy antigen in bovine serum or urine (European Patent Application 188,551, WPI No. 86-042108/06); a new placental protein (U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,863); and early pregnancy factor WO 8605498 (WPI No. 86-264940/40) have been described. Methods have been described for determining pregnancy by adding dyes to urine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,587,221 and 3,226,196, dinitrophenylhydrazine; U.S. Pat. No. 3,595,620, bromocresol purple or chlorophenol red), by an iodine-paper test (U.S. Pat. No. 3,248,173), by adding other precipitating agents (U.S. Pat. No. 3,278,270), by a treatment of female blood with a mixture of acids and sodium chloride (U.S. Pat. No. 3,883,304). Pregnancy may be determined using an assay of a test sample removed in the vicinity of the cervical canal or cervical os following the teachings of U.S. application Ser. No. 121,902 filed Nov. 17, 1987. Any one of the above methods can be used, but methods such as hCG measurements are preferred., 55452=For production of fetal fibronectin antigen and antibodies the procedures described by H. Matsuura and S. Hakomori, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:6517-6521 (1985) can be followed, replacing the tumor fibronectin with fetal fibronectin. A most preferred anti-(fetal fibronectin) antibody is produced by the hybridoma deposited at the American Type Culture Collection and given the accession number ATCC HB 9018 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,326 issued Jan. 16, 1990 to Matsuura et al. That monoclonal antibody is designated FDC-6. Culture of the hybridoma and preparation of the antibodies for use in an immunoassay is described in detail in the Examples., 122528=The assay was performed as described in Example 9 with the following exceptions. The antibody conjugate was goat anti-human fibronectin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs catalogue no. 109-056-059) diluted 1:1,000 in 0.02M Tris, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5.0% BSA, 0.02% NaN. The enzyme substrate was para-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma Chemical Co. catalogue no. 104-40T) diluted in AMP buffer (Sigma Chemical Co. catalogue no. 221). In addition, the samples were centrifuged rather than filtered to remove particulates. For this test, an assay which detected any fetal fibronectin in the sample was scored as a positive test. The results of the tests are illustrated below. ##STR1##, 48432=It is important that the test sample be dispersed in a liquid which preserves the sensitive protein analytes which are unstable in the sampled composition. The storage and transfer medium should prevent decline in the protein analyte level during storage and transport. A suitable preserving solution for storage and transfer consists of 0.05M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.15M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1% BSA, 500 Kallikrein Units/mL of aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 5 mM EDTA, and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,889, issued Apr. 24, 1990. The solution is the most preferred sample diluent solution when detecting fetal fibronectin., 125736=Samples obtained from a therapeutic abortion were tested to verify that fetal materials had been removed from the uterus. The assay was performed as in Example 9 with the following exceptions. The samples were prepared as follows. Samples were collected from products of conception by aqueous filtration through woven cotton into a test tube, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatants assayed directly for fetal fibronectin with no further dilution. A calibration curve was included in the test. The calibrators were diluted from amniotic fluid of known fetal fibronectin concentration to an assay range of from 10 ng/mL to 4 mg/mL. Sample diluent solution was used as the negative background control. The samples were assayed as described in Example 9 using the calibration curve to quantify the fetal fibronectin concentration. A fibronectin cutoff of 0.11 \u03bcg/ml (negative control value plus 2 standard deviations) was used to determine positivity., 108034=Using the purified fetal fibronectin obtained by the procedure of Example 1, mouse monoclonal antibodies to the fetal fibronectin are obtained using standard procedures of Galfre and Milstein, Meth. Enzym. 73:1 (1981) and Matsuura, H. and Hakomori, S. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:6517-6521 (1985), using fetal fibronectin as the antigen for immunizing the mice. The monoclonal antibodies are screened using a modification of the techniques described in the literature, e.g., Lange et al, Clin.Exp.Immunol. 25:191(1976) and Pisetsky et al, J. Immun. Meth. 41:187 (1981)., 44613=The term \"fetal restricted antigen\" as used herein is defined to mean a uniquely fetal or placental derived material, which is either not present in maternal serum, plasma or urine, or is not present in significant amounts in maternal serum, plasma or urine. Any substance meeting this definition is intended to be included within the meaning of the term, including both immunogenic materials and proteins and other substances which are not immunogenic in their purified form but which have unique epitopes which can be selectively bound with antibodies specific or selective thereto. An example of a fetal restricted antigen is the fetal fibronectin which binds specifically with the FDC-6 monoclonal antibody described by H. Matsuura and S. Hakomori, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:6517-6521 (1985). Production of the hybridoma (deposited at the American Type Culture Collection as accession number ATCC HB 9018) which produces FDC-6 antibody is also described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,326 issued Jan. 16, 1990 to Matsuura et al., 53072=The principal antibodies useful in the assays of this invention are IgG and IgM antibodies, although the IgD, IgE and IgA antibodies can also be used if available in sufficient quantity. The antibodies are then affinity purified using conventional affinity chromatography techniques such as those described by Mishell and Shiigi in SELECTED METHODS IN CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY. San Francisco: Freeman (1980), Goding, J., MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE. New York: Academic Press pp 111-114 (1983), and Parikh et al, C&EN (Aug. 26, 1985)., 115759=Anti-human plasma fibronectin antibody prepared according to Example 4 was conjugated with alkaline phosphatase following the one-step glutaraldehyde procedure of Avrameas, Immunochem. 6:43 (1969)., 113232=Preparation of the Hybridoma deposited at the American Type Culture Collection and given the accession number ATCC HB 9018 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,326 issued Jan. 16, 1990 to Matsuura et al, which patent is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 103891=Known techniques using bifunctional cross-linking agents include the following: (a) a one-step glutaraldehyde linkage, Avrameas, S., Immunochem. 6:43 (1969); (b) two-step glutaraldehyde linkage, Avrameas, S., Immunochem. 8:1175 (1971); and (c) dimaleimide linkage, Kato, K. et al, Euro. J. Biochem. 62:285 (1966)., 92882=Procedures for labeling antibodies with radioactive isotopes listed in Table A are generally known in the art. Tritium labeling procedures are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,438, for example. Iodinating, tritium labeling and 35 S labeling procedures especially adapted for antibodies are described by Goding, J., MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE New York: Academic Press (1983) pp 124-126, and the references cited therein. Other procedures for iodinating antibodies are described by Hunter and Greenwood, Nature 144:945 (1962) and David et al, Biochem. 13:1014-1021 (1974) and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,867,517 and 4,376,110. Examples of suitable systems, coupling procedures and substrate reactions therewith are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re. 31,006, 3,654,090, 4,214,048, 4,289,747, 4,302,438, 4,312,943, 4,376,110 and the references cited therein, for example. Examples of other suitable systems are described by Pesce et al, Clin. Chem. 20:353-359 (1974) and Wisdom, G., Clin. Chem. 22:1243 (1976).}",
