Fiber Panel Products--FL2000 VAM System, have not provided adequate solutions to the above-described problems. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a fiber management system which allows each optical fiber to be easily located and removed from an HDT. It would also be desirable if this system limited the permitted minimum bend radius within each fiber to an acceptable value.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in connection with several embodiments, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of various modifications which would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, rather than maintaining the inner fingers and fiber trays as distinct elements, it is possible to form a fiber tray which includes an integrated inner finger. Moreover, it is possible to form a fiber guide which includes extension portions which allow the fiber guide to be connected directly to the HDT frame. FIG. 9 is an isometric view of such a fiber guide 900, which includes extension portions 901-905 which are adapted to be connected directly to frame 300. Thus, the invention is limited only by the following claims. The previously described routing system ensures that the optical fibers are in an unstressed condition when routed through fiber guide 101 and over fiber trays 111b-111d. In a particular embodiment, a multi-fiber cable having twelve individual optical fibers is used to serve each row of ODUs. In such an embodiment, each multi-fiber cable has an integer length, with the longer multi-fiber cables being used to serve the lower rows of ODUs. The furcation tube of each of these multi-fiber cables is coupled to a corresponding lance within the associated fiber guide. For example, the furcation tube of the multi-fiber cable serving fiber tray",
