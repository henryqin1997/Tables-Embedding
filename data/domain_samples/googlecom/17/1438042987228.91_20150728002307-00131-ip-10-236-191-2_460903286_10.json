    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5907=FIG. 2( a) illustrates a representative example of the data structure of the Image Classification Database [1160]. A list of links to each image in the Personal Image Collection is maintained in an Image List [2110]. The data associated with each image is separated into two principle subcomponents: (i) the actual Image Data [2100] which contains information about the nature of a particular image in a user's Personal Image Collection. Examples include base Image Data [2130] about the date, time or place (if a camera incorporates a GPS subsystem) at which a picture was taken; Events & Occasions associations [2120] which link an image with a list of social or personal occasions such as weddings, family gatherings, seasonal events, etc; Location associations [2140] such as the beach, a ski resort or a theme park; Category associations [2150] such as various family activities, work or holiday related picture, hobbies, sports, etc. and (ii) a set of People Data [2200] which contains information about persons who are known to the user. Some of this information may be determined automatically by analysis of images, but much of it will require that the user at least confirm the information which is determined automatically and some information will need to be entered manually. The task of managing this user interaction and associating the recorded information with a particular image is achieved by the Core Workflow module [1110, 1410].}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87291=This application is one of a series of contemporaneously-filed patent applications on Jan. 22, 2004 including application Ser. No. 10/764,339, entitled, \u201cClassification and Organization of Consumer Digital Images using Workflow, and Face Detection and Recognition\u201d; application Ser. No. 10/764,336, entitled, \u201cA Classification System for Consumer Digital Images using Workflow and User Interface Modules, and Face Detection and Recognition\u201d; application Ser. No. 10/764,335, entitled, \u201cA Classification Database for Consumer Digital Images\u201d; application Ser. No. 10/764,274, entitled, \u201cA Classification System for Consumer Digital Images using Workflow, Face Detection, Normalization, and Face Recognition\u201d; and application Ser. No. 10/763,801, entitled, \u201cA Classification System for Consumer Digital Images using Automatic Workflow and Face Detection and Recognition\u201d., 142273=This describes how the information contained in the faceprint database may be gathered over time. However the user of the system may be more concerned with how he or she may access and use this information to add value to an image collection and to facilitate the organization and management of the collection. Thus, in addition to program modules, the system preferably includes a set of image manipulation tools. These include a query module which assists the end user build up database queries based on \u201cidentity\u201d and \u201crelationship\u201d searches on the faceprint database. These queries may be combined with more conventional queries derived from additional image information stored in the database that may include, but is not limited to, image metadata, camera metadata, global image parameters, image color histogram, color correlogram, etc. Thus the user might search for \u201call Summer Holiday 2002 pictures of members of the Sullivan family at the Beach\u201d. The query module will find all such pictures and present these to the user in the browser module. Additional tools which can be incorporated include a slideshow module which assists the user in preparing slideshow animations from the retrieved images; an image enhancement module which implements many of the techniques described in our face tools application(s) to enhance the retrieved pictures and a publisher module which facilitates the generation of Xmas and birthday cards, party invitations, and other fun stuff., 124174=\u201cImage category data\u201d is referred to as a set of user-defined categories for describing a user's personal or other collection of images. Some pre-defined categories may also be provided in the workflow and/or database modules of the software. Much of the data may, however, be user-defined in order to allow each user to chose image descriptors which are most useful and relevant to their own personal image collection. Examples of image category data include: Beach Fun, Ski Slopes, Mountain Fun (holiday categories); Garden Views, Vegetable Season 2002, My Flowers 2003 (for a gardener); Kids Birthdays 2003, The New Baby, Summer Camps, High School Graduations (for a family), and so on. Note that much of this data may be recorded manually, although face recognition data can preferably also assist in linking certain known identities with certain image categories., 269937=Image emphasis and appeal may be determined in part based on a some broad combination of different image characteristics (see, e.g., US patent applications 2003/0048950 and 2003/0059121 to Savakis et. al., hereby incorporated by reference). These image characteristics may include the presence of persons in an image. Face detection is preferably used for this purpose, while alternatively or in addition, a skin detector may be used. Face detection may also be used to determine if one or more people are part of the main subject of an image. Face region normalization and recognition, as well as workflow, are again preferably further included in the overall system. In one application, image emphasis and appeal data may be used to manage the retrieval and browsing of images in a database. In another application, the same emphasis and appeal data may be used to selectively control the compression of an image., 269478=The grouping of images may be automated based on a color correlogram of images (see, e.g., US patent application 2003/0059107 to Sun et. al., hereby incorporated by reference). The color correlogram of an image represents the spatial distribution of color in an image and provides an accurate color signature of an image compared, e.g., with a color histogram which only records the overall distribution of color in the image., 116946=British patent application no. GB0031423.7; and, 268734=The facial detection, normalization, recognition and workflow techniques, by themselves or in any combination of these modules, may be combined with any of various recently developed techniques for accessing, grouping and managing of images in databases. For example, images in a database may be grouped and/or accessed based on some time-based similarity of the images (see, e.g., US patent applications 2003/0084065 to Lin et al., hereby incorporated by reference). The image similarity criteria may be based on an image creation timestamp, a last database access timestamp, or any other image information which is stored or can be computed or extrapolated from other image data stored in the database system., 202586=Those skilled in the art will realize that given 49 distinct classes of pose distortion it will take a large amount of input data to populate each of these distinct face spaces with faceprints associated with known persons. To compensate for this we preferably utilize a prior art technique described in detail in Chapter 7, of MIT Artificial Intelligence Technical Report No. 1574 to Beymer. \ufffd MIT 1996. This allows a multiplicity of views, at different pitch & yaw pose angles, to be generated from a single input image. Note that the techniques employed by Beymer utilize 2-D techniques, whereas we have extended these to use more sophisticated 3-D techniques, and as this operation can be performed in the background we can employ multi-dimensional approaches utilizing, for example, 3-D Active Appearance Models which offer superior results to the 1-D matching technique described by Jebara and previously cited in this section. Following the generation of this multiplicity of views from a single image, a faceprint is obtained for each view, and each of these faceprints is added to the face recognition dataset for that particular combination of pitch & yaw pose angles. In this way, the 49 face recognition datasets associated with the 49 distinct classes of pose distortion are populated at the same rate as would occur when a single face recognition dataset is used., 173924=The set of People Data [2200] includes an ID List [2210] which links each person who is added to the list with a set of Personal Data [2220] and a set of Face Recognition Data [2300]. In the embodiment described here the Personal Data [2220] can also include a set of Relationship Data which is stored in a Relationship List [2230] and describes the relationship between this person and other persons who have entries in the database. It can also include a Group Membership List [2240] which contains information about social groups which the person belongs to, including family, extended family, workplace groupings or social activity groupings. Most of this information will need to be entered manually when a new Personal Profile is entered into the system database. The task of managing this user interaction and associating the recorded information with a particular Personal Profile is also achieved by the Core Workflow module [1110, 1410]., 167282=The image classification engine 1600 includes an image detection module 1620, a face detection module 1630, a face normalization module 1690, a face recognition module 1640 and a database module 1650. Each of these modules of the image classification engine 1600 work in conjunction with the workflow module 1610 in automatic and/or semi-automatic processing of image data. The image detection module 1620 works in conjunction with the in-camera image acquisition process to alert the workflow module that an original image has been captured and initially processed into in-camera image storage 1670. Information from the image classification database 1660 is preferably linked and/or stored with corresponding images, face prints, etc., via connection 1716, into in camera image storage 1670. These stored images are then preferably processed by the face detection module 1630, face normalization module 1690, when one or more faces are detected within the acquired images, and face recognition module 1640 which compares face classifier parameter values of the normalized face regions, or face prints, with archived face prints to discern whether there are matches with known identities. The database module 1650 communicates with an image classification database, e.g., for archiving and recalling face prints, images and related data in accordance with the processing of the workflow module 1610., 88703=The techniques of face detection and face recognition are each being explored by those skilled and a great many advancement have been made in those respective fields in recent years. Face detection has to do with the problem of locating regions within a digital image or video sequence which have a high probability of representing a human face. Face recognition involves the analysis of such a \u201cface region\u201d and its comparison with a database of known faces to determine if the unknown \u201cface region\u201d is sufficiently similar to any of the known faces to represent a high probability match. The related field of tracking involves face or identity recognition between different frames in a temporal sequence of frames. A useful review of face detection is provided by Yang et al., in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 24, No. 1, pages 34-58, January 2002. A review of face recognition techniques is given in Zhang et al., Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 85, No. 9, pages 1423-1435, September 1997., 115997=United States patents no.

No. 6,351,556 to Loui et. al., hereby incorporated by reference). Correlations between histogram information in the two images, or areas within same overall images, video frames or photographs, may then be used as a measure of image similarity. Foreground \u201cblobs\u201d may be separated from background image data using segmentation techniques, and these foreground blobs may be determined to corresponds to images of persons captured within the image data (see, e.g., US patent application 2002/0168108 to Loui et. al., hereby incorporated by reference). Background/foreground similarity of images may be determined, and these can be subsequently grouped into event clusters (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,556, hereby incorporated by reference)., 147996=This metadata can be important for classifying a face based on statistical probability. In particular, Bayesian statistics may be implemented for such calculations based on a-priori knowledge. As a simple example, if Image 1000 is of Jim with good probability, and the next image is of Jim and another person, which could be either John or Jack, based on the a-priori knowledge of the relationship (John is friendly with Jim and but John and Jack are not friends) one can statistically conclude that it is of higher probability that the second person is Jim and not Jack. Of course, more sophisticated decisions can be conducted based on the relationships defined above., 117026=Yang et al., IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 24, no. 1, pp 34-58 (January 2002).}",
