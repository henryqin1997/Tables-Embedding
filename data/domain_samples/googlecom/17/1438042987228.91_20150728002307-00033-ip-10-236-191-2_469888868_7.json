Concentrating the relatively hard and rigid polymeric material in the outer layer 14 increases rotational stiffness and column strength of the tubular member 10. Providing an intravascular guide wire having a shaft with increased rotational stiffness is advantageous in clinical applications requiring 1:1 torque response for precise steering, particularly in tortuous vasculature. In addition, providing an intravascular guide wire and/or catheter 30 having a shaft 32 with increased column strength is advantageous in clinical applications requiring substantial longitudinal force transmission over long distances as is usually required to cross tight vascular restrictions., 22941=This application is related to co-pending patent application Ser.

Accordingly, departures in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as described in the appended claims. As the molten polymer exits the modified co-extrusion head of Wang '665, the rotatable die imparts helical orientation to the outer layer 14 of the tubular member 10 and the rotatable pin imparts helical orientation to the inner layer 12 in the opposite direction. Although not shown, an air passage may extend through the pin 44, which may be used to pump air into the tubular member 10 as it solidifies to help maintain the lumen 16 therein. As the molten polymer begins to solidify after exiting through the modified extrusion head of Wang '665, the biaxial helical orientation imparted to the inner and outer layers 12/14 is locked into the tubular member 10. of the present application, a rotational drive may be coupled to the pin in the co-extrusion head of Wang '665, and a rotational drive may be coupled to the die of Wang '665, with the necessary modifications made to the co-extrusion head to permit such rotation. The rotational drives may comprise, for example, a motor coupled to the pin and die by a chain or",
