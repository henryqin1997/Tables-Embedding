All such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. In addition, it will be appreciated that while illustrated moving along a vertical plane to capture images of horizontally oriented and vertically spaced wafers and wafer slots, the image sensors can be configured to move horizontally and/or vertically. For example, rather than being vertically separated, the images sensors can be arranged on the same horizontal plane, but view the wafer slots from different angles on that plane. Moreover, in cases where a wafer transport module extends horizontally, e.g., where wafers are oriented vertically and spaced horizontally, the image sensors can be configured to move horizontally along the transport module to capture images of the wafers. Thus, advantageously, based upon the foregoing, the wafer loading status of a cassette can be checked without opening the cassette and possibly exposing the wafers to contamination. Moreover, because a mechanism for opening the cassette is no longer necessary, the loading of the cassette can be checked at any point before processing. Preferably, the loading status is checked early after loading a cassette into a processing system, e.g., at the input/output station of the",
