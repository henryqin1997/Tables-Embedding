Through iontophoresis, either positively charged drugs (medication) or negatively charged drugs (medication) can be readily transported through the skin and into the patient. This is done by setting up an appropriate potential between two electrode systems (anode and cathode) in electrical contact with the skin. If a positively charged drug is to be delivered through the skin, an appropriate electromotive force can be generated by orienting the positively charged drug species at a reservoir associated with the anode. Similarly, if the ion to be transferred across the skin is negatively charged, appropriate electromotive force can be generated by positioning the drug in a reservoir at the cathode. Of course, a single system can be utilized to transfer both positively charged and negatively charged drugs into a patient at a given time; and, more than one cathodic drug and/or more than one anodic drug may be delivered from a single system during a selected operation. For general discussions of iontophoresis see: Phipps, J. B. et al; \"Transport of Ionic Species Through Skin\"; Solid State Ionics; Vol. 28-30, p. 1778-1783 (1988); Phipps, J. B., et al; \"Iontophoretic Delivery of Model Inorganic and Drug Ions\"; J. Pharm. Sciences; Vol. 78, No. 5, p. 365-369 (May 1989); and, Chien, Y. W. et al; \"Iontophoretic Delivery of Drugs: Fundamentals, Developments and Biomedical Applications\"; J. Controlled Release, Vol. 7, p. 1-24 (1988). The disclosures of these three references are incorporated herein by reference., 24902=The present application is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/173,149 filed on Dec. 22, 1993, which was now U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,442, a file-wrapper continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 07/831,804 filed Feb. 5, 1992, now abandoned. Application No. 07/831,804 was a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 07/502,232 filed on Mar. 30, 1990, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,894 on Jun. 30, 1992. The specification and drawings of application 08/173,149 are incorporated herein by reference., 119274=As previously explained, the primary electrode arrangement may be constructed for operation as either a cathode or an anode, depending upon the particular application of the principles of the present invention. In general, again depending upon the particular application, it may be constructed for operation as: an \"inert\" or \"electrolysis\" electrode; a sacrificial electrode; a plating electrode; and/or, an intercalation-type (or insertion-type) electrode. Herein, in this context, the phrase \"inert\" or \"electrolysis\" electrode, and variants thereof, is meant to refer to an electrode which does not itself participate in chemical change in the electrolyte solution during operation, but is used as an electrode during operation to generate either hydronium or hydroxide ions in the solution via typical electrolysis processes. Examples of such electrodes are platinum and carbon electrodes. The term \"inert\" electrode also includes an electrode which causes oxidation/reduction reactions, without plating, intercalation, insertion or sacrifice, to effect the electrolyte content of the reservoir. Herein, the term \"sacrificial\" electrode is used to refer to an electrode which is operated to release ions into the associated electrode reservoir during operation at the sacrifice (i.e., non-replaceable expense) of the electrode, for example, a wide variety of metal electrodes operated as anodes would be sacrificial electrodes, typical examples being silver, zinc and copper electrodes. The term \"plating\" electrode in this context is used to refer to an electrode which is operated to plate ionic species in solution at a surface thereof. An example of such an electrode would be a copper electrode operated as the cathode in a solution containing copper ions. During such operation copper ions will be reduced, plating copper onto the electrode. The terms \"intercalation\" and \"insertion\" electrode in this context is generally used to refer to arrangement providing for expulsion or incorporation of ionic species from or into the electrode upon oxidation or reduction of that electrode. An example of such an electrode is the sodium tungstate electrode described in the Phipps U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,747,819 and 4,744,787, supra. Other examples of such electrodes are the iridium oxide electrodes of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,679,572 and 4,717,581; and, Robblee, L. S. et al., J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 130, No. 3 p. 731-733 (1983); Pickup, P. G. et. al., J. Electroanal. Chem., Vol. 220 p. 83-108 (1987); and, Dautremont-Smith, W. C.; Displays, p. 67-80 (April 1982); all of which incorporated herein by reference. The particular, specific, nature of the primary electrode will be dependent upon the particular transport to be conducted.}",

As can be seen, the average rate of delivery (microgram per hour) was relatively constant, regardless of the drug concentration. Steady-state delivery rates were determined for each skin sample by multiplying the steady-state receptor concentration (achieved in approximately 10 hours) by the receptor flow rate, which was calculated from the weight of each two-hour receptor sample. Average steady-state rates for each skin sample were calculated for five consecutive values observed between 12 and 24 hours after application of the current. During the 66-hour duration of the typical experiment, samples were collected continuously at two-hour intervals. The weight of each receptor sample was recorded, and the hydromorphone",
