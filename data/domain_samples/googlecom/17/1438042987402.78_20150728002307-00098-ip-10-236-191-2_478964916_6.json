In conclusion, as pointed out hereinabove, the means forming the centering groove 11 can comprise a groove formed in a recess of the coupling sections such as illustrated in FIG. 5 or can be a separate element such as 31 of another type of material which is mounted in the coupling section. The device of the present invention can be utilized as a customary splicing element for two waveguides such as optical fibers. Since all of the parts of the device only require tolerances within wide limits, a simple and inexpensive production of the device by an injection molding process or by similar processes is possible so that the cost of producing the device as well as the cost of utilizing the device is minimal. In above described embodiment, the optical component was another waveguide which was received in another plug such as 22. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the coupling device 20a is provided for detachably connecting a core 3 of a waveguide 21 in a plug 22 with an optical component 13, which may be either a transmission or reception diode and is supported on a coupling",
