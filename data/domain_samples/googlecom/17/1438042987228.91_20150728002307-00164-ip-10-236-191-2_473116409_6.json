The barrier sheet 28 of the diaper 10 may have the same width and length as the diaper 10 if desired. Also, the elastic strips or members 42 may be positioned 0-2 inches from the side edges of the absorbent pad and the cover sheet 40 may be the same size as the backing 12. Another embodiment of the diaper of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 12, in which like reference numerals designate like parts. In this embodiment, the side dimensions of the backing sheet 12 are smaller than the side dimensions of the cover sheet 40. Thus, the side edges of the backing sheet 12 are located inwardly of the side edges of the cover sheet 40. In other respects, the diaper of FIG. 12 is similar to that previously described in connection with FIGS. 1-4. Another embodiment of the diaper of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 11, in which like reference numerals designate like parts. In this embodiment, the cover sheet 40 has side dimensions smaller than that of the backing sheet 12, such that the side edges of the cover sheet 40 are spaced inwardly from side edges of the",
