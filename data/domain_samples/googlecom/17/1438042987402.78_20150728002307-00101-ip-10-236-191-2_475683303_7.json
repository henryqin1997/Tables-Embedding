    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87965=Reference now should be made to FIG. 5 which shows additional details of the optional port environment for master key 12. As mentioned in conjunction with FIG. 1, the master key 12 may not be used where the CPU is a ROM controlled computer. The master key 12, however, is used for those situations in which the CPU is a general purpose computer 10 used for other functions. The two-way communications link to the RS-232 Port 11 of the computer 10 is first coupled to the DTE/DCE interface 20 which determines the nature of the communications link for establishing the characteristics of signals supplied back to the port 11 on the proper pin. The output of the interface block 20 is supplied to a one character delay switch 22 which, as described above is conjunction with FIG. 4, is used to determine the presence or absence of the identification control character which precedes security messages. The output of the one character data delay switch 22 then is applied to a quad line receiver (such as the Motorola 1489) 24 which supplies the signals to a transmitter/receiver interface circuit 26. The transmitter/receiver interface circuit 26 may be of any suitable type such as the Motorola 6850, National Semiconductor 8250, Intel 8251A, or General Instrument AY-3-1813A. The interface circuit 26 passes signals from the RS-232 port on through the remainder of the master key circuit 12 to the individual key circuits 14 and also receives messages from the individual keys 14 and passes them as output signals through a quad line driver 28 (which may be the Motorola 1488 driver) to the RS-232 Port 11.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the foregoing description and the system illustrated in the drawings are considered to constitute the preferred embodiment of the invention, various changes and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true scope of the invention. The security message format for example can be varied without departing from the scope of the invention and various types of encryption and security checking techniques may be employed while realizing the benefits of the invention. It should be noted in conjunction with the foregoing description that the system does not operate to prevent the copying of the application software. On the contrary, copying of the software for archival or back-up purposes of to permit an authorized user to have copies of the software at multiple locations is encouraged. The software can be operated only when it is operated in conjunction with the single individual electronic key 14 which is associated with it. This key unlocks the software and permits it to run in any computer which is configured to handle that particular software package. Consequently, a user could have one copy of the software at home and another copy at the office. A unique electronic key, however, would be necessary to operate either of the software copies so that the user would need to carry the electronic key from one location to another to operate the software on computers located in those two",
