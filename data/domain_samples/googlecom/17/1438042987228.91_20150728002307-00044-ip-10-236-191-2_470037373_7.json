    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{60785=Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit (VLSI) physical design automation utilizes algorithms and data structures related to the physical design process. A general treatise on this art is presented in a textbook entitled \"Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation\" by Naveed Sherwani, Kluwer Academic Publishers 1993., 83333=An architecture including a plurality, preferably many parallel processors that is especially suited for application to physical design automation of integrated circuits is known as cache coherent Distributed Shared Memory (DSM). Two examples of this architecture are presented in an article entitled \"The Stanford Dash Multiprocessor\", by Daniel Lenoski et al, et al, in Computer Magazine, March 1992, pp. 63-79, and in a technical summary of the KSR1 System prepared by Kendall Square Research, of Waltham, Mass., 1992., 266146=The interconnect controller 518 is preferably implemented by a communications protocol interface unit and router such as described in a technical disclosure entitled \"The S3.mp Interconnect System and TIC chip\", by A. Nowatzyk, Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society HOT Interconnect Symposium, Stanford University, 1993., 81417=An implementation in which the genetic algorithm is executed in parallel on separate computers is described in an article entitled \"WOLVERINES: STANDARD CELL PLACEMENT ON A NETWORK OF WORKSTATIONS\", by S. Mohan et al IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Vol. 12, No. 9, September 1993, pp. 1312-1326. The procedure runs a basic genetic algorithm on each of a plurality of computer-aided-design (CAD) workstation in the network and utilizes an additional genetic operator, migration, which transfers placement information from one workstation to another across the network. Migration transfers genetic material from one environment to another, thereby introducing new genetic information and modifying the new environment., 173215=As described in a textbook entitled \"GENETIC PROGRAMMING\", by John Koza, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1993, pp. 94-101, placements are selected for genetic alteration on the basis of fitness such that placements with higher fitness have a higher probability of being selected. However, it is desirable for less fit placements to be included to prevent the loss of potentially desirable genetic material and premature convergence to local optima., 76273=An expedient for bypassing this problem is described in an article entitled \"A GENETIC APPROACH TO STANDARD CELL PLACEMENT USING META-GENETIC PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION\", by Khushro Shahookar et al, in IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 9, No. 5, May 1990, pp. 500-511. Shahookar accomplishes his goal by utilizing a complicated modification of genetic crossover referred to in the article as \"cycle crossover\". Other modified crossover operations which are discussed by Shahookar are referred to as \"order crossover\" and \"partially mapped crossover\" (PMX).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In summary, the present invention provides a process optimization method that is capable of solving extremely large problems including massive numbers of interrelated variables, and a parallel processing architectural structure for implementing the method. Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof. The interconnect interface 610 is shown as being connected through a unidirectional or bidirectional channel control 612 and a communications channel 614 to the remote node 606. The control 612 differs from the interconnect controller 518 of the DSM node 500 in that it provides protocol interface only, without routing. This enables point to point communications between two nodes. However, the interconnect controller 518 can be substituted for the channel control 612 if connection and routing to a plurality of nodes is desired. The node 600 consists of a memory controller 608 and an interconnect interface 610 that are constructed and operate in the manner described above with reference to the elements 510 and 512 of the DSM node 500 respectively. The node 600 is therefore a subcombination of the node 500. The node 600 does not necessarily include a processor, although a processor can be added, because the node 600 is typically controlled remotely by a processor in a full DSM note 500. Alternatively, by a process (not shown) in the peripheral 602. The local memory",
