In this way it would be possible also to accurately measure the delivery of such inverted flows and therefore the true delivery of air to the engine. It is clear that the above-described device 33 can be changed and modified without departing from the scope of the present invention. Finally, the use of the timer 30 strictly defines the length of time during which the signal is transmitted to the transducers 1 and 2 and therefore eliminates the background noise due, for instance, to undesired electromagnetic connections. Due to the high sampling rate, the device 33 can be used advantageously for delivery measurements in the automotive field, especially in direct injection engines. Indeed, by having the two transducers transmit simultaneously for a length of time such that about 40 ultrasonic waves are transmitted (i.e., for 160 \u03bcsec at a frequency of 250 KHz), and then switching the transducers to the reception mode, it is possible to have measurement times on the order of 400 \u03bcsec, whereas in the known devices it is impossible to decrease measurement times below several milliseconds. The use of the collimator 9 allows delivery measurements to be carried out with",
