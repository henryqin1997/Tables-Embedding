The preceding detailed description of the invention is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Instead, it is intended that the invention be limited only in terms of the following claims. In other applications for the table of the present invention, the table position may be adjusted throughout the procedure in order to optimize surgical access to difficult to reach locations within the patient's body. In one application for the table of the present invention, surgical procedures may be carried out using simultaneous anterior and posterior access. For example, surgeons may be positioned at opposite sides of the table, such as in positions designated P1 and P2 in FIG. 2, and the table may be rotated back and forth to permit one surgeon to perform the portions of the surgery requiring an incision in the chest while the other surgeon performs those parts of the surgery requiring a incision in the back. Each surgeon may select the degree of lateral patient rotation, even 45 degrees or greater, which provides the best surgical access for the procedure. During such procedures, the table may be oriented so that the patient is in a trendelenberg position",
