    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described the basic concept of the invention, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing detailed disclosure is intended to be presented by way of example only, and is not limiting. Various alterations, improvements and modifications will occur and are intended to those skilled in the art, but are not expressly stated herein. These modifications, alterations and improvements are intended to be suggested hereby, and within the scope of the invention. Further, the stimulating pulses described in this specification are well within the capabilities of existing electronics with appropriate programming. Biphasic stimulation as provided by the present invention may be desirable in additional situations where electrical stimulation is indicated; such as, nerve tissue stimulation and bone tissue stimulation. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the following claims and equivalents thereto. In a fourth aspect of the invention, biphasic electrical stimulation is applied to smooth muscle tissue. Visceral smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow visceral organs such as the stomach, intestines, urinary bladder and uterus. The fibers of smooth muscles are capable of stimulating each other. Thus, once one fiber is stimulated, the depolarization wave moving over its surface may excite adjacent fibers, which in turn stimulate still others. Benefits of such stimulation can be realized, for example, in situations where incontinence has been caused by trauma or disease. In a third aspect of the",
