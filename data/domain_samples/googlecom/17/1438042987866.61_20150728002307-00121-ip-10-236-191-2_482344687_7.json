The composite output voltage of the vertical deflection amplifier 72 corresponding to the Y position of the transducer surface S and the sine of the angle \u03b13, and the composite voltage from the horizontal deflection amplifier 78 representing the X position of the transducer face S and the cosine of the angle \u03b13 are added vectorially in the electrostatic deflection cathode ray tube 74. This produces a trace on the cathode ray tube face which corresponds completely in position and direction to the path of the ultrasonic beam produced by the transistor 32 in an object under investigation. The X or horizontal deflection channel comprises components that are identical to those in the Y or vertical channel. Corresponding components in the horizontal channel are identified by the same reference numerals as those in the vertical channel, but are followed by a suffix x rather than y. The only difference between the two channels is that the input signals to the adder network of the x channel are taken from the cosine sliders 22b, 24b, 26b",
