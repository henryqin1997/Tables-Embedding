No. 4,791,652 issued Dec. 13, 1988 and No. 4,811,340 issued Mar. 7, 1989, both entitled \"Synchronization of Asynchronous Data Signals\", there are described methods and apparatus for synchronizing asynchronous data signals for transmission via a SONET communications network. Even using these techniques, however, the waiting time jitter of synchronized DS1 signals can exceed limits which are imposed by existing communications equipment, with which the SONET communications network must interface.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Numerous other modifications, variations, and adaptations may be made to the described embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. Although the above description relates specifically to synchronization of an asynchronous DS1 signal to the SONET format, the invention is not limited thereto but is more generally applicable to the synchronization of any asynchronous signal. In particular, the invention may be equally applied to the synchronization of an asynchronous DS3 signal at a nominal bit rate of 44.736Mb/s into the SONET format for producing an STS-1 signal. Furthermore, the invention may if desired be applied to the synchronization of signals to other formats, for example in producing a DS3 signal from multiple DS1 signals. It has been determined that, in a SONET synchronizer in accordance with the prior art as shown in FIG. 1, the waiting time jitter in the synchronized DS1 signal can be a maximum of about 2.4 UI p-p (unit intervals, peak-to-peak), which is well in excess of the required maximum of 1.0 UI p-p. Using a synchronizer in accordance with this invention and as described above with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the maximum waiting time jitter is reduced to about 0.4 UI p-p or less. Thus it can be seen that the phase detector operates in a fully synchronous manner for both the read and write phases, even though these are asynchronous with respect",
