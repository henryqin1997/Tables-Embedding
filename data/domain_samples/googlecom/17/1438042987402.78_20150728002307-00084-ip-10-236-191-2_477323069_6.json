No. 586,892 filed June 16, 1975 and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. In addition, the use of a compliant membrane for sealing the spring structure in a fluid tight manner is disclosed and claimed in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 599,768 filed July 28, 1975, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 4,021,766 on May 3, 1977. Furthermore, a solid state force transducer with an integral support structure is disclosed and claimed in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 656,636 filed Feb. 9, 1976., 28000=Heretofore, monocrystalline force transducers have been fabricated in batches by etching thin diaphragms out of a monocrystalline silicon wafer. Piezoresistive sensing elements were deposited on the surface of the diaphragm near the outer periphery thereof. One of the piezoresistive elements was oriented so as to detect the radial component of stress in the diaphragm and the second piezoresistive element was oriented to sense circumferential elements of stress in the thin membrane or diaphragm when the diaphragm was subjected to a force, such as that exerted by means of a fluid pressure differential across the diaphragm. Such force transducers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,417,361 issued Dec. 17, 1968 and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,414 issued Sept. 11, 1973. In addition, this type of transducer is disclosed in an article titled \"Solid State Digital Pressure Transducer\" appearing in the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. ED-16, No. 10, October 1969, pages 870-876., 30947=Furthermore, it is known from the prior art to provide a linear spring suspension structure for deriving rectilinear translation of a device suspended from the structure. The suspension system employs a plurality of E-spring structures coupled to the displaceable device in a common plane and in mutually opposed relation, i.e., disposed on opposite sides of the displacement axis. Such a structure is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,295,803 issued Jan. 3, 1967., 30563=It is also known from the prior art to construct an accelerometer from a plurality of E-shaped spring structures so as to achieve rectilinear motion of the sensing mass in response to a component of force applied to the spring structure along the sensing axis. Such an accelerometer or force transducer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,702,186 issued Feb. 15, 1955., 40948=In the next step as shown in FIG. 7, the upper surface of the wafer 11 is reoxidized to form layer 21 to a thickness of approximately 1600 angstroms. The oxide layer 21 is then coated with photoresist material and exposed via conventional photolithographic exposure techniques to a pattern of radiation corresponding to a plurality of piezoresistors to be formed in the surface of the resultant spring structure or pattern 15. Typically, the piezoresistors are generally of the pattern shown in FIG. 9., 29591=It has also been proposed to construct an accelerometer by affixing a monocrystalline silicon beam to a support structure so as to achieve a cantilever spring. A piezoresistive strain sensing element was deposited on the surface of the silicon beam for sensing the stress produced as a result of a force exerted on the beam, such as by acceleration. Such an accelerometer is disclosed in an article titled \"A Silicon Integrated Circuit Force Sensor\" appearing in the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. ED-16, No. 10, October 1969, pages 867-870. See also IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin titled \"Force Transducer\" appearing in Vol. 7, No. 12 of May 1966 at pages 1225-1226.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As used herein, monocrystalline is defined to include an epitaxial layer grown upon a monocrystalline substrate even though the expitaxial layer may not comprise only a single crystal. The advantages of the present invention include the batch fabrication of transducers of the folded spring type which exhibit improved linearity as contrasted with the prior art diaphragm and cantilever force transducers. An accelerometer of the configuration of FIGS. 13 and 15 has yielded an output signal of 20 volts peak-to-peak when tilted through an angle of 360\ufffd relative to the earth's gravitational field. The measured peak-to-peak deviation of the output signal from G sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle of tile relative to the gravitational horizontal and G is the earth's gravitational force, was only 0.1 percent of the peak-to-peak full scale output. Referring now to FIG. 18 there is shown a structure for sealing the spring structure in a fluid tight manner while permitting deflection of the spring structure. More particularly, the silicon dioxide coating 21, which was formed on the top surface of the wafer during the step depicted in FIG. 7, is protected, in the region of the slots, through the various processing steps. In the last etching step, as depicted in FIG. 12 the anisotropic etchant does not attack the silicon dioxide, thereby leaving a thin silicon dioxide web interconnecting adjacent leaf spring portions and bridging the gap therebetween.
