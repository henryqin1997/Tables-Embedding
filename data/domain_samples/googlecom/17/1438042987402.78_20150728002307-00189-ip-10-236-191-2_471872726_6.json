The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. FIG. 8 illustrates yet another alternative view of the anchoring assembly. Rather than have discrete elements of the retention device 18 and anchoring device 20, they may be integrated into a single retention and anchoring device 150, wherein an anchoring device 152 is pivotally pinned 154 to a head portion 156 of device 150. Suture openings 158 can be placed within head portion 156 or in anchoring device 152 for securing a ligament to device 150, rather than with the spikes 160 on the outer perimeter of head portion 156. Device 150 then inserts into securing device 22 within tunnel 12 like that shown in either FIG. 1 or 2. Another embodiment can include having the anchoring device mate to the head portion in ball and socket joint, which allows pivoting of the anchoring portion for self alignment and seating into the cortex of the bone.
