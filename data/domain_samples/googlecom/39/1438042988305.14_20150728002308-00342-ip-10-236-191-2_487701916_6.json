WILBY ANNERS FOR IMAGE REPRODUCTION PERMITTING VARIABLE IMAGE ENLARGEMENT 0R REDUCTION 3 Sheets-Sheet S United States Patent O U.S. Cl. 178--6.7 4 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE In image reproducing apparatus, variable enlargement or reduction is obtained with a drum scanner by sampling signals derived from a head scanning an original on the scanner drum and transferring them to a store at a first rate, and by extracting the stored signals at a different rate and applying them to a reproducing head exposing a photosensitive sheet on the drum. The resultant change in image line length around the drum periphery is accompanied by a dimensional change in the longitudinal direction of the drum produced by corresponding adjustment of the relative rates of movement of the analysing and reproducing heads with respect to the scanner drum, and a pulse generator functions to maintain the desired relationship between the drum rotation, the longitudinal movements of the analysing and reproducing heads, the rate of signal sampling and the rate of signal extraction from the store., 8458=3,541,245 TION NOV. 17, 1970 w.
