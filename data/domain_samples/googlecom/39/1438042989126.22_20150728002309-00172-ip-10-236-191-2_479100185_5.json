[0070] To provide a comprehensive disclosure without unduly lengthening the specification, applicant incorporates by reference any patents and patent applications referenced above. [0069] Having described the principles of my invention with reference to an illustrative embodiment, it should be apparent that the invention can be modified in arrangement and details without departing from such principles. Accordingly, I claim as my invention all such embodiments as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims, and equivalents thereto. [0068] Concluding Remarks [0067] The features evaluated in each stage need not be measures of correlation. For example, one stage may evaluate the similarity between a decoded symbol or symbols from the suspect signal and symbol or symbols expected to be in a watermark message. A statistical analysis may be employed to indicate the likelihood that the decoded symbols represent expected symbols. Based on the similarity measure and/or statistical likelihood, the detection stage provides a detection value that can be combined with a detection value derived from another detection stage. In sum, effective detection metrics may be constructed by combining information from different stages. These detection metrics can then",
