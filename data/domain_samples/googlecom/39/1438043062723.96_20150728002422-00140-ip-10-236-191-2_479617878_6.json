While the present invention has been described with reference to network switches, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the present invention may be applied to any network device have multiple input ports which are multiplexed onto an output port. Accordingly, as used herein, the term network switch refers to a network device which receives data at multiple input ports and provides that data to an output port for transmission over a communication link. Thus, the present invention may include in the term network switch, devices such as routers or the like. Simulations of the above-described source-port level congestion control and link level congestion control have been carried out for a 10 second time interval with an 85% traffic load and a 500 Kbyte congestion threshold for output port queues. Performance of the congestion control was measured in terms of control of buffer occupancy and link throughput. The maximum buffer occupancy results indicated that both link level and source port level congestion control managed to control buffer occupancy. Furthermore, the source port level congestion control achieved a 13% improvement in throughput over the",
