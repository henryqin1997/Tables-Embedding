    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5923=The present biomass processing system may best be understood by making reference to the schematic drawing in FIG. 1, which shows one embodiment of the system. The apparatus of the system comprises a cylindrical reaction vessel (10) having one closed end (11), and one open end (12). A removable cover (13) fits onto the open end, and may be securely fastened to the vessel open end. In the cover is at least one port. An injection lance (14) extends through the port, which is in the center of the cover (15), into the reaction vessel. The injection lance is a tube extending from the port through the longitudinal center of the cylindrical reaction vessel. The end of the injection lance that is distal from the port (16) is sealed. The injection lance has holes along its length that are arranged in a V-shape (17). These holes allow the escape of contents from inside the injection lance into the reaction vessel in an upward direction at about 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. In addition, a vacuum source may be applied through the port to which the lance is connected, thereby creating a vacuum inside the vessel. Attached to the inside surface of the reaction vessel are baffles (18) which extend into the open space in the vessel, and do not touch the injection lance. In the interior of the reaction vessel are free-floating attrition media (19). The apparatus is placed horizontally on rollers (20) that are used to rotate the reaction vessel in the biomass processing system.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{41817=By \u201cdry weight\u201d of biomass is meant the weight of the biomass having all or essentially all water removed. Dry weight is typically measured according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E1756-01 (Standard Test Method for Determination of Total Solids in Biomass) or Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry, Inc. (TAPPI) Standard T-412 om-02 (Moisture in Pulp, Paper and Paperboard)., 74018=Typically a saccharification enzyme consortium is used, which comprises one or more enzymes selected primarily, but not exclusively, from the group \u201cglycosidases\u201d which hydrolyze the ether linkages of di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides and are found in the enzyme classification EC 3.2.1.x (Enzyme Nomenclature 1992, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. with Supplement 1 (1993), Supplement 2 (1994), Supplement 3 (1995, Supplement 4 (1997) and Supplement 5 [in Eur. J. Biochem. (1994) 223:1-5, Eur. J. Biochem. (1995) 232:1-6, Eur. J. Biochem. (1996) 237:1-5, Eur. J. Biochem. (1997) 250:1-6, and Eur. J. Biochem. (1999) 264:610-650, respectively]) of the general group \u201chydrolases\u201d (EC 3.). Glycosidases useful in the present process can be categorized by the biomass component that they hydrolyze. Glycosidases useful for the present process include cellulose-hydrolyzing glycosidases (for example, cellulases, endoglucanases, exoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, \u03b2-glucosidases), hemicellulose-hydrolyzing glycosidases (for example, xylanases, endoxylanases, exoxylanases, \u03b2 xylosidases, arabinoxylanases, mannases, galactases, pectinases, glucuronidases), and starch-hydrolyzing glycosidases (for example, amylases, \u03b1-amylases, \u03b2-amylases, glucoamylases, \u03b1-glucosidases, isoamylases). In addition, it may be useful to add other activities to the saccharification enzyme consortium such as peptidases (EC 3.4.x.y), lipases (EC 3.1.1.x and 3.1.4.x), ligninases (EC 1.11.1.x), and feruloyl esterases (EC 3.1.1.73) to help release polysaccharides from other components of the biomass. It is well known in the art that microorganisms that produce polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes often exhibit an activity, such as cellulose degradation, that is catalyzed by several enzymes or a group of enzymes having different substrate specificities. Thus, a \u201ccellulase\u201d from a microorganism may comprise a group of enzymes, all of which may contribute to the cellulose-degrading activity. Commercial or non-commercial enzyme preparations, such as cellulase, may comprise numerous enzymes depending on the purification scheme utilized to obtain the enzyme. Thus the saccharification enzyme consortium of the present process may comprise enzyme activity, such as \u201ccellulase\u201d, however it is recognized that this activity may be catalyzed by more than one enzyme. Saccharification enzymes may be obtained commercially, such as Spezyme\ufffd CP cellulase (Genencor International, Rochester, N.Y.) and Multifect\ufffd xylanase (Genencor)., 86100=Soluble sugars (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, galactose, arabinose and mannose), acetamide, lactic acid and acetic acid in saccharification liquor were measured by HPLC (Agilent Model 1100, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) using Bio-Rad HPX-87P and Bio-Rad HPX-87H columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) with an appropriate guard columns. The sample pH was measured and adjusted to 5-6 with sulfuric acid if necessary. The sample was then passed through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter directly into an HPLC vial. The HPLC run conditions were as follows:, 31237=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/670,437, filed Apr. 12, 2005., 66898=A processing reactant is injected through a port in the secured vessel cover, and through the injection lance into the reaction vessel. In one embodiment the reactant is preheated and is introduced by spraying through holes in the upper surface of the injection lance while the baffles rotate such that the reactant contacts the biomass as it passes above the spray. The processing reactant may be any composition that is used in a biomass pretreatment process and that is compatible with the material from which the apparatus is constructed. Typical pretreatment reactants include oxidizing agents, denaturants, detergents, organic solvents, and bases, lists of which are provided in US2004/0231060, as well as acids. Some suitable reactants include peracetic acid (Teixeira et al. (1999) Appl. Biochem. and Biotech. 77-79:19-34), hydrogen peroxide (Gould (1983) Biotech. and Bioeng. 26:46-52), sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide (Curreli et al. (2002) Process Biochem. 37:937-941), aqueous ammonia (Kim and Lee (2005) Bioresource Tech. 96:2007-2013), and liquid anhydrous ammonia (Teymouri et al. (2005) Bioresource Tech. 96: 2014-2018). A particularly suitable processing reactant for biomass pretreatment in the present apparatus is aqueous ammonia. Most preferred is an aqueous solution comprising ammonia used in a biomass-aqueous ammonia mixture wherein the ammonia is present at a concentration at least sufficient to maintain alkaline pH of the biomass-aqueous ammonia mixture, but wherein the ammonia is present at less than about 12 weight percent relative to dry weight of biomass, as described in co-pending application CL2825., 55399=The apparatus is made from a generally non-corrosive material that will withstand pressures, temperatures, and processing reactants that are commonly used in biomass treatment processes. Examples of non-corrosive materials include stainless steel, Hastelloy\ufffd, ceramics, Inconel\ufffd, duplex stainless steel, zirconium and carbon steel. Different biomass treatment processes are carried out at temperatures ranging between \u221210\ufffd C. and about 220\ufffd C., with typical temperatures ranging between 4\ufffd C. and 170\ufffd C. Also biomass treatment processes may be carried out at temperatures ranging between room temperature (about 25\ufffd C.) and about 170\ufffd C. Pressures used in biomass treatment processes generally range between atmospheric and about 1200 kPa, with typical pressures ranging between atmospheric and about 310 kPa, and more typically between about atmospheric and 138 kPa. The materials used in a specific embodiment of the apparatus are those that withstand the conditions of the specific biomass treatment process to be used, as is well known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a particularly suitable material for the reaction vessel is stainless steel of schedule 10 thickness that may be used with pressures between atmospheric and about 310 kPa, and temperatures up to about 145\ufffd C. Alternatively, the apparatus may be made of other materials that withstand higher temperatures and pressures, as well as highly corrosive process reactants such as strong acids. These more harsh biomass treatment conditions include temperatures up to about 220\ufffd C., with pressures up to about 1216 kPa, and strong acid reactants such as sulfuric acid. When using these process conditions, materials such as Hastelloy\ufffd) and zirconium would be effective.}",
