However, the enterprise service balancer 1401 has additional capacity for selecting an appropriate resource to process a customer communication on the basis of the medium from which the customer communication arrived in the enterprise service balancing system 1410. For example, the enterprise service balancer 1401 may direct that an e-mail customer communication, which is not an interactive communication, be processed differently by the communication processing applications 1402-1406 than a customer communication that is interactive, such as one arriving from telephony or video streaming. The enterprise service balancer 1401 may extract and analyze customer and resource data from the database 1407 as appropriate., 135447=FIG. 10 illustrates the linking of workpackets in a call parking facility utilized by the enterprise service balancer 401 while attempting to find an appropriate resource to process the call represented by the workpacket, according to an embodiment of the invention. An exemplary enterprise service balancer may have a variable number of associated parked calls at any given moment. For example, an enterprise service balancer may have workpackets 1001, 1002, 1003, and 1004. Each of the workpackets 1001-1004 has an associated call pointer 908 that may be used to retrieve the call associated with the workpacket. The workpackets also each have a resource identifier 1005. The resource identifier 1005 is usually incomplete while the enterprise service balancer 401 searches a set of appropriate resources representing the enterprise to process the call. If the enterprise service balancer 401 locates an available resource suitable for processing the work packet, then the enterprise service balancer 401 provides the identity of the resource in the resource identifier 1005. If the enterprise service balancer 401 has identified a specific resource that is not instantly available, but should be available within a configurable time period, then the resource identifier 1005 may contain an identifier for the resource. If the timeout expires, then an alternative resource will be selected by the enterprise service balancer 401., 137017=The workpackets 1001-1004 may be linked to each other in a worklist 1000, as shown in FIG. 10, but do not necessarily need to be processed by the enterprise service balancer 401 in the order that they have been received. It is expected that there will be many different types of calls each type with different service requirements, and it is the arrival of agents to service these calls, each agent with different servicing capabilities, that determines the order in which calls will be distributed. Accordingly, it is unlikely this will be a First In First Out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) distribution of calls except in the simplest of cases. In addition, the workpackets do not necessarily need to be kept in a linked list but may be organized in another data structure., 74722=FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary enterprise service balancing system 1410 that processes customer communications arriving from a variety of media, according to an embodiment of the invention., 74303=FIG. 12 illustrates additional information that may be retrieved in an exemplary workpacket 1200 processed by an enterprise resource., 98324=A client call arrives at the ACD 102 and is received in the route point 103. The route point 103 directs the call as instructed by the routing program 104. The routing program 104 directs the call to a first enterprise service balancing (\u201cESB\u201d) route point 502. A routing instruction 503 associated with the first ESB route point 502 transfers the call after a configurable time period to a second ESB route point 504. The second ESB route point 504 contains a routing instruction 505 that in turn redirects the call, after a configurable time period, back to the first ESB route point 502. The call continues to be routed back and forth between the two ESB route points until the call is otherwise disposed. Exemplary methods and systems for parking calls using route points in an ACD/PBX are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/060,038, \u201cMultiple Call Handling in a Call Center,\u201d filed on Apr. 13, 1998, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which is incorporated herein by reference., 151832=The enterprise service balancer 1401 receives customer communications from a variety of media as shown. The ellipsis between medium 3 and medium 4 indicates that the enterprise service balancer may process customer communications received from more than four different mediums. Of course, the enterprise service balancer 1401 may also process customer communications received from a smaller number of communication media., 144999=The workpacket 1200 also indicates the urgency of the call. The workpacket 1200 may further indicate when the call arrived, the present time, and the amount of time that the caller has been waiting. The workpacket 1200 may also indicate the customer's last order, its status, and additional relevant information, such as an identification of the agent who processed the customer's last order. The workpacket 1200 may also provide the agent with the caller's preferences., 144304=FIG. 12 illustrates additional information that may be retrieved in an exemplary workpacket 1200 processed by an enterprise resource. The exemplary workpacket 1200 includes the customer's name, the customer's telephone number, the customer's account number, and the customer's level of service. The workpacket 1200 also indicates that the customer has been secured. Security may be provided by requiring the customer to enter a code, for example, and may be satisfied by automated processing before the call reaches the agent. The workpacket 1200 also identifies the client and relevant information regarding the client, such as a corporate motto., 157520=In one embodiment the enterprise service balancer 506 utilizes the ACD 102 to distribute calls to agents while managing service levels for calls and for all other channels such as e-mail, fulfillment (e.g., research a billing inquiry), and fax as in 1402. The enterprise service balancer 506 may control ACD call distribution by making agents 120 available or not-available to receive calls through control of the agent's ACD state, either through 1st or 3rd party call control means. With this control means an agent is always in the ACD \u201cNOT READY to take a call from the ACD\u201d ACD state unless the enterprise service balancer 506 determines that the best work for this agent is to take an ACD 102 distributed call. To receive an ACD 102 distributed call, the agent 120 is placed into a \u201cREADY to take a call from the ACD\u201d ACD state by the enterprise service balancer 506 and the agent will receive a call from the ACD 102. The calls being distributed may either be parked at an ESB route point 502, 504 and are redirected by the ESB 506 to a ACD Skill/Split Hunt Group 106, 107 at the time an agent is made available or after calls are processed by the ESB application 506, the calls are simply parked (queued by the ACD) at ACD Skill/Split Hunt groups 106, 107 waiting for an agent logged into one or more ACD Skill/Split Hunt groups to become READY. In either implementation, it is the ESB 506 that controls the distribution of calls to an agent 120. If an ACD call is not the best work at this time for this agent, then the agent will receive some other non-ACD work. This exemplifies that even an ACD 102 can be treated as a switching system and can be controlled by the enterprise service balancer 506., 150967=The enterprise service balancing system 1410 comprises an enterprise service balancer 1401, communication processing applications 1402-1406, and a database 1407. The communication processing applications 1402-1406 may comprise call-handling and Work Pusher applications such as those shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, as well as FIG. 11. The communication processing applications 1402-1406 may operate with work pushers, with one or more conventional ACDs, or with other similar functioning equipment. The ellipsis between the communication processing application 1405 and the communication processing application 1406 indicates that the enterprise service balancing system 1401 may comprise more communication processing applications than shown in FIG. 14., 142921=The agent (resource) may retrieve a specific parked call for continued processing by actuating the retrieve call button 1104, as previously discussed. In one embodiment, the agent may actuate the retrieve call button 1104 by using either a combination of hot keys or by clicking on the retrieve call button 1104 using a cursor controlled by the mouse 1109. In another embodiment, the computer 1103 may be provided with a touch-sensitive screen and the agent may simply touch the retrieve call button 1104. By actuating the retrieve call button 1104, the agent initiates continued processing of a parked call., 140100=The enterprise service balancer allows a resource, such as the call center agent, to preview a workpacket without necessitating a connection to an associated call (or other work item). Because the agent's own application controls delivery of the call, the agent can preview a \u201cscreen pop\u201d 1111 of customer information and decide whether to take the call or transfer it elsewhere using a transfer call button 1105. The resource may be performing other work at the time the workpacket arrives and decide to send the workpacket back to be distributed to another enterprise resource. The ability to decline workpackets may be especially helpful to back-office agents who perhaps do not normally handle calls and may wish to accept only selected calls. The transfer call button 1105 may also initiate transfer of a customer call to another resource within the enterprise. For example, the resource at the agent workstation 1110 may discover during processing of the call that the call would be better processed by another resource within the enterprise. Accordingly, by actuating the transfer call button 1105, the resource may place the customer call at precisely the best location with the enterprise for further processing. In the preferred embodiment, the transfer sends a notification to the enterprise service balancer 401 to redistribute the call since the agent's knowledge of the best resource may be incomplete., 148366=While waiting for a resource to become available, and if this call is more important than other calls vying for the appropriate resource, then the enterprise service balancer may determine to expand the number of resources that are appropriate to handle this call (step 1319). The enterprise service balancer may determine to expand the number of resources that are appropriate to service this call, including non-human resources such as IVR resources or Voice-Mail for self-servicing. The enterprise service balancer 401 determines the scope of resources based on all competing calls and or other competing work and the manner in which to either increase or even decrease the number of resources available to service the call. This evaluation may include acquiring additional information from a number of different resources and including the customer via an IVR communication. An exemplary method and system for dynamically managing the scope of resources within an enterprise environment is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/247,893, \u201cDynamically Allocating Server Resources to Competing Classes of Work Based Upon Achievement of Service Level Goals,\u201d filed on Feb. 10, 1999, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which has been previously incorporated herein by reference. Once such an evaluation has completed, the processing returns to Step 1315. An ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that this is a description of a process using a flowchart and that the step 1319 may occur independently and concurrently with Step 1315., 131730=An exemplary method and system for establishing preference values and threshold values for service classes related to work items, such as may be utilized in the ESB agent table 800 and the enterprise service balancer 401, is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/149,877, \u201cDynamically Assigning Priorities for the Allocation of Server Resources to Competing Classes of Work Based Upon Achievement of Service Level Goals,\u201d filed on Sep. 8, 1998, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which is incorporated herein by reference., 143598=In some embodiments, parked calls may be parked at a remote location. In the preferred embodiment, parked calls are simply redirected to the telephony device 1102 at the agent workstation 1110. This call transfer occurs through the enterprise service balancer's work pusher (e.g., the work pusher 410 shown in FIG. 4) that supplies the telephony device address to the call parking component at the remote location. In other embodiments, the retrieval process utilizes a centralized ESB application that incorporates this work pusher function to move the parked call to the agent workstation 1110, as would occur for the telephone 644 in FIG. 6., 132924=In addition, the present invention may also operate in conjunction with an exemplary method and system for computing a dynamic component in a composite preference value associated with a work item. An exemplary method and system for computing a dynamic component in a composite preference value is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/248,047, \u201cHierarchical Service Level Remediation for Competing Classes Based Upon Achievement of Service Level Goals,\u201d filed on Feb. 10, 1999, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which is incorporated herein by reference., 147089=Based upon the information that it has received thus far, the enterprise service balancer 401 then selects an appropriate enterprise resource to dispose of the call (step 1313). If database data is not necessary (step 1307), then the enterprise service balancer 401 proceeds to step 1313. In selecting an appropriate enterprise resource, the enterprise service balancer may consult data such as that shown in the ESB selection criteria table 702 shown in FIG. 7 and may also analyze pertinent information regarding resources such as the ESB agent table 800 shown in FIG. 8. For example, this database may contain information regarding the real-time availability of resources. The enterprise service balancer then determines the best available call-receiving resource (step 1315) and sends the workpacket to the selected call-receiving resource (step 1317). If no such resources are available (step 1315), the call will continue to be parked until such a resource becomes available. As previously discussed, the initial screen pop associated with a workpacket's arrival at the resource's workstation may comprise a smaller subset of data than the complete workpacket itself., 121661=The ESB implementation for the call center 640 using the ESB application 611 and the Work Pushers 618, 619 is but one possible design for associating work with a call and pushing the work and call to the agent workstations 605, 606 and the agent phonesets 607, 608. The ESB implementation for the call center 640 is a connected model where all clients are connected over a data network to the ESB application 611 and does not specify any particular means for establishing connections or interchanging or messages across a connection. An exemplary implementation for providing connectionless models where connections are made and broken based on the need for participation, such as might be made by a more centralized ESB application 611, and using object oriented techniques that includes agent-to-agent transfer of calls outside of the ESB application is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/235,065 \u201cCall Center Telephone and Data Flow Connection System,\u201d filed on Jan. 21, 1999, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which is incorporated herein by reference., 74463=FIGS. 13A and 13B comprise a flowchart 1300 illustrating the processing of a call in an enterprise service balancing system 410 utilizing an enterprise service balancer 401, according to an embodiment of the invention., 141578=The ESB client application interacts with the GUI application 1106 to provide the workpacket screen pop 1111 to the resource. The initial screen pop may not necessarily contain all of the information in the workpacket fully displayed. The additional information may be retrieved by the resource as necessary. For example, the workpacket may contain other media references such as optical images. When the resource accesses a work item in a workpacket, the work item may be moved (or opened) and presented to the resource., 132302=Additionally, embodiments of the present invention may also operate in conjunction with a method and system for adjusting the availability of resources (e.g., agents) for performing various types of work. An exemplary method and system for adjusting the availability of resources for performing various types of work is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/247,893, \u201cDynamically Allocating Server Resources to Competing Classes of Work Based Upon Achievement of Service Level Goals,\u201d filed on Feb. 10, 1999, assigned to the Mosaix Corporation, and which is incorporated herein by reference., 137819=FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary agent workstation 1110 for processing workpackets, according to an embodiment of the invention. Resources, such as agents, will interact with the enterprise service balancing system via an ESB client application in the agent's workstation, such as Work Pusher applications 618, 619 shown in FIG. 6. The ESB client application may even be provided to the resource using a browser application. The ESB client application may either be a thin client or a fat client. A thin client comprises a small application that retrieves much of its processing capabilities from a server while a fat client contains greater processing capabilities. Implementing the ESB client application as a browser application somewhat blurs the distinction between thin and fat clients. The agent workstation 1110 includes a computer 1103 having a GUI application 1106, a telephone 1102 and an agent head set 1101., 74148=FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary agent workstation 1110 for processing workpackets, according to an embodiment of the invention., 142133=In typical CTI event-driven implementations, the CTI event arrives and triggers a \u201cscreen pop,\u201d while at the same time the ACD/PBX (or a similarly functioning switch) performs an uncontrolled delivery of the call to the agent's headset. Having two separate systems provide the two items needed by the agent, the customer information associated with the screen pop and the call itself, creates a race condition between the screen pop and the call arrival that necessitates some system for synchronizing the screen pop and the call arrival. The enterprise service balancer 401 eliminates this race condition by directing that the workpacket's arrival occur prior to sending the call to the agent's headset 1101, according to an embodiment of the invention., 150396=FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary enterprise service balancing system 1410 that processes customer communications arriving from a variety of media, according to an embodiment of the invention. As previously discussed, the enterprise service balancing system is not limited merely to processing customer communications arriving from a telephony medium. Customer communications may arrive from a variety of media, such as telephony, e-mail, Internet telephony, Internet communications, video kiosk, and other forms of video streaming applications., 138822=When an ACD agent becomes available, the agent typically actuates a ready button 1107 on the GUI application 1106 using a mouse 1109 or actuates a similar button on a desktop keyboard 1108. In the enterprise service balancing system 410, this agent action triggers a request to the enterprise service balancing system to provide the next workpacket. The enterprise service balancing system\u2014based on the achievement of current service levels across the enterprise and which\u2014if any\u2014work can be handled by this call center agent\u2014will then send a workpacket to the ESB client application associated with the agent's workstation 1110. The workpacket represents the best work for this agent to perform at this time, as determined by the enterprise service balancing system. If the agent actuates a retrieve call button 1104, the ESB client application will then make a request to the enterprise service balancing system to have the call directed to the headset 1101. Of course, the delivery of the call to the headset may be configured within the ESB application to be coincidental with the opening of the workpacket to obtain the parking address of the call and transfer the call to the headset 1101.}",
