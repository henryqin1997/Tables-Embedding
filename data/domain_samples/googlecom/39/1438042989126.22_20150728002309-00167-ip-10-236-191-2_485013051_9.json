    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention provides for like-peripheral devices to be cascaded while unlike-devices are addressed in parallel. Thus, there are multiple short chains of peripheral devices on one chip select instead of one long chain. This improves the address latency. In summary, the present invention uses a microcontroller 12 to provide the address bit and device data start bits for the first PD in a string of PDs in a chain. Multiple chains of PDs operate under control of a single serial output and chip select of the microcontroller. Each chain of PDs has like-peripheral devices. Each PD includes a string of flipflops. The contents of a device status register are loaded into the flipflops. If the complete address matches, then the first PD shifts out the device data start bits for the next PD in the string. The address bit for the next PD is provided by the pull-up or pull-down device hard-wired on the SI of the next PD. The device data start bits for the next PD are provided by right-most flipflops of the previous PD. If the address bit and device data start bits match the contents of the device registers of the next PD, then that next PD enables SYSCLK to shift out the contents of flipflops. As the device control bits are clocked from conductor 14 into the SPI, the contents of the device status register are clocked out and sent",
