One of those directions leads toward a larger system including multimedia inputs from many different sources, presented to a user--or a group of users simultaneously--through a set of system output devices which have a configuration similar to that of an entertainment center or a home theater. This type of personal computer converges the capabilities of previously separate systems into a single system having greater capabilities than the sum of its parts, and at the same time reducing cost by eliminating the duplication of components providing the same function in the separate systems. An example of such a \"converged system\" is the publicly available Destination\ufffd PC/TV system from Gateway 2000, Inc. This product permits a user to enjoy the capabilities of both a personal computer system and a high-quality television system at a lower total cost than that of two separate systems.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any elements or arrangements of elements capable of achieving the same purpose may be substituted for the specific forms shown. This patent is intended to cover all adaptations or variations of the invention, limited only by the following claims and equivalents thereof. During the interval activated by step 510 (indicated by arrow 513) step 520 passes control via exit 521 to blocks 460-480 to modify parameter values for individual devices as shown in FIG. 4. At other times, however, exit 522 passes control to step 530. This step receives the scan code from the button press or other source, and substep 531 accesses from master controller 177 the parameter value indicated by the scan code. Step 540 determines the new value of that parameter, preferably in the same way as does step 470. Step 550 then writes the new parameter value back into master controller register 177, and exits at point 402. FIG. 5 is a flowchart 500 showing method steps for implementing the functions described in connection with FIG. 2B. Steps shared with flowchart 400 are shown reduced in FIG. 5. In method 500, the recognition of a device-selection button press at 411 activates a parameter-set interval at step 510; during this interval, one or more parameters may be modified. One way to define this interval",
