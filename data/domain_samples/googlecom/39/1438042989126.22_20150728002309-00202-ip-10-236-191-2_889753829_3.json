            "Years ago I borrowed this idea from a teacher in the Lower Mainland. Have the students make a 5 by 5 grid and write the Japanese vocabulary currently being studied in squares. Japanese only, no English translations. The teacher then does Bingo by calling out the English words. The students must find the Japanese equivalents on their bingo grid and try and get 5 in a row. The winner is presented with the \u30d3\u30f3\u30b4 \u3055\u307e award in a ceremony infront of the class. I allow the students to hand in the awards for bonus marks at the end of the term.
