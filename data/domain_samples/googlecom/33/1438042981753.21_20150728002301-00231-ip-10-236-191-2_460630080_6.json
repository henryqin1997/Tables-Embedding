    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention as defined by the following claims. In the case of contemporaneous multiple subscriber conferences, a user process module (UPM) local to one of the subscriber stations is activated (56) to select and display other subscriber stations which are to be driven and communicate the necessary input from the input of the input device to the cameras to be controlled. As set forth above, the input device is preferably a joystick but may be a keyboard, touch sensitive screen or similar device. Thereafter, local or remote cameras are selected from input devices local to the user 54. The user then selects through the second channel camera functions 58 and communicates the desired functions to the camera selected 60. Referring now to FIG. 7, the operation of applicant's telecommunication system will be described. At the outset, a video telephone call is originated on a first channel 50, preferably a commercially available telephone transmission line from a subscriber station. A call may similarly be originated over a data channel as well. Thereafter, a second channel 52, preferably the \"D\" channel of an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) transmission system is activated as a normal part of the video telephone call to accept input from the",
