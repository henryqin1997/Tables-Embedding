Further, since modifications and changes will occur, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described herein. The various components are of standard structural shapes and of steel but could be reproduced from aluminum, fibre-glass or the like, therefore rendering the device relatively inexpensive to manufacture and also safe in operation and long lasting. The dimensional characteristics of the exercising machine while in the set-up position are as follows; the height of the framework is in the order of 6 feet while the overall width of the framework is 3 feet to 31/2 feet and the overall depth of the machine is 3 feet to 31/2 feet. As the above dimensions are for the exercise machine while in the set-up position this is an collapsible device for the ease of storage and transporting, therefore, this device when folded up the overall height remains the same 6 feet but the overall width is reduced to only 8 inches and with the horizontal pivoting base leg extensions folded back into the storage and transport position the overall depth is reduced to 20 inches. Another exercise such as curls are performed on the exercise machine 8,FIG.1 by disconnecting cable 72 from the front overhead bar pulley 60 and the S-hook from the weight pull bar 68 chain, the",
