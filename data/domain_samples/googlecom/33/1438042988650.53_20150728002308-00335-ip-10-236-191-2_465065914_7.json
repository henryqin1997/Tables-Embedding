It is anticipated, however, that departures can be made therefrom and that obvious modifications will occur to persons skilled in the art. Referring now to FIGS. 7 and 8, in a fourth principal embodiment of the invention, the user computer 22 communicates through the telephone network 16 with an access billing site (\"billsite\") 45 which regulates all billing for and access to the information service on-line service providers 27. The billing site 45 has an access management computer 12 associated therewith which facilitates access to the on-line service providers 27 and communicates with a billing system 34. The billing system 34 bills access charges to the user's on-line service account 50. When a user desires to obtain access to an on-line service provider 27, he or she is prompted by the billsite 45 to enter a message ID 49 associated with the user's on-line billing account 50. The billsite then provides an anonymous access message 52 to the particular on-line service provider 27 to which access is requested. The on-line service provider 27 may have its own computer 52 which records the amount of time access is made available for any given session. Similarly, the access management computer 12 at the billsite 45 may do the same to serve as a redundant audit trail. The access",
