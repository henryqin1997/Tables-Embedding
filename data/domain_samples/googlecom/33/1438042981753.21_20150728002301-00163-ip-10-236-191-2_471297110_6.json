The construction of the door 12 and its component parts may be carried out using conventional engineering materials normally used for construction of rollup doors and the like. A preferred material for the rub or wear strips 52 is a molded or extruded polymer, such as polyethylene, and a preferred material for the anti-nesting strips 36 is a low density polyethylene. Referring now to FIG. 11, an alternate embodiment of a door closure member rub strip is illustrated and generally designated by the numeral 152. The rub strip 152 is shown, by way of example, mounted on reentrant flange end 14d of guide track 14. A rub strip 152 may be mounted on each reentrant end of each flange of the respective guide tracks 14 and 16. The rub strip 152 is characterized by an elongated leg 154 adapted to be disposed between the flange 14a and the inturned flange distal edge 14d' and is formed integral with a second leg 156 extending substantially normal to the leg 154. The leg 156 is of a greater thickness than the leg 154 and is formed with an elongated open ended",
