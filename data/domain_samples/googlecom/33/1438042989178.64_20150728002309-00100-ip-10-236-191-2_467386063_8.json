    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, it will be seen that this invention provides a system and method for providing the appearance of true poker play, when the game is in fact representing a predetermined outcome based on the result of a drawing from a fixed-pool lottery type game. This is accomplished with the use of a special card called a match card, where the match card, coupled with a bonus, is used to make up any player choice deficiencies when such deficiencies prevent the awarding of the predetermined winnings. This completely avoids the problems found in the prior art, when a player's bad choices are overridden by the machine. A player's choice is never overridden or changed using the present invention, giving the appearance of real poker play. Although the description above contains certain specificity, the described embodiments should not be construed indicating the scope of the invention; the descriptions given are merely providing an illustration of embodiments of the invention. The scope of this invention is determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. The present invention has been partially described using a flow diagram. As will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art and with the benefit of the present disclosure, steps described in the flow diagram can vary as to order, content, allocation of resources between steps, times repeated, and similar variations while staying fully within the inventive concepts disclosed herein.
