Accordingly, this invention is not to be regarded as limited to the embodiments disclosed herein, but is to be limited as defined by the appended claims. Under certain circumstances, conflicts may occur between cache memories. One such conflict may arise during a data return from main memory to a requestor which is monitored by two or more caches. If those caches register hits for the data unit (or units) being returned from main memory, each will set its respective hold line before it has had a chance to examine the dirty status for data at the monitored address. To prevent a conflict, the procedure shown in FIG. 9 is employed. In sum, each cache controller determines if the others hold line was set on a previous clock cycle. If so the earlier set hold line dominates. If both hold lines were set during the same clock cycle, then the cache controller associated with the CPU bearing the lower identification number takes precedence. After either a write back or a finding that a write back is not necessary, the cache tag store is addressed. If there is a hit, a corresponding status bit in multi word transfer register 90 is set equal to one. Subsequently, until N tag store",
