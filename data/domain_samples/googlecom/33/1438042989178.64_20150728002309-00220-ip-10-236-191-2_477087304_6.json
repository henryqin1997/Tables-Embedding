As should be apparent, the blade of a screwdriver, drill bit or drive bar extension is pushed through the axially aligned longitudinal openings in the grommets 36 to attach the work surface light to the hand tool. The present embodiment shows the batteries in an electrical parallel circuit but they could be arranged in a series circuit if desired. A flexible and expandable grommet 36, having a center opening 34, is located within the longitudinally aligned openings in the cap 14 and end plate 30. Although a single lamp may be used, it is more desirable to use two or more lamps to provide more uniform and shadow free illumination of the work surface. The switch 18 is shown as a common on-off, push-pull, electrical switch interconnected between the first electrical surface 16 and the third plate 26 by wires 32. Other electrical switches could be used, such as a rotating cap and switch between the cap and housing 12 to eliminate all projections from the housing 12. The electrically insulating cap 14 includes an inside first electrically conductive surface 16 (see FIG. 5) and a electrical switch 18. A second electrically conductive surface 20 (see FIG. 5) electrically interconnects between",
