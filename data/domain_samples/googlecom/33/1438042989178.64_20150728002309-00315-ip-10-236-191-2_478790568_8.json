For specific details, reference is made to pending application Ser. No. 594,458 filed on Mar. 28, 1984 in the name of Gerald D. Boyd, as assigned to a common assignee. It is important to note that the physical construction (not the electrical or magnetic values or operation) may be incorporated in the construction of the inductor assembly (2). The sole purpose of using this particular construction method is to allow manufacture of an inductor assembly (2) in a small physical form. The ballast apparatus (1) will in fact, operate exactly the same when configured on separate and individual cores. It should be noted that the ballast apparatus (1) conserves energy in two ways. First, it removes the voltage going to the filaments inside the lamps (26 and 27) after they have turned on. Second, it provides more current to operate the lamps (26 and 27) than is currently available from 60 Hz ballast units.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, the appended claims are intended to cover all such equivalent variations as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention. If the ballast apparatus (1) were allowed to establish a resonant frequency, a short circuit through the negative resistance of the lamps (26 and 27) would result. Since the capacitors (14 and 15) are between the inductor assembly (2) and the lamps (26 and 27) in a series circuit, a resonant circuit condition from either direction would cause damage to the lamps (26 and 27). The phase shift of waveform \"C\" combined with the appropriate values of the capacitors (14 and 15) assures that a resonant circuit condition is avoided. The capacitors (14 and 15) also balance the phasing between the inductor assembly (2) and the lamps (26 and 27). At a point in time when the inductor assembly (2) is trying to release as much reactive power as possible, the capacitors (14 and 15) are trying to charge to their fullest potential. As a result, the inductor assembly (2) is pushing power out at the same point in time when the capacitors (14 and 15) are trying to pull power in. The total efficiency",
