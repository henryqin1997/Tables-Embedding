    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described a preferred embodiment of a method and system for facilitating communication between a vehicle and a remote location, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain advantages of the within system have been achieved. It should also be appreciated that various modifications, adaptations, and alternative embodiments thereof may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, the use of broadcast communication networks has been illustrated, but it should be apparent that many of the inventive concepts described above would be equally applicable to the use of other non-broadcast communication networks. The invention is defined by the following claims. The invention may also be used to reduce driver distraction while ensuring that important information is successfully communicated by controlling the time or conditions under which targeted broadcast messages are communicated. Broadcast messages can be received at any particular time by a targeted vehicle, and output only when appropriate conditions are satisfied. This may also more effectively target information of interest to a vehicle operator, and prevent unwanted distractions from messages at inopportune times. Using both audio and visual output for the same or overlapping message data may be advantageous for vehicle operators, by providing critical information in a redundant fashion. Also, interruptions during driving may be minimized by keeping visual message portions to a necessary minimum, thereby reducing the length of messages",
