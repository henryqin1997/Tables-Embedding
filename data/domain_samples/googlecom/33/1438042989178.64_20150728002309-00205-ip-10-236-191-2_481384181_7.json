This terminal strip 59 can receive up to ten plugs 61 on the ends often different light strings, as illustrated in FIG. 6 b. Thus, if each light string contains 100 lights, the power supply can accommodate a total of 1000 lights for a given tree. Each plug 61 is designed to fit the terminal strip 59 but not standard electrical outlets, to avoid accidental attachment of the low-voltage light string to a 120-volt power source. A latch 62 extends along one elongated edge of the terminal strip 59 to engage each plug 61 as it is inserted into the strip, to hold the plugs in place. When it is desired to remove one of the plugs 61, a release tab 63 is pressed to tilt the latch enough to release the plug.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{41069=This application is a U.S. continuation-in-part of International PCT Application PCT/02/07609, filed Mar. 13, 2002, which claims priority from provisional Application Ser. No. 60/287,162, filed on Apr. 27, 2001, now abandoned, and from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/277,346 filed on Mar. 19, 2001, now abandoned., 66587=The PWM output voltage is achieved by switching a pair of MOSFET transistors Q21 and Q22 on and off by the integrated circuit driver U21, such as an IR21571 driver available from International Rectifier. MOSFET transistors Q21 and Q22, such as an IRFB260N available from International Rectifier have very low \u201con\u201d resistance which improves the efficiency of energy transfer. The driver U21 is powered by a charge pump created by a capacitor C30, a pair of diodes D23 and D24, and a current limiter R31. A safety thermal shutdown circuit is formed by a thermistor TH21 and a resistor R25 which act as a voltage divider to the shut down pin of the driver U21. If the thermistor's resistance decreases due to a temperature increase beyond the design specification, the voltage presented to the driver U21 increases above 2.0 volts, which causes the driver U21 to shut down and protects the circuit and the power MOSFETs Q21 and Q22., 79436=Light strings embodying the present invention are particularly useful when used to pre-string artificial trees, such as Christmas trees. Such trees can contain well over 1000 lights and can cost several hundred dollars (US) at the retail level. When a single light and its shunt fail in a series light string, the lights in an entire section of the tree can be extinguished, causing customer dissatisfaction and often return of the tree for repair or replacement pursuant to a warranty claim. When the artificial tree is made in sections that are assembled by the consumer, only the malfunctioning section may be returned, but the cost to the warrantor is nevertheless substantial. With the light string of the present invention, however, the only lights that are extinguished when a single light fails are the lights in the same series-connected group as the failed light. Since this group includes only a few lights, typically 2 to 5 lights, the failed bulb can be easily located and replaced., 77277=The low-voltage output of the power supply may have a voltage level other than 24 volts, but it is preferably no greater than the 42.4 peak voltage specified in the UL standard UL1950, SELV (Safe Extra-Low Voltage). With a 30-volt supply, for example, 10-volt lights may be used in groups of three, or 6-volt lights may be used in groups of five. Other suitable supply voltages are 6 and 12 volts, although the number of lights should be reduced when these lower output voltages are used., 70267=If a wider range of dimming control is needed, the driver U21 can be replaced by another integrated circuit such as an IC2106 along with a PWM controller to drive a fuller range of PWM output voltage. Because the lamp load is a resistive load, the output can be controlled from almost zero light to full light.}",

The tool 250 may be made of metal or a rigid plastic. FIG. 14 ). The tool 250 can also be placed over the bulb 258, with the bulb extending upwardly through an opening 259 in the tool, and with the inner edge 260 of the opening 259 resting on the top surface 253 of the socket 254, as illustrated in FIG. 13 illustrate a separate bulb-removal tool 250 that can be packaged with the other spare parts for a light string. The bases and sockets of such bulbs are typically made to fit tightly together to ensure that the bulbs remain in their sockets and maintain the electrical connections that are made by a tight frictional fit within those sockets. As a result, when a bulb fails, it is often difficult to remove the burned-out bulb for replacement. The tool 250 has an elongated tapered edge 251 that forms a cutout 252 that can be pressed between the top surface 253 of a bulb socket 254 and the lower surface of a flange 256 on a bulb base 257.
