    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55034=The system illustrated in FIG. 1 employs in-situ ellipsometer endpoint control according to principles of the present invention. A high speed ellipsometer, which may be, for example, a Rudolph Research i1000 In-situ Ellipsometer, manufactured by Rudolph Research of Flanders, N.J., employs a polarizer module 46 which conventionally includes a light source, a polarizer, and a compensator to send polarized light through a window 48 formed in one side of the reactor chamber wall. An analyzer module 50 of the ellipsometer includes an analyzer and photo detector receiving light reflected from wafer 10 through a second window 52 formed in the reactor wall and feeds information to an ellipsometer controller 54 which controls polarizer module 46. Information obtained by the ellipsometer controller 54 is transmitted to an endpoint controller 56 embodying principles of the present invention. Controller 56 may be a personal computer or a single circuit board programmed to carry out the method to be described herein, and receives certain information from reactor controller 40., 75485=The graph in FIG. 4 shows delta varying between 80 and 280 and psi varying between 0 and about 90. A starting point of the process is indicated at point 132 on the locus 130. The starting point indicates the delta and psi coordinates with no oxide film on the substrate (bare silicon). A desired endpoint 134 was calculated for an intended oxide film thickness of 100 Angstroms. An unbounded control line 136 generally transverse to the direction of the locus 130 in the vicinity of endpoint 134 is generated as previously described (e.g. perpendicular to the line between points 70, 102 of FIG. 3). During the film growth process measured data points move along the curve 130 in the direction indicated by arrow 138. In this case, to detect the 100 Angstrom thickness at endpoint 134, there is a first sign change of ERROR, e.g. F(Dm,Pm) as the locus crosses line 136. This first sign change is adequate to conclude that a stop point is reached, as will be explained. For a relatively thick film growth or deposition process, the same stop point 134 can be passed several times before the stop point of the process has been attained, because delta and psi repeat over each multiple of a cycle thickness, which is 2748.6 Angstroms for this model., 78360=FIGS. 5a, 5b and 5c demonstrate delta-psi loci of a double layer film model of a silicon nitride deposited on 1,000 Angstroms of silicon dioxide film, which itself has been deposited upon a silicon substrate. FIG. 5a illustrates the locus 150 as an open shaped curve which starts at a point 152 at which there is no nitride film. Data points move in the direction of arrow 154 and have a discontinuity point at 156, at which time the locus continues at the upper end of the figure, at point 158. Cycle thickness for this model is 1866 Angstroms. In FIG. 5a the desired endpoint 160 is 1006 Angstroms. The unbounded control line 164, established as previously discussed, intersects the locus only once per cycle. However, the above described control method will detect a sign change in ERROR at the discontinuity point 156 since the data at this point jump across the line 164 to the point 158 at the upper portion of the curve. A range check, as previously described in connection with FIG. 4, is illustrated in FIG. 5a by box 166. Use of this range check, together with the sign change, will readily prevent use of the discontinuity point 156 (at which the ERROR changes sign) as the stopping point.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as given by way of illustration and example only, the spirit and scope of this invention being limited solely by the appended claims. There have been described methods and apparatus for endpoint control to obtain a desired film thickness which provide superior accuracy, repeatability and control of film thickness in processes for film growth or etching. The described method has been initially employed in film growth processes for growth of silicon dioxide on silicon wafers, employing the rapid thermal processing equipment illustrated in FIG. 1. This method has the unique advantage, when used in a rapid thermal processing method, of enabling control of final film thickness substantially independent of temperature variation. As previously mentioned, particularly for rapid thermal processing equipment, control of the process employing fixed time is highly unreliable because film growth rates are critically dependent upon the actual temperature of the wafer and the ability of the controller to hold that temperature. In a second set of process runs, the apparatus of FIG. 1, employing the endpoint control method described herein, was used to grow 100 Angstroms silicon dioxide film on a 100 millimeter diameter silicon wafer using 0.5 standard liters per minute of oxygen gas under atmospheric pressure conditions. The process, with other parameters otherwise identical, was repeated for 1,100\ufffd C. temperature and 1,000\ufffd C. temperature, with the process run according to the conditions",
