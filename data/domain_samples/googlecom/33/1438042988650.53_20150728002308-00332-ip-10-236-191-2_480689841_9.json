Nos. 6,614,013 and 6,617,560 are all hereby incorporated by reference., 46696=In some embodiments, where the desired light level is a function of more than one ID number, the algorithm call derive the desired light level by interpolating between the ID numbers. The particular ID numbers used in the function will depend on the specific application. In one specific embodiment, for example, a derived desired light level can be interpolated from two ID numbers associated with the desired light levels at 12 p.m. and 3 p.m., where the derived desired light level represents the desire light level at 1:30 p.m.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Specific embodiments of the present invention are presented above for purposes of illustration and description. The full description will enable others skilled in the art to best utilize and practice the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications suited to particular uses. After reading and understanding the present disclosure, many modifications, variations, alternatives, and equivalents will be apparent to a person skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of this invention. Moreover, the described circuits and method can be implemented in a multitude of different fonts such as software, hardware, or a combination of both in a variety of systems. Moreover, the circuits described can be purely analog or a combination of the both analog and digital. Moreover, the circuits described can be linked to other circuits in a network.
