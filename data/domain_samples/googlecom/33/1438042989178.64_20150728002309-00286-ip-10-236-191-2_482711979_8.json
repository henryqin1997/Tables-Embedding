Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. [0055] Use of an LCD device incorporating the wire fixing structure of the present invention is advantageous because wire 55 may be easily inserted and securely fixed between first and second ribs without any additional components, thereby decreasing manufacturing cost and improving production yield. Because no additional components (e.g., pads) are required, the generation of foreign materials may be substantially eliminated. [0054] Further, and as previously described above, the first and second ribs 59 and 60 may be formed from a material such as plastic. Accordingly, when the wire 55 is inserted between the end portions of the first and second hooks 59 a and 60 a, the first and second ribs 59 and 60 may be elastically deflected away from one another, allowing the wire 55 to be arranged between the first and second ribs 59 and 60. Further, after the wire 55 is inserted between the end portions of the first and second hooks 59 a and 60 a, the first and second ribs",
