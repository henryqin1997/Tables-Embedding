    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it should be understood that various changes in form a and detail can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. To provide a comprehensive disclosure without unduly lengthening the specification, applicants incorporate by reference the patents and patent applications referenced above. The particular combinations of elements and features in the above-detailed embodiments are exemplary only; the interchanging and substitution of these teachings with other teachings in this and the incorporated-by-reference patents/applications are also contemplated. While the invention has been shown and described as applied to media signals with temporal components like audio and video signals, a process of down-sampling to facilitate the application of a relatively small and efficient transform could be applied to a other types of media signals such as still images, graphics, etc. The methods, processes, and systems described above may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. For example, the watermark encoding processes may be implemented in a programmable computer or a special purpose digital circuit. Similarly, watermark decoding may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or combinations of software, firmware and hardware. The methods and processes described above may be implemented in programs executed from a system's memory (a computer readable medium, such as an electronic, optical or magnetic storage device). The",
