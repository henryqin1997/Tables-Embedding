This is advantageous where the computer has more than one user and each user has his or her own personalized data image. The DIMS uses a standard coherent caching algorithm (such as described in the standard textbook: Almasi and Gottlieb, Parallel Computing, 2nd edition, 1994, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference.) and implementation to store the cached data images and maintain their coherency with the corresponding master data image. When the LDIM is unable to communicate with the RDIM, the computer in which it is installed can still operate to the extent that the required software and data is cached on the local hard disk., 68661=It is another object of the present invention to allow the DIMS to work with any operating system presently available on the market (including DOS, Windows 98/NT/2000/ME, Unix, Novell, OS/2, BeOS) or any future operating system that supports any of the standard persistent storage device interfaces.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in carrying out the above methods and in the devices as set forth without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. As the LDIM can include encryption/decryption capability, the images can be stored encrypted on the remote persistent storage device and on the local persistent device, if any. That is, before the LDIM performs a write, the LDIM encrypts the data to be written and then writes the encrypted data. Similarly, when the LDIM process a read request, it first reads the data (either from the cached data image or from the master data image) and then decrypts the data before passing the data to the CPU of the computer. A computer including a LDIM can be used by multiple users at different times, with each user's master data image being transparently provided to him. Also, a user can choose which master data image to use. Also, because the physical data image is stored remotely,",
