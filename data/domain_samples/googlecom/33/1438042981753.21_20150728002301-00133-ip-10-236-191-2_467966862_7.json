The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. It will also be appreciated that the present invention provides apparatus and methods for infusing a solution into a body passageway whereby the textured balloon catheter retains its shape while within the body. Likewise, it will be appreciated that because the present invention provides a textured balloon catheter which can be quickly and accurately inserted within the body passageway, the patient suffers relatively little trauma. Additionally, it will be appreciated that the present invention further provides apparatus and methods for infusing a solution such as cardioplegia into the body for use in performing retrograde cardioplegia where right atrial isolation, right atriotomy, and repeated cannulation of the apparatus are not required. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides apparatus and methods for using and manufacturing a textured balloon catheter for infusing a solution into a body passageway, whereby the catheter is held securely within the passageway by a plurality of protuberances projecting outwardly from the exterior of the balloon.",
