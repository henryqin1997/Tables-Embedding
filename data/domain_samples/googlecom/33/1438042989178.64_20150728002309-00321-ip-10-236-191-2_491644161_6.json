From the foregoing, it will be understood that there is an inventive method in the arrangement of the labeled rows of bits, and two trays and the positioning of the trays removable from the base or container in the arrangement ready for high-pressure surgical use. Particularly, when a surgeon is acquainted with the kit, the surgeon will know exactly which bit to select for the procedure at hand. The two trays 13 and 14 can be accessed relative to the base 11, and the necessary assemblage of bit and driving tool can be effected. All items are properly separated until the assembly of two items is made. This permits quick selection and assembly in the midst of surgical procedure. The two trays 13 and 14 are stacked in layers in the box or container 11 to be snug therein by extending throughout the box walls 16. The lower tray has upstanding supports, such as its side walls 21, which upwardly engage and thereby support the upper tray which rests on the surfaces 61 upon which the lower bottom 19 rests. Of course the reverse is true if the tray 14 is the bottom tray, That",
