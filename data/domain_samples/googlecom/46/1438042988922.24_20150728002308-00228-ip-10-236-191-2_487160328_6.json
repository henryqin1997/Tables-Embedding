Arnold Attorney, Agent, or Firm-David E. Dougherty; Raymond W. Green [57] ABSTRACT Oxide refractory materials (for example, aluminazirconia mixtures) can be cast by a semicontinuous process to have an extremely fine crystal structure, by casting a melt of the oxide refractory materials onto a non-reactive, non-melting particulate solid cooling media of a material other than that of the oxide refractory material (for example, steel spheres having a size ranging from about 5 to about 60 mm), additional cooling media beingadded to the solidification chamber while the oxide refractory melt is cast onto the cooling media. The melt is then cast upon the additional cooling media, until the solidification chamber is nearly filled with both oxide refractory material and cooling media. The solidified material, when crushed and graded, has exceptional utility as an extremely tough abrasive grain., 11895=also a composition having a fine crystal structure made BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a semicontinuous process 4 and apparatus for producing oxide refractory material having a fine crystal structure. Oxide refractory materials having a fine crystal structure are useful as refractory grain, or more particularly, as abrasive grain for inclusion in bonded abrasives such as grinding wheels and the like. For such grinding purposes, it is highly desirable for the abrasive grain to have as fine a crystal structure as possible, since this gives toughness to the abrasive grain. Copending, concurrently filed, commonly assigned US. patent application Ser. No. 153,302 filed June 15, 1971 and now abandoned, by W. O. Richmond discloses and claims a process and apparatus for making oxide refractory material, characterized by an extremely fine crystal structure (for example, at least 90% by numerical count of the discontinuous crystals in a two-phase system having a particle size smaller than about 40 microns). While the solidification chamber of the above-identified W. O. Richmond application has no lateral limits in its dimensions, it does, if limited to batch operation with no cooling media added after the initial amount, have an inherent depth limitation, since the oxide refractory melt added to the solidification chamber, while initially passing through the cooling media, is rapidly cooled and becomes solidified. This solidification prevents the passage of additional liquified oxide refractory material. The apparatus and process of the above-identified W. O. Richmond application is therefore, in its narrower sense, essentially a batch operation, since the amount of oxide refractory material which can be solidified in a single chamber is limited by the depth to which the melt flows between the cooling media before it becomes solidified and blocks further passage of melt.}",
