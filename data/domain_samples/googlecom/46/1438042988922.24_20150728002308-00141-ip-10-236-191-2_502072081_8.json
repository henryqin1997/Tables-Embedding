    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to what has been thus far described with reference to preferred embodiments of the invention. Rather, the scope of the present invention is limited only by the following claims: ##SPC1## If T(NP)-T(NP -1)\u2266Tmax, processor 38 proceeds to determine whether a threshold number of detection pulses, NT, has been reached. If NP is greater than threshold number NT, which is typically between 2 and 5, processor 38 generates an intrusion detection signal to controller 40 which operates an alarm circuit as described above. If T(NP)-T(NP -1)>Tmax, the number of detection pulses, NP is reset to zero and the entire detection procedure described above is repeated to detect new pulses. It will be appreciated from FIG. 8B that the change in amplitude between consecutive extrema is generally dependent on the time interval between the consecutive extrema. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, processor 38 determines a time-interval-dependent threshold, VT (TD), based on the predetermined relationship which generally exists between the time interval and amplitude change across consecutive extrema. The time-interval-dependent thresholds may be determined based on a look-up-table stored in a memory of processor 38. If VD |\u2266VT, extremum Vi is ignored and extremum Vi-1 is maintained as reference for the next extremum found in the search. However, if VD >VT, the number of detected pulses is raised by one, i.e. N=N+1. Then, the",
