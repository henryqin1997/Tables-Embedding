Furthermore, the flow cytometry according to this invention, employing a blood sample stained with the above fluorescent dye composition, offers the advantage of expedient reticulocyte quantitation with good sensitivity with a minimum of fluorescent background. Moreover, because the staining is performed with a composition containing the above-mentioned fluorescent dye, the intracellular RNA of reticulocytes is not precipitated and a first-order relation can be obtained between RNA content and fluorescence intensity, thus offering the advantage of providing clinically useful information. As described above, the method of quantitating reticulocytes according to this invention comprises exposing a blood sample stained with a fluorescent dye composition containing TOTO-3 or TO-PRO-3, POPO-3 or PO-PRO-3, YOYO-1 or YO-PRO-1, or",
