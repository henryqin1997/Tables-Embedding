    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14064=The present invention relates to improvements in loudspeakers, particularly dipole loudspeakers, and generally planar diaphragm electromagnetic loudspeakers. These improvements enable the production of low frequency sound of substantial amplitude from a diaphragm of relatively small area. In addition, the invention relates to improvements in a speaker of the membrane diaphragm type which provides full range sound reproduction characteristics, including excellent low frequencies response and three dimensional imaging owing to directionality at frequencies above 1400 Hz, in a speaker of relatively small size., 26781=Another object of the invention is to provide a loudspeaker of the planar diaphragm type in which frequencies above about 1400 Hz are reproduced by a diaphragm of a dimension at least as great as the wavelengths of the produced sound to obtain a distinct separation and directional perception of the sound, thereby providing three-dimensional audio imaging., 13932=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 245,915, filed Sep. 19, 1988 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,784., 24660=In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the respective portions of the diaphragm which produce the bass, mid-range and high frequency sounds are each of a dimension greater than the wave length of the produced sound at frequencies greater than 1400 Hz. This enhances the sound direction perception of the listener so that separation of the sounds from each speaker of a stereo system is greatly enhanced, thereby providing three dimensional audio imaging., 41783=If the wavelength of a reproduced sound is longer than the width of the loudspeaker driver reproducing it, the emanating sound will be dispersed through a wide angle. If the wavelength of a reproduced sound is equal to or smaller than the width of the loudspeaker driver reproducing it, the sound will emanante as a directional beam. This characteristic can be utilized to create a loudspeaker that exhibits selective directionality (above 1400-1500 Hz) for improved three-dimensional reproduction., 28092=FIG. 6 is an illustration of the directional dispersion pattern at frequencies above 1400 Hz produced by the loudspeaker according to the invention; and, 46725=The piston diameter of the loudspeaker which reproduces frequencies at and above 1500 Hz should be 9\" (corresponding approximately to a 12 inch loudspeaker), so that the reproduced frequencies are directional. The lighter the piston, the higher the frequency response of the loudspeaker before high-frequency roll-off occurs. For this example, assume that this 12 inch loudspeaker responds flatly to 4 KHz before roll-off occurs. A crossover network is then used to provide frequencies above 4 KHz to another cone driver which must have a piston diameter of at least 3.378\" (approximately a 5 inch loudspeaker) to guarantee directionality. If this speaker responds to 10 KHz before beginning to roll-off, a crossover network is then used to provide frequencies above 10 KHz to another cone driver, which must have a piston diameter of at least 1.35\" (approximately a 21/2 inch loudspeaker) to guarantee continued directionality. For best results, these cone drivers 202 should be arranged in a vertical row on the face of the loudspeaker 200, so that no horizontal image shifting occurs as frequencies are reproduced by the different cone drivers., 45245=There is shown in FIGS. 6 a polar response pattern for the loudspeaker according to the invention at frequencies of 4, 6, 8, and 10 KHz. In order to provide three-dimensional sound, the operating frequency must be above 1400 Hz. It is noted on the response patterns of FIG. 6 the general steepness of the sides of the patterns and the absence of fringe lobes. These features allow more precise orientation of the speakers relative to the sides of a listener's head, providing extremely wide separation at higher frequency. All of these features contribute to three-dimensional sound output. With the unique configuration of the membrane conductor strips relative to the support opening, the loudspeaker according to the present invention meets the teaching of mandatory directionality of frequencies above 1400 Hz. That is, with played-back sound images from the loudspeaker according to the invention, the images are all in their correct three-dimensional locations including positions out to the sides of the listener, up and down, moving toward the listener's face as well as moving away from the listener's head around and above the head, etc., 42301=The above characteristic dictates that, for all frequencies above 1400-1500 Hz, the loudspeaker driver (or drivers) must have a width which equals or exceeds the wavelengths of the frequencies which are reproduced. For example, if a driver has a width of 3.378\", which is the 4000 Hz wavelength, the driver must be used to reproduce sounds at or above 4000 Hz., 41328=During stereo playback through loudspeakers, a maximum separation of frequencies above 1400-1500 Hz is necessary for accurate reproduction of three-dimensional cues. Wide dispersion of these frequencies by stereo loudspeakers suppresses dimensional cues, while beaming of these frequencies by carefully oriented directional stereo loudspeakers provides maximum separation and a consequent improvement in three-dimensional reproduction.}",
