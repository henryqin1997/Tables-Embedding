    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{103526=The invention also contains a 19\" rackmount, high resolution (800\ufffd1024 or greater) color graphics monitor with standard video inputs for red, green, blue, and composite video. This particular monitor can be configured to operate in either an interlaced or non-interlaced mode at 60 Hz. It can also function to receive an RS-170 video standard or RS-343 video standard. Video display can be set at a 1:1 or 3:4 aspect ratio. The monitor CRT (cathode ray tube) screen is of the short persistence phosphorus type which is preferably for some of the system's functions (for example, flicker-frame and transparent overlays of scanned images). Monitor controls for brightness, gain, and degauss are readily available on the front panel of the monitor. These functions are preferable and it is important that they are readily available to the user. The brightness and gain can be used to vary the apparent intensity of an image appearing on the screen such that it can be easily viewed in various ambient light environments. In addition, the degauss feature is important since the system can be used in various magnetic environments without distortion of the image. The monitor's image is driven by a frame grabber image acquisition and image output board housed in the system's computer. The monitor's RGB and composite video inputs can be looped through the monitor so that video hard copy images can be taken directly from the monitor's output. The monitor also has capabilities of either a high resistance or 75 ohms termination. Such monitors are standard and commercially available., 57067=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/290,316, filed on Dec. 23, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,099,846., 72428=Brain stem and cerebellar maps from the newer Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas (G. Shaltenbrand and W. Wahren, Atlas for Stereotaxy of the Human Brain (2d Ed.); Stuttgart: Thieme, 1977) afforded an opportunity to expand the computer mapping capabilities to include rhombencephalic structures. Incorporating these maps into this system required the development of a coordinate system that would allow the simultaneous display of diencephalic architectonics and the remaining brain stem and cerebellum. Allowance was also required for variations in the angle of the junction of the diencephalon with the lower brain stem. See Hardy, T. L., Koch, J., \"Computer-assisted Stereotactic Surgery,\" Appl. Neurophysiol . Vol. 45, pp. 396-398, 1982, which describes a software modification to the above-noted system described in the 1981 paper to allow a similar use of brain stem maps and describes the development of a brain stem coordinate system. Both coordinate systems could be moved independently of each other; the size of the brain maps, including the brain-stem length, could be readily varied to match the patient's anatomical dimensions as determined from contrast ventriculograms. This was accomplished by developing a method of intersecting an upper (diencephalic) coordinate system constructed about the third ventricular core, with a lower coordinate system constructed about the fourth ventricle. For example, the angle of intersection will be closer to 90 degrees in a patient with a brachiocephalic brain in which brain-stem angulation is perpendicularly oriented. Adjustments for difference in brain-stem sizes were achieved by a software subroutine that could be prompted to expand or contract the digitized maps. As with the above-noted system described in the 1981 paper, this system was not designed to work with newer imaging technology. After the development of high-resolution, color-graphics raster display monitors that could interface with small computer systems it became possible to improve this system. The computer system was later modified so that it could use such a monitor to display CT images as well as benefit from the addition of color graphics. The result was a portable system which could store, manipulate, and selectively display CT images in the operating room independent of the CT scanner. The previously digitized atlas maps also could be superimposed on CT sections of the diencephalon. This method of graphic operative simulation served as a guide for using CT data in performing functional neurosurgery. However, this system had to be programmed separately for each type of scanner. \"Computer Graphics with Computerized Tomography for Functional Neurosurgery, (T. L. Hardy, J. Koch, and A. Lassiter, Appl. Neurophysiol. Vol. 46, pp. 217-226 (1983)), describes a prototype system which could be used with CT imaging technology. This system could simulate probe trajectories but could not determine coordinates. Such parameters had to be entered by typed entry into the computer's program. The system was capable of pseudocolor, but no other image manipulation routines were possible. CT image display was limited to four bits of image capabilities which gave a gray scale capability of 24 (16 levels). This system was fraught with difficulties and the hardware design was subsequently abandoned. Some of these difficulties were also due to the CPM based operating system which was slow, cumbersome and extremely difficult to use as a developmental platform. Hardy, T. L., Lassiter, A., and Koch, J., \"A Portable Computerized Tomographic Method for Tumor Biopsy\", Acta. Neurochir. [Suppl.], (Wien), p. 444, 1983, describes the above-noted system as a laboratory model for simulating tumor biopsy., 69738=Another prior art imaging system, developed by Tyrone L. Hardy, M.D., and others (Thompson, C. J., Hardy, T. L., and Bertrand, G.; \"A System for Anatomical and Functional Mapping of the Human Thalamus,\" Comput Biomed Res., Vol. 19, pp 9-24, 1977) was designed to run on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-12 computer with software written in assembly-level and Fortran IV languages. This system was very large and could not be taken into an operating room. The graphics display terminal, which could be taken separately into the operating room, had to be interfaced with the computer by long coaxial linkages. Its operation was cumbersome but necessary, given the hardware constraints inherent in the computer design. Stereotactic brain maps of the diencephalon were utilized in this system. These stereotactic brain maps were the architectonics by R. Hassler (\"Anatomy of the Thalamus;\" Introduction to Stereotaxy with an Atlas of the Human Brain, Vol 1; G. Schaltenbrand and P. Bailey, eds. Stuttgart: Thieme, 1959, pp. 230-290) and Van Buren and Borke (Van Buren, J. M., and Borke, R. C.: \"Variations and Connections of the Human Thalamus\" (Springer, New York, 1972)), which were digitized for use in the computer. Software routines for modifying the computer displays of the brain maps corrected deficiencies in anatomical sectioning (the horizontal sections vary 8 degrees from the intercommissural plane) and variations in the sizes of the atlas maps (the frontal maps were considerably smaller than the horizontal maps). The coordinate system for the digitized atlas map sections were based, as those of the anatomical atlas maps, on a brain coordinate system constructed about the third ventricular core; that is, an intercommissural line bisected by a midcommissural line and a horizontal line representing the basal plane of the brain. This system was later extensively modified to operate in a much smaller portable computer system by Tyrone L. Hardy and Jay Koch (T. L. Hardy and J. Koch, \"CASS: A Program for Computer Assisted Stereotaxic Surgery,\" Proceedings of the 5th Annual Symposium on Computer Application in Medical Care; Washington, D.C., 1981, pp. 1116-1126), which describes a system which ran on a smaller, more portable DEC PDP-11 MINC computer system with a Tektronix graphics terminal. This system was designed to work with older X-ray imaging technology and not with CT scans, NMR scans or PET or DSA. The system drew map images, simulated probe trajectories and printed electrophysiological data on the display terminal according to various parameters which were typed into certain program requests., 94590=Software, provided in the CPU 34, is preferably structured on a multi-modular bi-divisional foundation, which comprises a division for image acquisition, enhancement and manipulation and a division for graphics and user specific functions. The division for image acquisition, enhancement and manipulation includes modular software subroutines for: 1) image capture, storage, and archiving; 2) pixel analysis for an entire image or user-defined areas of interest; 3) zoom and pan functions; 4) contrasting and filtering images with functions for smoothing, sharpening, and pseudocoloring; 5) image comparisons; 6) image editing; and 7) various edge detection routines, including Laplacian, Roberts, Sorbel, and Frei routines. The graphics and user-specific functions comprise software modular subroutines that control: 1) the manipulation and swapping of diencephalic and brain-stem atlas maps (preferably at least 117 of such maps) in frontal, sagittal, and horizontal sections; 2) the graphic simulation and the manipulation of various probes and electrodes; 3) alphanumeric functions for demographic data and for coding, Storing, and selectively displaying the position of various electrophysiological response points on an electrophysiological map system which preferably comprises at least 2500 electrophysiological response points; 4) measurement functions for determining stereotactic coordinates and other user-specific calculations; and 5) volumetric determinations and two- or three-dimensional simulations.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope of the invention. Through a standard loop-through off of the high resolution color graphics monitor, a standard video thermal hard copy unit is attached for the production of hard copy archives. The user can activate this unit by selecting certain switchable parameters on the front of the unit. The CPU's functions are directed by the user through the use of an infra-red touchscreen which has an input via a standard RS-232 8-bit input-output serial interface into the CPU. The user directs the functions of the unit by pointing at various icons (picturegrams) which are displayed on the monitor's cathode ray tube. The act of pointing at an icon displayed on the CRT screen within the confines of the infra-red touchscreen matrix directs the CPU to institute a predetermined series of programmed functions specific to the user's desires and within the parameters of the then existing software design. The CPU controls all data inflow and outflow through its special software programs. The image display board has 4 to 8 bits of image overlay capability which the system utilizes through its software routines to make composite images, for example, graphic overlays, brain maps, probe, electro-physiological maps, measurements, alpha-numeric data and various calculated parameters.
