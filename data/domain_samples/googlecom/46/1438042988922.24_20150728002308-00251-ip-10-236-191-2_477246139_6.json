    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As understood from the foregoing description, the embodiment described above stabilizes the guide position for the scope 4 and prevents the surface wall portion of the body to be observed from being pinched in the leading end port. The hard ring 10B prevents the leading end port from being deformed, thereby smoothing the insertion and withdrawal of the guide tube 10. Furthermore, the embodiment has an advantage that a position of the guide tube tip can be confirmed by the X-ray silhouette inspection, thereby inserting and locating the guide tube 10 and the scope 4 securely and easily. Furthermore, the leading end port of the guide tube 10 which is not deformed by an internal pressure of the body improves an insertion property of the scope 4, and assures smooth movements of the guide tube 10 along the inserted scope 4 for insertion and withdrawal of the guide tube 10. Since the embodiment adopts not only the ring like convex member 17 but also the hard plastic ring 10B attached to the leading end and the embedded metal ring 16, the embodiment prevents the leading end port of the guide 10 from being opened by an insertion pressure of the scope 4 or expanding force of a bending of the scope 4, thereby providing an effect to prevent the surface wall portion of the body to be observed from being pinched. A condition of the scope",
