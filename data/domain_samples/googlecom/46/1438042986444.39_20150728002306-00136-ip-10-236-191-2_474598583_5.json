    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23557=The number of multiplier vanes 30 is related to the number of scan lines desired. In the United States, for example, the NTSC standard for television comprises 525 lines. Of these 525 lines, up to 42 lines may be used for blanking. Therefore, a minimum television display under present standards would include 483 scan lines of video information. Thus, at least 484 multiplier vanes or some multiple thereof is required for complete display of the video information. Similarly, the device may be constructed with other numbers of horizontal multiplier vanes to match the television standards of other countries. In a display device having external dimensions of approximately 84 cm. by 112 cm., the multiplier vanes 30 are 102 cm. long, about 1 cm. wide, 0.76 mm. thick and spaced about 0.76 mm. apart. Regardless of the number of multiplier vanes, there may be any number of vertical accelerator vanes 32, however, from 1920 to 2220 vertical vanes are sufficient to provide adequate resolution in most practical tri-color devices having 484 horizontal multiplier vanes. In the illustrated embodiment, the accelerating vanes 32 are 76 cm. long, about 1 cm. wide and 0.25 mm. thick.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that although the foregoing structure has been described with respect to a display device that uses an electron multiplier as an electron source, the scope of the invention also includes display devices having other types of electron sources, e.g. an array of field emitter tips, thermionic button cathodes or other types of area cathodes. Since, in the described embodiments, the crossed vanes define a cell of the device, there is no registration problem with the exception of registering the accelerating vanes with respect to the screen lines. Furthermore, since the internal structure is open, the disclosed device can be easily pumped down to a vacuum. Although the foregoing embodiment of a flat image display device is shown with a particular electrode arrangement therein, the basic structure permits many variations in electroding. Different electrode widths, locations and potential distributions can easily be accomplished by variations in the electrode patterns. Since the multiplier dynodes are formed in strips, the multiplier sections of all cells in a horizontal line can be activated simultaneously. The multiplier structure for this arrangement therefore is called a line multiplier. The device is operated by activating the line multipliers on the multiplier vanes 30 in sequence and by applying the appropriate modulation signals to the modulators. The electrons that pass through the modulator are next further accelerated toward the screen and focussed by the remaining electrodes to provide an appropriately",
