The solvent was then removed in vacuo and the resulting residue was co-evaporated 10 times with a Et3 N-MeOH solution (1:1 ) (100.0 mL) to provide a viscous oil after pumping for a few hours. The oil was dissolved in HOAc (10.0 mL) and treated at +10\ufffd C. with Cl2 in HOAc (1.9M) (3.5 mL). After 20 min., the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and after pumping, THF (20.0 mL) was added to the resulting mass of product. After bubbling NH3 through for a few minutes at 0\ufffd C., the reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at r.t. After extraction with EtOAc -25% NH4 OAc solution and flash chromatography (30 to 40% EtOAc in hexane), the title product was obtained as a white solid (0.210 g)., 133421=To a solution of 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl ethanone (2.50 g) in 1,2-dichloroethane (27.0 mL) were introduced the Viismeier reagent (Aldrich catalog, 1992-1993) 3.3M (11.6 mL) and DMAP (1.17 g).

Chem. 1966, 6, 471 ). The thiophene compound IV is obtained from III using the general method described by Weissenfels (Z. Chem., 1973, 13, 57). The thiol compound V can be obtained after oxidation of compound IV (Ra \u2550--SMe) with one equivalent of m-CPBA followed by treatment of the resulting sulfoxide with TFAA at reflux. The sulfonamide group (VI) can then be formed by the method of Kharash (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1951, 73, 3240). The hydrolysis of compound VI and decarboxylation with Cu bronze in quinoline provides compound VII. Compound VII (R4 \u2550H) can be treated with halogenating agent such as bromine in acetic acid to allow the preparation of the 5-bromothiophene (VII, R4 \u2550Br). When it is desired to have a nitrile group at C-5, this can be accomplished from VI via amide formation using the Weinreb methodology (Tetrahedron Letters, 1977, 4171 ) followed by dehydration with TFAA. The CF3 group can be introduced at C-5 of VII via the method of Girard (J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48, 3220)., 107650=The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carder materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.
