    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70648=The liquid bottoms in the cracker, which consists mainly of heavy oligomers and complexes, is cooled by a series of cooling coils (A-6) within the bottom of the cracking vessel to a temperature below about 190\ufffd C. and the cooled liquid is removed from the cracker via line 27 at a rate such that the average residence time of the heavy ends within the cracking unit is less than about 45 minutes and preferably less than 20 minutes. The heavy ends are removed from the process through line 29 or they are recycled via line 27 to the hydrolysis unit 500 and/or to one of the dehydrator stages 200 and 600 via lines 31 and 33 respectively. Materials recycled to hydrolysis unit 500 are passed via line 35 to scrubber 1400 from which the scrubbed hydrolysate is fed via line 37 either via line 39 to the first dehydrator stage 100 or removed from the process via line 41 to storage vessel 1500., 71559=With reference to FIG. 1b, the cracking unit overhead vapor is fed through line 25 to condensor 1000 in which the non-condensable components such as nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, lactic acid, light decomposition products and water are separated from entrained lactide. The temperature and pressure of condensor 1000 are carefully controlled to maximize the condensation of lactide and minimize the condensation of water vapor., 73984=The concentrated lactide sidestream is removed from distillation column 1400 through line 59 to lactide heater 1900 and then through line 61 to melt crystallization unit 2000 in which the lactide is pumped to the top of the unit and flows down in a thin film which cools and forms purified crystals of lactide. The melt crystallization operation can consist of a single such unit or it can consist of two or more units arranged for either parallel or series operation. Uncrystallized lactide residue flows to the bottom of the unit and is removed from the crystallizer via line 63. Crystallizer bottoms (uncrystallized residue) can therefore be accumulated and recycled to the crystallizer unit by itself or it can be recycled via line 65 in admixture with concentrated lactide feed in heater 1900. Alternatively, the crystallizer bottoms can be removed through line 57 and recycled to hydrolysis unit 500 and/or the dehydration units 200 and 600., 62909=The monomer-to-catalyst ratio (molar basis) is generally maintained below 20,000, but usually not less than 500. Good results have been observed when the monomer/catalyst ratio is within the range of 15,000 to 1,000, with the preferred ratio being from 10,000 to 4,000. By employing a monomer/catalyst ratio of 1000 and maintaining a low Acidity Potential, very high conversions can be achieved in as little as 2 minutes. However, when monomer to catalyst ratios of 500 or less are used, the resultant polymer is frequently discolored, contains contaminants and is unstable., 72018=Non-condensables from condensor 1000 are passed via line 5 to scrubber 1100 in which they are scrubbed with lactic acid to remove residual amounts of liquids in the stream. Scrubbed non-condensables, which comprise mainly nitrogen gas and small amounts of water vapor, are fed via line 47 to dryer 1200 in which water is removed from the nitrogen gas via line 9. The dry nitrogen gas is then fed via line 51 to heater 1300 in which the dry gas is heated to 150\ufffd-250\ufffd C. and recycled via line 23 to the oligomer cracking vessel 900. Makeup nitrogen gas is supplied to the process from nitrogen storage vessel 1350 via line 52 from which it is mixed with recycled nitrogen gas in line 51., 94346=To observe the effect of alkali metal contamination on lactide formation by depolymerization, runs were carried out comparing commercially available SnII octoate catalyst containing 3,000 ppm by weight, sodium contamination with a tin octoate catalyst which contained only 50 ppm by weight sodium contamination. Both materials were used at a concentration of 0.5% by weight to depolymerize oligomer having a molecular weight of 1460 (n=19) at 290\ufffd-335\ufffd C. in a thin film reactor operated at a pressure of 10 mm Hg and 6 seconds residence time. The data from this test are given in FIG. 6 which shows that the high-sodium catalyst yielded substantially higher amounts of undesirable concentrations of the meso enantiomer even at the lower temperatures and the meso content rose substantially to over 20% by weight as the reaction temperature was raised to a level of 330\ufffd C. On the other hand, the low-sodium catalyst yielded only about 6% weight meso lactide at 330\ufffd C. These data show clearly the desirability of using catalysts having low alkali metal content and minimizing the depolymerization temperature., 73324=As described above, the liquid heavy ends, which are comprised largely of heavy unreacted oligomers and small amounts of partially formed polymers, are heated and subjected to vacuum in order to flash off lighter oligomers and other residual materials. The vacuum flashing overhead from unit 1500 is then passed through line 55 and admixed with lactide feed to distillation column 1400. The residual heavy ends from the vacuum flashing unit are then recycled via lines 57 and 58 to hydrolysis unit 500, and/or dehydrator units 200 and 600 via line 60 and 62 respectively. Residual heavy ends can be removed from the process through line 64., 61855=The use of melt crystallization processes for the purification of impure lactide is disclosed in copending U.S. Pat. No. patent application Ser. No. 08/231,964, filed on Apr. 22, 1994, by O'Brien et al., 29049=Because of its biodegradability, polylactide [poly(lactic acid)] has become of increasing commercial interest as a substitute for less readily degradable materials such as polyolefins and polyurethanes. The basic technology for making polylactide extends back to as early as 1932 with the work of Carrothers et al. [\"Studies of Polymerization and Ring Formation. X. The Reversible Polymerization of Six-Membered Cyclic Esters\", American Chemical Society Journal, v. 54, pp 761-772]. Nevertheless, the commercial acceptance of polylactide has been inhibited by the high cost of such polymers as compared to polyolefins and polyurethanes. However, as concerns for the environment become greater, the urgency of using more environmentally friendly materials such as polylactide has become correspondingly greater. To meet this urgency, there exists a substantial need for more economical ways of making poly(lactic acid) [PLA]., 50676=Though the precise composition of the catalyst is not critical, i.e., a wide variety of depolymerization catalysts can be used, it is nevertheless quite important that the catalyst be substantially free of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal ions. It is known that alkaline substances have the adverse effect of causing racemization. (\"High-Molecular, Particularly Optically Active Polyesters of Lactic Acid, A Contribution to the Stereochemistry of Macromolecular Compounds\", Makromol. Chem. 30, no. 1:23-38, April, 1959). However, applicants have found that limiting the amount of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal ions in the reaction system, in combination with the use of non-ferrous materials of construction, greatly reduces the effect of other side reactions which degrade both the quality and yields of the lactide., 72724=The condensate from condensor 1000, which is comprised of lactide and minor amounts of heavy oligomers and intermediate lactic acids, is removed from the condensor via line 43 and fed to vacuum distillation column 1400. Optionally, liquid heavy ends from the distillation operation may be admixed with the condensate feed to the distillation column 1400. Distillation column 1400 is preferably a packed column in which light ends are taken overhead, concentrated lactide is removed as a liquid side stream and liquid heavy ends are removed as bottoms to vacuum flashing unit 1500., 75151=The vapor overhead from the vacuum distillation column 1400, which contains lactic acid, water and small amounts of entrained lactide, is passed through line 69 to condensor 1500 in which the noncondensables are removed through line 73 to cold trap 1700 and thence through line 75 to vacuum pump 1800. The condensed liquid from condensor 1500 is recycled through line 71 to either the hydrolysis unit 500 or to one of the dehydration stages 200 and 600.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Surprisingly, reweighing the steel wool revealed that there was no weight loss nor any change in the properties of the steel wool. Thus, there was no corrosion of the steel wool. Nevertheless, the lactide had turned brown and the lactide acidity had increased from 1.5 meq to 166 meq. Analysis by HPLC revealed an 8.7% weight loss in lactide. These data therefore indicate that the loss of lactide was incurred by water generated internally during reaction of the lactide catalyzed by the presence of the iron. A further experiment was carried out in which pure lactide and a small weighed piece of carefully cleaned steel wool were placed in a glass bottle in which the head space was inerted with nitrogen gas and the bottle was sealed. The bottle was then placed in a 120\ufffd C. oven for 72 hours, after which the bottle was opened and the steel wool was washed and reweighed. Example 10 Analysis of the lactides showed that the one derived by cracking in the presence of the chloride-containing catalyst had a high acid level (2,000 ppm) and the above data show a very low yield of lactide was obtained. Moreover, the product was dark in color and had a high odor level. Meso level was low, probably because of its relatively high instability. However, depolymerization using the sulfate catalyst resulted in more than twice the amount of lactide recovery,",
