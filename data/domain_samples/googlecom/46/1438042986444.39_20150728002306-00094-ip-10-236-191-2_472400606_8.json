Further, as compared to prior art computer controller wrapping machines, the disclosed wrapping machine of the present invention is well suited for tie-in with accessory equipment on a 1:1 relationship and is well-suited to be subservient to a process for purposes of controlling article backlog in response to supply rate changes. Moreover, the computer control drive arrangements of the disclosed wrapper are digitally controlled on a machine-timed basis enabling error sensing and proportional corrections in machine-timing so that corrections may occur during acceleration and deceleration as well as during constant velocity operations of the machine. Further, with regard to the control system in the present invention, the disclosed system distinguishes from current commercially available systems because the main drive pulse generator is a 1:1 shaft. This produces perfectly spaced machine-time reference pulses and is preferable to obtaining timing reference pulses by the sensing of flights, dogs or articles which are not perfectly spaced or oriented. The handwheel 84 secured to the shaft 60 allows the wrapper to function in the event the operator wishes to make sole packages while the main motor 52 is deenergized. This is possible since the disclosed computer controlled servo drive mechanism enables the servo slave motors to follow the deenergized main drive motor 52 when the motor is handwheel operated in either direction., 35543=Servo motor 132, serving to drive the crimping and sealing heads of 42 and 44 provides, by means of the encoder 134, a feedback digital velocity signal corresponding to the velocity of one of the input shafts 142 or 144 of the slot drive units 136 and 138. The computer is programmed to compare the velocity feedback signal from encoder 134 with the velocity of the reference signal of encoder 83 to effect control of servo motor 132 such that a 1:1 ratio between the input shafts 142 and 144 of the slot drives 136 and 138 will make one revolution for each advance of a flight 40 of the infeed conveyor 38. Detector 204 monitors motion of the lower cutting head shaft and produces an output pulse for each crimping, sealing and cutting cycle. The computer is programmed to compare pulses it receives from detectors 202 and 204 relative to the infeed conveyor 38 and to control servo motor 132 in such a way as to maintain a preset desired phase relationship between the pulses generated by detectors 202 and 204. In this way the computer and servo motor 132 control the phasing of the cutting head to the article within the tube of packaging material.}",
