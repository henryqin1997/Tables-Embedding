    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25014=This is a continuation of Ser. No. 614,145, filed May 25, 1984, now abandoned., 38997=Since, according to experience, approximately 1000 pulses are needed for destruction of a kidney stone, this means an actual treatment period of less than two minutes., 35394=Another dimension of importance for the configuration of the spheroidal cap is the apex angle \u03b1 of the spherical sector between the cap and the focal point. This angle determines the degree of reduction of the sonic intensity with increasing distance from the focal point and is thus essential regarding the degree of risk to the surrounding tissues. Since it is unavoidable that a positive pressure surge is always followed by a negative pressure surge which for its part may generate cavitation and thereby may injure the tissue, it is necessary to undertake an evaluation at this juncture. As the frequency increases, the cavitation threshold rises very steeply above 100 kHz. It amounts to 10 bar at 100 kHz, 30 bar at 200 kHz, 200 bar at 500 kHz. At a height of 5 mms of the ceramic elements 7, the fundamental frequency of the transmitter is approximately 500 kHz. The oscillator is consequently intended for a pulse length of one microsecond. Assuming that the shock wave peak pressure amounts to 1000 bar in the focal plane in the negative pressure stage, and assuming an apex angle of 60\ufffd, it will still amount to approximately 200 bar at a distance from the focal plane of 10 mm in axial direction, but only 40 bar at a distance of 50 mm. Tissue damage caused by cavitation should thus no longer be expected even at a distance of 10 mm from the focal point., 26850=A second known possibility consists in making use of ultrasonic transducers as sound sources, which either have the form of spheroidal caps or are focussed by application of lens systems. However, the greatest difficulty during application of ultrasonic transmitters consists in securing the high energy densities required. According to experience, pressure amplitudes of the order of magnitude of 2000 bar are needed for destruction of concretions. Lens systems are hardly applicable for this reason, because reflection and absorption in the lens material cause excessive losses. Ultrasonic transducers in the form of spheroidal caps are satisfactorily appropriate for the continuous emission of ultrasonic oscillation, but the application of continuous ultrasonic oscillation to a concretion formed within the body is impossible because burning of normal healthy body tissue in the vicinity of the concretion would be unavoidable at the high energy density required. In principle, shock waves may also be generated with ultrasonic transducers in the form of spheroidal caps, but this presupposes an extremely high load-bearing capacity of the transducer elements because the resonance increase of the oscillation amplitude occurring during continual energisation cannot be exploited whilst doing so. Ultrasonic transducers in the form of spheroidal caps are commonly produced as piezoceramic appliances, e.g. based on barium titanate, by being pressed into shape, sintered and then polarised radially. Since the variation in the thickness of the material caused by the action of the electrical charge applied is always combined with a transverse contraction at the same time, such spheroidal ceramic caps are destroyed very rapidly during pulse excitation at high voltages. Special measures are needed for this reason, to secure the high load-bearing capacity required., 38580=A pulse of 2000 bar and a duration of one microsecond over a cross-section of 10 mm2 corresponds to work of no more than approximately 0.3 watts-seconds.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be appreciated that modifications and variations may be made to the embodiment herein described without departing from the scope of the invention. In the case of large concretions, sonic action should not be continued until complete destruction of the concretion has been obtained, since the risk arises that excessive quantities of dust or granulate could clog the natural outlets. A repetition of the treatment at adequate intervals of time is indicated in such cases. The apparatus suspended from a stand in such manner as to be movable in all three directions has its rubber diaphragm placed on the skin of the patient and coupled to the same via a film of liquid between the skin and diaphragm. No air bubbles may be included between the diaphragm and skin whilst doing so. It is assured that the diaphragm is in contact with the skin, throughout the area of the radiation cross-section, by means for obtaining appropriate liquid pressure (height adjustment of the compensator vessel 1). The apparatus is adjusted by means of the echo pulse location method in such a manner that the concretion lies at the focal point. The first shock wave treatment may thereupon be begun. Another locating action should occur after a treatment of a few seconds, a result possibly already secured being detectable whilst doing so, from the change in shape and amplitude of the reflected signal. Treatment is continued after",
