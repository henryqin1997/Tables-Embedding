Thus, for example, the compounds of formula (III) can be prepared in the manner described in co-pending U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 823,308, filed 8/10/1977, by reacting 4-R-cyclohexanone with phenyl magnesium bromide and hydrogenating the cis-trans-isomeric 4-R-1-phenylcyclohexanols obtained after hydrolysis, with inversion or retention, after isomer separation, to the trans-4-R-1-phenylcyclohexane; reacting to this in the presence of aluminum chloride with acetyl chloride to form the 4-(trans-4-R-cyclohexyl)-acetophenone and oxidizing this acetophenone with hypohalite to the benzoic acid (III)., 43171=(b) 15 g of trans-trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl-cyclohexane-4'-carboxylic acid are heated to the boil for 20 minutes with 36 g of thionyl chloride; subsequently, the excess thionyl chloride is distilled off, finally under reduced pressure. The trans-trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl-cyclohexane-4'-carboxylic acid chloride obtained is dissolved in 450 ml of dioxane and mixed, while cooling with ice, with 180 ml of 25% aqueous ammonia solution. After stirring for one hour, the reaction mixture is poured onto 2000 g of ice. The precipitated trans-trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexylcyclohexane-4'-carboxylic acid amide is filtered off and recrystallized from ethanol; m.p. 215\ufffd-218\ufffd., 46564=(a) A solution of 100 g of 4-hydroxy-biphenyl-4'-carboxylic acid in 1000 ml of acetic acid is hydrogenated in the presence of 10 g of platinum oxide at room temperature and normal pressure for 16 hours. Subsequently, it is filtered off from the catalyst, evaporated and the residue heated to the boil in 500 ml of tert-butanol in the presence of 150 g of potassium tert-butylate. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture is poured onto 1000 g of ice, neutralized with 10% sulphuric acid and extracted twice with 500 ml of amounts of diethyl ether. The ether extract is dried over sodium sulphate, evaporated and the residue taken up in 500 ml of boiling methanol. The hot solution obtained is poured into a boiling solution of 200 g of thiourea in 800 ml of methanol. After 30 minutes, the mixture is cooled to 0\ufffd, and the thiourea inclusion compound crystallizing out is filtered off and boiled out with 1000 ml of petroleum ether (b.p. 40\ufffd-60\ufffd). The undissolved residue is heated to 50\ufffd from 30 minutes with 1000 ml of aqueous 2 N aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. The solution obtained is acidified with 10% sulphuric acid after cooling and the precipitated trans-trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl-cyclohexane-4'-carboxylic acid is filtered off and recrystallized from petroleum benzine (b.p. 50\ufffd-70\ufffd)., 42091=(a) 36.4 g of 4-(trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl)-benzoic acid (prepared according to Example 1 of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 823,308, filed Aug. 10, 1977, by reaction of phenyl magnesium bromide with 4-n-pentylcyclohexanone and subsequent hydrolysis, hydrogenation, acetylation and oxidation) are hydrogenated in 500 ml of glacial acetic acid in the presence of 5 g of platinum oxide at room temperature and under a pressure of 3 bars. The hydrogen uptake is ended after 8 hours. After filtering off the solvent and evaporation, the residue is heated to boiling with 120 g of thionyl chloride for 16 hours. Subsequently, the excess thionyl chloride is distilled off and the residue poured into 500 ml of water. The aqueous mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 50\ufffd and then extracted twice with 200 ml amounts of diethyl ether. The extracts are dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated. The trans-trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl-cyclohexane-4'-carboxylic acid remaining behind is recrystallized from petroleum benzine (b.p. 50\ufffd-70\ufffd ); m.p. 220\ufffd, c.p. 245\ufffd.}",
