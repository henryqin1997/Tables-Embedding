This arrangement can secure the visibility of the catheter tip and can be used with balloon catheters, aspiration catheters, guide catheters, angiographic catheters, imaging catheters, and in general with any kind of catheter. The positioning of the marker according to the preset invention at the catheter tip enhances the flexibility and the softness of the catheter tip to prevent the wall of the body vessels from being injured. FIG. 6 According to one embodiment, catheter 1 may comprise catheter tip 20 equipped with marker 21, as shown in Moreover, the before-explained catheter 1 may comprise a catheter tip being equipped with one marker. This arrangement can secure the visibility of the catheter tip and can be used with balloon catheters, aspiration catheters, guide catheters, angiographic catheters, imaging catheters, and in general with any kind of catheter. depicts tube 2 in a bent state. The inner part 18 of the wire marker 10 or 11 is compressed in this state while the outer part 19 of marker 10 is expanded thus ensuring a higher flexibility and trackability of the catheter 1 according to the present invention. FIG. 5 shows a particularly advantageous embodiment of the marker 10 (or, of course, also of marker 11) comprising two layers",
