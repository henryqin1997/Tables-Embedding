Illustratively, the interior of sound chamber 140 is lined with a damping foil like the 3M Company's damping foil number 2552, for example. Sound chamber 140 dampens vibration energy produced by these components, as well as assists in dissipating heat they generated.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the foregoing apparatus has been described, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of the apparatus, and various changes and modifications may be made to adapt the various uses and characteristics without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure, as described by the claims which follow. Side panels 714, 716 include buttons 726, 728 to assist the caregiver in placing canister 26 in the proper location within cavity 9. Illustratively, buttons 726, 728 are small protrusions, each extending from a side panel. Each button 726, 728 is configured to be received or \u201csnapped\u201d into corresponding dimples 730, 732, respectively, disposed in walls 706, 710, respectively. In the illustrated embodiment, the buttons extend from the widest point of side panels 714, 716 of canister 26. Each of top and bottom panel 718, 720 of canister 26 includes a boss 722, 724, respectively. Each boss 722, 724 is configured to engage a sensor such as sensor 116, 118, respectively, as depicted in FIG. 2. This engagement provides a signal to controller 50 indicating that canister 26 is seated properly into cavity 9 and the vacuum therapy treatment may begin to be administered. It is contemplated that bosses 722, 724 can be mechanical sensors, optical, capacitive or other similar type sensors.
