For example, the accelerated user interface also applies to cameras having only two modes, but that have multiple navigation screens within the \u201cplay mode\u201d Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. A method and system for accelerating the user interface of an image capture device has been disclosed. Through the present invention, the user interface is accelerated when accessing captured images through interaction of various features. In a first enhancement, as has been described above, an enhance image file is created for each image that contains a combination of a thumbnail, a screennail, and a full resolution compressed image. Through the use of the enhanced image file, the user interface in review mode is accelerated because the thumbnails can be displayed quickly; and the user may easily recognize images by providing a larger resized thumbnail on the display. In a another enhancement of the present invention, the user interface in play mode is accelerated by displaying the reduced resolution screennail image first and then updating it with higher resolution compressed image so that",
