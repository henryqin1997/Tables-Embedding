As shown in FIG. 1, the light source unit 100, a cylindrical lens unit 201, a polygonal mirror unit 300, a first f\u03b8 lens 400, a second f\u03b8 lens 500 and third f\u03b8 lens groups 600A-600D, a mirror unit 700, a horizontal synchronizing signal generating unit 800, and the like are mounted on the upper surface 10A of the bottom plate 10. In FIG. 1, two coordinate systems, XYZ coordinate system and X\u2032Y\u2032Z coordinate system are indicated. In the XYZ coordinate system, Y-axis is parallel with the optical axis of the f\u03b8 lenses 400, 500, 600A-600D, X-axis is parallel to the upper surface 10A and perpendicular to the Y-axis, and Z-axis is perpendicular to X-axis and Y-axis. In the X\u2032Y\u2032Z coordinate system, X\u2032-axis is parallel to an optical path from the light source unit 100 to the polygonal mirror unit 300, and Y\u2032-axis is perpendicular to both Z-axis and X\u2032-axis., 64178=The present disclosure relates to the subject matter contained in Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 11-179811, filed on Jun. 25, 1999, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 36185=The multi-beam scanning optical system 1000 operates as described below., 33552=FIG. 1 is a plan view showing a structure of a multi-beam scanning optical system 1000.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present disclosure relates to the subject matter contained in Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 11-179811, filed on Jun. 25, 1999, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the above-described embodiment, the number of the beams is four. This is merely an example and the invention is not limited to the described structure. For example, the number of the beams can be three for yellow, magenta and cyan components, the structure of the scanning optical system can be modified according to the number of the beams. As described above, since the laser diodes 120A-120D have substantially the same temperature, the laser beams emitted by the laser diodes 120A-120D have substantially the same wavelength. Therefore, there will be no shift between the beams emerged from the second f\u03b8 lens 500 in the scanning direction. Accordingly, the color shift of the image can effectively be prevented. That is, the heat generated by the laser diodes 120A-120D is conducted from the casing 122 to the stepped portions 115 of the accommodation holes 114A-114D, and then conducted to the wall 114. Since the wall 114 is formed of a single member made of single material, and having high heat conductivity, the heat conducted from the laser diodes 120A-120D to the wall 114 is mutually transmitted to the laser diodes 120A-120D, and finally, the heat is evenly distributed within the wall 114. As a result, the casings",
