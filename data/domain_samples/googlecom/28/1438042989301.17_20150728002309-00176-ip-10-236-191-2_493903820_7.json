    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{52130=Since the first demonstration of a printed, all polymer transistor in 1994, a great deal of interest has been directed at a potential new class of electronic systems comprising flexible integrated electronic devices on plastic substrates. [Garnier, F., Hajlaoui, R., Yassar, A. and Srivastava, P., Science, Vol. 265, pgs 1684-1686] Recently, substantial research has been directed toward developing new solution processable materials for conductors, dielectrics and semiconductors elements for flexible plastic electronic devices. Progress in the field of flexible electronics, however, is not only driven by the development of new solution processable materials but also by new device component geometries, efficient device and device component processing methods and high resolution patterning techniques applicable to plastic substrates. It is expected that such materials, device configurations and fabrication methods will play an essential role in the rapidly emerging new class of flexible integrated electronic devices, systems and circuits., 190140=Sample preparation: The silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers consist of Si (thicknesses of 20, 50, 100, 205, 290 or 320 nm) on SiO2 (thicknesses of 145 nm, 145 nm, 200 nm, 400 nm, 400 nm or 1 \u03bcm) on Si substrates (Soitec, Inc.). In one case, we use an SOI wafer of Si (thickness of \u02dc2.5 \u03bcm) and SiO2 (thickness of \u02dc1.5 \u03bcm) on Si (Shin-Etsu). In all cases, the top Si layer has a resistivity between 5\u02dc20 \u03a9cm, doped with boron (p-type) or phosphorous (n-type). The top Si of these SOI wafers is patterned with photolithoresist (AZ 5214 photoresist, Karl Suss MJB-3 contact mask aligner) and reactive ion etched (RIE) to define the Si ribbons (5\u02dc50 \u03bcm wide, 15 mm long) (PlasmaTherm RIE, SF6 40 sccm, 50 mTorr, 100 W). The SiO2 layer is removed by undercut etching in HF(49%); the etching time is mainly dependent on the width of the Si ribbons. The lateral etch rate is typically 2\u02dc3 \u03bcm/min. Slabs of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) are prepared by mixing base and curing agent in a 10:1 weight ratio and curing at 70\ufffd C. for >2 hrs or at room temperature for >12 hrs., 54034=The design and fabrication of flexible electronic devices exhibiting good electronic performance, however, present a number of significant challenges. First, the well developed methods of making conventional silicon based electronic devices are incompatible with most plastic materials. For example, traditional high quality inorganic semiconductor components, such as single crystalline silicon or germanium semiconductors, are typically processed by growing thin films at temperatures (>1000 degrees Celsius) that significantly exceed the melting or decomposition temperatures of most plastic substrates. In addition, most inorganic semiconductors are not intrinsically soluble in convenient solvents that would allow for solution based processing and delivery. Second, although many amorphous silicon, organic or hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors are compatible with incorporation into plastic substrates and can be processed at relatively low temperatures, these materials do not have electronic properties capable of providing integrated electronic devices capable of good electronic performance. For example, thin film transistors having semiconductor elements made of these materials exhibit field effect mobilities approximately three orders of magnitude less than complementary single crystalline silicon based devices. As a result of these limitations, flexible electronic devices are presently limited to specific applications not requiring high performance, such as use in switching elements for active matrix flat panel displays with non-emissive pixels and in light emitting diodes., 192713=For the devices such as pn junction diodes and transistors, electron beam evaporated (Temescal BJD1800) and photolithographically patterned (through etching or liftoff) metal layers (Al, Cr, Au) serve as contacts and gate electrodes. Spin-on-dopants (SOD) (B-75X, Honeywell, USA for p-type; P509, Filmtronics, USA for n-type) are used to dope the silicon ribbons. The SOD materials are first spin-coated (4000 rpm, 20 s) onto pre-patterned SOI wafers. A silicon dioxide layer (300 nm) prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) (PlasmaTherm) is used as a mask for the SOD. After heating at 950\ufffd C. for 10 sec, both the SOD and masking layer on SOI wafer are etched away using 6:1 buffered oxide etchant (BOE). For the transistor devices, thermally grown (1100\ufffd C., 10\u02dc20 min. dry oxidation with high purity oxygen flow in furnace to thicknesses between 25 nm and 45 nm) silicon dioxide provide the gate dielectric. After completing all device processing steps on the SOI substrate, the Si ribbons (typically 50 \u03bcm wide, 15 mm long) with integrated device structures are covered by photoresist (AZ5214 or Shipley S1818) to protect the device layer during HF etching of the underlying SiO2. After removing the photoresist layer by oxygen plasma, a flat PDMS (70\ufffd C., >4 hrs) slab without any prestrain is used to remove the ribbon devices from the SOI substrate, in a flat geometry. A slab of partially cured PDMS (>12 hrs at room temperature after mixing the base and curing agent) is then contacted to the Si ribbon devices on the fully cured PDMS slab. Completing the curing of the partially cured PDMS (by heating at 70\ufffd C.), followed by removal of this slab, transfer the devices from the first PDMS slab to this new PDMS substrate. The shrinkage associated with cooling down to room temperature creates a prestrain such that removal and release creates the wavy devices, with electrodes exposed for probing., 266809=Where the terms \u201ccomprise\u201d, \u201ccomprises\u201d, \u201ccomprised\u201d, or \u201ccomprising\u201d are used herein, they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, or components referred to, but not to preclude the presence or addition of one or more other feature, integer, step, component, or group thereof.

The lithographic processes employed AZ photoresist, i.e., AZ 5214 and AZ nLOF 2020 for positive and negative imaging, respectively. The GaAs wafers with photoresist mask patterns are anisotropically etched in the etchant (4 mL H3PO4 (85 wt %), 52 mL H2O2 (30 wt %), and 48 mL deionized water) that is cooled in the ice-water bath. The AlAs layers are dissolved with a diluted HF solution (Fisher\ufffd Chemicals) in ethanol (1:2 in volume). The samples with released ribbons on mother wafers are dried in a fume hood. The dried samples are placed in the chamber of electron-beam evaporator (Temescal FC-1800) and coated with sequential layers of 2-nm Ti and 28-nm SiO2. The metals for the MESFET devices are deposited by electron-beam evaporation before removal of AlAs layers. PDMS stamp with thickness of \u02dc5 mm is prepared by pouring the mixture of low-modulus PDMS (A:B=1:10, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) onto a piece of silicon wafer pre-modified with monolayer of (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane, followed by baking at 65\ufffd C. for 4 hrs. In order to generate strong bonding, the stamps are exposed to UV light for 5 minutes. In the transfer process, the stamps are stretched through thermal expansion (in oven) and/or mechanical forces. The wafers with released ribbons are then laminated on the surfaces of the stretched PDMS stamps and left in contact at elevated temperatures (dependent on the required prestrains) for 5 minutes. The mother wafers are peeled from the stamps and all the ribbons are transferred to stamps. The prestrains applied to the stamps are released through cooling down to room temperature and/or removing the mechanical forces, resulting in the formation of wavy profiles along the ribbons. In the mechanical evaluations, we use a specially designed stage to stretch as well as compress the PDMS stamps with \u2018wavy\u2019 and \u2018buckled\u2019 GaAs ribbons.}",
