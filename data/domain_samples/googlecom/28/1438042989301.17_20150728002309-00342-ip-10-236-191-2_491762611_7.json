A waveform 1300 illustrates operations in a portable media player device A, and a waveform 1310 illustrates operations in a portable media player device B. Device A and device B listen for probe request packets on a discovery channel during synchronized discovery windows 1320. At the end of the discovery window 1320 at time 1322, the devices switch from the discovery channel to a data channel and a data window announcement is sent from device A to device B. A heartbeat packet may be sent from device B to device A. Data packets are sent and received during a data window 1330 which may be relatively short in comparison with a discovery period 1332. Devices A and B then switch to power save mode during a time 1340 until the next discovery period begins. In the example of FIG. 13, the discovery window 1320 is 100 msec, the data window 1330 is 100 msec and the discovery period 1332 is 2000 msec.}",

At this time, the wireless module sets the size of the current data window to Data Window Size, which is configured by the upper layer., 111295=7) When the next Discovery Window starts, the wireless module switches to the discovery channel and performs passive discovery, step 1202, as described above. Thus, passive discovery and data transfer are performed concurrently in a time sharing manner., 104147=1) The wireless module stays awake and parks at its own discovery channel in its discovery window to perform passive discovery, step 1100, as described above., 104616=3) The wireless module sends out a portable media player data window announcement packet, step 1104, immediately after the channel switch is completed., 111598=8) Steps 2) to 7) (steps 1202-1210) are repeated until the device leaves the ad hoc network., 104355=2) When the discovery window ends, the wireless module starts the data window.

Thus, passive discovery and data transfer are performed concurrently in a time sharing manner., 106376=4) After sending out the data window announcement packet, the wireless module is ready for data packet receiving and sending, step 1106., 107149=7) Steps 1) to 6) (steps 1100-1108) are repeated until the ad hoc network does not have any joiner or is terminated., 40438=This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/835,617, filed Aug. 4, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 106562=5) When the current data window expires, the wireless module stops sending and receiving packets and turns off its wireless radio, step 1108, for power saving. If the data window is sufficiently long, power saving may not be achieved., 111007=6) When the current data window expires, the wireless module stops sending and receiving data packets and turns off its wireless radio for power saving, step 1210.

    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only. The above description and the accompanying drawings provide examples of values for various parameters, such as timing parameters. It will be understood that such values are given by way of example only and are not in any way limiting as to the scope of the invention. If a portable media player device is set to stop file sending, the device issues a disconnect call to wireless module as described above. Then it can immediately stop the file sending operation. Stop Sending File The file transfer applications on both file receiver (ad hoc former) and file sender (joiner) turn on the high speed data transfer mode before the data transfer starts in order to achieve a short file sending time. Operate in Sending File If a portable media player device is set to send a file to another portable media player device, the local device issues a connection call as described",
