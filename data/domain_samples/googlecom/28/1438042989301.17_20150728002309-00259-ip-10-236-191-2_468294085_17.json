    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention and its advantages have been described in detail herein, however, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Although the invention has been described with respect to an SS7 system, it will be understood that the present invention may be adapted to monitor the quality of service provided on any communications network. The CDR analysis system also has analysis tools to provide users with the ability to drill down and analyze data at specific geographic, node, link, call, transaction or message levels. The quality monitoring system application can be configured to sample only a percentage of CDRs to populate the historical database. Users can select an appropriate sampling rate through the CDR configuration profile set-up. The system application hardware is configured as per the customers sampling requirements. All of the quality statistics may be stored for the sampled set of CDRs. In a preferred embodiment, the minimum granularity is five minutes of data. The granularity can also be configured to be traffic dependent. All data is entered in appropriate hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly tables. The quantity of hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly tables stored in the database is dependent upon the amount of hard disk space procured with the CDR server hardware 506. The system is capable of using additional",
