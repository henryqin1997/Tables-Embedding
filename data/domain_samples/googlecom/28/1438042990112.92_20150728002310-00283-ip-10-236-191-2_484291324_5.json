U.S.S.R. 222,370 and Offenlegungsschrift 2,738,022 disclose sydnone imines which contain phenyl, 1- or 2-phenylethyl and the phenylisopropyl groups in 3-position as well as N-meta- and para-chlorophenyl and N-phenyl carbamoyl groups. Variations of 3-benzyl sydnonimines are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,277,108. Other variously substituted 3-aralkyl sydnonimines are disclosed by Olovyanishinkiva et al. Khim. Geterotsikl Soedin, 2 170-175 (1978) and 9 1198-1203 (1975)., 12203=Yashunskii et al., J. Med. Chem., 14 1013-1015 (1971) disclose the marked CNS-stimulatory effect of 3-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl) sydnonimine (Sydnophen). The relative activities of a large number of alkyl, aryl and aralkylsydnonimines are presented in Table 1 on page 1014. Most of them, including compound XVIII (2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl-sydnonimine), were essentially inactive central nervous system stimulants relative to compound XIII (Sydnophen), demonstrating the criticality of the structure of the 3-substituent in the Sydnocarb series of compounds as far as CNS stimulatory activity is concerned. Thus, although the activity profile of Sydnocarb is not identical to that of amphetamine, or for that matter Sydnophen, CNS stimulatory activity is a common property of the initial reactant amphetamine, the intermediate Sydnophen and the final product Sydnocarb., 13182=In accordance with this invention there is provided new central nervous system (CNS) stimulants possessing comparable stimulatory activity to Sydnocarb while exhibiting much less sympathomimetic activity than norepinephrine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, l-Sydnocarb, l-3-[2-[(diethylaminoacetyl)oxy]-2-phenylethyl]N-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]sydnone imine (Example 9, Ser. No. 193,042, filed Oct. 2, 1980) and dl-3-[2-(dimethylamino)-2-phenylethyl]-N-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]sydnone imine (Example 2, Ser. No. 193,043, filed Oct. 2, 1980, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,289,885)., 26008=Dissolve 1-benzyl-1-methylhydrazine hydrochloride (10.0 g) in water (40 ml), stir and cool with an ice bath, then add 37% formaldehyde solution (8.1 g). Continue cooling and stirring for 40 minutes, then drip in a solution of potassium cyanide (3.0 g) in water (40 ml). Stir for 3 hours, then extract the reaction with methylene chloride. Wash, dry and evaporate the extract in vacuo to obtain 8.1 g of 1-benzyl-2-cyanomethyl-1-methyl hydrazine. Cover the product with water (40 ml), cool with an ice bath, then carefully add concentrated aqueous-HCl (7.8 ml) dropwise. Further cool the reaction with an ice-salt bath, then drip in a solution of sodium nitrite (6.3 g) in water (50 ml) with continued stirring. After completing the addition, stir cold for 11/2 hours. Extract the reaction with methylene chloride, then wash, dry and evaporate the solvent in vacuo to obtain the crude 1-benzyl-2-cyanomethyl-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazine (9.4 g). Dissolve the oil in dry toluene (50 ml), add phenylisocyanate (7.04 g), stir, then add triethylamine (4.7 g) and heat the reaction at 50\ufffd-60\ufffd C. for 61/2 hours. Cool, filter and evaporate the solvents in vacuo, then pump dry to obtain 13.8 g of crude residue. Dissolve the product in ethyl acetate, add 5 N isopropanolic-HCl (17.2 ml). Scratch and stir, then let stand to crystallize. Filter to obtain 1.62 g of crude title product; m.p. 165\ufffd C. (dec.). Dissolve the solid in methylene chloride-methanol, treat with decolorizing carbon, filter then evaporate to low volume in vacuo. Add 95% ethanol and let stand to crystallize. Filter and dry to obtain 974 mg of the pure title product; m.p. 169\ufffd C. (dec.)., 22743=Obtain an analytical sample from acetone; m.p. 155\ufffd-157.5\ufffd C. (dec.)., 14544=The compounds of this invention are prepared by the following technique: ##STR1## The starting material 1-benzyl-1-methylhydrazine is synthesized by the methods described by Butler et al., J. Med. Chem. 14 1052 (1971). The 1-benzyl-1-methylhydrazine is reacted with the sodium bisulfite formaldehyde addition product followed by reaction with a cyanide salt. The resulting cyanomethyl derivative is converted to the nitroso nitrile derivative with acidic nitrous acid and the nitrosonitrile derivative is converted to the oxadiazolium salt by treatment with anhydrous HCl. Neutralization of the oxadiazolium salt with a very mild base, such as sodium acetate, in the presence of an arylisocyanate affords the desired product. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are prepared by conventional techniques from such organic or inorganic acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, formic, acetic, propionic, oxalic, succinic, glycollic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, benzoic, salicylic, methane sulfonic, toluene sulfonic, and the like. The salts are employed in isolating the base in order to free it from reaction by-products. Due to the lability of the nitrosonitrile in the presence of base, direct conversion of the nitrosonitrile to the desired product in the presence of a base such as triethylamine is not as efficient as the stepwise conversion through the oxadiazolium salt (see Example 5, infra).}",
