At 0.85 \u03bcm such a standard has been reported in the literature (\"Frequency stabilisation of GaAlAs laser using a Doppler-free spectrum of the Cs-D2 line\", IEEE J. Quantum Electronics, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp 169-175, February 1983) based on the D2 line of Cesium and with an absolute resolution better than 10 MHz (see FIG. 3). Alternative standards exist throughout the contemplated wavelength range of optical transmission systems and thus restriction to 0.85 \u03bcm is not necessary.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The specific arrangements described above are such as to achieve linear optical amplification for a coherent optical transmission system by means of a number of sophisticated \"circuit\" elements which have no correspondence at lower frequencies. These elements have already been demonstrated, in principle at least. Instead of employing an optical local oscillator comprised of a laser stabilised to an atomic standard as described above, the circuit could be operated in a swept local oscillator mode, locking into a particular frequency channel with a characteristic signature, such as by adjusting the current in the laser in response to an automatic frequency control arrangement. A refinement of the circuit of FIG. 2, particularly for when employed in the optical amplifier of FIG. 1a, involves the introduction of an optical delay, of magnitude equal to the delay in the electronic path, between the optical local oscillator and the single sideband modulator in order to cancel all but the highest frequency noise components introduced by the optical local oscillator. The integrated optic device of FIG. 2 comprises a lithium niobate substrate 8 in which are diffused an input waveguide 9, two branch waveguides 10 and 11 of substantially identical optical length, and an output waveguide 12. The optical signal output from a semiconductor laser 13 is applied to the input waveguide 9 directly or via an optical fibre 14. In use with the circuit of FIG. 1a the laser 13",
