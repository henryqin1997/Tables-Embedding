Current carrying electrodes 21 are formed in semiconductor substrate 20 and act as the source and drain regions of non-volatile memory device 12. An ion implantation process (indicated in FIG. 1 with arrows 19) is then used to form current carrying electrodes 21. For example, an n-type dopant such as arsenic or phosphorus is implanted vertically into floating gate structure 16 and the exposed portions of dielectric layer 15 at an energy ranging from about 30 keV to 120 keV and a dose ranging from about 1\ufffd1014 atoms/centimeter2 (cm2) to 5\ufffd1015 atoms/cm2. Preferably, the dopant is implanted perpendicularly to the surface 14 of semiconductor substrate 20, but an implant angle ranging from about 0\ufffd to 7\ufffd may also be desirable. It may also be desirable to form a pre-implant screen oxide (not shown) along the exposed top surface of floating gate structure 16. After the ion implantation process, ion implantation mask 18 is removed using conventional techniques known in the art., 23637=Following the formation of dielectric layer 15, a floating gate structure 16 is formed to provide a charge-storage structure for non-volatile memory device 12. Floating gate structure 16 is formed from a layer of conductive material (not shown) such as polysilicon or amorphous silicon that is deposited using a low pressure vapor deposition (LPCVD) process. The layer of conductive material is then patterned as shown in FIG. 1 using a conventional photolithographic mask and etch process. For example, a reactive ion etch (RIE) process is used to remove the exposed portions of the conductive layer and form floating gate structure 16 so that it has sidewalls 17. Preferably, floating gate structure 16 has a thickness ranging from about 1500 \u212b to 3500 \u212b.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Additionally, the use of an oxy-nitride layer to provide the tunneling layer and the formation of a silicon dioxide film using a TEOS deposition process improve the operational performance of non-volatile memory device 12 at elevated temperatures. A semiconductor device formed in accordance with the present invention not only has improved write/erase cycling and data retention capability, but can also be programmed in a shorter amount of time than some previously known structures. Following the formation of silicon dioxide layer 33, a control gate structure 34 and a gate structure 36 are formed as part of non-volatile memory device 12 and semiconductor device 11, respectively. In the preferred embodiment, control gate structure 34 and gate structure 36 are formed from a single layer of polysilicon or amorphous silicon (not shown) that is deposited using conventional techniques and patterned as shown in FIG. 2 using an RIE process. Another advantage of present invention is that silicon dioxide layer 33 and the layer of material used to provide control gate structure 34 and gate structure 36 are used to form a portion of both non-volatile memory device 12 and semiconductor device 11. This integration reduces the total number of processing steps required to form integrated circuit 10. This in turn reduces the complexity and cost associated with the manufacture of integrated circuit 10. Therefore, the present invention provides a non-volatile memory device that has a thicker and higher",
