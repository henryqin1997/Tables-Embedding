However, the present invention is equally suitable for cases whereby the lever supporting member is: a connector housing that only has terminal fittings inserted therein; an electric wire cover attached to a connector housing which has terminal fittings inserted therein and supporting electric wires that extend from that connector housing; a frame that houses only sub connectors. (3) In the embodiment described above, the arm members are not circular. However, according to the present invention, the outer circumference edges of the arms may equally well be arc shaped and concentric to the rotative axes of the levers. In that case, the thick members may be formed along the arc-shaped outer circumference edges of the arms. The thin members may also be formed along the outer circumference edges of the arms in the same manner. (2) In the embodiment described above, the thick members are formed along the supporting members that support the protecting walls on the connector housing. However, according to the present invention, the thick members may equally well be formed at a location removed from these supporting members. (1) In the embodiment described above, the thin members extend along the outer circumference edges of the arms. However, according to the present invention, the thin members may equally well",
