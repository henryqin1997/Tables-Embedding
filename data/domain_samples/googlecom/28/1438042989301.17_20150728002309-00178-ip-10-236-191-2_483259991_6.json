Thus, this compound by itself in a thermochromic paint is entirely unsatisfactory for use with a heat-recoverable memory metal device as described herein., 26477=The proportions of basic copper carbonate and the sulfur compound used in the composition are not critical. Sufficient sulfur compound should be present to produce a distinct color change in the desired range. Generally, this is achieved if the mole ratio of basic copper carbonate to sulfur compound is in the range of from about 0.5:1 to about 2:1, preferably from about 0.8:1 to 1.5:1. A mole ratio of 1:1 is particularly preferred., 28188=The thermochromic paint composition comprises the thermochromic component dispersed in a conventional liquid paint formulation. By the term \"liquid paint formulation\" is meant conventional solvent-binder systems used in preparing paints. Liquid paint formulations typically contain water or an organic solvent having dispersed or dissolved therein a polymeric or resin binder. Typical binders include natural resins such as kauri, copal, shellac, pontianak, dammar, sandarac and the like, and synthetic resins such as alkyd resins, nitrocellulose, phenolic resins, amino resins, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, copolymers of vinyl accetate and vinyl chloride, methacrylate, polymers of methyl methacrylate and polymers of butyl acrylate, polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, styrene, butadiene and isoprene, and the like., 18539=Couplings and the devices comprising a heat-recoverable memory metal member or driver, a non-heat-recoverable insert, or liner, and a sealant are disclosed in copending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 1,372 filed Jan. 5, 1979 and 107,656 filed Dec. 27, 1979 by. E. S. Binkley, now abandoned, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The sealant used in these patent applications comprises a thermosetting composition containing dispersed particulate fillers. In installing a heat-recoverable device of this type, heat is applied to cause the heat-recoverable member to recover, and the sealant to soften, flow, and then cure. In heating the device, it is important that the device and substrate to which it is being applied not be overheated. One method of monitoring the temperature of the device during the installation process is to apply a thermochromic paint to at least a portion of the exposed surface of the device. The use of a thermochromic paint to indicate the temperature of the sealant or adhesive is suggested in the above-mentioned applications., 17991=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 116,707, filed Jan. 30, 1980, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Non-Patent Citations While the thermochromic compositions of this invention can be used with heat-recoverable memory metal couplings as described in detail above, the compositions can be used whenever it is desired to know that a given object or article is at a temperature in the range of 165\ufffd C. to 240\ufffd C. For most uses, the thermochromic compositions will be incorporated into a paint formulation. Using the test procedures described in detail above, one skilled in the art will be able, without undue experimentation, to determine suitable sulfur compounds for use with basic copper carbonate to produce the thermochromic compositions of this invention.

The results of these tests are shown in Table II. The thermochromic component to be tested was incorporated into a paint formulation as described in Example 1. The paint was coated on the exposed outer surface of the liner which extended beyond the heat-recoverable driver. The coupling was placed in the flame of a propane torch, positioned such that the tip of the inner blue cone just touched",
