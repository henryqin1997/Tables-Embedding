No. 10/203,909 filed Oct. 29, 2002 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/185,623, filed Feb. 29, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference., 48110=In constructing the embodiment of the eccentric ergometer of the present invention which is depicted as device 10, the power train of a standard Monarch cycle ergometer may be used. The adjustable seat 18 may comprise a recumbent seat and the device 10 may be driven, for example, by a three-horsepower direct current (DC) motor with one or more idlers between the motor 12 and the flywheel 16. The gear ratio from the flywheel 16 to the turning or pedal crank 14 is preferably about 1:3.75. As previously stated, all components are mounted to a steel frame 20 for stability. A motor controller 28 controls the motor speed and preferably has a 0 to 10 Volt output for both motor speed and load. The magnetic sensor 26 monitors pedal revolutions per minute (rpm) which is preferably displayed to the rider/user during the training session The voltage and amperage outputs from the controller 28 are monitored through an analog-to-digital board and dedicated computer. The motor 12 also includes an on/off switch 30 which is accessible by a user in order to switch the device on and off from the position of use. A safety shut off may also be included which may be programmed to automatically shut off the motor once certain predetermined parameters are reached.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description is of exemplary embodiments of the subject invention it will be appreciated that the foregoing description is not intended to be limiting; rather, the exemplary embodiments set forth herein merely set forth some exemplary applications of the subject invention. It will be appreciated that various changes, deletions, and additions may be made to the components and steps discussed herein without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Further, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other configurations of the apparatus may be designed in order to effectively exercise other muscles of a user's body in an eccentric manner. For example, the same elements which comprise the previously described eccentric ergometers may be repositioned and/or configured in a different way in order to effectively exercise the various muscles of the back in an eccentric manner. exemplify eccentric arm ergometers that are designed to produce negative work in the arm musculature however, these apparatus also function to load the abdominal, back and trunk muscles as well. Arm strengthening at very low energy costs can benefit those who use upper arm extremities in sport or locomotion such as wheelchair propulsion. In addition, the eccentric loads to the muscle with these types of devices can exceed what is typically produced on machines or with free weights in a gym. In rehabilitation settings,",
