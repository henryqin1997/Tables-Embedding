    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{149207=At block 1010, the analysis module forms a communication describing the one or more action for communication to the corresponding agent modules. The corresponding agent modules may then cause the respective nodes of the network to implement the actions described therein. Thus, the manager and agent modules may be utilized to perform what-if analysis based on an online trace-driven simulation in a manner similar to fault detection. What-if analysis may be utilized for correcting faults and improving network performance., 152989=At block 1110, one or more actions are derived based on the modification which may be utilized to improve network performance. Exemplary actions may include rate-limiting, rerouting, and topology control of flow eight 1216. The network simulation enables the manager module to further evaluate the benefit of these actions accurately. For example, the following table shows an expected throughput for exemplary corrective actions., 46623=The present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

For instance, the simulator may create a network simulation based on the network settings of the real network and the modification set. The network simulation, as previously described, may then be utilized to determine the consequences of the modifications to the real network., 151241=At block 1106, for instance, network settings are collected that describes target end-to-end demands and the routing protocols that is in use. It should be noted that these network settings may be different from the traces used for troubleshooting, because the procedure 1100 examines how the network (e.g., link loads and routing) will react to the changes in network configuration.}",
