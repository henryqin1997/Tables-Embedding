No. 10/038,106 filed Jan. 2, 2002., 84370=In one embodiment of the present invention, some or all of the receptacle units contain current (or power) monitoring devices for monitoring the total current through the receptacle or the current through each of the outlets of the receptacle. In this embodiment, the current measured in the receptacles can be communicated to the controller over the communications bus to allow the controller to detect any present or impending over current conditions. In one embodiment, additional current (or power) monitors, coupled to the communications bus, can be distributed throughout the power distribution network to provide values of current (or power) to the controller. In addition, each of the receptacles may have a display that displays the current or power draw for the receptacle unit to determine if additional devices can be powered from the unit. Further, as described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. \u201cNot Yet Assigned\u201d, filed on Jan. 2, 2002, titled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PREVENTING OVERLOADS OF POWER DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS, assigned to the assignee of the present application, and incorporated herein by reference, the controller and power monitoring devices can be used in conjunction with the controller along with software contained in computers contained in the equipment racks to determine maximum power levels in the power distribution system.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Having thus described at least one illustrative embodiment of the invention, various alterations, modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications and improvements are intended to be within the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended as limiting. The invention's limit is defined only in the following claims and the equivalents thereto. In embodiments discussed above, racks are described as being arranged in rows. In different embodiments, rows of racks may be linear rows, curved rows, have spaces (i.e., aisles) between racks, or be arranged in some other configuration. , the UPSs are placed at the ends of the rows of racks. Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to systems in which the UPS racks are placed at the ends, however, as described above, in embodiments of the present invention, there are advantages to placing the UPSs at the end of the rows. Specifically, the placement of the UPSs at the end of the rows allows easy access to the UPSs for replacement for repair or upgrade. Further, in redundant power systems having two PDUs, as described above, the placement of the PDUs at the ends of the rows allows the number of cables at any point in the tracks in a row of racks to be",
