[0057] Further, plural cold accumulating materials different from the paraffin can be mixed to have the suitable mailing point. [0056] For example, in the above-described embodiment of the present invention, two kinds of paraffin materials having different melting points are mixed. However, plural kinds of paraffin materials having different melting points, more than two, can be mixed. [0055] Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. [0054] According to the experiments by the inventors of the present invention, when the melting point of the mixed cold accumulating material is in a range of 7-11\ufffd C., air to be blown into the passenger compartment can be effectively cooled in the cold accumulator 40 while the compressor 1 stops. Accordingly, by mixing plural kinds of the paraffin materials to have the melting point in the range of 7-11\ufffd C., a mixed cold accumulating material suitable used in the cold accumulator 40 can be obtained. That is, when the mixed cold accumulating material has the melting point in the",
