However, those skilled in the art will recognize that changes and modifications may be made to the exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the various components may be implemented in alternate ways, such as, for example, by replacing the FET-based switches with bipolar devices. Moreover, additional sample signals can be read at a time by a sequence detector, such as by adding another flip-flop device to receive delayed output Q4 and provide a delayed output Q5, or any other number of additional flip-flop devices and delayed output signals QN. These alternatives can be suitably selected depending upon the particular application or in consideration of any number of factors associated with the operation of the system. Moreover, these and other changes or modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention, as expressed in the following claims. , for an error sequence of \u201c0, 1, 0, 0 . . . \u201d, a fourth sample 804 as facilitated by delayed output Q4 of flip-flop 605 can allow sequence detector 600 to determine that the sequence does not represent a decoded \u201cZ\u201d state, but instead the \u201c1\u201d state is a glitch-sample, and thus the decoded state should remain \u201c0\u201d for the output signal of sequence detector 600.
