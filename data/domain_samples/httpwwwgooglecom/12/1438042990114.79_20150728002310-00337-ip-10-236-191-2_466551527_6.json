    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21609=In assignee's co-pending application Ser. No. 427,427 (T-8383) filed Oct. 27, 1989, an in situ method is disclosed for remediation and decontamination of surface and near-surface soils by electrically heating the soil through electrodes operated at power line frequencies of about 60 Hz. The electrodes are implanted substantially vertically in the soil in a line pattern which allows substantially uniform electrical heating in the region between rows of electrodes. The depth of electrode insertion is substantially equal to the depth of the contamination, but could be deeper or shallower. The process is particularly applicable to soils contaminated at depths of up to about 30 meters. The electrodes are hollow and perforated below the surface to allow application of a vacuum to the soil through the electrodes. The electrodes are also equipped with provision for electrical connection and vacuum line connection, and also with the capability to be sealed to a barrier that is impermeable to gases, such as a flexible sheet., 21199=Assignee's co-pending application Ser. No. 427,418 filed Oct. 27, 1989, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,594 (T-8395) discloses an in situ method for remediation and decontamination of surface and near-surface soils by evacuating the soil under a flexible sheet, which is impermeable to gases, and heating the soil surface with a relatively flat electric surface heater, which is permeable to gases., 20227=Assignee's co-pending application Ser. No. 444,574 filed Nov. 20, 1989, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,973,811 (T-2247) utilizes a different coupling scheme, called \"eddy current\" or \"inductive\" coupling which makes use of the magnetic field established rather than the electric fields as disclosed in the prior art RF systems above-described. A current generator is used to drive a transmission line which is shorted at the opposite ends. This method is much better suited to heating highly conductive soils than the fringe field method., 15852=This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/627,479, filed Dec. 14, 1990, now Pat. No. 5,190,405., 20794=U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,448 issued to Robert M. Koerner et al on Jun. 27, 1989 discloses a method and apparatus for in situ removal of contaminants from soil comprising a barrier having a permeable inner layer and an impermeable outer layer overlying the contaminated soil and a vacuum system for reducing pressure under the barrier and withdrawing contaminants from the contaminated soil., 23384=And finally, in Assignee's co-pending application Ser. No. 07/559,771 filed Jul. 30, 1990 (T-2245), moist warm air from a vapor treatment system is injected into wells which are screened (perforated) only at the contaminated depth forcing vapor flow only through the contaminated region. Between the injection wells is an extraction well which is also screened only at the contaminated depth. A vacuum is drawn on the extraction well through the contaminated soil, thereby entraining some of the contaminants. The contaminated, flushing vapor is then treated and recycled. A microwave/radio frequency (MW/RF) heating system heats the earth's surface and the contaminated soil, thereby enhancing volatilization of the contaminants and their removal via the vapor flushing system. By screening the wells only through the contaminated zone and maintaining the contaminated soil zone in a moist state, the entire energy of the system is focussed on the contaminated region.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations These and other variations of the means and methods disclosed herein are to be construed as included within the scope of this invention. In an additional method of practicing this invention, once the heating section and pumping manifold 39 is in place, and a section evacuated and heated, various gases and liquids can be injected through the heater wells 11 or through openings in the impermeable flexible sheet 29. Thus, for example, water, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, superheated steam, alkalies or acids, or other reactants could be injected to further remove or decompose the contaminants, as required. The decontamination process disclosed herein can be applied in soils which have low in situ moisture content or high contaminant levels relative to moisture content. Unlike other decontamination processes that rely on electrical conduction through the soil, this invention relies only on thermal conduction through the soil. It can therefore be applied in completely dry soils and at temperatures beyond the boiling point of water. Moreover, since the thermal conductivity of soils has relatively little variation compared to their electrical conductivity, this thermal conduction decontamination process results in substantially more uniform heating than processes that rely on electrical conduction through the soil. If the soil contains a large amount of free water, the process can be initiated by pumping through the manifold to remove the free water, followed by surface heating. This process can be repeated several times by adding",
