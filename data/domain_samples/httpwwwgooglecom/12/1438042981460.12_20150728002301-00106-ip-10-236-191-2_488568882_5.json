As shown in FIG. 22, a new button is displayed on the DVHS operating screen 72 on the CRT display screen 61, for operating the DVHS 3 (in this case, action mode selection).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23883=Home network systems such as the IEEE1394 serial bus can be used to connect multiple information processing apparatuses (e.g., DTV (Digital Television), DVHS (Digital Video Home System), IRD (Integrated Receiver Decoder), etc.) and carry out playing and recording of video and audio information, or to transmit and receive information between information processing apparatuses to carry out editing processing such as dubbing. Conventionally, control of the controlled information processing apparatus is carried out by the controlling information processing apparatus issuing AV/C (Audio Video/Control) commands to the controlled information processing apparatus., 79720=In step S34, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, confirms that the user has selected the IRD 4 from the input USER_ACTION command, causes the GUI engine 46 to generate GUI data corresponding to the operating buttons of the IRD 4 to the DTV 2, and transmits GUI data corresponding to the addition of operating buttons for the IRD 4, via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 44359=The user makes reference to the display on the CRT 16 and operates the operating panel 17 or an unshown remote commander, selects a desired device from the DVHS 3 or IRD 4 connected to the IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and further instructs the processing for the selected device to execute. In the event that the user operates the remote commander, the infrared photoreceptor 18 receives infrared signals representing the operations of the user from the remote commander. The CPU 12 supplies broadcast waves received with the antenna 21 and control signals generated by the CPU 12, for example, based on the signals representing the operation of the user, input from the operating panel 17 or the infrared photoreceptor 18, to the DVHS 3 or IRD 4 via the IEEE1394 interface 11 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 22816=This is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09/691,951 filed Oct. 19, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,931,199., 81744=Then, the CPU 52 of the IRD 4 receives input of the DIRECT_SELECT_INFORMATION_TYPE command via the IEEE1394 serial bus 1 and IEEE1394 interface 53. The CPU 52 generates control signals for changing the received channel according to the instructions of the input commands, and outputs the control signals to the CS tuner main unit 55. The CS tuner main unit 55 changes the received channel according to the input control signals., 73907=In step S15, the IEEE1394 interface 11 receives GUI data transmitted from the DVHS 3, and outputs signals to the CPU 12 indicating that new GUI data has been received., 78607=In step S32, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, reads out data corresponding to its own operating screen from the GUI engine 46, and transmits this to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1. The DTV 2 receives this data corresponding to the operating screen of the DVHS 3, and displays the data on the CRT display screen 61 (the processing of steps S4 and S5 in FIG. 17)., 82254=In step S38, the CPU 43 inputs signals indicating that the channel of the IRD 4 has been changed, to the GUI engine 46, the GUI engine 46 changes the GUI data corresponding to the channel of the IRD 4, and transmits the GUI data corresponding to the channel change of the IRD 4 to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 84400=In step S42, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and executes the processing for starting recording. That is, the CPU 43 transmits an AV/C command to the IRD 4 instructing transmission of received broadcast data using the point-to-point connection established in step S35, via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1. The CPU 52 of the IRD 4 inputs the AV/C command via the IEEE1394 serial bus 1 and IEEE1394 interface 53, generates control signals for transmitting the broadcast waves received with the antenna 54 as streaming data to the DVHS 3, and outputs to the CS tuner main unit 55. The CS tuner main unit 55 demodulates the received waves input via the antenna 54 according to these control signals, and transmits to the DVHS 3 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 47691=The CPU 43 generates control signals for controlling the VCR control unit 45 for example, based on these signals, and outputs these control signals to the VCR control unit 45. Based on the control signals input from the CPU 43, the VCR control unit 45 performs actions such as recording picture data input from another device via the IEEE1394 serial bus 1 and IEEE1394 interface 44 on an unshown video cassette tape, and transmitting picture data recorded on the unshown video cassette tape to other devices connected to the IEEE1394 serial bus 1, via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, for example., 88081=Now, description has been made so far regarding cases using a network comprising an IEEE1394 serial bus 1, but the same processing may be performed on a network configured using other connection methods, as well., 45663=The broadcast waves received with the antenna 21 are demodulated with the tuner 22, decoded by the receiving circuit unit 23, and input to the multiplex separating unit 13. The multiplex separating unit 13 separates signals corresponding to broadcast waves into audio signals and picture signals for example, based on the control signals input from the CPU 12, and the signals are respectively output to the speakers 25 via an audio signal playing unit 24 and to the CRT 16 via the picture generating unit and CRT driving circuit unit 15, or supplied to the DVHS 3 via the IEEE1394 interface 11 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 81316=In step S37, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, reads out a DIRECT_SELECT_INFORMATION_TYPE command which is an AV/C command for instructing changing of channels, from the RAM 48, and transmits this to the IRD 4 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 70034=In step S8, the IEEE1394 interface 11 receives GUI data transmitted from the DVHS 3, and outputs signals indicating that new GUI data has been received to the CPU 12., 50126=Based on these signals, the CPU 52 generates control signals for controlling the CS (Communications Satellite) tuner main unit 55 for example, and outputs these to the CS tuner main unit 55. Signals received with the antenna 54 are input to the CS tuner main unit 55. The CS tuner main unit 55 performs demodulation and de-scrambling of the input received signals according to the signals input from the CPU 52, outputs the signals to the NTSC encoder 56 where they are converted into NTSC data, which is displayed on an unshown monitor or transmitted to other devices connected to the IEEE1394 serial bus 1 via the IEEE1394 interface 53 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1. Further, the CPU 52 saves data in the RAM 57 and reads out data saved in the RAM 57, as necessary., 80289=In step S35, the CPU 43 calls an AV/C command for generating a point-to-point connection from the RAM 48, in order to enable real-time transfer of streaming data (continuous data) from the IRD 4 to the DVHS 3, transmits to the IRD 4 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and establishes a point-to-point connection between the DVHS 3 and the IRD 4., 72285=In step S12, the IEEE1394 interface 11 receives GUI data transmitted from the DVHS 3, and outputs signals indicating that new GUI data has been received to the CPU 12. The CPU 12 outputs the data received via the multiplex separating unit 13, picture generating unit 14, and CRT driving circuit 15, to the CRT 16. Consequently, the display portion for the IRD 4 channel on the DVHS operating screen 72 is changed., 83286=In step S40, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and inputs signals indicating that the DVHS 3 has been selected to the GUI engine 46. The GUI engine 46 generates GUI data corresponding to the DVHS operating buttons, and transmits GUI data corresponding to the addition of operating buttons for the DVHS 3 to the DTV 2, via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1., 85455=The IEEE1394 interface 44 receives streaming data transmitted from the IRD 4 via the IEEE1394 serial bus 1. The CPU 43 outputs the received streaming data to the VCR control unit 45 to the IEEE1394 interface 44, and the data input to the VCR control unit 45 is recorded on an unshown video cassette tape., 86399=In step S44, the CPU 43 returns a response to the DTV 2 via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and executes the processing for ending recording. That is, the CPU 43 stops the processing for recording the data input to the VCR control unit 45 onto the unshown video cassette tape, and also transmits an AV/C command to the IRD 4 instructing stopping transmission of streaming data, via the IEEE1394 interface 44 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1. The CPU 52 of the IRD 4 inputs the AV/C command via the IEEE1394 serial bus 1 and IEEE1394 interface 53, generates control signals for stopping transmission of the streaming data, and outputs to the CS tuner main unit 55. The CS tuner main unit 55, upon receiving these control signals, stops transmitting the streaming data., 68006=In step S4, the IEEE1394 interface 11 receives the GUI data transmitted from the DVHS 3, and outputs signals to the CPU 12 indicating that new GUI data has been received., 76773=In step S21, the CPU 12 transmits to the DVHS 3 a GUI_UPDATE command with \u201cstop\u201d described in the sub-function area thereof via the IEEE1394 interface 11 and IEEE1394 serial bus 1, and the processing ends.}",
