For example, \u201c+18\u201d 86 indicates that an aircraft is 1800 feet above the tracking aircraft and \u201c\u22120.7\u201d 90 indicates that a second aircraft is 700 feet below the tracking aircraft 92 as displayed on the exemplary display 60. If the tracking aircraft 10 and the intruder 12 are both equipped with a more comprehensive TCAS II system the display 60 will also indicate whether the intruder is climbing or descending at more than 500 feet per minute as indicated by an upward 94 or downward 96 pointing arrow.}",

All the references cited herein are incorporated by reference. Referring again to FIG. 2, when a traffic advisory is issued by the TCAS system of an aircraft equipped with the anti-collision system of the present invention, a signal is sent from the TCAS computer 58 to a light controller 68. The light controller 68 activates selected external lighting systems 70 and 72 of the tracking aircraft 10 to enhance the airplane's conspicuousness and increase the likelihood and timeliness of visual acquisition by the crew of the intruder 12. The light controller 68 can alternately activate and deactivate predetermined lighting systems 70 and 72 which can include the landing lights 18, taxi lights 20, deicing lights 22, strobe lights 24 and rudder illumination 26 as illustrated in FIG. 1. Alternately illuminating and obscuring individual lights or groups of lights spaced apart on the aircraft creates an illusion of side-to-side motion further enhancing the conspicuousness the aircraft. If lights are in close proximity, simultaneously activating and deactivating the lights can increase their",
