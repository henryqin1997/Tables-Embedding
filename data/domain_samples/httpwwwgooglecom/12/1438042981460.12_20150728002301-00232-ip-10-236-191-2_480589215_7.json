The vehicle orientation processor 1040 uses those messages to determine the appropriate orientation of the route map relative to the dashboard display device 1025, as described previously with respect to FIGS. 7 and 8. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 may compare information about the current direction in which the vehicle is traveling as received from the electronic compass 1020 with information about the current displayed orientation of the map to determine whether the map orientation displayed on dashboard display device 1025 should be changed. When the map orientation should be changed, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 re-displays the map on the dashboard display device 1025 in the orientation appropriate for the direction that the vehicle is traveling. For example, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 may send the map in the appropriate orientation through system bus 1075 to the dashboard display device interface 1060. The dashboard display device interface 1060 then displays the appropriately oriented map using communication pathway 1082 to the dashboard display device 1025.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44081=The client device 220 typically includes a general purpose computer 270 having an internal or external storage 272 for storing data and programs such as an operating system 274 (e.g., DOS, Windows\ufffd, Windows\ufffd 95, Windows\ufffd 98, Windows\ufffd 2000, Windows\ufffd NT, Windows\ufffd Millennium Edition, Windows\ufffd XP, OS/2, and Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications 276 (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, presentation programs, and graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications 278 (e.g., AOL (\u201cAmerica Online\u201d) client, CompuServe client, AIM (\u201cAmerica Online Instant Messenger\u201d) client, AOL TV (\u201cAmerica Online Television\u201d) client, and an ISP (\u201cInternet Service Provider\u201d) client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications 280 (e.g., Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content., 92256=In some implementations, the functions performed by the vehicle orientation processor 1040 may be performed by a processor that also performs other functions, such as a processor associated with an on-board navigation guidance system., 84304=The GPS interface 1050 is capable of exchanging messages with GPS 1015 through communications pathway 1080. The electronic compass interface 1055 is capable of exchanging information with electronic compass 1020 through a communication pathway 1081. Dashboard display device interface 1060 is capable of sending and receiving communications with the dashboard display device 1025 through a communications pathway 1082., 86038=The GPS 1015 is capable of determining the location of the vehicle, such as the longitude and latitude of the vehicle. The GPS 1015 sends the location of the vehicle to the vehicle orientation processor 1040 using the communications pathway 1080, the GPS interface 1050, and the system bus 1075., 85220=The wireless communication controller 1070 is capable of exchanging wireless communications with the host system 1035 through a wireless communications pathway 1084. The wireless communication controller 1070 only may be necessary when the map display system 1010 includes a host system., 84830=The peripheral storage interface 1065 is capable of sending and receiving communications with the peripheral storage device 1030 through a communications pathway 1083. The peripheral storage interface 1065 may be necessary only when the map display system 1010 includes a peripheral storage device 1030., 88920=For example, the vehicle may be traveling toward the north after making a turn onto a particular road, and the particular road on which the vehicle is traveling may be depicted on the map displayed on the dashboard display device such that the road extends from the left side of the display to the right side of the display. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 may receive from the electronic compass 1020 a message that indicates the vehicle is traveling toward the north. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 may receive from the GPS 1015 a message that indicates the vehicle is located at a particular position. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 may determine the road on which the vehicle is located by comparing the location of the vehicle with locations included on the map displayed on the dashboard display device 1025. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 may determine whether the road on which the vehicle is traveling is depicted on the dashboard display device 1025 in an appropriate orientation. Specifically, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 may determine whether the road on which the vehicle is traveling is depicted with the northern portion of the road directed at the top of the display. If not, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 may send to the dashboard display interface 1060 using the system bus 1075 the map to be displayed in the correct orientation (e.g., the road on which the vehicle traveling is depicted as traversing from the bottom toward the top of the display). The dashboard display device interface 1060 then controls the dashboard display device 1025 to display the map in an appropriate orientation relative to the direction in which the vehicle is traveling., 83685=The map display system 1010 includes a vehicle orientation processor 1040, a storage unit 1045, a GPS interface 1050, an electronic compass interface 1055, a dashboard display device interface 1060, an optional peripheral storage interface 1065, an optional wireless communication controller 1070, and a system bus 1075. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 is a central processing unit (CPU) that processes executable instructions. The storage unit 1045 stores executable instructions and data., 28925=This application is a continuation application of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 10/330,550, filed on Dec. 30, 2002 and titled \u201cPRESENTING A TRAVEL ROUTE USING MORE THAN ONE PRESENTATION STYLE,\u201d now allowed, all of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety., 86836=The vehicle orientation processor 1040 accesses a route map. For example, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 may access a route map received from the host system 1035 using the communications pathway 1084, the wireless communication controller 1070, and system bus 1075. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 also may access a route map stored on media associated with the peripheral storage device 1030 using the communications pathway 1083, the peripheral storage interface 1065, and the system bus 1075., 90784=It is important to note that the vehicle orientation processor 1040 does not necessarily control the display such that the vehicle is always traveling directly up. For example, the vehicle orientation processor may be constrained to rotating the depicted map in increments of 90\ufffd, and may select the orientation of the depicted map that causes movement of the vehicle to have the largest upward component. An indication of the orientation of the map (e.g., an indication of where North is) may be displayed., 86420=The electronic compass 1020 is capable of determining the direction in which the vehicle is traveling. The electronic compass 1020 sends the direction in which the vehicle is traveling to the vehicle orientation processor 1040 using the communications pathway 1081, the electronic compass interface 1055, and the system bus 1075., 91343=The vehicle orientation processor 1040 also may determine whether a different map should be displayed on the dashboard display device 1025 based on the current position of the vehicle as indicated by a messages provided by the GPS 1015. When the vehicle orientation processor 1040 determines that a different map should be displayed, the vehicle orientation processor 1040 accesses the map, for example by communicating with the host system 1035 or by accessing media associated with peripheral storage device 1030. The vehicle orientation processor 1040 sends the map through system bus 1075 to the dashboard display device interface 1060. The dashboard display device interface 1060 then displays the map using communication pathway 1082 to the dashboard display device 1025., 85587=The system bus 1075 provides a series of parallel connections to allow communication between the vehicle orientation processor 1040, the storage unit 1045, the GPS interface 1050, the electronic compass interface 1055, the dashboard display device interface 1060, the peripheral storage interface 1065, and the wireless communication controller 1070.}",
