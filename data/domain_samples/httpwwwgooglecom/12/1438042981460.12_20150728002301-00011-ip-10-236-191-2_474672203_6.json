Photos falling within this range are designated \u201cbest match\u201d photos, and can be viewed as such in image area 100. For example, the timeline 250 can be used by itself to find all photos taken between Jan. 1, 2000 and Feb. 28, 2000 by moving the adjustable time bands 251 to these two respective dates. The photos the database that have been tagged with a timestamp falling between these two dates can be retrieved from the database, and displayed in the \u201cbest match\u201d section of image area 100., 49963=[0021] The events tag category includes default tag types for parties and vacations, and can be customized to include tag types for particular types of events such as concerts, plays, shows and sporting events, and for particular events such as the 2002 Boston Marathon. In addition, tags in the events category can include pre-defined calendar events such as New Years Eve, and customized calendar events such as birthdays and anniversaries. Tags in the event tag category can contain attributes corresponding to the names, locations, and dates of the underlying events associated with the tags., 57527=[0030] In addition to finding photos according to their timestamp, the timeline 250 can be used with other metadata to limit search tag results. For example, if the adjustable time bands 251 of timeline 250 indicate the period of interest extends from Jan. 1, 2000 to Feb. 28, 2000, searching the database for all photos having a San Diego tag will return the photo \u201cLori on the road at Legoland\u201d as a \u201cbest match\u201d photo, and display the photo in image area 100, only if the photo was taken sometime between Jan. 1, 2000 and Feb. 28, 2000. If the photo was taken outside of this time period, it would only appear as a \u201cclose match\u201d photo in image area 100. When tag searches are conducted in conjunction with timeline 250, the timeline displays the total number of photos in the database per unit time period in a first color which may be a solid color, and the total number of photos in the database that match the tagged search criteria as \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cclose\u201d matches in a second color which may be a hatched pattern or color., 60188=[0032] As shown in FIG. 4, in addition to timeline 250, photos taken on a particular day or during a particular month can also be found by displaying the photos in a 2-D histogram or scatter plot such as the calendar view shown in the figure. The calendar view displays all of the photos that have been taken, scanned, or imported into the database on any day in a given month as a function of the day of the week the photos were taken, and the week in the month. If a particular day of the month is selected in the calendar view, all photos taken on that day can be retrieved from the database as \u201cbest match\u201d photos. For example, FIG. 3 shows that during the month of June, 2001 two sets of photos were taken. The first set contains a single photo taken on June 8, while the second set contains 10 photos taken on June 18. By selecting the June 18 calendar day, the 10 photos taken on June 18 are selected as the \u201cbest match\u201d photos, and can be displayed in image area 100., 61221=[0033] The calendar view can also display the results of a tag search in the month-at-a-glance mode. When so used, each day in the calendar can indicate not only whether any photos were taken on that day, but whether the photos taken on that day fall into the \u201cbest match\u201d, \u201cclose match\u201d, or \u201cno match\u201d group with respect to the tagged search criteria. For example, if the Legoland photo described in FIG. 2 was one of ten photos of Lori R. taken in San Diego on Jun. 18, 2001, and a search were done for all photos having a San Diego tag, then the Jun. 18, 2001 square in FIG. 3 would indicate that day as having photos in the \u201cbest match\u201d group. If, however, a search were done for all photos having a New York tag, the Jun. 18, 2001 square in FIG. 3 would indicate that day as having photos in the \u201cno match\u201d group. Finally, if a search were done for all photos having a New York tag and a Lori R. tag, the Jun. 18, 2001 square in FIG. 3 would indicate that day as having photos in the \u201cclose match\u201d group., 37650=[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. application serial no. 10/052,213, filed Jan. 16, 2002, which in turn claims the benefit of priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 09/774,523, filed Jan. 31, 2001, which in turn claims priority to U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/261,897, filed Jan. 16, 2001 and U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/179,379, filed Jan. 31, 2000, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.
