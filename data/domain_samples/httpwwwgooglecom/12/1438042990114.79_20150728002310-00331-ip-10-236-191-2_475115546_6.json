    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations There have been described and illustrated herein several embodiments of a forceps having wave-like opposing jaws for clamping, grasping, manipulating, cauterizing, coagulating/desiccating and/or cutting vascular tissue in an atraumatic fashion. While particular embodiments of the disclosure have been described, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplications of preferred embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. In addition, it may be preferable to add other features to the forceps of the present disclosure, e.g., an articulating assembly to axially displace the end effector assembly relative to the elongated shaft. Although it is preferable to vertically align the electrodes on the bipolar version of the forceps, in some cases it may be preferable to offset the opposing electrodes relative to one another either longitudinally or transversely to suit a particular purpose. Although it is preferable to form the upper and lower jaw members such that they are complimentary and intermesh with one another, in some cases it may be preferable to include non-complimentary portions depending upon a particular purpose.",
