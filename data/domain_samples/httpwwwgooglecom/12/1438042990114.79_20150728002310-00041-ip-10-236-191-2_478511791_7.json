Ink Jet Printing of an UV Curable Acrylate Resin Using a Cylindrical Excimer Lamp EXAMPLE 2 Using a paint program, three 2\u2033\ufffd2\u2033 squares for each ink were printed onto a transparency film and exposed to a flat lamp available from Heraeus Noblelight GmbH (Hanau, Germany) and having a width of about 5 inches; a length of about 12 inches; and a thickness of about \ufffd inch. An instantaneous cure was observed. Three inks were prepared from the above mixture: a magenta ink using 5 wt % Intrasperse Red-Violet RH; a yellow ink using 5 wt % Disperse Yellow 42; and a cyan ink using 5 wt % Victoria Blue BO. Each ink was placed within the ink cartridge, which was positioned inside the Epson printer. The water-based inks were removed by syringe from an Epson color ink jet cartridge, Model S020191).
