The present invention can be implemented in process devices located in the field, or in process devices or controls located at a remote location such as a control room or distant facility. Any appropriate hardware and/or software can implement the present invention including personal computers, microprocessors at various locations or configurations, etc. The invention can be implemented in any appropriate process device 40 including the illustrated control system or other devices which have access to process variables such as transmitters or controllers. The device can be at a remote location or in close physical proximity to a process variable sensor. FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of control system 40 showing one example physical configuration of the control system. In the example of FIG. 3, control system 40 utilizes a microprocessor 100. Microprocessor 100 is configured to receive setpoint 62 which can be stored in memory, such as memory 102. Memory 102 can also contain permanent and/or temporary values such as used for programming or for storing program instructions or temporary storage. The process variable input can be through any type of physical layer such as through standard communication protocols. Example protocols include two-wire based protocols such",
