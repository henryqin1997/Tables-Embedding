    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6324=FIG. 12 is a flow chart of an illustrative process for playing back one of multiple copies of a recorded program. Process 1200 starts at step 1202. At step 1210, the interactive television application receives a user instruction to play back a program. At step 1220, in response to receiving the user instruction, the interactive television application may automatically select a particular copy of the program based on any suitable criteria. In other embodiments, the user may select a particular copy of the program from a list of programs for playback.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{104473=At step 1470, the interactive television application plays back at least a portion of the second copy of the program that was selected at step 1460. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may play back the second copy of the program from the beginning. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may play back the second copy of the program from a playback position just prior to the playback position of the first copy of the program before the interactive television application selected the second copy of the program. Process 1400 ends at step 1472., 100561=At step 1320, the interactive television application identifies the copy of the program that has the most desirable recording attributes. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may identify the copy of the program having the largest number of desirable recording attributes. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may identify the copy of the program having the most desirable recording attributes as measured qualitatively. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may identify a copy of the program that does not lack desirable recording attributes., 98169=If the interactive television application determines that the selected copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes, process 1200 moves to step 1240, where the interactive television application receives an instruction to select another copy of the program. For example, the interactive television application may automatically generate and provide the instruction to recording device 14 or another device, or the interactive television application may receive a user instruction to select another copy of the program. At step 1250, the interactive television application selects another copy of the program. For example, the interactive television application may automatically select another copy of the recorded program based on any suitable criteria, or the interactive television application may receive a user indication of a copy of the recorded program to select. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may select or suggest another copy of the program that has at least one recording attribute that is more desirable than a recording attribute of the first copy. The interactive television application then proceeds back to step 1230 to determine whether the newly selected copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes., 101213=At step 1330, the interactive television application selects the copy of the program identified in step 1320 for playback. At step 1340, the interactive television application plays back the selected copy of the program. For example, the interactive television application directs display device 12 to play back the selected copy of the program. Process 1300 ends at step 1342., 102415=At step 1440, the interactive television application identifies the recording attributes of the first copy of the program. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may determine the recording attributes of the first copy of the program using information from database 104. In some embodiments, the user may determine the recording attributes of the first copy of the program based on the characteristics of the program being played back on display device 12. At step 1450, the interactive television application determines that the first copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes. In some embodiments, the interactive television application automatically determines (e.g., from the attributes retrieved from database 104) that at least one recording attribute of the first copy of the program is not desirable. In some embodiments, the user indicates to the interactive television application that the first copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes (e.g., using input device 14)., 47892=User equipment 10 may include any equipment suitable for providing an interactive television experience. For example, user equipment 10 may include computer equipment, such as a personal computer with a television card (PCTV). User equipment 10 may include television equipment such as a television, set-top box, recording device, video player, user input device (e.g., remote control, keyboard, mouse, touch pad, touch screen, voice recognition interface, etc.) or any other device suitable for providing an interactive television experience. For example, user equipment 10 may include a DCT 2000, 2500, 5100, 6208 or 6412 set-top box provided by Motorola, Inc., 95645=If the interactive television application can manipulate user equipment 10 to record multiple copies, process 1100 moves to step 1150 to do so. For example, the interactive television application may, in response to the determination made in step 1120, cancel a previously scheduled recording to free a tuner, or delete a previously recorded program from recording device 14 or another device to make room to record the copies of the program. Process 1100 then moves to step 1130, where multiple copies of the program are recorded. For example, the interactive television application may schedule each copy with recording options set either automatically or by the user. Process 1100 ends at step 1160., 97135=At step 1230, the interactive television application determines whether the selected copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes. For example, the interactive television application may automatically determine whether the selected copy of the program lacks desirable recording attributes. In some embodiments, the interactive television application may identify a database entry corresponding to the selected copy of the program in database 104 indicative of a desirable recording attribute. In another example, the user may determine that the selected copy lacks desirable recording attributes based on an indication of the recording attributes of the selected copy. If the interactive television application determines, either automatically or in response to a user indication, that the program does not lack desirable recording attributes, process 1200 moves to step 1260 and plays back the copy of the program. Process 1200 ends at step 1262., 103519=At step 1460, in response to determining to switch to a second copy of the program, the interactive television application selects the second copy of the program that has at least one recording attribute that is more desirable than a recording attribute of the first copy of the program. For example, if the first copy of the program is interrupted, the interactive television application may select a copy of the program that is not interrupted. In some embodiments, the user may select another copy of the program based on an indication provided by the interactive television application of the recording attributes of the other copies of the program. In some cases the user or interactive television application may select another copy that is not known to lack the desirable recording attribute, and may not discover until after playback has begun on the second copy whether the desirable attribute is lacking., 94452=If the user equipment does not have the capability to record multiple copies of the program, process 1100 moves to step 1120. At step 1120, the interactive television application determines whether the user equipment 10 can be manipulated to allow the user equipment to record multiple copies of the program. For example, the interactive television application may determine, based on the results of a conflict check, whether a tuner can be freed, or whether recorded programs can be deleted from recording device 14 or another device to make room for storing the copies of the program. The interactive television application may automatically determine whether the user equipment can be manipulated, or prompt the user for instructions to manipulate the user equipment. If the interactive television application determines that the interactive television application cannot manipulate user equipment 10 to record multiple copies, process 1100 moves to step 1140. At step 1140, the interactive television application instructs user equipment 10 not to record multiple copies of the program.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above described embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims which follow. In some embodiments, copies may be different in ways other than by their recording attributes. For example, two versions of a program may differ because they have different ratings (e.g., an rated-R program shown on HBO and a rated PG-13 program shown on ABC). The programs with different ratings may also, for example, be recorded with different recording attributes. This also may occur with respect to audio services, for example, where one version of a song or music video includes explicit lyrics, while another has been edited to sanitize the language. It will be noted that all of the features described above in connection with the recording of a transmitted program may be applied to the recording of a video-on-demand program, video clip, series of programs, or any other content suitable for recording and display by user equipment 10. In the case of series, the interactive television application may record multiple copies of one, some, or all episodes of the series. At step 1470, the interactive television application plays back at least a portion of the second copy of the program that was selected at step 1460.
