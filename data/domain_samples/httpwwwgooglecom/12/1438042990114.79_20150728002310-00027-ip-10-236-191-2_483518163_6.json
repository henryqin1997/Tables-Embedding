In a seventh embodiment depicted in FIG. 7, the pen-type input device 68 is removable from a recess 70 in the bottom surface of mouse body 12. In this manner the pen-type input device 68 is readily accessible to a user while remaining out of sight during operation of mouse 12. The pen-type input device 68 has a data receptive end 72 located at a first longitudinal end. At the second longitudinal end the pen-type input device has an output cord 74 connected to the output cord 16 of mouse 10. The pen-type input device 18 can be used not only to draw curves such as figures, letters, numerals, symbols or the like, but also to control the cursor display on a computer. In a sixth embodiment of this invention depicted in FIG. 6, the pen-type input device 58 has a button 60 similar in function to mouse button 14, acting as a control button permitting entry of data signals to the computer. In a fifth embodiment depicted in FIG. 5, the pen-type device 48 is recessed on a side 50 of mouse body 12 for easy removal by a user. The pen-type body 48 may be attached to the mouse body by a retractable",
