The vessel 75 can be, for example, a pressurized vessel, such as an autoclave. The volatile hydrocarbon solvent 60 can be added to the vessel 75 in liquid form. The vessel 75 can operate at a pressure and temperature sufficient to maintain the volatile hydrocarbon solvent 60 in liquid form. The pressure can be, for example, between about 20 kPa and about 1000 kPa, such as between about 100 kPa and about 1000 kPa, between about 40 kPa and about 750 kPa or between about 50 kPa and about 500 kPa. The temperature can be, for example, between about 5\ufffd C. and about 150\ufffd C., such as between about 10\ufffd C. and about 60\ufffd C. or about room temperature.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35802=The material comprising bitumen can be mixed with the light aromatic solvent in a countercurrent process. Similarly, the bitumen-depleted sand phase can be mixed with the volatile hydrocarbon solvent in a countercurrent process. The first mixture can be separated, for example, by settling the bitumen-depleted sand phase. Separating the first mixture also can include filtering the bitumen-depleted sand phase or separating the bitumen-depleted sand phase by gravity drainage. In some embodiments, the bitumen-depleted sand phase is mixed with the volatile hydrocarbon solvent at a pressure sufficient to maintain the volatile hydrocarbon solvent in liquid form, such as a pressure between about 20 kPa and about 1000 kPa. In some embodiments the bitumen-depleted sand phase is mixed with the volatile hydrocarbon solvent in a batch process. Similarly, in some embodiments, the second mixture is separated into the bitumen-enriched volatile hydrocarbon solvent phase and the residual sand phase in a batch process., 30321=This claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of prior U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/617,739, filed Oct. 13, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims. We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims. As with the bitumen product 40 exiting the separator 35, the bitumen product 85 exiting the separator 80 can sold as a commodity or subjected to further processing. Upon exiting the separator 80, the bitumen product 85 can have a concentration fine solid material between about 1 ppm and about 1,000 ppm, such as between about 5 ppm and about 250 ppm or between about 25 ppm and about 100 ppm. In embodiments in which the recovered volatile hydrocarbon solvent 90 is recycled, the fresh volatile hydrocarbon solvent 60 may not be needed or may be needed only as a make-up stream. For example, the second mixture can contain between about 5 and about 250 times as much recovered volatile hydrocarbon solvent 90 as fresh volatile hydrocarbon solvent 60, such as between about 10 and about 150 or between about 25 and about 100. , 2 and 3, the bitumen-enriched volatile hydrocarbon solvent phase 65 can be routed into",
