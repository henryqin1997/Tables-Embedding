Deflected droplet sorters employ techniques originally developed for ink jet printers. As with fluidic switching sorters, cells are characterized and identified in stream. The stream is then broken into a series of droplets. The droplet generator imposes periodic pressure variations on the fluid stream. This variation can be implemented by deforming an exit chamber under the influence of a piezo-electrically driven lever. The resulting periodic expansion and contraction of the chamber periodically perturbs the fluid pressure so droplets are generated at the perturbation rate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing embodiment addresses biological cell sorting, the present invention provides for sorting of a range of particle types in suspension. Furthermore, more complex sorting is provided for by using different charge magnitudes and polarities for the droplets. Obviously, a wide range of detection schemes for characterizing particles can be employed. While particular algorithms for locating centers of gravity are described, there are a range of alternative algorithms that can be employed to take advantage of the shape information available in an image. In fact, the method need not determine center of gravity locations specifically. Instead, spacing can be determined directly. These and other modifications to and variations upon the preferred embodiments are provided for by the present invention, the scope of which is limited only by the following claims. Accordingly, the present invention provides an increase of at least an order of magnitude in the determination of droplet spacing. This yields a comparable increase in the precision with which flow velocity is controlled. This in turn means that transit time between detection and breakoff is known to greater certainty. This allows cells to be spaced more closely together in the stream, yielding a system with greater throughput. It is noted that in FIG. 3, the image is about 40\ufffd120 pixels, while four times this resolution is commonly available for video imagers. This extra resolution can be used either to increase the precision with which",
