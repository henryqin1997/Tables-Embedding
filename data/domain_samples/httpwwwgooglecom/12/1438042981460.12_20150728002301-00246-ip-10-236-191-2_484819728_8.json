No. 295,812 filed on Aug. 27, 1981 taught the synergistic result of blending a thermoplastic organic polymer with an inorganic filler, a polymerizable unsaturated organic compound, a vinyl-polymerizable unsaturated hydrolyzable silane and a surfactant. The general teachings of the art prior to this invention had generally discouraged the addition of surfactants to polymer-filler blends. Although this blend resulted in certain improvements in the physical and processing properties of the resultant filled thermoplastic polymer matrix, there continues a need for even greater improvements in these physical and processing characteristics., 54806=Gardner Impact--Described in Materials Engineering, Nov. 1973, under title \"Gardner Impact vs. Izod--Which is Better for Plastics?\" by V. Abolins, G. E. Corp., 50000=In addition to the additives, previously discussed in detail, other ingredients conventionally used in such compositions may also be incorporated. These include, where appropriate, platicizers, vulcanizing agents, crosslinking agents, dyes, pigments, and the like. Of particular interest is the employment of what are known as interfacial agents for use in conjunction with the surfactant. Mixtures of a surfactant and at least two interfacial agents as disclosed and claimed in U.S. Ser. No. 295,813 filed on Aug. 27, 1981 and entitled \"Synergistic Reinforcement Promoter Systems For Filled Polymers\" can be particularly useful. The resulting mixtures of surfactant and interfacial agents are desirable in certain filled thermoplastic polymer blends. When employed the combined amount of interfacial agents should be about 5 to 95 weight percent of the combined weight of the interfacial agents and surfactant., 54994=Melt Index--ASTM D-1238 condition F}",
