A vaporizer such as described in claim 1, 3. A vaporizer such as described in claim 1, distinguished further by provision of means pivoted on said handle and carried thereby and adapted to be swung outwardly therefrom to support said vaporizer in an upwardly inclined 10 position. 2. An electric vaporizer of the class described, comprising in combination, a housing, a discshaped heater base mounted on said housing and having on its lower side a transversely extending lug, a resistance coil mounted in ways in the upper side of said heater base, a resilient switch member extending across said lug and positioned thereby and adapted to be anchored thereto and to said heater base, an electric cord including a pair of cables straddled by said switch member, common means for connecting said coil into circuit relation with said switch member and with said cord and for rigidly anchoring said cord and said member to said heater base, a button",
