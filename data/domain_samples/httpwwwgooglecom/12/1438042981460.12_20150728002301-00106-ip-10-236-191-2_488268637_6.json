Silicone rubber, Teflon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene and neoprene are materials currently being used. The degree of shrinkage is established during the manufacturing process. Radial shrink ratios, for these materials, range from 2:1 to 10:1 and the longitudinal shrinkages range from 5 to 15 percent. However none of the commercially available heat shrinkable materials possess all of the properties required for anastomosis procedure as taught by the present invention. For example, neoprene can undergo shrinking at a low temperature (approximately 140\ufffd F.) but it is not biocompatible; Teflon is implantable, but high temperatures are needed to cause shrinking., 62946=The method of producing a heat shrinkable tubing by irradiation is well known in the art. The radiation processing generally used is limited to two types of ionizing radiation: cobalt-60 gammas (approximately 1.25 MeV) and electrons with energies in the range 0.2-10 MeV. The production of a heat shrinkable polymer is accomplished by irradiating a suitable polymer with a dose of radiation between 5-20 Mrad to produce crosslinks in the polymer, heating the polymer to the crystalline melting temperature, stretching and then quickly cooling the polymer in the stretched configuration. The polymer remains in the stretched configuration until heated to at or above the melting point of the crystalline structure at which time the crosslinks cause a rubber like contraction to the original form.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be clearly understood that the invention is not to be limited to the particular details shown therein, as various modifications, adaptations and alterations are within the scope of the following claims. Referring now to FIG. 10 there is shown a pictorial representation of the heating means for applying heat to the heat shrinkable sleeve. The heating control indicated generally at 136 comprises a source of heat which may be an electrical coil and fan (not shown) a temperature selector control 138, a temperature indicator 140, an on/off control 142 and a communication means 144 which may be a tubular member to transport hot air to a heating wand 68. Referring now to FIG. 11 the heating wand 68 is shown in more detail. The preferred embodiment comprises a handle 146, an upper jaw 148 and a lower jaw 150 which are closable to encircle the vessel being anastomosed, and a dual finger control 152 to allow the surgeon to control whether the heat is on or off and to control the opening and closing of jaws 148 and 150. Heat is supplied to the sleeve by hot air flowing from heating means 136 via tube 144 through handle 146 to jaws 148, 150 and then through outlets 151 disposed radially around jaws 148, 150.
