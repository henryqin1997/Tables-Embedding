    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36249=The operation of this R-wave detection circuitry may correspond to that disclosed in commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/612,760, by Keimel, et al, filed Nov. 15, for an Apparatus for Monitoring Electrical Physiologic Signals, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, alternative R-wave detection circuitry such as that illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,643, issued to Menken on Apr. 11, 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,004, issued to Baker et al. on Nov. 14, 1989, both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, may also usefully be employed to practice the present invention., 22868=Early automatic tachycardia detection systems for automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillators relied upon the presence or absence of electrical and mechanical heart activity (such as intramyocardial pressure, blood pressure, impedance, stroke volume or heart movement) and or the rate of the electrocardiogram to detect hemodynamically compromising ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. For example, the 1961 publication by Dr. Fred Zacouto, Paris, France, entitled, \"Traitement D'Urgence des Differents Types de Syncopes Cardiaques du Syndrome de Morgangni-Adams-Stokes\" (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) describes an automatic pacemaker and defibrillator responsive to the presence or absence of the patient's blood pressure in conjunction with the rate of the patient's electrocardiogram to diagnose and automatically treat brady and tachyarrhythmias., 24865=More recently, others have suggested the use of high rate plus acceleration of rate or \"onset\" (U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,585) with sustained high rate and rate stability (U.S. Pat. No. 4,523,595). As stated in the article \"Automatic Tachycardia Recognition\", by R. Arzbaecher et al., PACE, May-June 1984, pp. 541-547, anti-tachycardia pacemakers that were undergoing clinical studies prior to the publication of that article detected tachycardia by sensing a high rate in the chamber to be paced. The specific criteria to be met before attempting tachyarrhythmia termination by pacing involved a comparison of the detected heart rate to a preset threshold, such as 150 beats per minute (400 millisecond cycle length) for a preselected number of beats. As stated above, other researchers had suggested the rate of change of rate or suddenness of onset, rate stability and sustained high rate as additional criteria to distinguish among various types of tachyarrhythmias., 46195=In the present invention, selection of the particular electrode configuration for delivery of the cardioversion or defibrillation pulses is controlled via output circuit 548, under control of cardioversion/defibrillation control circuitry 554 via control bus 546. Output circuit 548 determines which of the high voltage electrodes 506, 508 and 510 will be employed in delivering the defibrillation or cardioversion pulse regimen, and may also be used to specify a multielectrode, simultaneous pulse regimen or a multielectrode sequential pulse regimen. Monophasic or biphasic pulses may be generated. One example of circuitry which may be used to perform this function is set forth in commonly assigned copending patent application Ser. No. 07/612,758, filed by Keimel, for an Apparatus for Delivering Single and Multiple Cardioversion and Defibrillation Pulses, filed Nov. 14, 1990, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, output control circuitry as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,953,551, issued to Mehra et al. on Sep. 4, 1990 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,883, issued to Winstrom on Jan. 31, 1989 both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, may also be used in the context of the present invention. Alternatively single monophasic pulse regimens employing only a single electrode pair according to any of the above cited references which disclose implantable cardioverters or defibrillators may also be used., 32583=Leads 110 and 120 may correspond to the leads disclosed in allowed U.S. Patent Ser. No. 07/284,955 by Bardy for an \"Endocardial Defibrillation Electrode System\", filed Dec. 15, 1988 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A subcutaneous lead 130 is also illustrated, implanted subcutaneously in the left chest. Lead 130 includes a large surface electrode pad 132, carrying elongated electrode coils 136, 138 and 140. Electrode 132 may correspond to the electrode illustrated in allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/376,730, by Lindemans et al. for a Medical Electrical Lead, filed Jul. 7, 1989 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 36903=The threshold adjustment circuit 516 sets a threshold corresponding to a predetermined percentage of the amplitude of a sensed R-wave, which threshold decays to a minimum threshold level over a period of less than three seconds thereafter, similar to the automatic sensing threshold circuitry illustrated in the article \"Reliable R-Wave Detection from Ambulatory Subjects\", by Thakor et al., published in Biomedical Science Instrumentation, Vol. 4, pp 67-72, 1978, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 23772=Later detection algorithms proposed by Satinsky, \"Heart Monitor Automatically Activates Defibrillator\", Medical Tribune, 9, No. 91:3, Nov. 11, 1968, and Shuder et al. \"Experimental Ventricular Defibrillation with an Automatic and Completely Implanted System\", Transactions American Society for Artificial Internal Organs, 16:207, 1970, automatically detected and triggered defibrillation when the amplitude of the R-wave of the electrocardiogram fell below a predetermined threshold over a predetermined period of time. The initial system proposed by Mirowski et al. in U.S. Pat. No. Re 27,757, which similarly relied upon the decrease in the amplitude of a pulsatile right ventricular pressure signal below a threshold over a predetermined period of time, was abandoned by Mirowski et al. in favor of the rate and/or probability density function morphology discrimination as described in Mower et al., \"Automatic Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Structural Characteristics\", PACE, Vol. 7, November-December 1984, Part II, pp. 1331-1334., 33924=FIG. 2 is a functional schematic diagram of an implantable pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator in which the present invention may usefully be practiced. This diagram should be taken as exemplary of the type of device in which the invention may be embodied, and not as limiting, as it is believed that the invention may usefully be practiced in a wide variety of device implementations, including devices having functional organization similar to any of the implantable pacemaker/defibrillator/cardioverters presently being implanted for clinical evaluation in the United States. The invention is also believed practicable in conjunction with implantable pacemaker/cardioverters/defibrillators as disclosed in prior U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,209, issued to Wielders, et al. on Oct. 22, 1985, U.S. Pat. No. 4,693,253, issued to Adams et al. on Sep. 15, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,006, issued to Haluska et al. on May 6, 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,949,730, issued to Pless et al. on Aug. 21, 1990, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 42761=In response to the detection of fibrillation or a tachycardia requiring a cardioversion pulse, microprocessor 524 activates cardioversion/defibrillation control circuitry 554, which initiates charging of the high voltage capacitors 556, 558, 560 and 562 via charging circuit 550, under control of high voltage charging line 552. The voltage on the high voltage capacitors is monitored via VCAP line 538, which is passed through multiplexer 532, and, in response to reaching a predetermined value set by microprocessor 524, results in generation of a logic signal on CAP FULL line 542, terminating charging. Thereafter, delivery of the timing of the defibrillation or cardioversion pulse is controlled by pacer timing/control circuitry 520. One embodiment of an appropriate system for delivery and synchronization of cardioversion and defibrillation pulses, and controlling the timing functions related to them is disclosed in more detail in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/612,761, by Keimel, for an Apparatus for Detecting and Treating a Tachyarrhythmia, filed Nov. 15, 1990 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, any known cardioversion or defibrillation pulse generation circuitry is believed usable in conjunction with the present invention. For example, circuitry controlling the timing and generation of cardioversion and defibrillation pulses as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,585, issued to Zipes on May 24, 1983, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,949,719 issued to Pless et al., cited above, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,817, issued to Engle et al., all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties may also be employed. Similarly known circuitry for controlling the timing and generation of antitachycardia pacing pulses as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,577,633, issued to Berkovits et al. on Mar. 25, 1986, U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,005, issued to Pless et al. on Nov. 14, 1989, U.S. Pat. No. 7,726,380, issued to Vollmann et al. on Feb. 23, 1988 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,587,970, issued to Holley et al. on May 13, 1986, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties may also be used., 51473=These counts, along with other stored information reflective of the previous series of R--R intervals such as information regarding the rapidity of onset of the detected short R--R intervals, the stability of the detected R--R intervals, the duration of continued detection of short R--R intervals, the average R--R interval duration and information derived from analysis of stored EMG segments are used to determine whether tachyarrhythmias are present and to distinguish between different types of tachyarrhythmias. Such detection algorithms for recognizing tachycardias are described in the above cited U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,380, issued to Vollmann, U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,005, issued to Pless et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,006, issued to Haluska et al., incorporated by reference in their entireties herein. An additional set of tachycardia recognition methodologies is disclosed in the article \"Onset and Stability for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Detection in an Implantable Pacer-Cardioverter-Defibrillator\" by Olson et al., published in Computers in Cardiology, Oct. 7-10, 1986, IEEE Computer Society Press, pages 167-170, also incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. However, other criteria may also be measured and employed in conjunction with the present invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Similarly, it should be understood that the width measurement function of the present invention, while particularly adapted for use in or in conjunction with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator may also in some cases be usefully practiced in conjunction with a non-implantable device, in a device which, for example only treats fibrillation or only treats tachycardia, or even in a device adapted primarily for diagnostic purposes. It should be recognized that although the disclosed embodiment deals with fibrillation and tachycardia in the lower chambers or ventricles of the heart, the invention may possibly be usefully practiced in the context of the upper chambers or atria of the heart, which are also prone to tachycardia and fibrillation in some patients. In addition, while the therapies discussed in conjunction with the disclosed embodiment generally relate to delivery of electrical pulses, it should be understood that the invention may be usefully practiced in conjunction with any device adapted to deliver differing therapies for tachycardia and fibrillation, including drug therapies, non-pulsatile electrical therapies, and any other such therapies as may be implemented in such devices as their development progresses, whether applied directly to the heart or systemically. While the methodology disclosed does result in some asymmetry with regard to the detection of the start point and endpoint of the R-wave, it nonetheless provides an adequate measurement of pulse width for purposes of distinguishing between R-waves of ventricular origin and R-waves of nodal",
