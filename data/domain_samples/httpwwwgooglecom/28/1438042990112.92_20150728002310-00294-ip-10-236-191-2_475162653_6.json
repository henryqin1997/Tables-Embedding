Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. The application interface can be used to develop multi-user applications that implement the distributed network architecture described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,980, which is hereby incorporated by reference. For this embodiment, the multi-server management system and multiple zones of interest created within the network described therein are used in conjunction with the client defined objects and broadcast schedules and filters created using the application interface of the present invention. In general, the multi-user application developed using the application interface can be any type of application that involves the creation and transmission of data among different client computers in a distributed network. For example, the multi-user application may be a teleconferencing application utilizing audio, visual, or combined audio/visual data. For this application, the objects may be data streams that encapsulate the audio/visual or text data. The client structure contains a field that allows the client to be associated with a",
