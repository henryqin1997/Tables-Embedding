Various alterations and modifications will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art after having read the above disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. With flows A to E, the bipolar punchthrough region \"c\" in p-well can be laid out. In this case, phosphorus up-diffusion or SIC or thin Si epi becomes mandatory. Of course, all the proposed flows can be used in pure CMOS process. The sequence of fabricating with flow \"E/F\" is presented in FIGS. 5A-5E. In FIG. 5A, oxidation is followed by an n-well mask, and an n-well implant. In FIG. 5B, the next steps are photoresist strip and n-well implant. FIG. 5C shows diffusion, nitride deposition, island mask, nitride etch, and photoresist strip steps. FIG. 5D has the steps of oxidation, nitride strip, p-well/field mask, p-well implant, and field implant. In FIG. 5E, there is a photoresist strip and a diffusion. The sequence of fabricating with flow \"D\" is presented in FIGS. 4A-4D. In FIG. 4A, oxidation is followed by a blanket n-well implant. In FIG. 4B, the next steps are diffusion, nitride deposition, island mask, nitride etch, and",
