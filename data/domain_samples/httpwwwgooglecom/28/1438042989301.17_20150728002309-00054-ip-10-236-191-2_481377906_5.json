A plurality of handsets 22 can be each connected by a three wire cable 28 with modular plugs 34 at each end to a jack in the terminal strip 104. Further cost savings are the result. As an example, a four wire terminal strip 104 plug can be inserted into the four contact jack 56 in the adapter block 44 and the adapter block plug 52 inserted into the four contact wall outlet 24 jack 32. A plurality of telephone bases 20 can then be connected in parallel to the jacks in terminal strip 104 by a plurality of cables 26 with modular plugs 30 at each end. The result is a very inexpensive means for connecting multiple phones and a recording device to a single line. FIGS. 11 through 16 show couplers and extension cords for use with the modular plug and jack telephones. Any of these can be constructed for the four contact size plugs and jacks or the three contact size plugs and jacks. Couplers 98 and 100 in FIGS. 11 and 12 are to convert a jack to a",
