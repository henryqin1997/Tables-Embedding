When band 1202 expands in direction R, it may also expand in directions P. When band 1202 expands in directions P, upper lobes such as lobe 1208 may move farther apart from each other, lower lobes such as lobe 1218 may move farther apart from each other, and connecting portions such as portion 1228 may move farther apart from each other. During the expansion of band 1200, upper lobe 1208 and lower lobe 1218 may move in directions X and Y (shown in FIG. 12), respectively. During expansion of band 1202, plane MAP, and any anchor or anchors positioned in or near plane MAP, may be stationary or nearly stationary with respect to the biological passage in which apparatus 1200 is deployed.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{119681=In some embodiments, balloon 3390 may have a uniform compliance. In some of those embodiments, anchor 3310 may be crimped by balloon dilation. For example, the size of band 3302 may be chosen so that when band 3302 is maximally expanded, anchor 3310 is partially engaged in wall 2028. As balloon 3390 continues to dilate, regions 3380 may expand \u201caround\u201d and apply an axial crimping force to anchor 3310 as described above., 91086=Central axis C passes through bore 1230 of band 1202. In some embodiments, anchor 1210 may extend in a direction that has components parallel to axis C and radial direction R. In some embodiments, anchor 1210 may extend in a direction that is extends in (or nearly in) radial direction R., 120716=In some embodiments, anchor 3310 may be self-crimping. For example, balloon 3390, which in self-crimping embodiments may have compound or uniform compliance, may push anchor 3310 radially away from the center of lumen 2022 into wall 2028. The curvature of prongs 3330 (or, in the case of angled prongs like 2830, the angle of the prongs) may be selected to cause anchor 3310 to close in response to being radially driven into wall 2028., 160429=Apparatus 6600 may include band 6602 that may be secured against wall 2028. One or more fingers such as finger 6620 may extend from band 6602 into lumen 2022. Finger 6620 may be flexible. In some embodiments, finger 6620 may include one or more fibers. In some embodiments, finger 6620 may include one or more surface area enhancing features such as feature 6622., 120200=In some embodiments of the invention, band 3302 may have compound compliance. A first compliance may dominate when band 3302 is expanded toward wall 2028 and when anchor 3310 is partially engaged in wall 2028. A second compliance may dominate when anchor 3310 are crimped. The second compliance may be less than the first compliance to \u201cbind\u201d balloon 3390 to cause portions 3380 to generate axial forces on anchors 3310., 92446=One or more of anchors 1210 and 1220 may engage biological tissue. Band 1202 may be allowed to contract in direction I to draw the tissue toward axis C. (Direction I is the opposite of radial direction R, but is shown separately from direction R for the sake of clarity.) During contraction, upper lobes such as lobe 1208 may move closer to each other, lower lobes such as lobe 1218 may move closer to each other, and connecting portions such as portion 1228 may move closer to each other. During contraction of band 1202, plane MAP, and any anchor or anchors positioned in or near plane MAP, may be stationary or nearly stationary with respect to the biological passage in which apparatus 1200 is deployed. Barb 1212 may secure tissue to anchor 1210 during contraction. Barb 1212 may continue to secure tissue to anchors 1210 after contraction is complete., 32238=This claims the benefit of copending U.S. Provisional Patent Applications Nos. 60/293,345, filed May 24, 2001, and 60/350,394, filed Jan. 22, 2002, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties., 88376=In some embodiments, anchor 1210 may be present on or near medial axial plane MAP. Plane MAP may be on or near the longitudinal center of apparatus 1200. In some embodiments, one or more anchors may be present on band 1202 not on or near plane MAP. In some of those embodiments, one or more anchors may be present on the lobes. (Although plane MAP is shown in connection with apparatus 1200, plane MAP may be shown in connection with other embodiments of the invention to illustrate aspects of those embodiments that may correspond to aspects of apparatus 1200.), 105607=In some embodiments, head 2014 may be positioned in wall 2028 near inner face 2032 to avoid applying stress to the portion of wall 2028 near outer surface 2036 when anchor 2110 is drawn toward lumen 2022. In some embodiments, head 2014 may be positioned in wall 2028 near outer surface 2036 to enable head 2014 to be supported by a large portion of the tissue of wall 2028 when anchor 2110 is drawn toward lumen 2022., 118565=In some embodiments, balloon 3390 may include central region 3304 having a compliance greater than the compliance of regions 3306 and 3308. In those embodiments, as balloon 3390 is dilated in the second dilation stage, regions 3306 and 3308 may expand more than central region 3304. Some embodiments may include balloon portions 3380, which may be near the transitions between regions of different compliances. Portions 3380 may apply force to anchor 3310 to crimp anchor 3310 into a secure configuration. Anchor 3310 may be permanently secured, or locked, into wall 2028., 90900=Similarly, ends A and B will be used to illustrate aspects of other embodiments of the invention that may correspond to aspects of apparatus 1200., 89006=Lower lobe 1218 and upper lobe 1208 may be open in directions Y and X, respectively. The presence of open lobes is a feature that may be referred to as \u201copen cell\u201d design. The number of upper and lower lobes present between ends A and B may be less than or greater than the number shown. Lower lobe 1218 may be coupled to upper lobe 1208 by a connecting portion such as connecting portion 1228. In some embodiments, one or more anchors may be present on one or more connecting portions., 84867=In some embodiments, a retracted anchor may extend in the distal direction as does anchor 1106. In some embodiments, a retracted anchor may extend in the proximal direction as does anchor 1107. In some embodiments, a retracted anchor may extend in the radial direction (not shown). Balloon 1102 may be partially inflated to retain and position band 1100. The position of balloon 1102 may be controlled by catheter shaft 1108., 100401=Any suitable mechanism for allowing a connecting member such as 1528 to reduce movement in directions X and Y when band 1502 expands or contracts may be used. For example, a connecting member may be a flexible coil coupled to rigid members 1550 and 1560. When band 1502 expands, the coil may expand. When band 1502 contracts, the coil may contract. Some embodiments of the invention may include a connecting member that has reciprocating elements that may cause the connecting member to lengthen or shorten in response to 20 band expansion and contraction, respectively. In some embodiments, connecting members 1528 may be referred to as \u201ctransition\u201d members.}",
