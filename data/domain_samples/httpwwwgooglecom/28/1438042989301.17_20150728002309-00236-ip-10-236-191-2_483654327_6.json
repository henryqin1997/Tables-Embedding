    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been described in specific detail with reference to the disclosed embodiments, it will be understood that many variations and modifications may be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the appended claims. Conclusion By changing the piston and/or rod diameters the amount of concentrate pumped in the up and down strokes can be changed. It is possible to size the diameters so that the outlet flow on the up-stroke equals the outlet flow on the down-stroke. Alternatives This pump provides better mixing and customer acceptability. The annular thin flow of concentrate into the water streams provides improved mixing. The configuration according to the present invention has the cost advantages of a single-acting pump and the smooth-flow advantages of a double-acting pump. In normal, single acting pumps, one gets individual slugs of concentrate in the water stream. Even though this is a single acting piston pump, the flow of concentrate in the mixture appears continuous rather than pulsed. This is because, even on the upstroke, concentrate flows through the valve 40 and into the annular chamber 15 where it is \u201cwashed out\u201d by the flow of water. As noted above, double-acting reciprocating pumps have relatively pulse-free flow because they pump on both the up and down strokes. However, double-acting pumps contain more parts and are more expensive than single-acting pumps. Single-acting pumps do not have a smooth output",
