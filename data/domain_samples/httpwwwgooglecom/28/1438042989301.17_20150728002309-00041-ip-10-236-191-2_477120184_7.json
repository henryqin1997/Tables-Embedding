    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35012=Many crystals have been found to possess piezoelectric property. Until the late 1940's piezoelectric materials included quartz, Rochelle salt, tourmaline, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), and lithium sulfate monohydrate. Not only single crystal, but polycrystalline ceramics solid can present piezoelectricity after subjected to a \u201cpoling\u201d field. Since 1957 lead zirconate-titanate (PZT) solid-solution ceramics has become one of the most important piezoelectric materials which offers high piezoelectric coupling, wide operating temperature range, and a choice of useful variations in engineering parameter., 93364=The decimal number 501 can be written in the format: 501 =28+27+26+25+24+22+20, which can be represented by the 12 bit binary number: 0001,1111,0101. A bit value of \u201c1\u201d is created by connecting the appropriate output bit of ripple counter U4 to the corresponding input bit of the NAND gate U5. A bit value of \u201c0\u201d is created by leaving the appropriate output bit of the ripple counter U4 unconnected but connecting the corresponding input bit of the NAND gate U5 to supply voltage Vdd. As shown in FIG. 7, the least significant output bit for the example ripple counter U4 (74HC4040) is QA terminal 9, and the corresponding least significant input bit for the NAND gate U5 (74HC133) is terminal 2. The output and input bits can be seen to be connected properly for the scaling factor of fs=501 (binary number 0001,1111,0101)., 20150=This application is a continuation-in-part of commonly-owned, copending U.S. Provisional Pat. App. Ser. No. 60/092,270, filed Jul. 10, 1998 by Ko, et al., 78863=\u03c4=(0.3 k\u03a9. 100 nf+0.3 k\u03a9. 10 nf+1200 k\u03a9. 10 nf)=0.012 rad/sec, 89541=For the example 11R22.5 truck tire 304, every mile raveled corresponds to approximately 501 revolutions of the tire 304. Given the long useful life of truck tires, which may be re-treaded many times, the total tire revolutions can become a very large number. It becomes expedient to scale down the number stored in the revolution counting memory by creating a divided-by-Fs counter for the counter element 470. The number Fs a scaling factor which can be used to reduce the value of the total count. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the total count is scaled down 501:1 (scaling factor Fs=501), which conveniently makes the saved revolution count an approximation of the total miles traveled by the tire 304. So for the example preferred embodiment of the invention, a divided-by-501 counter 470 is created. Since the revolutions per mile is determined by the tire diameter (circumference), the scaling factor Fs would have to be different for each tire diameter in order for the count to still represent mileage. If such a custom mileage counter is desired, then it will be seen that appropriate wire connections in the counter 470 circuit could be made selectable by means of jumpers or microswitches rather than by hard wiring as shown in the preferred embodiment. These alternative connection means should be considered within the scope of this invention., 94296=The output of the NAND gate U5 is normally HIGH. Because of the specific interconnections between ripple counter U4 and NAND gate U5 and voltage Vdd, when the number 0001,1111,0101 (only this number) appears on the outputs of ripple counter U4, it is decoded by the NAND gate U5 as a logical TRUE which passes through the NAND gate U5 producing a LOW output on wire 477. The negative transition of the NAND gate U5 output feeds the inverter U30 to provide a reset signal to the CLR terminal of the ripple counter U4, thereby zeroing out its output bits. Thus the number 0001,1111,0101 is not present for very long and then the output of the NAND gate U5 transitions back from LOW to its normal HIGH value as the ripple counter U4 continues counting up but from the reset value of 0000,0000,0000. Thus the example counter 470 will output a narrow negative pulse on wire 477 to the next stage (one shot 480) of the revolution counting circuit every 501 revolutions (one mile).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only preferred embodiments have been shown and described, and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. Undoubtedly, many other \u201cvariations\u201d on the \u201cthemes\u201d set forth hereinabove will occur to one having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention most nearly pertains, and such variations are intended to be within the scope of the invention, as disclosed herein. The power consumption for this revolution counter is about 35 \u03bcW when truck runs at 71 MPH. The tests show that both the unimorph and bimorph piezo element 440 energy converters can provide more than 60 \u03bcW even when the truck runs at 50 MPH. With higher speeds, even more power is generated. Therefore, the revolution counting system can function well with the piezo element 440 energy converters. Ptotal=Preg+Pckt=25 \u03bcW+10 \u03bcW=35 \u03bcW. Pckt=2.5V * (2.5 \u03bcA+277 mA * 300 ms/50 s)=10 \u03bcW Preg=2.5 V* 10 \u03bcA=25 \u03bcW The power circuitry 450 consumes power as well because a regulator is used to stabilize the voltage output. It dissipates 2.5\ufffd10=25 \u03bcW. The microcontroller 490 consumes the most power of the circuit",
