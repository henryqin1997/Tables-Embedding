    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6454=Experimental methods. E. coli MG1655 cells were grown as in Example 1. Bacterial cells were diluted serially (ten-fold dilutions) with sterile PBS. Bacterial cells (50 ml volume of the 10\u22127 dilution) were deposited on a black polycarbonate filter (Osmonics; cat. num. K02BP04700) using a vacuum filtration device and a plastic funnel cup (Millipore Microfil V User Guide, PF07114, Rev A 3/00). A negative control was prepared by filtering sterile PBS. After filtration, each filter was placed on a separate agar plate containing LB growth medium, which was pre-warmed to 37\ufffd C., and placed in a 37\ufffd C. incubator. The viable cell count of the 10\u22127 dilution was determined by filtering replicate samples and incubating the filter on LB agar. This process indicated that the 10\u22127 dilution contains approximately 1000 cells per 50 ml. At 5.25 hours, membranes were imaged by placing the filters held on glass microscope slides into a CCD-based imager (described in Step 5 of Detailed description section and shown in FIG. 3) so that the bacteria were facing the illumination source and CCD camera. A FITC optical filter set (Chroma; excitation 470/40 nm, emission 522/40 nm) was used and a one second exposure captured using software control (Image Pro Plus, version 4.1; Media cybernetics).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{243448=Experimental methods. Water was aseptically collected from the Charles River (Cambridge, Mass.) and used in the experiment within one hour of collection. The Charles River water was centrifuged at a setting of 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5415C for 1-2 seconds. The centrifuged Charles River water was diluted 1:10 with sterile Type I water and 1.0 ml of this was deposited on a black, mixed cellulose ester filter (Millipore; cat. num. HABP04700) using a vacuum filtration device and a sterile plastic funnel (Millipore Microfile\ufffd 100 ml Funnel, cat. num. MIHABG072). Each filter after filtration was placed on a separate agar plate containing R2A growth medium (Becton Dickinson/Difco; cat. num. 218263). Ten separate filters were prepared and the agar plates were incubated at 32.5\ufffd C. for up to 74 hours. Periodically (after 17, 24, 42, 50, 68, and 74 hours) the agar plates were removed from the incubator and the filters were imaged by placing the plates on a CCD-based imager so that the bacterial colonies were facing the illumination source and CCD chip. The illumination source for reflectance was provided by a Fiber-Lite\ufffd Model 190 Convection Cooled 30 Watt Quartz Halogen Illuminator (Dolan-Jenner Industries, Inc., Lawrence, Mass.), and the illumination was directed at an oblique angle onto the filter. The naked eye is capable of seeing bacterial colonies that are 0.5 mm or greater in diameter, so this size criterion was used as a discriminating characteristic of a bacterial colony. The colonies that were 0.55 mm or greater in diameter were identified and counted in the reflectance images. When autofluorescent microcolonies that gave rise to a macrocolonies could be detected was also determined. Autofluorescent images were analyzed to determine when the progenitors of 74 hr macrocolonies appeared. At various time points the percentage the 74 hr macrocolonies that were detectable as autofluorescent microcolonies was plotted., 237195=Experimental methods: A single colony of freshly grown Escherichia coli (ATCC, Cat. No 8739) was inoculated into a conical tube (50 ml) containing growth medium (TSB; 10 ml) and incubated (16 hours, 37\ufffd C., 150 rpm). This culture containing stationary phase cells (2.4\ufffd109/ml) was used to inoculate an Erlenmeyer flask (500 ml) containing pre-warmed TSB (37\ufffd C., 100 ml) to produce a log phase culture for optimal time to detection. This flask, containing pre-warmed TSB was inoculated with the stationary phase culture (100 \u03bcl) and incubated 2 hours, 37\ufffd C., 150 rpm). A culture established in this way was found to contain \u02dc5\ufffd107 bacteria/ml via pour plate titration. The log phase culture was diluted in PBS (10\u22126). A volume (10 ml) of this dilution was filtered through a membrane (Chemunex Inc., Chemfilter CB0.4, Black, PET-23, 25 mm) supported over an absorbent pad (Whatman Inc., Cat. No. 1441325) using a filtration device (Millipore Inc., 1225 Sampling Manifold, Cat. No. XX27 025 50). After the bacteria were collected on the membrane, the membrane was placed on a pre-warmed TSA plate (32.5\ufffd C.). An image of the plate was captured (30 sec exposure) using non-magnified large area imaging with a FITC optical filter set (Chroma; excitation 470/40 nm, emission 522/40 nm) using software control (Image Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics). Following this initial image capture the plate was placed in an incubator (32.5\ufffd C.) for growth. The plate was removed from the incubator after 2.5 hours of growth and the same field was imaged again using the image capture settings applied previously. Following image capture, the membrane was immediately fixed (1.5% formaldehyde in filtered type 1 water for 5 minutes) followed by two washes (PBS, 5 min each) by placing the membrane on 3M Whatman paper impregnated with either fix or wash solutions as indicated. The membrane was placed on the sampling manifold with all but one placement blocked off with a stopper. Vacuum filtration was applied for 15 seconds. To stain the membrane in order to enumerate the bacteria in an individual microcolony, propidium iodide (1 ml, 5 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the wall of the cup while vacuum pressure was applied, followed by type 1 water (1 ml). Vacuum pressure was applied for an additional 15 seconds after which the membrane was removed and placed on a glass slide, dried, and mounted with a coverslip using the Pro Long Antifade Reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., Cat. No. P-4781). The stained microcolonies were imaged using fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan II fluorescent microscope, Carl, Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.; Cy3.5 filter set, Chroma Id. No. SP-103, excitation 581/10 nm, emission 617/40 nm, 400x) fitted with the SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Mich., Model No. 2.3.1, 2 seconds, red spectra only selected) following spatial registration of these with their corresponding unstained microcolonies identified using large area imaging., 261189=Experimental Methods: Spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 (Raven Biological Laboratories, Inc.) were diluted to a concentration of \u02dc2\ufffd105 spores/ml in sterile water and subjected to a variety of heat stresses ranging from 5 minutes at 110\ufffd C. to 15 minutes at 121\ufffd C. The heat treated spores and an untreated control were serially diluted by 10-fold in water up to a 1/1000 dilution. For comparison, each sample was analyzed by the traditional pour plate method in addition to non-magnified large area imaging of autofluorescence. Pour plates were prepared by placing 1 ml of each dilution (including the undiluted stock) of each sample in a petri dish followed by the addition of 20 ml of molten Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA, BD catalogue no. 236950). After solidifying, the plates were incubated at 55\ufffd C. for 48 hours and counted manually. Plates that had between 30 and 300 colonies were used to calculate the spore titer, unless no plates had more than 30 colonies, in which case the plate containing 1 ml of undiluted stock was used., 284662=All patents, patent applications, and publications referenced in this application are hereby incorporated by reference. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. Examples of other embodiments that may be adapted to the methods described herein are found in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/237,010, entitled \u201cRAPID AND SENSITIVE DETECTION OF CELLS AND VIRUSES\u201d, filed Sep. 6, 2002 and U.S. application Ser. No. 10/236,105, entitled \u201cRAPID AND SENSITIVE DETECTION OF MOLECULES\u201d, filed Sep. 6, 2002, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 232767=Experimental methods. E. coli MG1655 cells were grown and analyzed as in Example 2. After imaging the microcolonies, the filter was re-incubated at 37\ufffd C. for about 15 hrs. The resulting macrocolonies were imaged using reflected white light supplied by an incandescent microscope lamp shining obliquely on the plate. Otherwise, the same imaging system was used to collect the reflected light as was used to detect microcolony autofluorescence., 217063=The invention can also use interferometer-based spectral imaging for the detection and decoding of signals (Schrock, E., 1997, supra). Using this technique, light emitted or scattered by signaling moieties is split into two paths, passed thorough prisms (so that different wavelengths travel different distances), and allowed to recombine to create an interference pattern. Fourier analysis of the interference pattern generates a spectrograph for each point in the image., 234768=Experimental methods. E. coli MG1655 cells were grown and analyzed as in Example 3. However, for this example a dilution of cells was applied to multiple filters (n=101) so that on average the detection zone on about one in five filters was expected to contain a single target cell. After 5 hr of incubation each filter was imaged and scored for the presence of microcolonies. The filters were then re-incubated overnight and scored for the presence of macrocolonies. The results obtained using the invention were then compared to the results obtained using traditional visual method., 88767=An example of a system that directly detects viable cells is the ScanRDI system (Chemunex). ScanRDI enumerates microbial cells that are stained with a fluorogenic esterase substrate using laser scanning technology (U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,057; Mignon-Godefroy, K., et al., Cytometry 27: 336-44, 1997). A laser-scanning system (including an optical collection system using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)) captures an image of the filter and can detect individual labeled cells. The system illuminates and queries a microscopic area (generally 4-14 \u03bcm) but scans the beam progressively so as to cover a macroscopic area (e.g., a 25 mm diameter circle). The system is designed to detect cells with intact membranes and active esterase enzyme. There is a correlation between the numbers of such cells and the number of cells that can form colonies on growth medium. However, this approach often results in substantial \u201covercounting\u201d\u2014i.e., higher numbers of cells than are detected by traditional culture (Costanzo, S., et al. (2002). PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology 56: 206-219). Another disadvantage of the ScanRDI system is that it kills the microbes during the staining process precluding generation of pure cultures from the detected microbes. Finally, laser scanning systems for cellular enumeration are complex and expensive (hundreds of thousands of dollars) making them difficult to justify for routine microbiological applications. Other laser scanning systems have also been commercialized (Miraglia, S., et al., J Biomol Screen 4: 193-204, 1999; Tibbe, A. G., et al., Nat Biotechnol 17: 1210-3, 1999; Kamentsky, L., 2001, Laser Scanning Cytometry. In Cytometry, Z. Darzynkiewicz, H. Crissman and J. Robinsnon, eds. Methods in Cell Biology Vol. 63, Part A, 3rd ed, Series Eds. L. Wilson and P. Matsudaira. (San Diego: Academic Press))., 90663=Flow cytometry is another powerful method that can rapidly enumerate microbes without relying on cellular replication (Alvarez-Barrientos, A., et al., Clin Microbiol Rev 13: 167-195, 2000). Individual organisms or particles are forced to flow through a narrow channel, one at a time, past a laser beam. Besides enumeration, information about size/shape and composition is gathered by analyzing the fluorescence emission and light scattering caused by the organisms. Thousands of individual cells or particles can be analyzed per minute. Pathogens can by identified using flow cytometry by binding fluorescently labeled species-specific antibodies or nucleic acid probes to fixed organisms (Alvarez-Barrientos, 2000, supra)., 69942=This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/317,658, filed Sep. 6, 2001, hereby incorporated by reference., 211848=The invention can also incorporate other types of photodetectors and other configurations. The sensitivity of the imaging system can be increased by choosing a more sensitive camera (e.g., a camera cooled to a lower temperature, or a camera that uses a back-thinned chip). Alternatively, the detection sensitivity and resolution can be increased by implementing a line scanning system (e.g., BT Image Array; Hamamatsu). For line scanning, a linear CCD or photodiode array (e.g., 1\ufffd500 or 1\ufffd1000 pixels) is used to capture the image. The resolution in one dimension corresponds to the number of array elements, while the second dimension is generally captured by moving the sample slide perpendicularly under the linear array. Since there are fewer elements, similar sensitivity linear arrays are typically less expensive than area format CCD cameras., 91419=Pathogens can by identified using flow cytometry by binding fluorescently labeled species-specific antibodies or nucleic acid probes to fixed organisms (Alvarez-Barrientos, 2000, supra). Individual cells of one particular type are usually the targets. Flow cytometric methods have been used more extensively for quantitatively detecting particular cell types on the basis of the ability to bind labeled probes, usually either antibodies or nucleic acids. For example, flow cytometry is used to quantify the population sizes of classes of lymphocytes in patients with AIDS. Flow cytometry is a more complex and expensive method than traditional culture. Although faster than traditional culture, flow cytometry does not have a comparable limit of detection to the traditional method. Traditional microbial culture can detect one bacterial cell in 0.1 liter of water, while flow cytometry is most effective when there at levels that are many thousands of times higher than that. Furthermore, microbial targets are often killed by the staining methods used for detection, eliminating the ability to produce pure cultures., 150331=The CCD-based imager depicted in the schematic figure was used to collect much of the data described in the examples (see also Step 5 of Detailed Description section). In one example, excitation light is provided by introducing light from a high intensity white light source (1000 Watt Xenon arc lamp, Model A-6000, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, N.J.) into a liquid light-guide (5 mm core diameter, Model 380, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, N.J.). The liquid light-guide carries the light to an excitation filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics, Hawthorne, N.Y.) and directs the filtered beam (typically 9 mm in diameter) onto the detection surface containing the labeled target cells. The detection surface is the optically clear bottom of a microtiter dish well. However, the same apparatus can detect labeled target cells on various detection surfaces (e.g., microscope slides, coverslips, and tubes with flat, optically clear, bottoms). The incident light strikes the detection surface inducing fluorescence in the signaling moieties that are bound to target cells via category-binding molecules and that are deposited on the optically clear surface. A portion of the emitted fluorescent light is collected by a high-collection efficiency lens system and transmitted through an emission filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics) to a CCD Camera (Orca II, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, N.J.)., 276976=Methods. A sensitive (E. coli MG1655) and resistant (E. coli MG1655/pLafr I) strain of bacteria were deposited on filters as in the previous example (Example 1). Filters containing approximately 1000 resistant bacteria were placed on LB plates (LB agar; Difco) that either contained antibiotic (tetracycline; 64 \u03bcg/ml) or did not contain antibiotic. After incubation at 37\ufffd C. (3 hrs), the filters were stained and imaged as in (Example 1).}",
