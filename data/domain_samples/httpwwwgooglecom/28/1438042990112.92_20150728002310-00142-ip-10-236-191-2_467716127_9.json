The sequence of steps composing the algorithm is indicated by the sequence of blocks 202 to 210. In block 202 the algorithm starts by selecting an unvisited path from the seed point to the voxel. The selection of a path may be performed by any suitable algorithm although the algorithm described by Dellepiane et al. in \u201cNonlinear Image Labeling for Multivalued Segmentation\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 5, No. 3, March 1996, pp. 429-446, has been found to be particularly useful.}",

At block 522, the user, analyzing display 26, evaluates if the desired structure is displayed, if not, the user may return to block 518 to set a new threshold value to further expand or shrink the displayed structure. At block 520, the program 30 uses display 26 to show the user the structure associated with the selected threshold. At block 518, the user sets, using still user interface 24, the threshold representing the lowest connectivity value to be considered. It should be noted that if the user has set an expected volume at block 516, an optimal threshold value will have already been selected, though the user can still modify that value if so desired. At block 516, the user has the option to set, using the user interface 24, an expected volume in order to automatically compute the optimal threshold. At block 514, the program 30 computes the connectivity values according to Equation 6 in accordance with the path weight value set at block 510. It should be noted that Equation 6 is performed on the modified data-set, meaning the output of block",
