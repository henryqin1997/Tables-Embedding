Another refinement for the subject golf information system, of this first embodiment, comprehends changes in repositioning a cup 18 on the surface of a green 16 which has the effect of changing the distance from the reference points provided in the digital course map 86. As shown in FIG. 1, a starting location for a given hole can be designated with waypoint information by the green waypoint proximity region 38 as well as, or alternatively by, the tee waypoint proximity region 39. Preferably, both regions are positioned adjacent the tee area 12 and green 16 or hole 10 in the location where a golf cart 40 will pass as a player begins or ends play on a particular hole. For example, the size of the region surrounding a definitive location of waypoint on the course is preprogrammed and determined based upon course and hole shape, size and ground surface area provided for a golf course to pass over. Such information is stored in EEPROM in waypoint 88 adjacent EEPROM stored information for digital course map 86. When the golf cart 40 is detected through DGPS 42 within such a waypoint defined region,",
