Thus the scope of this invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. Accordingly, it will be seen that this invention provides a periodontal probe tip 10 having numerous features for quickly diagnosing the periodontal health of subject patients. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for using the periodontal probe tip 10 disclosed herein, for achieving maximum efficiency in diagnosing periodontal disease. Referring to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, the preferred method for using the periodontal probe tip 10 of the present invention can be more clearly described. In normal use, the dentist would retract the subject patient's lips and insert probing end 14 into the patient's gingival pockets 30. The dentist would advance probing end 14 into the patient's gingival pocket 30 until probing ball 28 contacts the bottom of pocket 30. At this point the dentist would first inspect the colored regions 24 a-c on the illuminated probe tip 10 to obtain a general indication of the depth of the patient's gingival pockets 30. If probe tip 10 reads green, the dentist would be assured that the pocket is healthy. Alternately, if probe tip 10 reads yellow or red, the dentist would have reason to",
