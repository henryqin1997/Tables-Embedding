The key elements are the combinability of the techniques to yield a hybrid separation and a low-magnitude correlation of the separations achieved by the independent separations. These and other variations upon and modifications to the described embodiments are provided for by the present invention, the scope of which is limited only by the following claims. Separation technologies other than gas chromatography can be used. For example, the invention provides for separation by liquid chromatography, and electrophoresis. In the latter case, different pH buffers can be used for the independent columns and a buffer with an intermediate pH can be used for the hybrid column. The invention further applies where the independent separations are performed using different technologies. For example, the independent separations can involve liquid chromatography and capillary zone electrophoresis. The hybrid column supplies an electric field along a liquid chromatography column. System 200 involves two-dimensional gas chromatography with a common thermal gradient. Those skilled in the art can see that the system and method can be extrapolated to three or more dimensions. Different thermal gradients can be applied by the independent separations, and an intermediate thermal gradient to the hybrid. While the present invention can be practiced with one confirmatory hybrid run for each pair of independent runs, in many cases finer interpolation can remove ambiguity in correlations. In the limiting case of continuous interpolation, one could",
