However, as a sensor that acquires a slip between a gripped object and fingers necessary for performing complicated control such as stable gripping and skillful manipulation of an object by a robot hand, relatively few sensors are found other than the sensor disclosed in JP-A-2004-226380 that acquires a sense of slip based on stick slip oscillation due to friction with an object., 33800=The sensor disclosed in JP-A-2004-226380 obtains a sense of slip. However, this sense of slip is a sense of slip based on stick slip oscillation due to friction with an object, which is obtained by using the pressure in a shearing direction. In other words, when a signal of the pressure in the shearing direction is generated in a certain frequency range, the sensor obtains the pressure as a sense of slip., 29732=The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2007-199221 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Jul. 31, 2007, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference., 33379=However, the sensor disclosed in JP-A-2006-47145measures a shape or a dynamic characteristic of a pressed object (elasticity and viscoelasticity of an object) and does not measure a sense of slip. The sensor disclosed in JP-A-2006-10407 detects oscillation due to a stick slip. Therefore, even if a slip itself can be detected, it is difficult to detect a direction of the slip., 32510=JP-A-2006-10407 discloses a detection sensor that includes a pressure sensitive element and a piezoelectric element and realizes detection of a sense of slip by performing a waveform analysis of the piezoelectric element and detection of a sense of force using the pressure sensitive element.}",
