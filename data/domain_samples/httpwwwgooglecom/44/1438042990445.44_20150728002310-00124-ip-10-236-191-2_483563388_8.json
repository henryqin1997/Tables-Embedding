Moreover, the apparatus of the present invention has been successfully tested to withstand static forces in excess of five thousand pounds without any breakage in the system. Also, the structures of the rotating arm 7 and its mounting fixtures may be furnished with a painted finish, a coated finish, a dielectric coating, a plated finish, or a galvanized coating. Such galvanized coating, which is a preferred embodiment, may be prepared for a hot dip galvanizing process by way of special manufacturing and assembly procedures. These procedures may include galvanizing arm and fastening members, such as the mounting bracket 10, without the shaft or pivoting pin 11, which enables rotation of the arm7. The shaft or pin 11 is then assembled with the arm and mounting bracket, after such galvanizing, to be assembled on the pole 2 after the process is complete. This safety structure provided by the present invention can be used with different sized poles. For example, telephone poles having a diameter ranging from about 7 to 9 inches are easily handled by the inventive structure. With",
