    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by I wish it to be understood that I do not consider the invention to be limited to the precise details of structure illustrated and described in the specification, for obvious modifications will occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains: It may thus be seen that I have invented a novel and highly useful article of jewelry adapted to be worn on the upper surface of a shoe while being engaged by the lowermost loop of a shoelace threaded in normal manner through the eyelets of the shoe. The article includes an exposed surface bearing suitable surface ornamentation or indicia, and may optionally include settings for one or more precious stones. If desired, the ornamentation may extend beyond the area of the base 11. To enable a customized appearance, the ornamentation, such as initials 22 are preferably formed independently and suitably attached using adhesives. Depending upon the forming of the body, as by casting, stamping, or the like, it is possible to form stone settings integrally. The device is normally mounted by passing the lowermost loop of the shoelace through the orifices 20-21, following which the shoe is laced and tied in known manner with a knot or bow. Thus, the device is protected from loss even should the lace break at or near the free ends thereof. Should it be desired to replace",
