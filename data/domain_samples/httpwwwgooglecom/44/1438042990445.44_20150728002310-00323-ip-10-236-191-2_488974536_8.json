Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the appended claims. The newly extruded material is thereafter gradually cooled below the material's solidification temperature while maintaining temperature gradients below a maximum value set by the desired part's geometric accuracy (box 114). FIG. 4 shows a preferred process of building prototypes in accordance with the invention. Data corresponding to the desired shape of the prototype is transmitted to the rapid prototyping system. The system calculates a sequence for extruding flowable material that thermally solidifies so as to create the described geometric shape (box 110). A heated flowable modeling material is then sequentially extruded at its deposition temperature into a build environment that maintains the build volume in the vicinity of the newly deposited material in a deposition temperature window defined by the material's solidification temperature and it's creep temperature (box 112). Calculation step 110 need not be completed before deposition step 112 begins. Once the entire prototype model has been completed, it needs to be cooled so that it is everywhere below the material's solidification temperature, before it is handled or significantly stressed. The cooling rate should be slow enough that the thermal",
