Upon application of the polymer coating to balloon 10 to form the polymeric composite, balloon 10 is cured at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time as is readily determinable by the skilled artisan. Curing enables the polymer coating to set up on the balloon wall to which it is applied and volatilizes the solvent or solvents, if any are used. The method of the present invention is performed by coating the desired internal layers of balloon 10 with an imide-containing polymer or a polyurethane to form an enhanced integrity polymeric composite. Preferably, at least the internal layers which are not substantially biaxially oriented, i.e., internal layers 26a, 26b, are coated with the imide-containing polymer according to the present method. The polymer coating is applied to the desired internal layers as a polymeric liquid which is sprayed onto the desired internal layers or into which the balloon 10 is dipped. The polymeric liquid may be a solution of the imide-containing polymer or polyurethane in",
