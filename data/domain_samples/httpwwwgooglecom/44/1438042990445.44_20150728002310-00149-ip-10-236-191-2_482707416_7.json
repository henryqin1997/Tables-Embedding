No. 6,449,535, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/717,943 filed on Nov. 21, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,459,961, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/401,039 filed on Sep. 21, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,782, which is a division of application Ser. No. 08/789,934 filed on Jan. 28, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,355., 108526=The Air options in FIG. 15 include FRESH option 1521 and RECIRCULATED option 1523. Only one of these two options can be active at a time. When FRESH option 1521 is selected by a first touch on the option, a voice comes on to explain the selected option, uttering \u201cTo select outside air to circulate in vehicle.\u201d A second touch on the option activates the selection to ventilate the vehicle with outside air. Similarly, RECIRCULATED option 1523 allows the user to select the inside air for recirculation in the vehicle., 110043=Temperature display 1535 displays the temperature selected by the user. Touching on up-arrow 1537 increases the selected temperature while touching on down-arrow 1539 decreases same. Continued touching on either up-arrow 1537 or down-arrow 1539 causes the temperature setting to change rapidly., 113973=In this illustration, the user enters \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d as exhibited on subdisplay 1705. In response, an INDEX screen shown in FIG. 18 appears on display screen 209, with the search item name \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d highlighted yellow. It should be noted that other item names such as \u201cAnti-lock Brake System Indicator\u201d are also shown, and they are in alphabetical order following \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d. This stems from the design of system 100 whereby the user may conveniently enter the beginning letter of the search item name only. In that case, a list of item names in alphabetical order with the first item name having the same beginning letter highlighted yellow. For instance, if the user had only entered \u201cA\u201d for \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d, a list of item names starting with \u201cA\u201d in alphabetical order would appear on screen 209 (although in this instance it would be the same list as shown in FIG. 18 as \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d is the first item with a letter \u201cA\u201d in system 100). If the user cannot locate the name of the item of interest in the list, he/she may scroll the screen using scroll-up option 1801 or scroll-down option 1803 to review additional item names after or before the listed item names. Alternatively, the user may select PREVIOUS option 1805 to return to the screen of FIG. 17 to enter the complete item name., 109092=The VENT options in FIG. 15 include FLOOR option 1525, FLOOR/DASH option 1527, DASH option 1529, DEFROST option 1531 and FLOOR/DEFROST option 1533. Only one of these five options can be active at a time. When FLOOR option 1525 is selected by a first touch on the option, a voice comes on explaining the option, uttering \u201cMain air distribution to floor.\u201d A second touch on the option directs an air flow toward the vehicle floor., 93865=FIG. 10 illustrates the MAIN MENU screen. This screen comprises displayed options disposed in columns 1001, 1003, 1005, and 1007. For example, column 1001 includes DRIVER'S VIEW option 1001 a, STEERING COLUMN CONTROLS option 1001 b, LOCK option 1001 c, DRIVING TIPS option 1001 d, and INDEX option 1001 e. It should also be noted that this screen can be invoked at any time by pressing MENU switch 205 e., 104965=When AUTO option 1513 is selected by a first touch, a voice comes on to explain the option, uttering \u201cSystem automatically determines air-flow distribution and volume for optimum efficiency.\u201d A second touch on the same option enables the automatic control, followed by a voice utterance, \u201cSet desired temperature.\u201d Temperature display 1535 then flashes with the current temperature setting, prompting the user to set a desired temperature in a manner to be described., 100624=When TIP option 1303 appears on screen 209, it indicates that helpful hints or reminders are available upon selection thereof. In accordance with another feature of the invention, the appearance of TIP option 1303 is accompanied by the playing of a sound segment associated therewith. This sound segment may be pre-selected by the user from the SOUNDSGOOD library. After an adaptation period, the user would be able to rely on the familiar sound segment, without looking at the screen, to alert him/her of the availability of the TIP option., 103071=Assuming further that at this point the user wants to learn about and also to program the air conditioning of the automobile, the user may access a \u201cCLIMATE CONTROL\u201d screen by successively pressing the PREVIOUS option to backtrack to the DRIVER'S VIEW screen of FIG. 11, where CLIMATE CONTROLS option 1109 is available. As a second alternative, the user may press MENU switch 205 e to invoke the MAIN MENU screen of FIG. 10, where a \u201cCLIMATE CONTROLS\u201d option within column 1003 is available. A third alternative is provided in the event that the user cannot immediately relate \u201cair conditioning\u201d to the CLIMATE CONTROLS option. At the MAIN MENU screen of FIG. 10, the user may select Index option 1001 e to be described. It suffices to know for now that this option allows the user to access the \u201cCLIMATE CONTROL\u201d screen using the term \u201cair conditioning\u201d., 109582=Similarly, FLOOR/DASH option 1527 enables the user to bifurcate the air flow between the floor and the dashboard. DASH option 1529 enables the user to direct the air flow from the dashboard. DEFROST option 1531 enables the user to direct the air flow toward the windshield and select fresh air if not selected. FLOOR/DEFROST option 1533 enables the user to bifurcate the air flow between the floor and windshield., 110392=Similarly, fan speed display 1541 displays the fan speed (high, medium or low) selected by the user. Touching on up-arrow 1543 increases the selected fan speed while touching down-arrow 1539 decreases same., 106577=Similarly, A/C option 1515 and HEAT option 1517 respectively enable the user to activate air conditioning and heaters at a desired temperature or a default temperature range., 101771=In any event, if option 1303 is selected in this instance, a voice comes on and utters a tip regarding tachometer 1305 such as \u201cTo prevent engine damage, do not drive with needle in red zone.\u201d This tip is also momentarily displayed on segment 1311 in lieu of options 1309 a through 1309 f., 95396=In addition, because of the small display area allocated to each option on the MAIN MENU screen, the wording on the option is brief and thus tends to be cryptic. In accordance with a feature of the invention, after a predetermined time (e.g., a few seconds) has elapsed from the option's being highlighted yellow, processor 105 causes a voice to be generated on speakers 127 to explain the purpose of the option before the user activates it. For example, after a predetermined delay from DRIVER'S VIEW option 1001 a's being highlighted yellow, a voice is activated, stating the option name, followed by an explanation of the purpose of the option such as \u201cTo provide location of dash mounted components.\u201d Thus, this inventive feature affords a preview of the option before the user commits to it, thereby avoiding unnecessary backtracking., 110639=The HEATERS options in FIG. 15 include SEAT option 1547, MIRROR option 1549, REAR WINDOW option 1551, STEERING WHEEL option 1553, and ALL option 1554. One or more of these options can be active at the same time. When SEAT option 1547 is selected by a first touch on the option, a voice comes on to explain the option, uttering \u201cTo enable seat heaters.\u201d A second touch on the option activates the seat heaters connected to climate control interface 108 f., 102131=Similar to the elements on the INSTRUMENT PANEL screen, tachometer 1305 and warning lights 1307 on this screen are individually labeled and correspond to options 1309 a, 1309 b, 1309 c, 1309 e and 1309 f, respectively. Assuming in this example that MAINTENANCE REQUIRED option 1309 c is activated, display segment 1311 would be replaced by new display segment 1411 illustrated in FIG. 14. As shown in FIG. 14, item 1401 indicates the subject selected, i.e., \u201cMAINTENANCE REQUIRED\u201d. Item 1403 explains what the MAINTENANCE REQUIRED warning light, when on, indicates. In this instance it states, \u201cMaintenance required warning light comes on to indicate it is time for scheduled maintenance.\u201d PREVIOUS option 1405 enables the user to reactivate segment 1311 of FIG. 13., 97947=Continuing the example, assuming that the user activates option 1105 after hearing the preview, in response processor 105 causes an \u201cINSTRUMENT PANEL\u201d screen to be displayed on screen 209. Such a screen is illustrated in FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 12, the previous screen format is generally maintained in that it provides a view of the object (the instrument panel of the automobile in this instance) pertinent to the option which has been selected, along with displayed options for further selection thereunder. Based on the disclosure heretofore, the design and operation of these screens by now are apparent to a person skilled in the art, and become self-explanatory., 111171=Similarly, MIRROR option 1549 enables the user to activate outside mirror heaters. REAR WINDOW option 1551 enables the user to activate a rear window defroster. STEERING WHEEL option 1553 enables the user to activate a steering wheel heater. Finally, ALL option 1554 enables the user to activate all of the heaters simultaneously., 115369=In any event, after the user locates the item name on the INDEX screen, the user may then touch the item name to access information on that item. To that end, a look-up table is stored in memory 115. FIG. 19 illustrates such a look-up table, wherein left column 1901 lists each item name in alphabetical order in the index, and right column 1903 lists the corresponding instruction for processor 105 to carry out to access information on that item. For example, according to row 1905 of the table, the selection and activation of the item name \u201cAIR CONDITIONING\u201d causes processor 105 to connect the user to the CLIMATE CONTROL screen of FIG. 15 previously described., 104365=As shown in FIG. 15, the MODE options include OFF option 1511, AUTO option 1513, A/C option 1515, HEAT option 1517, and SMART CLIMATE option 1519. It should be noted that only one of the MODE options can be active at a time. In this example, assuming that the voice is enabled, when OFF option 1151 is selected by a first touch, a voice explaining the option comes on, uttering \u201cTo disable climate control.\u201d A second touch on the same option would then shut the climate control off through climate control interface 108 f., 96936=As also shown in FIG. 11, a view of the interior of the automobile from the driver's perspective is provided. Underneath that view, DASH-MOUNTED CONTROLS option 1103, INSTRUMENT PANEL option 1105, AUDIO SYSTEM option 1107, CLIMATE CONTROLS option 1109 and PREVIOUS option 1111 are displayed. By default, DASH-MOUNTED CONTROLS option is highlighted yellow. However, the user in this example decides to select INSTRUMENT PANEL option 1105, instead. By touching option 1105 on screen 209, the option is highlighted yellow. If VOICE option is not disabled, after a predetermined delay, an announcement such as \u201cTo provide information on gauges, meters and warning lights\u201d comes on to preview the purpose or content of option 1105. Options 1103, 1107, and 1109 are similarly programmed. In this instance, selecting PREVIOUS option 1111 enables the user to return to the MAIN MENU screen of FIG. 10., 100299=FIG. 13 shows VOICE option 1301 similar to option 1101 described before, TIP option 1303, a tachometer of the automobile denoted 1305, warning lights collectively denoted 1307, and options 1309 a through 1309 f in display segment 1311., 98666=In accordance with another feature of the invention, individual elements on the instrument panel shown in FIG. 12 are labeled with numerals \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201c4\u201d and \u201c5\u201d which correspond to option 1201 a designated \u201c1. TACHOMETER AND WARNING LIGHTS\u201d, option 1201 b designated \u201c2. TURN SIGNAL/HAZARD WARNING\u201d, option 1201 c designated \u201c3. SPEEDOMETER AND WARNING LIGHTS\u201d, option 1201 e designated \u201c4. ODOMETER & TRIP METERS/OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE\u201d, and option 1201 f designated \u201c5. FUEL/TEMP GAUGE AND WARNING LIGHTS\u201d, respectively. As such, the function of the displayed options is two-fold. First, the wording on each displayed option informs the user of what the corresponding element(s) represents. Second, each displayed option is also for selection to obtain more information about the corresponding element(s). In addition, with the above voice preview feature, the user is further apprised of the purpose or content of the option before he/she commits to it. For example, TACHOMETER AND WARNING LIGHTS option 1201 a corresponds to a voice preview such as \u201cTo provide information on tachometer and malfunction, maintenance required, low oil pressure and charging system failure indicators.\u201d, 113188=Using INDEX option 1001 e of FIG. 10 to look up information on and/or to control various items in the automobile will now be described. After option 1001 e is activated, a DATA ENTRY screen illustrated in FIG. 17 is exhibited on screen 209. As shown in FIG. 17, a message \u201cEnter Letter Or Item Name\u201d appears to prompt the user for an entry of the name of the item of interest or its beginning letter. For this purpose, entry options for letters A through Z arranged in a grid format are provided in section 1701 for selection. In addition, DONE option 1703, when activated, indicates to system 100 that the entry is completed. Subdisplay 1705 is used to echo the user's entry to ensure its correctness., 106785=SMART CLIMATE option 1519 is designed to allow the user to program the climate control for the next ride before he/she leaves the vehicle. When SMART CLIMATE option 1519 is selected by a first touch, a voice comes on to explain the option, uttering \u201cTo enable pre-heating or pre-cooling of vehicle.\u201d A second touch on the option activates the function, followed by a voice utterance, \u201cSet desired temperature. Set desired time using fan speed arrows.\u201d Temperature display 1535 then flashes the current temperature setting, prompting the user to set a desired temperature. Similarly, fan speed display 1541 then flashes the current date, followed by current time, prompting the user to set the date and time that the user plans to reenter the vehicle. Through climate control interface 108 f, processor 105 determines whether the current level of power from the car battery and any back-up power sources is sufficient. If it is insufficient, a message such as \u201cFail to pre-condition vehicle temperature\u201d is issued through audio interface 118 to notify the user of the noncompliance. Otherwise, when it is close to the re-entry time, processor 105 determines the start-up time to effect the pre-conditioning, depending on the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the vehicle at that time. Processor 105 would then cause a combination of heaters and/or heat pumps (not shown) connected to interface 108 f to pre-condition the vehicle temperature. In order to avoid substantially draining the power, in this illustrative embodiment, the requested temperature would be maintained up to an hour after the set re-entry time., 94408=When the MAIN MENU screen comes on, by default, DRIVER'S VIEW option 1001 a is highlighted yellow, indicating that it is selected. However, the user may touch any other displayed option on screen 209 for re-selection. A further touch on the yellow highlighted option changes its color to blue and activates same. Again, the user may alternatively maneuver PUSH TO SELECT knob 205 d to re-select any other displayed option, followed by a depression of ENTER switch 205 b to activate the selected option. Since LCD screen 209 is compact, the display area for each option on the MAIN MENU screen is generally small. As a result, selection and activation of an option by touching the option on the screen is susceptible to errors, especially when the vehicle is in motion. Thus, in this situation it may be preferable to achieve the same result using knob 205 d and switch 205 b, instead., 100034=Assuming that the user in this instance activates option 1201 a, in response processor 105 causes a \u201cTACHOMETER AND WARNING LIGHTS\u201d screen to be displayed on screen 209. Such a screen is illustrated in FIG. 13., 111549=In personalizing the vehicle, preference interface 116 monitors any user adjustments to certain vehicle functions by comparing their current settings with the corresponding stored preferences in memory 115. Thus, for example, if the user changes any of the settings relating to the climate control such as the mode, vent, air, temperature, fan speed, etc. from its previous preferred setting, preference interface 116 causes a SAVE screen to appear on screen 209. This SAVE screen is illustrated in FIG. 16. As shown in FIG. 16, the user is prompted to save the change in the setting that he/she has just made. The user at this point may activate SAVE option 1601 to change the previous preferred setting. The SAVE screen thereafter disappears in favor of the previous screen. Otherwise, he/she may activate CLOSE option 1603 to close the SAVE screen, without storing the latest setting, which is then treated as a temporary setting. In the latter case, for example, a restart of the automobile will obliterate such a temporary setting, and reinstate the stored preferred setting., 96283=Continuing the example, after hearing the preview of option 1001 a, the user decides to select that option. In response, processor 105 causes a \u201cDRIVER'S VIEW\u201d screen to be displayed on screen 209. Such a screen is illustrated in FIG. 11. When the DRIVER'S VIEW screen appears, VOICE option 1101 is highlighted blue, indicating that voice announcements are active. To disable the voice announcements, the user may touch VOICE option 1101 on screen 209, or alternatively press ENTER switch 205 b. VOICE option 1101 would be highlighted yellow when disabled.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Finally, although information and control system 100, as disclosed, is embodied in the form of various discrete functional blocks, the system could equally well be embodied in an arrangement in which the functions of any one or more of those blocks or indeed, all of the functions thereof, are realized, for example, by one or more appropriately programmed processors or devices. Moreover, in the disclosed embodiment, system 100 is illustratively used in an automobile.
