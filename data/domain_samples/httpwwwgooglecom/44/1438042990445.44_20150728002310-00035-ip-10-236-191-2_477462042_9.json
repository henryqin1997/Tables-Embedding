    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6416=A VoIP MTA (Multimedia Terminal Adapter) is also known in the art, operative to convert IP protocol carrying telephony signals into POTS telephone set interface. Examples of such a VoIP MTA supporting four POTS telephone sets are MediaPack\u2122 Series MP-104/FXS of AudioCodes Ltd. In Yehud, Israel and two-ports Voice Service Gateway model DVG-1120 from D-Link\ufffd Systems, Inc. of Irvine, Calif., USA. A system 60 shown in FIG. 6 demonstrates the use of such VoIP MTAs 64. The system 60 is identical to system 50, except for replacing the IP phones 54 b and 54 c with POTS telephone sets 17 a and 17 b. In order to enable the usage of these telephone sets 17 a and 17 b, respective VoIP MTAs 64 a and 64 b are added as the mediation devices between the analog telephony and the IP telephony. The addition of MTAs 64 allows for the same basic system functionality, although POTS telephones 17 are used rather than IP telephones 54. The combination of telephone set 17 connected to VoIP MTA 64 allows connection to an IP network, in the same manner that the IP telephone 54 is connected thereto, and providing similar functionality. EP 0824298 to Harper teaches an example a network conforming to such a system.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{80914=The PLC modem 82 uses the well-known technique of frequency domain/division multiplexing (FDM), and provides means for splitting the bandwidth carried by a wire into a low-frequency band capable of carrying an analog telephony signal and a high-frequency band capable of carrying data communication or other signals. Examples of relevant prior-art in this field are the technology commonly known as HomePNA (Home Phoneline Networking Alliance), WO 99/12330 to Foley and as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,443 to Dichter (hereinafter referred to as \u201cDichter\u201d). Dichter and others suggest a method and apparatus for applying a frequency domain/division multiplexing (FDM) technique for residential telephone wiring, enabling the simultaneous carrying of telephony and data communication signals. The available bandwidth over the wiring is split into a low-frequency band capable of carrying an analog telephony signal and the ADSL signals, and a high-frequency band capable of carrying home network communication signals. In such a mechanism, telephony and ADSL are not affected, while a home networking communication capability is provided over existing telephone wiring within a house. WO 01/71980 published Sep. 27, 2001 entitled \u201cTelephone Outlet and System for a Local Area Network Over Telephone Lines\u201d and WO 03/005691 published Jan. 16, 2003 entitled \u201cTelephone outlet with packet telephony adapter, and a network using same\u201d both in the name the present inventor and assigned to the present assignee, and which are incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein, describe home networking over telephone wiring, based on outlets, which allows for conducting of digital telephony data as well as POTS and ADSL signals over in-house telephony wiring. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,893 to Whittaker et al. teaches an IP-based telephony network based on telephone wiring., 62003=This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/492,411, which is a U.S. National-Phase Application of PCT/IL2004/000178, filed on Feb. 24, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 77350=Implementing a network 70 in existing buildings typically requires installation of new wiring infrastructure 73. Such installation of new wiring may be impractical, expensive and hassle-oriented. As a result, many technologies (referred to as \u201cno new wires\u201d technologies) have been proposed in order to facilitate a LAN in a building without adding new wiring. Some of these techniques use existing wiring used also for other purposes such as telephone, electricity, cable television, and so forth. Doing so offers the advantage of being able to install such systems and networks without the additional and often substantial cost of installing separate wiring within the building. In order to facilitate multiple use of wiring within a building, specialized outlets are sometimes installed, which allow access to the wiring for multiple purposes. An example of home networking over coaxial cables using outlets is described in WO 02/065229 published 22 Aug., 2002 entitled: \u2018Cableran Networking over Coaxial Cables\u2019 to Cohen et al., 120276=Furthermore, although the invention has been described as relating to networks based on continuous electrical conducting medium (telephone, CATV, or electrical power), and the relevant modem and associated circuitry are connected in parallel to the wiring infrastructure, the invention can be applied equally to the case wherein the wiring is not continuous, but is in discrete segments. Such an arrangement is disclosed in WO 0007322 published Feb. 10, 2000 and entitled \u201cLocal Area Network of Serial Intelligent Cells\u201d in the name of the present inventor and assigned to the present assignee, which is incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, it will be appreciated that many variations, modifications, derivatives, combinations and other applications of the invention may be made. While the invention has been described with respect to a home network, it will be appreciated that the invention equally applies to any in-house network connected to an external network. Local area networks (LAN) within offices, factories or enterprises can equally use the invention. Furthermore, although the invention has been described as relating to networks based on continuous electrical conducting medium (telephone, CATV, or electrical power), and the relevant modem and associated circuitry are connected in parallel to the wiring infrastructure, the invention can be applied equally to the case wherein the wiring is not continuous, but is in discrete segments.

Although the invention has been so far described as relating to Ethernet/IP-based home networking, the invention can be similarly applied to any type of data network. Furthermore, although packet networks are the most common for local area networks and wide area networks, the invention is not restricted to packet networks",
