As in the case of its previously described counterpart 10, the front-to-rear dimension of the notebook computer 10a may be reduced due to the unique vertical stacking of the pointing device 34a under the keyboard structure 70 in its forwardly shifted storage and transport orientation, the palm rest portion of the computer 10a is comfortably lowered relative to the keyboard structure 70 in its use orientation, and the keyboard structure provides enhanced typing comfort due to its rearwardly and upwardly tilted use orientation. The keyboard structure 70 provides further typing comfort due to its upwardly dished configuration. The keyboard structure 70 is electrically coupled to the electronic circuitry 58a within the base housing 12a by means of a flexible ribbon cable member 60a having the indicated service loop therein. When the keyboard structure 70 is moved to its FIG. 5B storage and transport orientation, and the lid housing 26a closed, a pair of outwardly projecting tabs 84 on the front side 86 of the lid housing 26a are brought into close adjacency with left and right top side edge portions 88,90 of the keyboard structure 70 to define shields that horizontally overlie and protect the keys 38a disposed adjacent these side edge",
