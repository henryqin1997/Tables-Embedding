As discussed more fully below, if necessary, the tubular body 312 is cut by the physician so that the length of the device 310 is preferably approximately 0.2-1.0 cm less than the patient's measured urethral length, more preferably about 0.60 cm less than the patient's measured urethral length. Typical ranges for the outside diameter of tubular body 312 are preferably approximately 0.20-0.80 cm, more preferably 0.40-0.60 cm. Typical ranges for the outside diameter of the second anchor 316 are preferably approximately 0.50-1.0 cm, more preferably 0.60-0.90 cm. Typical ranges for the wall thickness of the tubular body of the device 310 are approximately 0.30-0.80 mm, preferably about 0.40-0.60 mm, and more preferably about 0.50 mm., 107036=The dimensions of the introducer 580 largely depend on anatomic considerations, the size of the device being inserted through the introducer, and the material used to construct the introducer. The length of the upper surface 583 of the introducer 580 is preferably approximately 8.0-14.0 cm, more preferably about 12.0 cm. As illustrated in FIG. 55, the length of the upper surface 583 is preferably greater than the length of the lower surface 584 so that the first end 581 slopes upwardly relative to the longitudinal axis of the introducer 580 at approximately a 30\ufffd angle. The outer diameter of the introducer 580 is preferably approximately 0.50-1.0 cm, more preferably about 0.70 cm. The wall thickness of the introducer 580 is preferably approximately 0.30-1.0 mm, more preferably about 0.50 mm. If an atraumatic tip 587 is included, it preferably extends longitudinally along the wall of the introducer 580 approximately 1.0-3.0 mm, more preferably about 2.0 mm., 25438=This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/917,573, filed on Aug. 11, 1997, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/696,333, filed Aug. 13, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,982,916, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although this invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments which will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein are also within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by reference to the appended claims. As needed, the devices of the present invention can be removed from the patient and replaced as previously discussed. Because the device 310 does not contain any protruding sharp or rigid elements, if an emergency arises, such as an obstruction, the device 310 can be pushed into the bladder using a conventional catheter, such as a Foley catheter without causing damage to the urethra or bladder. The device 310 can remain in the bladder without causing any complications until the patient is able to see their physician for removal and replacement of the device. The devices of the present invention, such as device 310, can also be positioned within the urinary tract fluoroscopically. As discussed above, after measuring the urethral length, the tubular body of the device is cut to length by the physician. The bladder is filled with contrast fluid. The distal end of the device 310 is releasably engaged using grasping forceps 225 as discussed above. The outside of the device 310 is lubricated with a water soluble lubricant, such as K-Y jelly and gently withdrawn",
