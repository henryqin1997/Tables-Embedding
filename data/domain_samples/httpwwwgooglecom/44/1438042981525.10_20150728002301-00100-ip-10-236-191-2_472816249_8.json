    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{15507=Such a compound and a device in the form of a planar waveguide are described in European Patent Application EP 254921, in which a fundamental light wave is generated by means of an YAG laser having a wavelength of 1064 nm. Crystalline methylnitroaniline (MNA) is used as the nonlinear optical compound. By means of the device, green light having a wavelength of 532 nm is obtained. The light wave thus obtained, whose frequency is doubled, is called second harmonic wave., 30178=In European Patent Application EP 262680, a NLO medium is described which is manufactured by heating a liquid crystalline polymer to an isotropic phase, after which the polymer is quickly cooled. The medium this obtained is isotropic and can only be used for third-order nonlinear optical response due to the lack of a polar order of the NLO compounds. Frequency-doubling (second order NLO effect) cannot be obtained with such a medium. The NLO compounds and NLO media according to the invention are not liquid crystalline., 59087=A mixture of 100 g of 4-nitrobifenyl (0.5 mol), 1300 ml of acetic acid and 130 g of iron are refluxed for 20 hours. After cooling, the mixture is filtered and poured into 3 l of ice/water. The product is extracted with 2\ufffd500 ml of CHCl3. The organic layer is washed twice with 250 ml of water, after which it is dried and evaporated. The resulting solid product is recrystallised from 96% ethanol. The yield is 89 g of substance XXIII (85%)., 40922=2.8 g of N,N-dimethylaniline are added to a mixture of 8.26 g of substance V (0.019 mol) in dry CH2 Cl2. After cooling to 0\ufffd C., 24 g of methacryloylchloride in 25 ml of dry CH2 Cl2 are added dropwise. The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 days at room temperature, after which 500 ml of ice water are added. The product VI is extracted with CH2 Cl2 and the organic layers are washed with in succession water (3x); 0.1 N H2 SO4 (3x); water (3x) and subsequently dried over MgSO4 and evaporated, yielding 7.4 g of the crude substance VI. Column chromatography over Al2 O3 (activity II/III) with CH2 Cl2 yields 2.75 g of pure solid white substance VI. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (CDCl3) gives the following results: \u03b40.9 (t, 3 H), 1.05-1.95 (m, 16 H), 1.95 (q, 3 H), 3.05 (t, 2 H), 4.0 (t, 2 H), 4.15 (t, 2 H), 5.5 (m, 1 H), 6.1 (m, 1 H), 6.7-7.8 (m, 10 H)., 49437=1.08 g (12 mmol) of acryloyl chloride in 10 ml of dry CH2 Cl2 are added dropwise to a cooled solution of 4.6 g (10 mmol) of substance XX, 1.52 g (12 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline and 500 ml of dry CH2 Cl2. The reaction mixture is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 5 days, after which 300 ml of water was added. The product is extracted with CH2 Cl2 and the organic layers are washed with water (3x); 0.1 N H2 SO4 (3x); 2% of NaHCO3 (3x) and water (3x) after which it is dried over MgSO4 and evaporated at room temperature. Pure acrylate XXI is obtained after crystallisation from toluene. The yield is 2.21 g. The melting point is 275\ufffd C. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (CDCl3) gives the following results: \u03b4 0.95 (t, 3 H), 0.9-1.85 (m, 8 H), 2.95 (s, 3 H), 3.05 (t, 2 H), 3.4 (t, 3 H), 4.2 (t, 2 H), 5.6-6.7 (m, 3 H), 6.7-8.0 (m, 16 H)., 56076=FIG. 4 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a device for doubling the frequency of a light wave. A glass substrate 30 is provided with strip-shaped ITO electrodes 32 which are all grounded. Said electrodes have a width of approximately 10 \u03bcm and the interspace between them is also approximately 10 \u03bcm. A buffer layer 34 of PMMA having a thickness of 1 \u03bcm is applied to the ITO electrodes and the glass substrate by means of spin coating a 10% by weight solution of PMMA in chlorobenzene. A layer 36 having a thickness of 2 \u03bcm is applied to said PMMA layer by means of spin coating a 5% by weight solution of NLO polymer VII (x=0.5, y=0.5), in chlorobenzene. In the same manner, a second buffer layer 38 of PMMA having a thickness of 1 \u03bcm is applied to said NLO layer 36. To prevent dissolution of the already applied polymer layers by a spin coating solution, said polymer layers can be provided with a thin barrier layer, for example, of polysiloxane. A coupling-in prism 40 and a coupling-out prism 42 are provided on the NLO layer 36. Apart from the inventive NLO polymer used, the above-described construction of the device is known from an article by A. Buckley et al. in Nato Advanced Research Workshop \"Non-linear optical effects in organic polymers\", Sophia Antipolis, France, June 1988. By means of the strip-shaped ITO electrodes 32 the NLO polymer layer 36 can be poled in accordance with a pattern to form poled areas 44. The molecules in the areas 44 of the NLO layer 36 are poled by heating the composition shown to approximately 127\ufffd C. and, subsequently, subjecting it to a corona discharge. The order of the NLO molecules is frozen-in during cooling, while maintaining the corona discharge. After said operation has been completed, poled areas 44 and unpoled areas 46 are formed in the NLO layer 36. This patterned poling is necessary for the NLO layer to meet the \"phase matching\" requirement, and is explained further in the above-mentioned article by A. Buckley et al. A beam of laser light 12 having a wavelength of 820 nm which emanates from a GaAs laser (not shown) enters into the NLO layer 36 via the coupling-in prism 40. Blue light is generated in the first poled area 44 through which the beam passes, and in the following unpoled area 46 \"phase-matching\" without second harmonic generation takes place. This process takes place a number of times after which the beam emerges via the coupling-out prism 42. The emerging beam 18 contains blue light having a wavelength of 410 nm., 59611=56.25 g of substance XXIV is dissolved in 150 ml DMSO, to which 20 g of powdered KOH is added. The mixture is cooled in ice. Over a period of 20 minutes, 50 of CH3 I is added slowly, so that the temperature stays below 30\ufffd C. The mixture is stirred for 5 hours at room temperature and then poured into water. The residue is filtered and washed with water. After recrystallisation from a 1:1 mixture of 96% ethanol and water, 46 g of crystals of substance XXIV are isolated (yield 82%)., 51206=The hyperpolarisability \u03b2 of the NLO compounds obtained is determined by means of the EFISH (electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation) method. Said method is described in the above-mentioned article by D. J. Williams. The \u03b2-measurements are carried out by means of a Nd:YAG laser having a wavelength of 1.9 \u03bcm, the NLO compounds being dissolved in, for example, dioxan. To measure the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility \u03c7.sup.(2), the same measuring arrangement is used, but the measuring operation is carried out at a laser wavelength of 1.064 \u03bcm (Nd:YAG laser). A quartz crystal is used as the reference for the measurements. To determine the \u03c7.sup.(2) of the polymers, said polymers are dissolved in CHCl3, after which the solution is spin coated onto a quartz substrate which is provided with a ITO (indium-tinoxide) electrode. The thickness of the film layer is approximately 1 \u03bcm. The layer is poled by means of the above-mentioned corona-poling method. Measuring \u03c7.sup.(2) takes place during the poling process. The determination \u03c7.sup.(2) of the NLO compounds dissolved in PMMA is carried out in the same manner. The dipole moment \u03bco of the molecules is determined in a standard manner by measuring the dielectric constant of the solutions of the NLO compounds in dioxan. In the relevant literature the value of \u03b2 is expressed in esu units, with 1 esu=4.1888\ufffd1010 m4 /V. The value of \u03c7.sup.(2) is expressed in pm/V, with 1 pm/V= 2.387\ufffd10-9 esu., 38550=The crude substance II is heated to 110\ufffd C. together with some triethyl phosphite. More triethyl phosphite (overall quantity 45 g, 0.27 mol) is added in 10 minutes at a temperature of 105\ufffd-115\ufffd C. Subsequently, the mixture is heated for half an hour at the same temperature. After it has cooled, a part (approximately 70%) of this crude reaction mixtures is distributed to a Al2 O3 chromatrographic column using toluene/hexane, toluene and chloroform as an eluent. In order of elution appear, in succession, a small quantity of the starting product I, 45 g of a 1:1 mixture of substance I and the desired phosphonate III and 15 g of the pure phosphonate III., 58734=Compound XXXII has values of \u03b2 of 10\ufffd10-30 esu at 1907 nm, 35\ufffd10-30 esu at 1064 nm, and of 105.19 10-30 esu at 810 nm. \u03bbmax and \u03bbcut-off are 340 nm and 410 nm, respectively. The synthesis of compound XXXII is shown in FIG. 5., 43227=The synthesis of the polymer of type XXII, the preparation of which is diagrammatically shown in FIG. 2, is shown as an example of NLO polymers based on the sulphone group as an electron acceptor, the amino group as an electron donor and an extensive \u03c0-conjugated system. The wavelength at which the absorption is maximal is (\u03bbmax) 410 nm and the wavelength above which there is no appreciable absorption (\u03bbcut-off) is 500 nm. In contrast to corresponding known NLO polymers comprising a nitro group or cyano group as the electron acceptor, the doubling of the frequency of laser light from 1064 nm to 532 nm can be readily attained by means of the NLO polymers in question., 62474=Compound XXIX has values of \u03b2 of 11\ufffd10-30 esu at 1907 nm, 39\ufffd10-30 esu at 1064 nm, and of 110\ufffd10-30 esu at 810 nm. \u03bbmax and \u03bbcut-off are 342 n, and 405 nm, respectively. The value of \u03bco is 6.0 D. The synthesis of compound XXIX is shown in FIG. 6.}",
