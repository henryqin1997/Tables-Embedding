    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0042] Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the apparatus and methods of the present invention may be constructed and implemented in other ways and embodiments. Accordingly, the description herein should not be read as limiting the present invention, as other embodiments also fall within the scope of the present invention. [0041] Even though EL panels do not emit any substantial electromagnetic radiation and use little power, the power supply, including wiring to the EL device, may produce undesirable electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, the EL driver 22 and wiring 28 to the EL panel 20 preferably comprise low electromagnetic interference (EMI) components to minimize the amount of electromagnetic radiation produced by the system. Additionally, an electromagnetic shield to further protect the sensitivity of the compass needle may optionally be provided between the battery/driver circuitry and the EL device/compass needle. [0040] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the EL driver is selected from a commercially made EL driver manufacturer. For example, EL drivers and EL lamps are available through BKL Inc., Burr Ridge, Ill. A simplified schematic of a typical driver circuit is shown in FIG. 3. A battery 224 supplies power to a voltage booster",
