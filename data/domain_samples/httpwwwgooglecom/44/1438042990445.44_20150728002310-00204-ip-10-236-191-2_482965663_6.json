Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description. It is therefore intended that the appended claims encompass any such modifications or embodiments. While FIGS. 9 and 11 have depicted the matched sets of component as including two chip assemblies and five chip assemblies, respectively, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that any number of chip assemblies may be utilized in such a matched set. The specific number of chip assemblies will be selected based upon the desired functionality of the matched set. The testing process of the present invention provides for each of the components of a matched set, regardless of the number, to be tested together as part of a single wafer-interposer assembly. As such, the components for matched set are selected to be assembled together only after successful testing. As best seen in FIG. 11, a matched set of components may be mounted on a substrate 310 that has a plurality of conductive layers 312 and dielectric layers 314. Specifically, chip assemblies 282, 284, 286 and 288 may be mounted together on a substrate 310 with chip assembly 292. Chip assemblies 282, 284, 286 and",
