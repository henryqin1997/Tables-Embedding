In such a method, identity information is received for a user attempting to log into the system 1502. This can be any arbitrary information used by any identity management system to validate a user. The identity information is provided to a set of authentication APIs that each are operable to act as an interface for a respective identity management system 1504. The user is then validated for at least one identity management system 1506, else denied access to the secure enterprise system. For a valid user, a call back is made into the appropriate identity management system(s) to obtain security roles, groups, and other information associated with the user 1508.

The network may can be any type of network familiar to those skilled in the art that can support data communications using any of a variety of commercially-available protocols, including without limitation TCP/IP, SNA, IPX, AppleTalk, and the like. Merely by way of example, the network 4210 can be a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), such as an Ethernet network, a Token-Ring network and/or the like; a wide-area network; a virtual network, including without limitation a virtual private network (\u201cVPN\u201d); the Internet; an intranet; an extranet; a public switched telephone network (\u201cPSTN\u201d); an infra-red network; a wireless network (e.g., a network operating under any of the IEEE 802.11 suite of protocols, GRPS, GSM, UMTS, EDGE, 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, Wimax, WiFi, CDMA 2000, WCDMA, the Bluetooth protocol known in the art, and/or any other wireless protocol); and/or any combination of these and/or other networks., 32078=U.S. patent application No. ______, filed ______, entitled \u201cSEARCH HIT URL MODIFICATION FOR SECURE APPLICATION INTEGRATION,\u201d [ATTY DOCKET 021756-034400US];, 33195=U.S. patent application No. ______, filed ______, entitled \u201cMINIMUM LIFESPAN CREDENTIALS FOR CRAWLING DATA REPOSITORIES,\u201d [ATTY DOCKET 021756-035000US]; and, 103807=When a crawl of this source is initiated in this example, SES will first call the agent to start crawling and fetch URLs. At this time, the crawler plug-in fetches the first valid email user from OID 1208 and uses an API such as the OCSEmailWSClient API 1212 to get all the email folders and download all messages in the folder. The SES crawler will add one DocumentMetaData object which contains the URL for each message or folder to its queue. The DocumentMetaData is returned through the fetch call later when the plug-in checks for the next message in the current user. It then processes the message by downloading the body. The email body is submitted through DocumentContainer object by the crawler plug-in. The crawler framework can handle the email parsing including extracting the attributes like \u201cauthor\u201d, \u201cfrom\u201d, \u201cto\u201d and process the attachments. This process is repeated until all the messages under all folders under the user are fetched, then is repeated for the next user obtained from the OID 1208. Once all users and all events are processed, a null is returned for the fetch call, which instructs the SES crawler plug-in to start processing the documents for indexing purposes., 32666=U.S. patent application No. ______, filed ______, entitled \u201cSECURE SEARCH PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT,\u201d [ATTY DOCKET 021756-034700US];, 32278=U.S. patent application No. ______, filed ______, entitled \u201cSUGGESTED CONTENT WITH ATTRIBUTE PARAMETERIZATION,\u201d [ATTY DOCKET 021756-034500US];, 33019=U.S. patent application No. ______, filed ______, entitled \u201cSELF-SERVICE SOURCES FOR SECURE SEARCH,\u201d [ATTY DOCKET 021756-034900US];, 31713=U.S. patent application Ser.
