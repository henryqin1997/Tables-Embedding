If one separating unit does not, for example, have the required throughput, a plurality of separating units 1 can supply the buffer pockets 3 in parallel. In this case, the additional plane of the pocket ring 5 is located above the plane of the buffer storage unit 2 in one system and, in the other system, it is located below the plane of the buffer storage unit 2. Only a small base area is therefore required. . FIG. 6 If a second individual organizing system B is rotated 180\ufffd about its vertical axis and the portion of the pocket ring 5 thereof not overlapping the collector belt 7 is folded in the opposite manner, the two systems A and B can be fitted together as shown in there is at the plane junction a 540\ufffd deflection over the interior of the system. Outside the overlap area it is possible to identify exit points 10 of the buffer storage unit 2 for loading the pockets 6, unloading stations 11 for additionally ejecting mail items 4 from the pockets 6 according to specified sorting criteria, a loading station 12 for loading the buffer pockets with the mail items from the separating unit 1, and an exit point 13 of the buffer storage",
