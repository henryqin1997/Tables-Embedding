As properly understood, the preceding description of specific embodiments is illustrative only and in no way restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated solely by the appended claims as follows. Stepping back to query step 800, if the payee bank is not a clearing bank or correspondent bank, process step 810 sends the check image to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) serving as the clearing entity for the bank of first deposit. That branch of the Federal Reserve Bank forwards the check image to the Federal Reserve Bank serving as the clearing agent for the maker bank. That Federal Reserve Bank determines in query step 811 if the maker bank requires a paper duplicate of the original paper check. If the maker bank requires a paper item, the FRB prints the paper item in process step 812, incorporates the duplicate check in their processing systems as depicted in process step 813 where the item is sent in path 814 to process step 815 where the maker bank receives the paper item. If in query step 811 the maker bank does not require a paper check, the FRB sends the image to the maker bank that receives the image in process step 815 and passes, via path 816, either the check image or printed duplicate of",
