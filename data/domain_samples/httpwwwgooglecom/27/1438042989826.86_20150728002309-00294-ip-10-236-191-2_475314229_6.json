    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The expected advantage of a simple operating procedure at the operating handle structure and the needle disengagement during the stitching and needle transfer process was achieved. The dimensions of the stitching head of a prototype model of the inventive apparatus described herein were very small as desired. The length of the stitching head, for example, was 17 mm. The length of the movable mouthpiece was 12 mm. Both mouthpieces had a thickness of only about 1.5 mm. The stitching head was movable through an instrument channel with an inner diameter of 5 mm and could be operated successfully. First, the stitching needle 4 which is attached to one end of the stitching thread is placed longitudinally between the closed or almost closed mouthpieces 2, 3 and eventually is engaged at one of its tips between the two ribbed surfaces 30. Then the stitching instrument is inserted through the instrument channel to the stitching location. During this process the stitching thread is pulled along through the tubes 16, 27. At the stitching location the movable mouthpiece 3 is opened and the stitching needle 4 is inserted by means of a grasping instrument extending through another instrument channel into one of the clamping structures, preferably into the stationary mouthpiece 2, since this can be opened and closed from without. At this point, a first stitch can be made through the tissue to be sutured. Then the movable mouthpiece",
