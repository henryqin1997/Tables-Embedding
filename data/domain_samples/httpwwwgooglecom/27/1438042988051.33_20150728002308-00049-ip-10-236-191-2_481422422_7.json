Tautzenberger et al, Anwendung von Memory-Legierungen in elektrischen Schaltgeraten, Zeitschrift Metall, January 1985) to use shape memory alloys in electrical switchgear and thereby to make use of the one-way effect or the two-way effect of a shape memory alloy for switching an electrical current., 26062=At temperatures above the first deformation initiation temperature As, that is to say when the wire is in the heated state, the shape memory alloy has an austenitic microstructure, wherein the standardised diameter dK of a crystalline grain has a characteristic value. In a nickel-titanium alloy the standardised diameter dK of the grain is approximately 0.25 mm (S. Eucken: Progress in Shape Memory Alloys, DGM 1992, p. 178). If the diameter dD of the wire 7--as shown in FIG. 4--is approximately equal to the standardised diameter dK of the grain of the shape memory alloy used for the drive element, the reversible movement of the drive element is also sufficiently accurately reproducible over a large number of cycles--for example for 105 movement cycles. Using a nickel-titanium alloy, the diameter dD of the wire 7 is advantageously in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.4 mm. Furthermore, the capacity for reproduction of the reversible movement is improved in that the shortening occurring between the first deformation initiation temperature As and the first deformation termination temperature Af is relatively small. With a nickel-titanium alloy advantageously a shortening of only approximately 3% is involved.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. A winding body 40, advantageously provided with at least one bar 39, is used for producing the winding 8, which can be displaced over the two bolts 3 and 6 in order to mount the winding 8 in the housing 5, wherein after the winding 8 has been mounted in the housing 5, and before the initiation of the drive apparatus, the bar 39 is removed so that the two bolts 3 and 6 are moveable with respect to one another by means of the winding 8. Advantageously the bar 39 is provided with breaking points 41, by means of which the bar 39 can be removed by being broken off. Advantageously, the mechanical compensating element 36 is made from a polymer which is elastic, electrically insulating and temperature resistant, and in addition is a poor dissipator of heat. The compensating element 36 and the terminal 37 form an advantageous electrical connection means for the winding 8, in which a tensile stress \u03c3 occurring between the terminal 37 and the anchor",
