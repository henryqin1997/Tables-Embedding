    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{83263=Examples of reduction sensitizers and environments which may be used during precipitation or spectral/chemical sensitization to reduction sensitize an emulsion include ascorbic acid derivatives; tin compounds; polyamine compounds; and thiourea dioxide-based compounds described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,487,850; 2,512,925; and British Patent 789,823. Specific examples of reduction sensitizers or conditions, such as dimethylamineborane, stannous chloride, hydrazine, high pH (pH 8-11) and low pAg (pAg 1-7) ripening are discussed by S. Collier in Photographic Science and Engineering, 23, 113 (1979). Examples of processes for preparing intentionally reduction sensitized silver halide emulsions are described in EP 0 348934 A1 (Yamashita), EP 0 369491 (Yamashita), EP 0 371388 (Ohashi), EP 0 396424 A1 (Takada), EP 0 404142 A1 (Yamada), and EP 0 435355 A1 (Makino)., 92467=In a preferred embodiment the creation of the microdot pattern as a latent image is possible through appropriate temporal, spatial, and spectral exposure of the photosensitive materials to visible or nonvisible wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The latent image microdot pattern can be rendered detectable by employing standard photographic chemical processing. The microdots are particularly useful for both color and black-and-white image-forming photographic media. Such photographic media will contain at least one silver halide radiation sensitive layer, although typically such photographic media contain at least three silver halide radiation sensitive layers. It is also possible that such media contain more than one layer sensitive to the same region of radiation. The arrangement of the layers may take any of the forms known to one skilled in the art, as discussed in Research Disclosure 37038 of February 1995., 54573=The biaxially oriented sheets of the invention preferably have a water vapor permeability that is less than 0.85\ufffd10 g/mm2 /day. This allows faster emulsion hardening, as the laminated support of this invention greatly slows the rate of water vapor transmission from the emulsion layers during coating of the emulsions on the support. The transmission rate is measured by ASTM F1249., 89718=The laminated substrate of the invention may have copy restriction features incorporated such as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/598,785 filed Feb. 8, 1996 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,752,152. These applications disclose rendering a document copy restrictive by embedding into the document a pattern of invisible microdots. These microdots are, however, detectable by the electro-optical scanning device of a digital document copier. The pattern of microdots may be incorporated throughout the document. Such documents may also have colored edges or an invisible microdot pattern on the backside to enable users or machines to read and identify the media. The media may take the form of sheets that are capable of bearing an image. Typical of such materials are photographic paper and film materials composed of polyethylene resin coated paper, polyester, (poly)ethylene naphthalate, and cellulose triacetate based materials., 86405=In the following Table, reference will be made to (1) Research Disclosure, December 1978, Item 17643, (2) Research Disclosure, December 1989, Item 308119, and (3) Research Disclosure, September 1996, Item 38957, all published by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., Dudley Annex, 12a North Street, Emsworth, Hampshire PO10 7DQ, ENGLAND. The Table and the references cited in the Table are to be read as describing particular components suitable for use in the elements of the invention. The Table and its cited references also describe suitable ways of preparing, exposing, processing and manipulating the elements, and the images contained therein., 84145=The photographic elements of this invention may use emulsions doped with Group VIII metals such as iridium, rhodium, osmium, and iron as described in Research Disclosure, September 1996, Item 38957, Section I, published by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., Dudley Annex, 12a North Street, Emsworth, Hampshire PO10 7DQ, ENGLAND. Additionally, a general summary of the use of iridium in the sensitization of silver halide emulsions is contained in Carroll, \"Iridium Sensitization: A Literature Review,\" Photographic Science and Engineering, Vol. 24, No. 6, 1980. A method of manufacturing a silver halide emulsion by chemically sensitizing the emulsion in the presence of an iridium salt and a photographic spectral sensitizing dye is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,693,965. In some cases, when such dopants are incorporated, emulsions show an increased fresh fog and a lower contrast sensitometric curve when processed in the color reversal E-6 process as described in The British Journal of Photography Annual, 1982, pages 201-203., 82066=The photographic elements of the invention may utilize emulsions as described in The Theory of the Photographic Process, Fourth Edition, T. H. James, Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1977, pages 151-152. Reduction sensitization has been known to improve the photographic sensitivity of silver halide emulsions. While reduction sensitized silver halide emulsions generally exhibit good photographic speed, they often suffer from undesirable fog and poor storage stability.}",
