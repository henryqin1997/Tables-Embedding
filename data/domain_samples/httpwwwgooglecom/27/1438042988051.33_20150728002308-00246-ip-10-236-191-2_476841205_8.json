No. 454,545, filed Dec. 21, 1989, entitled \"An Epoxy/Polyimide Copolymer Blend Dielectric and Layered Circuits Incorporating It\" by C. W. Eichelberger, et al. Each of these Patents and Patent Applications is incorporated herein by reference., 36902=Briefly, in this high density interconnect structure, a ceramic substrate such as alumina which may be 25-100 mils thick and of appropriate size and strength for the overall system, is provided. This size is typically less than 2 inches square. Once the position of the various chips has been specified, individual cavities or one large cavity having appropriate depth at the intended locations of differing chips, is prepared. This may be done by starting with a bare substrate having a uniform thickness and the desired size. Conventional, laser or ultrasonic milling may be used to form the cavities in which the various chips and other components will be positioned. For many systems where it is desired to place chips edge-to-edge, a single large cavity is satisfactory. That large cavity may typically have a uniform depth where the semiconductor chips have a substantially uniform thickness. Where a particularly thick or a particularly thin component will be placed, the cavity bottom may be made respectively deeper or shallower to place the upper surface of the corresponding component in substantially the same plane as the upper surface of the rest of the components and the portion of the substrate which surrounds the cavity. The bottom of the cavity is then provided with a thermoplastic adhesive layer which may preferably be polyetherimide resin available under the trade name ULTEM\ufffd from the General Electric Company. The various components are then placed in their desired locations within the cavity, the entire structure is heated to the softening point of the ULTEM\ufffd polyetherimide (in the vicinity of 217\ufffd C. to 235\ufffd C. depending on the formulation used) and then cooled to thermoplastically bond the individual components to the substrate. Thereafter, a polyimide film which may be Kapton\ufffd polyimide, available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, which is \u22480.0005-0.003 inch (\u224812.5-75 microns) thick is pretreated to promote adhesion and coated on one side with the ULTEM\ufffd polyetherimide resin or another thermoplastic and laminated across the top of the chips, any other components and the substrate with the ULTEM\ufffd resin serving as a thermoplastic adhesive to hold the Kapton\ufffd in place. Thereafter, via holes are laser drilled in the Kapton\ufffd and ULTEM\ufffd layers in alignment with the contact pads on the electronic components to which it is desired to make contact. A metallization layer which is deposited over the Kapton\ufffd layer extends into the via holes and makes electrical contact to the contact pads disposed thereunder. This metallization layer may be patterned to form individual conductors during the process of depositing it or may be deposited as a continuous layer and then patterned using photoresist and etching. The photoresist is preferably exposed using a laser to provide an accurately aligned conductor pattern at the end of the process., 52264=Related application Ser. No. 07/504,821, filed Apr. 5, 1990 entitled \"High Density Interconnect Microwave Circuit Assembly\" by W. P. Kornrumpf et al. provides a potential solution to this problem by selectively removing the high density interconnect structure dielectric over components which are sensitive to the presence of that dielectric. However, such a procedure is not ideal for all components.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail herein in accord with certain preferred embodiments thereof, many modifications and changes therein may be effected by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The use of this top mounted technique is not limited to single high density interconnect structures as shown in FIGS. 2-5 or a single chip as shown in FIG. 6, but may also be applied to a 3-D structure comprising a plurality of flat high density interconnect structures which have been stacked one upon another to form a unitary structure and on which a second high density interconnect structure has been fabricated along a surface of that unitary structure at which the various layers of the unitary structure are exposed. That second high density interconnect structure interconnects the various first high density interconnect structures to form a complex overall system. One or more control or other chips may be mounted on top of that second high density interconnect structure to aid in testing or control or for any other appropriate purpose. Such a structure is shown schematically in FIG. 7 at 710. The structure 710 comprises a plurality of individual high density interconnect structures 720 which have been stacked together and stood on edge. The high density interconnect structure 730",
