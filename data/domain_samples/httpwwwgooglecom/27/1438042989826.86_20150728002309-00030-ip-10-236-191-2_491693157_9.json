As shown, cells 2200 are generally flowed in a main microchannel that includes at least two sets of opposing microchannels for focusing and/or otherwise directing the flow of cells 2200 using hydrodynamic flow 2202 (e.g., cell buffer flow). One set of opposing microchannels is typically located, e.g., upstream from detector 2204 for simultaneously introducing hydrodynamic flow 2202 from both microchannels to focus cells 2200, as described above. A second set of opposing microchannels is typically located downstream from detector 2204 for introducing at least one hydrodynamic flow 2202 so as to direct selected cells 2208 (e.g., fluorescently-labeled cells) and non-selected cells 2206 into, in this case, one of two microchannels, each terminating in particular collection wells 2210., 98688=One embodiment of Joule heating-based particle sorting is schematically illustrated in FIG. 24. As shown, particles are typically flowed from particle well 2400 into main microchannel 2402. In the configuration depicted, focusing microchannel 2404 intersects with main microchannel 2402 in a \u201cT-junction\u201d upstream from detector 2408. Similar to the device represented in FIG. 23 (discussed above), focusing flow stream 2406 is optionally used to focus or pinch the particles against the wall of main microchannel 2402 opposing the \u201cT-junction\u201d as the particles flow through detector 2408. When selected particle 2410 (e.g., a fluorescently-labeled particle) is detected, an electrical signal from detector 2408 typically triggers the flow of current to Joule heating electrodes 2416, which are disposed within wells of branched particle sorting microchannel 2418. Optionally, branched particle sorting microchannel 2418 includes more than two branches or is a single, unbranched microchannel. Additionally, greater or less than two Joule heating electrodes 2416 are optionally included. Although not shown in FIG. 24, conductive coatings are also optionally included in lieu of or in addition to the heating electrodes for effecting the flow of a focusing fluid., 162419=FIG. 17 depicts a chip employing a channel geometry that was used to conduct fluorescence population experiments to confirm the feasibility of the device as a microfluidic flow cytometer. The experiment entailed comparing microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing data obtained by flowing fluorescently-labeled calibration beads (Quantum 26 Fluorescein Microbeads Standards B-111698 from Flow Cytometry Standards Corp.) through the microfluidic flow cytometer (both focused and unfocused) with data provided in a certificate of calibration that accompanied the beads. Flow Cytometry Standards Corp. obtained the calibration data by flowing the same type of bead through a traditional flow cytometer., 135174=Microfluidic devices and assay components which are optionally adapted to the present invention are described in various PCT applications and issued U.S. Patents, such as, U.S. Pat.

Jensen) issued Sep. 28, 1999; and published PCT applications, such as, WO 98/00231, WO 98/00705, WO 98/00707, WO 98/02728, WO 98/05424, WO 98/22811, WO 98/45481, WO 98/45929, WO 98/46438, and WO 98/49548, WO 98/55852, WO 98/56505, WO 98/56956, WO 99/00649, WO 99/10735, WO 99/12016, WO 99/16162, WO 99/19056, WO 99/19516, WO 99/29497, WO 99/31495, WO 99/34205, WO 99/43432, and WO 99/44217, which are all incorporated herein by reference., 88230=For example, methods employing electrostatic forces to transport and focus samples generally involve inducing sample flow in a transport channel by applying a first electrical potential to the channel. Thereafter, a second electrical potential is typically applied to focusing channels that intersect with the transport channel in a cross-configuration to vertically focus the transported sample in the enter of the transport channel. This electrokinetic-based system is also optionally utilized to direct or \u201cnudge\u201d flowing samples to effect a sorting function, e.g., by applying an electrical potential to at least one of the intersecting focusing channels to direct sample flow towards or away from that focusing channel and into, e.g., an additional intersecting channel or into a channel region. That is, electrokinetic force can be applied to \u201cnudge\u201d materials across the width of a first channel at an intersection of the first channel and a second channel, resulting in downstream focusing of materials in the channel. This application of electrokinetic force is optionally electrokinetic, electroosmotic, or both. See also, e.g., Ramsey et al., \u201cApparatus and Method for Performing Electrodynamic Focusing on a Microchip,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,187, issued Jan. 12, 1999. As mentioned, other alternative techniques for inducing the flow of focusing fluids to sort particles according to the methods of the present invention include pressure, hydrostatic, wicking, capillary, and other forces. Fluid direction components based upon these forces are discussed, below., 76867=In another embodiment of these methods, a \u201cT-junction\u201d microchannel geometry is optionally used to focus cells or other particles 1600 to one side of detection microchannel 1604. (FIG. 16). As shown in FIG. 16, a \u201cT-junction\u201d typically includes an orthogonal intersection of two microchannels. However, microchannel geometries that include non-orthogonal intersections are also optionally used (e.g., a \u201cY-junction\u201d or the like). In this embodiment, cells or other particles 1600 are typically flowed from one well 1602 and pinched to one side of detection microchannel 1604 by only one other introduced fluid stream 1606 and the wall of detection microchannel 1604 opposing the \u201cT-junction\u201d as cells or other particles 1600 pass through detector 1608. This embodiment generally achieves the same effect as the cross-microchannel formats, but with the added advantage of using less space on the microfluidic device due to the use of one focusing channel, rather than two which, in turn, provides for greater parallelism or complexity in chip design, and for more control of the hydrodynamic focusing mechanism., 140596=In additional preferred aspects, the substrate materials will comprise polymeric materials, e.g., plastics, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate, polytetrafluoroethylene (TEFLON\u2122), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polysulfone, polystyrene, polymethylpentene, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinylidine fluoride, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer), and the like. Such polymeric substrates are readily manufactured using available microfabrication techniques, as described above, or from microfabricated masters, using well known molding techniques, such as injection molding, embossing or stamping, or by polymerizing the polymeric precursor material within the mold. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,131. Such polymeric substrate materials are preferred for their ease of manufacture, low cost and disposability, as well as their general inertness to most extreme reaction conditions. Again, these polymeric materials optionally include treated surfaces, e.g., derivatized or coated surfaces, to enhance their utility in the microfluidic system, e.g., provide enhanced fluid direction, e.g., as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/843,212, filed Apr. 14, 1997, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes., 150846=In many applications, it may be desirable to provide relatively precise control of the flow rate of the cell suspension and/or other particles, e.g., to precisely control incubation times, or the like. As such, in many preferred aspects, flow systems that are more active than hydrostatic pressure driven systems are employed. For example, the cell suspension is optionally flowed by applying a pressure differential across the length of a channel. For example, a pressure source (positive or negative) is applied at the cell suspension reservoir at one end of a channel, and the applied pressure forces the suspension through the channel. The pressure source is optionally pneumatic, e.g., a pressurized gas, or alternatively is a positive displacement mechanism, i.e., a plunger fitted into a cell suspension reservoir, for forcing the cell suspension through the analysis channel. Alternatively, a vacuum source is applied to a reservoir at the opposite end of the channel to draw the suspension through the channel. Pressure or vacuum sources are optionally supplied external to the device or system, e.g., external vacuum or pressure pumps sealably fitted to the inlet or outlet of a channel, or they are internal to the device, e.g., microfabricated pumps integrated into the device and operably linked to a channel. Examples of microfabricated pumps have been widely described in the art. See, e.g., published International Application No. WO 97/02357., 100075=The heat produced by current flowing from Joule heating electrodes 2416 raises the temperature of, e.g., a buffer or gel disposed within branched particle sorting microchannel 2418, thus reducing hydrodynamic resistance in the buffer or gel. The reduced viscosity, in conjunction with vacuum source(s) that are typically operably connected to the device at non-selected particle collection well 2420 and/or selected particle collection well 2422, induce or increase flow of the buffer or gel from branched particle sorting microchannel 2418, which intersects main microchannel 2402 downstream from detector 2408. The induced flow of buffer or gel into main microchannel 2402 thus deflects or redirects the flow of selected particle 2410 into selected particle collection well 2422. In this embodiment, nonselected particle 2412 does not trigger Joule heating/redirecting flow and as such, flows unimpeded into non-selected particle collection well 2420., 155517=Although illustrated in the figures herein as a single channel and accessing capillary, it will be readily appreciated that these aspects may be provided as multiple parallel channels and accessing capillaries (discussed above), in order to substantially increase the throughput of the system. Specifically, single body structures are optionally provided with multiple parallel channels coupled to multiple sample accessing capillaries that are positioned to sample multiple samples at a time from sample libraries, e.g., multiwell plates. As such, these capillaries are generally spaced at regular distances that correspond with the spacing of wells in multiwell plates, e.g., 9 mm centers for 96 well plates, 4.5 mm for 384 well plates, and 2.25 mm for 1536 well plates., 164256=FIGS. 25A, B, and C are histograms showing the distribution of results obtained in resolution experiments using various microbead to buffer concentrations, namely, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:7, respectively. The experiments were conducted using an Agilent bioanalyzer microfluidic system to determine whether microbead doublet populations could be resolved. As shown, even at the highest microbead concentration, where the largest population of doublets was expected, significant resolution of the two populations was observed with a %CV of about 6.7%. (FIG. 25A). Similar %CVs were obtained at the two other concentrations. To further confirm the capabilities of the devices and methods of the present invention an additional resolution experiment was conducted using viable THP-1 cells stained with SYTO\ufffd-62 intercalating dye. As shown in FIG. 26, significant resolution was achieved with a %CV comparable to those obtained using traditional flow cytometric devices., 153941=Hydrostatic, wicking and capillary forces are also optionally used to provide for fluid flow. See, e.g., \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Continuous Liquid Flow in Microscale Channels Using Pressure Injection, Wicking and Electrokinetic Injection,\u201d by Alajoki et al., Ser. No. 10/142,263, filed Feb. 5, 1999., 46511=Cell-based assay systems model relevant biological phenomena, and have generally been widely adopted as screening assays, e.g., when screening for a compound's effect(s) on apoptosis or other biological phenomena. Pioneering technology providing cell- and other particle-based microscale assays are set forth in Parce et al. \u201cHigh Throughput Screening Assay Systems in Microscale Fluidic Devices\u201d WO 98/00231; in PCT/US00/04522, filed Feb. 22, 2000, entitled \u201cManipulation of Microparticles In Microfluidic Systems,\u201d by Mehta et al.; and in PCTUS00/04486, filed Feb. 22, 2000, entitled \u201cDevices and Systems for Sequencing by Synthesis,\u201d by Mehta et al., 148911=The flowing of the suspension of cells or other particles along one or more channels of the devices described herein is optionally carried out by a number of mechanisms, including pressure based-flow, electrokinetic flow, or other mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms. In a first preferred aspect, a pressure differential is used to flow the suspension of cells along a channel. Application of a pressure differential along a channel is carried out by a number of means. For example, in a simple passive aspect, the cell suspension is deposited in a reservoir at one end of a channel and at a sufficient volume or depth, that the cell suspension creates a hydrostatic pressure differential along the length of the channel, e.g., by virtue of its having greater depth than a reservoir at an opposite terminus of the channel. The hydrostatic pressure then causes the cell suspension to flow along the length of the channel. Typically, the reservoir volume is quite large in comparison to the volume or flow through rate of the channel, e.g., 10 \u03bcl reservoirs, vs. 1000 \u03bcm2 channel cross-section. As such, over the time course of the assay, the flow rate of the cell suspension will remain substantially constant, as the volume of the reservoir, and thus, the hydrostatic pressure changes very slowly. Applied pressure is then readily varied to yield different cell suspension flow rates through the channel. In screening applications, varying the flow rate of the cell suspension is optionally used to vary the incubation time of the cells with the test compound. In particular, by slowing the cells flow rate along the channel, one can effectively lengthen the amount of time between introduction of test compounds and detection of their effects. Alternatively, channel lengths, detection points, or test compound introduction points are varied in fabrication of the devices, to vary incubation times., 91551=FIG. 23 schematically depicts a microchannel configuration that includes one embodiment of separation element 2310. In this example, cells 2300 are typically flowed in a microchannel that intersects with another microchannel located upstream from detector 2304. The upstream intersecting microchannel is optionally used to focus cells 2300 to one side of the microchannel as cells 2300 pass through detector 2304 using hydrodynamic flow 2302. This illustration also includes a set of opposing microchannels located downstream from the detector for introducing at least one hydrodynamic flow 2302 to direct selected cells 2308 (e.g., fluorescently-labeled cells) and non-selected cells 2306 to either side of separation element 2310 and into, in this case, one of two microchannels, each terminating in particular collection wells 2312. Separation element 2310 is optionally omitted, with cells 2300 or other particles being directed into destination regions as desired., 119574=In a related but alternative aspect, the present invention provides methods, devices and systems for use in performing in vitro cell rolling assays. In particular, it has been reported that several classes of cell adhesion molecules participate in a wide range of important physiological functions, including wound healing, inflammation and cancer metastasis. Some examples of these molecules include selectins and integrins which mediate the rolling and subsequent immobilization of white blood cells along the endothelial lining of blood vessel, thus allowing them to migrate out of the blood vessel and toward the target tissue. Cell rolling assays are designed to mimic in vitro the rolling phenomenon in vivo, to create a more effective model for use in screening potential effectors of that phenomenon. See, e.g., Lawrence et al., J. Immunol., (1993) 151:6338-6346 and Brunk et al., Biophys. J. (1997) 72:2820-2833., 76083=FIG. 21 depicts a microchannel network that is optionally used to hydrodynamically focus particles, e.g., cells, microbeads, molecules, or the like in parallel through common detection zone 2100. For example, five cell suspensions are typically loaded into wells 2102 and flowed towards common detection zone 2100. Cell buffer solutions are also typically loaded into particular wells (e.g., well 2104) in the device and flowed towards common detection zone 2100. As shown, in the region just prior to common detection zone 2100, each microchannel in which cells are flowed intersects with two buffer flowing microchannels in a cross-configuration to focus the cells as they pass through common detection zone 2100., 143149=The holes in the top portion of the device are oriented such that they are in communication with at least one of the channels and/or chambers formed in the interior portion of the device from the grooves or indentations in the bottom substrate. In the completed device, these holes function as reservoirs for facilitating fluid or material introduction into the channels or chambers of the interior portion of the device, as well as providing ports at which electrodes may be placed into contact with fluids within the device, allowing application of electric fields along the channels of the device to control and direct fluid transport within the device. In many embodiments, extensions are provided over these reservoirs to allow for increased fluid volumes, permitting longer running assays, and better controlling fluid flow parameters, e.g., hydrostatic pressures. Examples of methods and apparatuses for providing such extensions are described in, e.g., Dubrow et al., \u201cMicrofluidic Devices and Systems Incorporating Cover Layers,\u201d WO 99/43432, published Sep. 2, 1999, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. These devices are optionally coupled to other sample introduction ports, e.g., one or more pipettor or capillary elements (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or more elements) which serially introduce multiple samples, e.g., from the wells of a microwell plate. Thus, in some embodiments, both reservoirs in the upper surface and external capillary elements are present in a single device. Alternatively, the devices include only one or more capillary elements for sample or other material introduction., 121115=Immobilization of ligands on the interior surface of channels is optionally accomplished by covalently attaching the ligands to the surface or by adsorbing the ligands on the surface. Covalent attachment of ligands to surfaces of solid substrates has been described in the art. See, e.g., Sundberg, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1995) 117:12050-57., 144824=The sources of reagents, samples (e.g., cells, microbeads, DNA or other molecules, etc.), buffers, and other materials are optionally fluidly coupled to the microchannels in any of a variety of ways. In particular, those systems comprising sources of materials set forth in Knapp et al., \u201cClosed Loop Biochemical Analyzers\u201d (WO 98/45481; PCT/US98/06723) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,443, issued Aug. 24, 1999, entitled \u201cHigh Throughput Screening Assay Systems in Microscale Fluidic Devices\u201d to J. Wallace Parce et al. and, e.g., in PCT/US00/04522, filed Feb. 22, 2000, entitled \u201cManipulation of Microparticles In Microfluidic Systems,\u201d by Mehta et al. are applicable., 154262=In alternative aspects, flow of the cell suspension and/or other particles is driven by inertial forces. In particular, channels are optionally disposed in a substrate that has the conformation of a rotor, with channels extending radially outward from the center of the rotor. The cell suspension is deposited in a reservoir that is located at the interior portion of the rotor and is fluidly connected to the channels. During rotation of the rotor, the centripetal force on the cell suspension forces the cell suspension through the channels, outward toward the edge of the rotor. Multiple channels are typically provided in the rotor to perform multiple different analyses. Detection of the function and reference labels is then carried out by placing a detector under the spinning rotor and detecting the signal as a channel passes over the detector. Examples of rotor systems have been previously described for performing a number of different assay types. See, e.g., Published International Application No. WO 95/02189. Test compound reservoirs are optionally provided in the rotor, in fluid communication with one or more channels, such that the rotation of the rotor also forces the test compounds into the one or more channels., 44213=This application is related to and claims priority to and the benefit of provisional application 60/134,472, filed May 17, 1999, Wada et al., \u201cFocusing of Microparticles in Microfluidic Systems,\u201d pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e), as well as any other applicable statute or rule. This priority application is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes., 47183=Other cell-based assays include various methods for the preparative or analytic sorting of different types of cells. For example, cell panning generally involves attaching an appropriate antibody or other cell-specific reagent to a solid support and then exposing the solid support to a heterogeneous cell sample. Cells possessing, e.g., the corresponding membrane-bound antigen will bind to the support, leaving those lacking the appropriate antigenic determinant to be washed away. Other well-known sorting methods include those using fluorescence-activated cell sorters (\u201cFACSs\u201d). FACSs for use in sorting cells and certain subcellular components such as molecules of DNA have been proposed in, e.g., Fu, A. Y. et al. (1999) \u201cA Microfabricated Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter,\u201d Nat. Biotechnol. 17:1109-1111; Unger, M., et al. (1999) \u201cSingle Molecule Fluorescence Observed with Mercury Lamp Ilumination,\u201d Biotechniques 27:1008-1013; and Chou, H. P. et al. (1999) \u201cA Microfabricated Device for Sizing and Sorting DNA Molecules,\u201d Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 96:11-13. These sorting techniques utilizing generally involve focusing cells or other particles by flow channel geometry., 103288=In one aspect, the invention provides in-system cell washing capability. This concept is also optionally extended to washing any other particulate sample. For an extensive description of microfluidic systems comprising particles, see, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/128,643, filed Apr. 4, 1999, entitled \u201cManipulation of microparticles in microfluidic systems,\u201d by Mehta et al. In this embodiment, diffusible substances such as antibodies, proteins, salts, drugs, etc. are removed by washing the materials away from the particles in a microscale system., 101132=Many alternative embodiments that incorporate Joule heating to control fluid viscosity and particle flow are possible. For example, although not shown in FIG. 22, one or both microchannels of the second set of opposing microchannels located downstream from detector 2204 optionally include one or more Joule heating electrodes (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more electrodes) and/or conductive coating portions. One or both of the opposing microchannels also optionally includes a branched channel structure similar to the branched structure depicted in FIG. 24, above (i.e., branched particle sorting microchannel 2418). Optionally, one or both of the opposing microchannels includes greater than two branches, each branch of which optionally includes one or more Joule heating electrode(s). In other embodiments, separation elements, such as those discussed above are optionally included. Preferred buffers, gels, and other materials used the in these heating embodiments have relatively sharp temperature/viscosity transitions in a narrow temperature range and are generally known in the art. Joule heating is described further in, e.g., in Ser. No. 08/977,528, entitled \u201cElectrical Current for Controlling Fluid Temperatures in Microchannels,\u201d filed Nov. 25, 1997 by Calvin Chow, Anne R. Kopf-Sill and J. Wallace Parce; and in PCT/US98/06723, entitled \u201cClosed-Loop Biochemical Analyzers,\u201d filed Apr. 3, 1998, by Knapp., 70942=Microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing is a highly effective technique when used, e.g., in flow cytometry applications, such as the assessment of live/dead cell ratios, the analysis of transfection efficiencies, the sizing of various molecular components (e.g., polynucleotides, polypeptides, etc.), the study of apoptosis, or the like. Fluid flow streams are optionally \u201cpinched\u201d or \u201cfocused\u201d into a narrow region of a microchannel to facilitate single particle or narrow streamline detection using a variety of optical detection schemes (discussed further, below). In one embodiment, particle focusing is achieved electrodynamically (see also, Ramsey et al., \u201cApparatus and Method for Performing Electrodynamic Focusing on a Microchip,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,187, issued Jan. 12, 1999). In other preferred embodiments, pressure, Joule heating, and/or other fluid movement methods are used to focus cells or other particles., 118124=Alternatively, fluorescence polarization detection methods are used to detect binding of relatively small molecules, e.g., ligands, antibodies, etc., to relatively large structures, e.g., cells. Fluorescence polarization assays for use in microfluidic systems are generally described in Provisional U.S. Application No. 60/088,650, filed Jun. 8, 1998, incorporated herein by reference.}",
