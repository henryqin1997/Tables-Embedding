    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23079=Recently, novel lubricant compositions (referred to herein as HVI-PAO) comprising polyalpha-olefins and methods for their preparation employing as catalyst reduced chromium on a silica support have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. applications Ser. No. 210,434 , now U.S. Pat. No. 4,827,073 and 210,435 , now U.S. Pat. No. 4,827,064, both filed June 23, 1988, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The HVI-PAO lubricants are made by a process which comprises contacting C6 -C20 1-alkene feedstock with reduced valence state chromium oxide catalyst on porous silica support under oligomerizing conditions in an oligomerization zone whereby high viscosity, high VI liquid hydrocarbon lubricant is produced having branch ratios less than 0.19 and pour point below -15\ufffd C. The process is distinctive in that little isomerization of the olefinic bond occurs compared to known oligomerization methods to produce polyalpha-olefins using acidic catalyst. Lubricants produced by the process cover the full range of lubricant viscosities and exhibit a remarkably high viscosity index (VI) and low pour point even at high viscosity. The as-synthesized HVI-PAO oligomer has a significant portion of terminal olefinic unsaturation. Typically, the HVI-PAO oligomer is hydrogenated to improve stability for lubricant applications., 22241=The oligomerization of 1-alkenes by acid or Ziegler-Natta catalysis to produce polyalpha-olefin (PAO) synthetic lubricants with superior properties is well known in the art. PAO lubricants are notable in particular for their superior VI and low temperature properties compared to mineral oil based lubes. One characteristic of the molecular structure of 1-alkene oligomers that has been found to correlate very well with improved lubricant properties in commercial synthetic lubricants is the ratio of methyl to methylene groups in the oligomer. The ratio is called the branch ratio and is calculated from infra red data as discussed in \"Standard Hydrocarbons of High Molecular Weight\", Analytical Chemistry, Vol.25, no. 10, p. 1466 (1953). Viscosity index has been found to increase with lower branch ratio., 33321=The supported metal oxide catalysts are preferably prepared by impregnating metal salts in water or organic solvents onto the support. Any suitable organic solvent known to the art may be used, for example, ethanol, methanol, or acetic acid. The solid catalyst precursor is then dried and calcined at 200 to 900\ufffd C. by air or other oxygen-containing gas. Thereafter the catalyst is reduced by any of several various and well known reducing agents such as, for example, CO, H2, NH3, H2 S, CS2, CH3 SSCH3, metal alkyl containing compounds such as R3 Al, R3 B,R2 Mg, RLi, R2 Zn, where R is alkyl, alkoxy, aryl and the like. Preferred are CO or H2 or metal alkyl containing compounds. Alternatively, the Group VIB metal may be applied to the substrate in reduced form, such as Cr+2 compounds. The resultant catalyst is very active for oligomerizing olefins at a temperature range from below room temperature to about 250\ufffd C., preferably 90-250\ufffd C., at a pressure of 0.1 atmosphere to 5000 psi. Contact time of both the olefic and the catalyst can vary from one second to 24 hours. The catalyst can be used in a batch type reactor or in a fixed bed, continuous-flow reactor. The weight ratio of feedstock to catalyst can be between 1000:1 and 4:1., 36053=The branch ratios are defined as the ratios of CH3 groups to CH2 groups in the lube oil and are calculated from the weight fractions of methyl groups obtained by infrared analytical methods as published in Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 25, No. 10, p. 1466 (1953). ##EQU1##, 42401=It has been found that the amount of catalyst used in the present invention can vary over a wide range, based on the amount of HVI-PAO. The amount of catalyst used has a definite effect upon the degree of increased thermal stability conferred upon the HVI-PAO. While the use of low quantities of catalysts, i.e., less than 3 wt.% based upon HVI-PAO, results in increased thermal stability, substantial increases in thermal stability are achieved when quantities of acid of about 10 wt.% are used. In practicing the instant invention, weight ratios of HVI-PAO to acid ranging from about 500:1 to 4:1 can be used with a preferred ratio of 10:1., 30125=HVI-PAO is distinctly superior to PAO in VI at all viscosities tested. Remarkably, despite the more regular structure of the HVI-PAO oligomers as shown by branch ratio that results in improved viscosity index (VI), they show pour points superior to PAO. It has been found that the process described herein to produce HVI-PAO oligomers can be controlled to yield oligomers having weight average molecular weight between 280 and 450,000 and number average molecular weight between 280 and 180,000. Measured in carbon numbers, molecular weights range from C20 to C13000 and viscosity up to 75OO cs at 100\ufffd C., with a preferred range of C30 to C10000 and a viscosity of up to 1000 cs at 100\ufffd C. for lube base stock material. Molecular weight distributions (MWD), defined as the ratio of weight average molecular to number average molecular weight, range from 1.00 to 5, with a preferred range of 1.01 to 3 and a more preferred MWD of about 1.05 to 2.5. Viscosities of the olefinic HVI-PAO oligomers used in the isomerization reaction of the present invention measured at 100\ufffd C. range from 1.5 cS to 7500 cS., 40144=1.0 part by weight of the activated catalyst prepared as in Example 3 is added to 1-decene of 200 parts by weight in a suitable reactor and heated to 125 \ufffd C. 1-Decene is continuously fed to the reactor at 2-3.5 parts/minute and 0.5 parts by weight of catalyst is added for every 100 parts of 1-decene feed. After 1200 parts of 1-decene and 6 parts of catalyst are charged, the slurry is stirred for 8 hours. The catalyst is filtered and light product boiled below 150 \ufffd C. @ 0.1 mm Hg is stripped. The finished product has a viscosity at 100 \ufffd C. of 145 cs, VI of 214 and pour point of -40\ufffd C.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with preferred embodiments and examples, modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the appended claims. Referring to FIG. 4, an illustration is presented of the theoretical reaction mechanism for the isomerization of HVI-PAO carried out in the present invention. In contact with acid, a carbonium ion is formed at the tertiary carbon atom of the backbone of HVI-PAO starting material. The reaction mechanism illustrates a rearrangement to form structures C and D with methyl branching occurring in the alkyl side chain of the starting material. The illustration further shows rearrangement occuring to produce structures A and B wherein methyl branching takes place on the backbone of the HVI-PAO. The upward shift noted in C-13 NMR resonances of the backbone methylene carbon results from the extra branching at the backbone of HVI-PAO, as shown in structure A and B in the mechanism illustrated. The evidence for the skeletal isomerization of HVI-PAO in the presence of AlCl3 as carried out in the present invention is obtained by comparative analysis of the C-13 NMR spectra of the starting material HVI-PAO and isomerized product. FIGS. 1-3 provide illustrations of such spectra for the starting material HVI-PAO and the product from Examples 5.2 and 5.3. Two major differences are observed",
