    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62436=Additionally, Tomatis, A., et al, studied reflectance images of 43 pigmented lesions of the skin (18 melanomas, 17 common melanocytic naevi and eight dysplastic naevi). Reflectance images were acquired by a telespectrophotometric system and were analyzed in the spectral range from 420 to 1040 nm, to discriminate melanoma from benign melanocytic entities. Different evaluations were carried, out considering the whole spectrum, the visible and the near infrared. A total of 33 (76.7%) lesions were correctly diagnosed by the telespectrophotometric system, compared with 35 (81.4%) correct clinical diagnoses. Reflectance in the infrared band appears diagnostically relevant., 156552=The temperature sensor for imaging and (or) detection may be constructed, as an infrared thermography imager, taught by Harzbecker K, et al., \u201cThermographic thorax diagnostics,\u201d Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1978 Feb. 1;33(3):78-80, and by Dexter L I, Kondrat'ev VB., \u201cThermography in differential diagnosis of lymphostasis in the lower limbs,\u201d Vestn Khir Im I I Grek. 1976 June; 116(6):60-4., 50979=Nuclear-radiation imaging of radionuclide-labeled antibodies is a subject of continued development and study. Its advantage is that pathologies, which are embedded within a tissue or hidden by residue, may still be visible to the gamma camera, since the gamma rays penetrate the tissue or residue. In fact various means may be employed to calculate the depth of the pathology within the tissue, for example, based on the attenuation of photons of different energies, which are emitted from a same source, as taught by commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/616,307 and 10/616,301, both filed on Jul. 10, 2003, and both of whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, or by constructing an attenuation correction map for the functional image, based on a structural image, for example, of ultrasound, as taught by commonly owned PCT Patent application PCT/IL03/00917, filed on Nov. 4, 2003, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference., 46136=Tissue Characterization by Nuclear Imaging Nuclear-radiation imaging of radionuclide-labeled antibodies (Gamma Imaging): The use of radiolabeled immunoglobulin for tumor localization, by functional imaging, was shown to be possible in 1959 when Day et al. radiolabeled isolated antifibrin. (Day, E. O.; Planisek, J. A.; Pressman D: \u201cLocalization of Radioiodinated Rat Fibrinogen in Transplanted Rat Tumors\u201d, J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 0.23: 799-812, 1959). Since the work of Day et al, in 1959, an expanding number of monoclonal, antibodies have received FDA approval. Examples, applicable to gastrointestinal tract tumors, include the following:, 44398=The present application derives priority from U.S. Provisional Application 60/572,466, filed on May 20, 2004., 54663=Before the early 1970's ultrasound imaging systems were able to record only the strong echoes arising from the outlines of an organ, but not the low-level echoes of the internal structure. In 1972 a refined imaging mode was introduced called gray-scale display, in which the internal texture of many organs became visible. In consequence, ultrasound imaging became a useful tool for imaging tumors, for example, in the liver., 61718=Tissue Characterization by Optical Reflective Spectroscopy: The application optical reflectance spectroscopy for tissue characterization is described, for example, in http://www.sbsp-limb.nichd.nih.gov/html/spectroscopy.html, downloaded on Mar. 15, 2005, disclosing an optical reflectance spectroscopy (ORS) device for measuring the thickness of the epithelial layer, and an evaluation technique based on oblique angle reflectance spectroscopy, that allows assessment of the scattering and absorption properties of the epithelium and stroma, thus providing information on chronic oral epithelial tissue inflammation, which is considered a potential diagnostic precursor to oral cancer., 69017=Ingestible Pills: Ingestible radio pills, which are ingestible capsules containing a transmitter are known. In 1964 research at Heidelberg University developed a pill for monitoring pH of the gastrointestinal tract. (Noller, H. G., \u201cThe Heidelberg Capsule Used For the Diagnosis of Pepic Diseases\u201d, Aerospace Medicine, February, 1964, pp. 15-117.), 60376=U.S. Patent Application 2003/01383786, to Hashimshony, entitled, \u201cMethod and apparatus for examining tissue for predefined target cells, particularly cancerous cells, and a probe useful for such method and apparatus,\u201dwhose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, teaches a method apparatus and probe for examining tissue and characterizing its type according to measured changes in optical characteristics of the examined tissue. In a preferred embodiment of this method the tissue to be examined is subject to a contrast agent containing small particles of a physical element conjugated with a biological carrier selectively bindable to the target cells. Additionally, energy pulses are applied to the examined tissue, and the changes in impedance and/or the optical characteristics produced by the applied energy pulses are detected and utilized for determining the presence of the target cells in the examined tissue. Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, the applied energy pulses include laser pulses, and the physical element conjugated with a biological carrier is a light-sensitive semiconductor having an impedance which substantially decrease in the presence of light. Moreover, the same probe used for detecting the targeted cells, may also be used for destroying the \u2018cells\u2019 so targeted., 55997=Rajshekhar, V. (\u201cContinuous impedance monitoring during CT-guided stereotactic surgery: relative value in cystic and solid-lesions,\u201d Rajshekhar, V., British Journal of Neurosurgery, 1992, 6, 439-444) describes using an impedance probe with a single electrode to measure the impedance characteristics of lesions. The objective of the study was to use the measurements made in the lesions to determine the extent of the lesions and to localize the lesions more accurately. The probe was guided to the tumor by CT and four measurements were made within the lesion as the probe passed through the lesion. A biopsy of the lesion was performed using the outer sheath of the probe as a guide to position, after the probe itself was withdrawn.}",
