The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element, part, step, component, or ingredient which is not specifically disclosed herein. While in the illustrated embodiments, the rectangular door panels and openings have widths that exceed their height, it will be of course appreciated that the invention is not so limited. Thus, the invention has applicability to other geometries of door panels and openings including square, oval, round, as well as rectangular door panels and openings wherein the height exceeds the width, for example. It will also be appreciated that in those embodiments wherein the door panel substrate is separate from the trim substrate, the door panel substrate can be manufactured from a different material than that used for the trim substrate, dependent on the desired properties and cost considerations. Thus, for example, the door panel substrate can be manufactured using an engineering grade thermoplastic while trim substrate can be manufactured using the more conventional materials such as ABS resin or polycarbonate plastic, for example. Also, interior trim/dashboard substrates are commonly manufactured of injection molded materials such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (i.e., ABS) resin or polycarbonate plastic, for example, and are commonly manufactured 3-4 mil",
