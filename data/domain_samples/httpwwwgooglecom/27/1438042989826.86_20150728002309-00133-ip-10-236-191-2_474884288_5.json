FIG. 5D2 shows the Lambertian emittance versus polar angle characteristics of the LEDs used to implement the near field wide-area illumination arrays in the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14. FIG. 5D4 is geometrical the layout of LEDs used to implement the narrow wide-area illumination array of the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14, wherein the illumination beam produced therefrom is aimed by angling the lenses before the LEDs in the near-field wide-area illumination arrays of the Multi-Mode Illumination Subsystem 14. FIG. 5D5 sets forth a set of six illumination profiles for the near-field wide-area illumination fields produced by the near-field wide-area illumination arrays of the illustrative embodiment, taken at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 millimeters along the field away from the imaging window (i.e. working distance) of the imaging-based bar code symbol reader 1. These plots illustrate that the spatial intensity of the near-field wide-area illumination field begins to become substantially uniform at about 40 millimeters (i.e. center:edge=2:1 max).}",
