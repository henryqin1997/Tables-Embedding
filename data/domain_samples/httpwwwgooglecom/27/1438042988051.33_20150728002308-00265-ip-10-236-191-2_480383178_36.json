FIG. 11, for example, illustrates an embodiment of a hierarchical security report 1100 that provides greater detail regarding the vulnerabilities of two target computers. For example, an upper portion of the display identifies a first target computer (\u201clocalhost.local.net\u201d at IP address 255.255.255.255) having a first open port represented by a window 1110 and a second open port represented by a window 1120. Each of the open ports of the first target computer has a respective vulnerability and may identify a vulnerability patch to install on the target computer to reduce the vulnerability. As a further example, a lower portion of the security report 1100 identifies a second target computer (\u201clocalhost2.local.net\u201d at IP address 254.255.255.255) having a single open port represented by a window 1130. The information in the window 1130 indicates that the service on the port is out of date, suggesting that it should be removed, and advantageously identifies a vulnerability patch to install if the service is to be retained.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{179558=In one embodiment, the present invention then proceeds to examine each host (i.e., target computer) in more detail using the live list and optionally using the potentially live list as well. In service discovery, a set of common TCP service ports and a set of common UDP service ports are scanned. The TCP service discovery list and the UDP service discovery list are typically substantially larger than the TCP host discovery list and the UDP host discovery list. Each list typically includes some subset of ports that are commonly used for communications. For example, each list may include anywhere from a few to hundreds of ports. Typically, each list includes ports such as those shown in Table 6 (an exemplary list of default ports publicly reported by Microsoft\ufffd for Windows\ufffd 2000.) This list is not exhaustive, and changes in technology, protocols, network infrastructure and operating systems frequently change port requirements., 197194=As an example, one embodiment of the present invention uses a batch size of one hundred target computers for simultaneous scanning. For host discovery, the ICMP scanning process sends 100 ICMP echo requests and monitors responses and time-outs. Because this is less than this embodiment's 640 packet slots, all ICMP request packets can be sent out, and responses or time-outs for all packets can be monitored at the same time. Assuming a TCP host discovery list of 10 TCP ports, the TCP host discovery scanner will ultimately send out 1000 packets (100 target computers\ufffd10 ports=1000 packets) to probe all listed ports of all listed computers. In this embodiment, the scanner will initially send out 640 packets in a sequential burst using all 640 packet slots. However, as discussed above, by the time the 640th packet is sent, it is probable (depending on time-out settings and how many responses the system receives) that at least one of the 640 packets sent earlier will have generated a response or a time-out, freeing that packet slot for sending one of the remaining 360 packets. By constantly monitoring the receipt of response packets and time-outs, the entire list of target computers can be tested with little wasted time., 291386=The grammatical/syntactic elements of one embodiment of the FASL language have been specified above. Notice that these things are sufficient to perform calculations and implement algorithms, but there is nothing about them that allows for things like sending and receiving data over the network and there are certain operations on the scalar types that would be nice to have but are not expressible with the grammar thus far specified. For this reason there exist structures and functions declared in the scope that owns the script scope (a \u201cmeta-scope\u201d if you will) that allow access to this functionality. As used herein \u201cFaultline\u201d refers to the overall network security system.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations . FIG. 12 Although the above description of the present invention includes at least one embodiment of the system, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made to the system without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims herein. For example, one alternative embodiment of the methodology described above is exemplified in An exemplary Scan Summary Report is set forth below in Appendix A. A corresponding exemplary FoundScore Report is set forth below in Appendix B. A corresponding Network Topology Report is set forth below in Appendix C. Once the data is loaded, an object which represents a single scan has a GenerateReport member function which programmatically generates all the html, gif, jpg, and png files that constitute the report. The html files are generated by loading a \u201ctemplate\u201d html file that contains boilerplate source and key words and replacing the key words with the html source representing the report data. The gifs and jpgs are simply background graphics that do not change from report to report so they are written as is without the report mechanism having to know the details of gif and jpg encoding. For images that do need to be dynamically calculated, the png graphics format is used. This is a public (non-licensed) format for which there exists a public library which we are linking",
