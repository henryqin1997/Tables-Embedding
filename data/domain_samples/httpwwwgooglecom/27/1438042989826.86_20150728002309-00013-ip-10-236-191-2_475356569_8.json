According to study results in the past, it is known that the variation of the refractive index of the third term of the integration in the right hand side of the equation (1) affects the phase error of the arrayed waveguide grating most. NARA and KASHIHARA, the inventors of the invention, proposed in a Japanese Patent Application (Application No. 226616/1999, filed on Aug. 10, 1999) that the crosstalk should be improved by forming a core that constitutes an arrayed waveguide grating to have a large number of deposition layers.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In addition, the optical waveguide in another viewpoint of the invention can be the optical waveguide such as the arrayed waveguide grating having the excellent crosstalk characteristics because it is fabricated by the method for fabricating the optical waveguide set forth. As described above, according to the method for fabricating the optical waveguide in the one viewpoint of the invention, based on the above-described study done by the inventors, the turntable rotation speed r1\u03c9 at the position r1 is set 600 mm/sec or above at least in the step of depositing the core glass particle among the steps of depositing the under cladding glass particle, the core glass particle and the over cladding particle when fabricating the optical waveguide apparatus by the flame hydrolysis deposition method. Thereby, the optical waveguide such as the arrayed waveguide grating having the excellent crosstalk characteristics can be obtained with high yields. Moreover, the description set forth has described the example where the arrayed waveguide grating was fabricated by applying the fabricating method of the embodiment mentioned above. However, an optical waveguide other than the arrayed waveguide grating can be fabricated by applying the method for fabricating the optical waveguide of the invention as described in the embodiment set forth. In this case, the uniformity of the refractive index in the optical waveguide part can also be enhanced and an optical waveguide apparatus having the excellent crosstalk characteristics can be made",
