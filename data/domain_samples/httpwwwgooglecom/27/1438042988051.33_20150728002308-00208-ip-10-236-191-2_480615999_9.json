    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While several embodiments of the present invention are described above, it is contemplated that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the second etch described above for making the hole 38 may be an isotropic etch thereby producing the same sized hole but with parallel sidewalls. Of course, the pads 45 may be similarly shaped. In all cases, the methods and means used for forming the vias and the wads comprise conventional semiconductor wafer processing techniques. Accordingly, it is intended that the embodiments described be considered only as illustrative of the present invention and that the scope thereof should not be limited thereto but be determined by reference to the claims hereinafter provided and their equivalents. r is a constant having a value less than unity, (e.g. 0.1-0.2.) t is the thickness of the wafer 10 and s1 is the width of the apex of the vias 25, where s2=s1+\u221a2 t-2\u221a2 rt Referring to FIG. 15, the width s2 of the vias 25 is given by the equation Referring to FIG. 14, there is provided in an alternative embodiment of the present invention a wad of electrically conductive compliant wire material 55. Wad 55 is substantially identical to wad 45 described above with respect to FIGS. 11 and 12 with the exception that the wad 55 is made to extend",
