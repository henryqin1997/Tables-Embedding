    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93080=The CT data image of human temporal bones was received from a GE 9800 CT scanner as a series of slices, nominally 1.5 mm thick. Each slice consisted of a raster image of the temporal bone; the resolution of each image was 256\ufffd256 volume elements, or voxels. Each voxel was 2.5 mm2 and was represented as a floating point number indicating the average density of the tissue at that voxel location. The density is measured in Hounsfeld units, representing the ratio of the tissue density to the density of water. Density values ranged from \u22121000 to 3095. The SLS\u2122 process required boundary information rather than interior density data; therefore, a conversion process was necessary., 24309=Much attention has been given in the art to the development of materials to assist in the regeneration of bone defects and injuries. In 1926, DeJong observed the similarities between the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the in vivo mineral and the hydroxyapatite (Ca5(OH)(PO4)3, \u201cCHA\u201d). Calcium compounds, including calcium sulfate (Nielson, 1944) , calcium hydroxide (Peltier, 1957), and tricalcium phosphate (\u201cTCP\u201d) (Albee et al., 1920), have been observed to stimulate new bone growth when implanted or injected into bone cavities (Hulbert et al., 1983). These materials also exhibit good biocompatibility and compositional similarities to human bone and tooth and can serve as resorbable or non-resorbable implants depending on their degree of microporosity., 54608=FIG. 2 is a scanning electron micrograph of calcium hydroxyapatite at 1000 times magnification., 58886=Many polymers can be made by emulsion polymerization. In this technique, liquid monomers are emulsified in water with the aid of an appropriate emulsifying agent. Water-borne, ionic initiators are incorporated to polymerize the monomer, thereby forming the desired emulsified polymer. Emulsion particles are typically quite small, about 100 nm (4\ufffd10\u22126 in) in diameter, so that the polymer is well distributed throughout the water vehicle with concentrations in the range of 2-5\ufffd1014 particles per cubic centimeter (Bovey et al., 1955). In general, such emulsions are mechanically stable to the effects of gravity. Emulsion polymerization is generally known to produce high molecular weight products at high polymerization rates and is the method of choice for preparing the polymer binder commonly used in water-based acrylic paint systems., 126158=Hattori et al. J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 73(6) :1803, (1990)., 110982=The polymer free parts with a density of about 0.97 g/cm3 were infiltrated as described earlier. For the CMP parts, a first infiltration resulted in 31\ufffd2% weight gain after firing 725\ufffd C. and strength of 1100 psi and subsequent infiltration increased the density about 50% and strength about 1500 psi. Strength vs. density data are shown in FIG. 5. Further infiltration caused the parts to melt and deform inhomogeneously at 725\ufffd C., which could indicate existence of a Ca/P concentration gradient through the part. This also lowered the strength of the part. The fractured surface of this part showed randomly distributed vitrified parts. It is believed that infiltrant filled up the pore and formed a phosphate glass., 127225=Nelson et al. J. Oral & Maxillofacial Surg., 51:1363-1371, (1993)., 27837=Jarcho et al. (1976, 1977) reported the development of a process for preparing dense, polycrystalline, calcium hydroxyapatite (CHA), with the empirical formula 2(Ca5(PO4)3OH) or (3Ca3(PO4)2)Ca(OH)2. In this study, plugs were fabricated at 100% density and implanted in dogs. No evidence of tissue inflammation occurred, and in contrast to the porous TCP implants described above, little resorption or biodegradation was observed after six months., 126538=Jarcho et al. J. Materials Science, 11:2027-2035, (1976)., 124930=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/279,235 filed Jul. 22, 1994 by Barlow et al., 58091=It is preferred that the polymer be distributed so as to cover as much of the surface of the particulate as possible. In principle, this could be accomplished by dissolving the polymer in a suitable organic solvent to achieve a low concentration of the polymer, depositing the solution on the surface of the particulate, then evaporating the solvent. However, this process has the disadvantage of solvent recovery costs as well as potential environmental harm associated with use of organic solvents. To address this problem, the amorphous polymeric binders preferably are prepared by emulsion polymerization as described in the literature (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/279,235 filed on Jul. 22, 1994, which is commonly owned with this application; Vail et al., 1994)., 55728=FIG. 7 is a scanning electron micrograph of calcium hydroxyapatite which has been reacted with orthophosphoric acid, shown at 1000 times magnification., 66274=The polymer binder materials used in the present invention have been developed as thermoplastic binders for ceramic particles, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/279,235. The polymeric binders are readily removed from the calcium phosphate compositions by thermal decomposition in oxidizing atmospheres to produce parts that contain only ceramic. In general, the binders are amorphous and polymeric. They are polymers, copolymers or terpolymers having glass transition temperatures above 40\ufffd C., and having a melt flow index between about 1 to about 50 g/10 min. at 200\ufffd C. and 75 psi extrusion pressure, using the instrument geometry and testing protocols described in ASTM # D1238. Preferred polymer binder compositions include methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate. The copolymer of methyl methacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate is particularly preferred as a polymeric binder., 109627=CMP green parts were fired at 880\ufffd C. for 2 hours. The fired CMP parts showed a 3 point bending strength of about 400 psi and a density of about 0.97 g/cm3, corresponding to a 17% volume shrinkage. A strength of about 2700 psi was obtained by firing a CMP part at 940\ufffd C. for 1 hour with a density of about 1.4 g/cm3., 22309=This application is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/832,882 filed Apr. 4, 1997 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,515 which is a continuation of then copending Ser. No. 08/288,120 filed Aug. 8, 1994, now U.S. Pat No. 5,639,402. The priority application is incorporated by reference herein., 127144=McIntosh et al. Anal. Chem., 28(9) :1424-1427, (1956)., 26752=Koster et al. (1976) reported the testing of the calcium phosphate formulations monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, tetracalcium phosphate, and combinations consisting of 20% monocalcium phosphate and 80% of either di-, tri- or tetracalcium phosphate as implant materials in dog tibiae. These investigators tested both dense ceramics and porous ceramics with pore sizes between 800-1000 microns. They reported that tissue compatibility is dependent on the CaO/P2O5 ratio. All materials with ratios between 2/1 and 4/1 are compatible with the optimum ratio being about 3/1 for TCP. After 10 months, Koster et al. (1977) found that tetracalcium phosphate was resorbed only to a minor extent, but that TCP demonstrated lamellar bone growth throughout its pores. Both were found to be tissue compatible. The authors stated that the 3/1 material was not as strong as the 4/1 material and suggested that TCP should be used only in low stress areas while tetracalcium phosphate could be used in high stress environments.}",
