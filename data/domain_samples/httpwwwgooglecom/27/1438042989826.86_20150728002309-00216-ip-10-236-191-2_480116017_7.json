    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{226658=In the above embodiments, the commutation of a rotary motor has been described. The present invention can be adapted so that the output of the position sensor is used to control the commutation of a linear motor. In such an embodiment, the stator coils might be arranged along a linear path, with switching of the drive current being applied to these stator coils in order to control the linear movement of for example a permanent magnet. In this case, a linear position sensor such as those described in the applicant's earlier application WO95/31696 may be used to control this commutation., 81114=A brief discussion has been given above as to how an excitation signal causes a resonator to resonate which in turn generates a signal in a set of receive windings which vary with the angular position of the resonator. A more detailed explanation of how these circuits interact to generate the above signals can be found in the applicants earlier International Patent Applications WO95/31696 and WO98/00921, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A brief description of the preferred form of the excitation winding, the resonator windings and the receive windings will now be described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the embodiments described with reference to FIGS. 6, 9 and 11, the vector to phase converter used a comparator to compare the signal output from the low pass filter. This is not essential. The sinusoidally varying phase signal output from the adder could be input into the phase to vector converter. However, use of such a comparator is preferred because it reconditions the signal. The embodiments described above with reference to FIGS. 6, 9 and 11 have the advantage that the stator coil switching timing is electronically programmable either by a user or continuously within a control loop. The same advantage can be achieved using a different position encoder to encode the position of the rotor. For example, a resolver or an optical position encoder could be used to generate the signals which are input to the vector-to-phase converter. However, the position sensor described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5 is preferred because of the advantages already described. In the above embodiments, a set of stator coils have been mounted on a stator which have been used to energise a rotor. The way in which the commutation is performed in the above embodiments can also be used in a motor having coils on the rotor and having a permanent magnet type stator or with motors having coils on both the stator and the rotor. However, in these embodiments, a slip ring will have to",
