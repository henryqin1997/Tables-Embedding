    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24799=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/483,841, filed Jun. 30, 2003., 25289=The need for articles produced from nonwoven containing nanofibers has continued to increase. The diameters of nanofibers are generally understood to be less than about 1000 nanometer or one micron. The nanofibers webs are desired due to their high surface area, low pore size, and other characteristics. The nanofibers, also commonly called microfibers or very fine fibers, can be produced by a variety of methods and from a variety of materials. Although several methods have been used, there are drawbacks to each of the methods and producing cost effective nanofibers has been difficult. Therefore, hygiene articles and other disposable consumer products containing nanofibers have not been marketed., 61267=Basis weight can be measured consistent with compendial methods ASTM D 756, ISO 536 and EDANA ERT40.3-90. Basis weight is defined as mass per unit area, with grams per square meter (gsm) as the preferred unit. Required instruments are a scissors or a die-cutter for sample cutting and an accurate weighing device, such as a scale. A sample is cut to a total area of 100 cm2 per layer with an accuracy and precision of \ufffd0.5%. A scale or balance is needed with 0.001 g sensitivity, readable, calibrated and accurate to within 0.25% of the applied load. The samples are conditioned at 23\ufffd Celsius (\ufffd2\ufffd C.) and at a relative humidity of about 50% for 2 hours to reach equilibrium. Weigh the cut sample with 10 plies from the sample area for a total of 1000 cm2=0.1 m2 on an analytical balance to the nearest 0.001 g and record the weight. (For samples thicker than 1 mm, weighing only 1 ply is preferred but should be noted.) Calculate the basis weight by dividing the weight by the sample area (all layers tested) to give the basis weight in gsm. All data are recorded for statistic analysis., 38358=The polymer is typically heated until it forms a liquid and flows easily. The melted polymer may be at a temperature of from about 0\ufffd C. to about 400\ufffd C., preferably from about 10\ufffd C. to about 300\ufffd C., and more preferably from about 20\ufffd C. to about 220\ufffd C. The temperature of the polymer depends on the melting point of the polymer or polymer composition. The temperature of the polymer is less than about 50\ufffd C. above its melting point, preferably less than 25\ufffd C. above its melting point, more preferably less than 15\ufffd C. above its melting point, and just at or above its melting point or melting range. The melting point or range is measured using ISO 3146 method. The melted polymer will typically have a viscosity of from about 1 Pa-s to about 1000 Pa-s, typically from about 2 to about 200 Pa-s and more commonly from about 4 to about 100 Pa-s. These viscosities are given over a shear rate ranging from about 100 to about 100,000 per second. The melted polymer is at a pressure of about atmospheric pressure or slightly elevated., 59989=The fiber diameter can be measured using a Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) and image analysis software. A magnification of 500 to 10,000 is chosen such that the fibers are suitably enlarged for measurements. Image analysis software for automatic sampling of fiber diameter in the SEM picture is possible, but also a more manual procedure can be used. In general, the edge of a randomly selected fiber is sought and then measured across the width (perpendicular to fiber direction at that spot) to the opposite edge of the fiber. A scaled and calibrated image analysis tool provides the scaling to get the actual reading in mm or micrometers (\u03bcm). Several fibers are randomly selected across the sample of web in the SEM. Typically, several samples from a web are cut and tested in this manner and at least about 100 measurements are made and all data are recorded for statistic analysis. If the result is to be recorded in denier, then the following calculation needs to be made. Diameter in denier=Cross-sectional area*density*9000 m*1000 g/kg. The cross-sectional area is \u03c0*diameter {fraction (2/4)}. The density for PP, e.g., can be taken as 910 kg/m3. To obtain decitex (dtex), the 9000 m is replaced by 10,000 m., 33061=Suitable thermoplastic polymers include any polymer suitable for melt spinning. The rheological properties of the polymer must be such that the polymer can be melt extruded and is able to form a film. The melting temperature of the polymer is generally from about 25\ufffd C. to 400\ufffd C. The polymers of the present invention as they are present in the die may have a melt flow rate of less than about 400 decigrams per minute. The melt flow rate is measured using ASTM method D-1238. Preferably, the melt flow rate may be less than about 300 decigrams per minute, more preferably less than about 200 decigrams per minute, and most preferably less than about 100 decigrams per minute. A most preferred range for melt flow rates is from about 1 decigram per minute to about 100 decigrams per minute. Generally, the lower the melt flow rate the more preferred. Therefore, polymers with melt flow rates less than about 50 decigrams per minute and 40 decigrams per minute may be utilized.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention. All documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. Pore diameter can be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art. The mean pore diameter is preferably less than about 15 microns, more preferably less than about 10 microns, and most preferably less than about 5 microns. The desired coefficient of variation for a uniform web is less than 20%, preferably less than about 15%, and more preferably about 10% or less. The lack of roping can be measured by counting the number of ropes or bundles of fibers in a measured area of the web. The lack of holes is also measured the number of holes having a diameter above a certain threshold in a measured area of the web. The holes may be counted if they are visible to the naked",
