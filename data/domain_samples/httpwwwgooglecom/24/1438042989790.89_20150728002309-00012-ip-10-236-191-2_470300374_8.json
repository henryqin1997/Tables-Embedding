No. 4,789,468 issued on Dec. 6, 1988 to Sirkar (the entire content of which is expressly incorporated hereinto by reference), discloses a liquid-liquid extraction system which utilizes microporous membranes. In this regard, the system disclosed in this patent relies upon an interface-immobilizing pressure difference effective to prevent the feed liquid from flowing through the micropores of the membrane and dispersing in the extractant liquid on the opposite side of the membrane.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, while the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. As may now be appreciated, the present invention provides a suitable means for predetermining, on a laboratory bench scale, maximum pressure differentials for liquid-liquid extraction systems employing selected microporous hollow fibers and selected feed and extractant liquids. As such, a variety of candidate liquids and/or microporous hollow fibers may be screened for eventual use in a liquid-liquid extraction system without the need to use full scale hollow fiber modules. In addition, the present invention provides detection means for a dynamic liquid-liquid extraction system whereby the presence of the feed liquid in the essentially immiscible extractant liquid (which might be indicative of module failure and/or malfunction) can be sensed. The detector 96 will therefore sense a change in the \"normal\" level of radiation passing through the vessel 92, the change being indicative of the presence of feed liquid in the discharged extractant liquid (i.e., since a change in optical properties of the discharged extractant liquid stream will ensue due to the immiscibility of the feed and extractant liquids). This sensed change will therefore cause the",
