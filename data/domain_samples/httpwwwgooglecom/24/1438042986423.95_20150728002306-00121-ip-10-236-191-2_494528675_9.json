The overall system provides the capability to plan capacity for manufacturing sub-components before the components are developed, early ordering for sub-components that exist, interlock of manufacturing and development processes, and a seamless process where the description of the undeveloped product can be altered and the impact on the released and unreleased sub-components can be seen instantly. When a decision is made to proceed to manufacturing, the data in the conceptual bill-of-material can be frozen and moved automatically to the system used to store manufacturing records and to the customer. A representative hardware environment for practicing the present invention is depicted in FIG. 7, which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of an information handling/computer system in accordance with the subject invention, having at least one processor or central processing unit (CPU) 10. CPUs 10 are interconnected via system bus 12 to random access memory (RAM) 14, read-only memory (ROM) 16, an input/output (I/O) adapter 18 for connecting peripheral devices, such as disk units 11 and tape drives 13, to bus 12, user interface adapter 19 for connecting keyboard 15, mouse 17, speaker 103,",
