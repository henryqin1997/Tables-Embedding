    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39861=The absorbent panels which are useful in the process of the present invention are those absorbent panels which have narrowed central portions and wider edge portions so that they form ears at each end of the panel. It is this ear portion combined with the narrowed central portion which allows the elastic member to be placed adjacent the panel in the central portion and over the ears so that the elastic member, in accordance with the process of the present invention, only becomes functional in the desired area; that is, the area that is to become the leg-encircling area of the diaper. There are many ways of preforming panels in desired shapes. Suitable techniques for preforming such panels are disclosed and described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,216,687 and co-pending patent application Ser. No. 51,562 filed June 25, 1979 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,369. Other techniques are those described in conjunction with FIGS. 7 and 8 herein., 41843=Broadly, the elastic members useful in accordance with the present invention may be made from materials having elongation of from 20 to 100% and preferably from about 50 to 500% with recoveries in the range of 20 to 100% and preferably from 70 to 100%. The material should have a force to stretch it 100% of from 30 to 2000 grams. A specifically suitable elastic member is that disclosed in co-pending commonly assigned patent application. U.S. Ser. No. 134,369 filed Mar. 27, 1980., 42345=The elastic members may be made from rubber or various synthetic elastomeric materials, preferably they are made from the thermoplastic elastomeric materials as are more fully disclosed and described in the co-pending commonly assigned patent application U.S. Ser. No. 134,369 filed Mar. 27, 1980. Materials may be anywhere from 1/4 to 11/2 inch in width or even wider and may be apertured or solid as desired. In a preferred embodiment, the material is an apertured or reticulated elastomeric material with a 3/4 inch width.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description and the drawings are illustrative and are not to be taken as limiting. Still other variations and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Suitable backing material for the disposable undergarments embodying the present invention can be an opaque polyolefin, for example, polyethylene about 0.001 inch thick. Another suitable material for this purpose is polyethylene terephthlate having a thickness of about 0.005 inch. In the latter case, the elastic members may be secured above the inwardly folded side edges of the facing. In addition, facings may be made from non-apertured material such as non-woven isotropic webs or apertured polyolefin or polyester films having a desired moisture permeability. In all of the aforementioned facings, the material should be relatively hydrophobic so as to retard wicking with the facing. Facing materials which may be used with the disposable products of the present invention may be non-woven webs made of a mixture of fibers consisting of predominantly of inexpensive short cellulosic fibers, such as short wood pulp fibers, or cotton linters in amounts of 75% to 98%, the balance being textile length fibers such as rayon, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,663,348 to Liloia, et al. Other facing materials which are suitable for use in disposable diapers of this invention can have fabric weights in the range of about 0.25 to 5 ounces per square yard and densities",
