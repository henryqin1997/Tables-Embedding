Since the predetermined digital speech quality monitoring data are multi-frequency transmitted with the voice signal, the mating radio communication unit which has the same arrangement as the communication unit can check the speech quality based on the error ratio by making a determination as to whether or not the received speech quality monitoring data are identical to the predetermined speech quality monitoring data. After the communication unit receives the signal multi-frequency transmitted from the mating communication unit, it separates the speech quality monitoring data and the voice signal, compares the received speech quality monitoring data with the predetermined speech quality monitoring data, and comes into a waiting mode when the error ratio increases to a predetermined extent. In addition, it is possible to detect a speech quality reduction with high accuracy regardless of the cause of the speech quality reduction. In the signal receipt section, a demodulated signal is applied from the demodulator 120 to the speaker amplifier 121 through the bandpass filter 129 which blocks the signal components except for other signal components of frequencies ranging from about 100 Hz to about 14 KHz. The received speech quality monitoring data included in the demodulator 120 are fed to the",
