Both these processed pastas had a moisture content of 54% and a pH of 4.6. Accelerated storage tests of each of these samples in duplicate were conducted (30\ufffd C./60 days). b) Not under modified atmospheric conditions, but the packaged pastas went through in-pack pasteurization by heating 15 minutes in 90\ufffd-95\ufffd C. steam (IPP). a) Under modified atmospheric conditions (65% N2 /35% CO2) and no further heating (MAP), A pasta dough was prepared by mixing 74 parts durum flour, 15.5 parts liquid whole egg and 10.5 parts distilled white vinegar (15% strength). This pasta dough was sheeted to 1.0 mm thick, slitted to 1.7 mm wide and cut to 15.2 cm long. These pastas were steamed at 90\ufffd-95\ufffd C. temperature under atmospheric conditions for 2.5 minutes, immersed in water for 30 seconds, then steamed again for another 2.5 minutes, coated with 2% soy bean oil and packaged in amounts of 150 g under two different conditions as follows: Example 2 These results showed that the pastas of the process of the present invention retained acid better and the cooked pastas also had a better texture.
