    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above-described embodiments of the present invention are merely descriptive of its principles and are not to be considered limiting. The scope of the present invention instead shall be determined from the scope of the following claims including their equivalents. The steps of insertion of a burr or other rotating surgical tool, locking as the special shank SS strikes the bottom of its receptacle or chuck and twist locking is illustrated in FIG. 17. The reverse operation in removing the burr 17 or other tool is illustrated in FIG. 18. Of universal application, however is the feature shown on FIG. 15. The module 12 includes a magnet 12M embedded in the shank of the module. In FIG. 15, this is marked by the dot. The magnet 12M produces a magnetic field in the region of the receptacle for the module and the field is sensed by the Hall effect device 34 which is contained in the housing of the handheld motor unit 11. This sensing of the module 12, which is in place in the motor unit 11, allows automatic control such as speed range selection without the need of selection by the surgeon. It is a backup to his professional tool and speed selection. Now referring to FIGS. 13-18, a commonly used surgical tool is a bur 17 with its operating head 17H and its special shank 17SS. The special shank has a reduced diameter",
