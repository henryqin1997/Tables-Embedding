    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments. Thus, with these achieved deposition rates and uniformity results, the magnet array and sputtering system of the present invention provides an acceptable single substrate processing device for semiconductor and other film deposition applications. Several experimental coating runs were performed. In each run, an Al2O3 coating was deposited on the exposed surface of the silicon wafer. On average, a deposition rate of about 1500 Angstroms/minute was achieved. This deposition rate represents a factor of three improvement over conventional RF diode sputtering methods. In addition, the full range \u201cwithin wafer\u201d Al2O3 film uniformity was within an acceptable commercial deposition uniformity, of about <2%. A sputtering system, similar to that shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, was utilized to perform several experimental coating runs on silicon wafer substrate. An aluminum target was utilized having a shape similar to that shown for target 300 in FIG. 8. The outer diameter of the target was approximately 11.5 inches and the inner diameter was approximately 2.5 inches. A magnet array similar in shape to magnet array 100 from",
