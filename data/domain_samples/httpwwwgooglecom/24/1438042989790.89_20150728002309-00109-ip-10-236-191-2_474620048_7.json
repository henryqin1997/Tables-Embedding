The VPN identification number marks an IPv6 packet as belonging to a particular VLAN VPN. The VPN identification number header is a specific option of the more generic destination options header (e.g., header type 60) of the IPv6 protocol. An exemplary format of the optional header extension, including the VPN identification number header is as follows:}",

Each of the standards for Internet and other packet-switched network transmission (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, MPLS) and public telephone networks (ATM, DSL) represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly, replacement standards and protocols having the same functions are considered equivalents. It should also be noted that the software implementations of the present invention as described herein are optionally stored on a tangible storage medium, such as: a magnetic medium such as a disk or tape; a magneto-optical or optical medium such as a disk; or a solid state medium such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more read-only (non-volatile) memories, random access memories, or other re-writable (volatile) memories. A digital file attachment to email or other self-contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. Accordingly, the invention is considered to include a tangible storage medium or distribution medium, as listed herein and including art-recognized equivalents and successor media, in which the software implementations herein are stored.
