Coupled to the output of the limiter amplifier 12 in the receiver section 201 there is provided an FM demodulator 20. In the AM transmitter section 203 of the apparatus 200 shown at the bottom of FIG. 3, there is provided a user tunable AM transmit oscillator 21 which is tunable over a frequency range of from 1 MHz to 1.7 MHz. One input of an AM modulator 22 is coupled to the oscillator 21 and the other input to an output of the FM demodulator 20. The output of the AM modulator 22 is coupled to a harmonic filter 23 having a bandwidth of 700 KHz from 1.0 MHz to 1.7 MHz and a center frequency FC6, e.g. 1300 KHz for suppressing undesired harmonics from the AM modulator 22. The output of the harmonic filter 23 is coupled to an AM output amplifier 24 which is, in turn, coupled to an AM output filter 25 having a bandwidth of 700 KHz and a center frequency FC7, wherein FC7 =FC6. The output of the AM filter 25 is coupled to a second input of the AM/FM diplexer 19 which, as indicated above, has an output coupled to the diplexer 2 leading to the antenna 1 for transmitting either an AM or an FM modulated carrier., 40879=This is a continuation in part patent application of a parent patent application, Ser. No. 08/249,895, now abandoned filed May 26, 1994 and assigned to the same assignee of the parent patent application., 41810=Television audio signal converters have heretofore been proposed, illustrative of which are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,905,303 which was granted to Johnson, Jr. et al. on Feb. 27, 1990 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,021,737 which was granted to Burdick S. Trask on May 3, 1977.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While different preferred embodiments of the present invention are described above, it is contemplated that modifications may be made to each embodiment of the features of any other embodiment and that modification may be made thereto for particular applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the embodiments described be considered only as illustrative of the present invention and that the scope thereof should not be limited thereto but be determined by reference to the claims hereinafter provided. Both stereo decoder and stereo modulator 780 and 781 and SAP decoder 790 are conventional circuits and may be included in the same integrated circuit chip and are shown separately only for convenience. Switch means 782 is provided for switching the stereo decoder on and off to provide either stereo or monaural audio signals to the transmitter section 713. Similarly, switch means 792 is provided to select between primary audio signal programming and secondary audio signal programming. Referring to FIG. 16, there is provided in still another embodiment of the present invention a secondary audio programming decoder 790. Decoder 790 is coupled between the amplifier 739 and the modulation limiter 742 as described above with respect to FIG. 11 for receiving and transmitting SAP signals. Referring to FIG. 15, there is provided for use in a stereo embodiment of the present invention a stereo decoder designated generally as 780",
