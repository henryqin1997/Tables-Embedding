    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31460=Due to the difficulty of implementing high-speed variable-length decoders, there are several special variable-length codes designed for fast and inexpensive decoders. For example, a variable-length encoder with a length-indicating prefix is proposed by J. Cocke et al in U.S. Pat. No. 3,717,851 issued Oct. 24, 1972. In \"Variable Word Length Coding for a High Data Rate DPCM Video Coder,\" Proc. of Picture Coding Symposium, 1986, pp. 54-56, M. E. Lukacs proposed a hardware architecture that is capable of fast decoding of specially designed variable length codes. These approaches tradeoff coding efficiency with hardware speed., 32119=A table-lookup based approach is an alternative to the bit-by-bit search operation. In a table-lookup based approach, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,675,212, issued on Jul. 4, 1972 to J. Raviv et al, the received bit string is compared with the contents of a codeword table. The codeword table has an entry associated with each possible variable-length codeword that includes the decoded fixed-length word and the length of the variable-length word. When the sequence of leading bits in an input register matches one of the entries in the codeword table, a codeword match is indicated. The input register is then shifted by the number of bits indicated by code length entry, thereby making the next sequence of bits available for comparison with entries in the codeword table. Disadvantageously, bit-by-bit shifting at the very high speed multiple of the sample rate is required to enable the decoder to maintain the sample rate of decoding., 40056=The outputs 111 of barrel shifter 109 are connected to a memory device 112. In the described embodiment, memory device 112 takes the form of a programmable logic array (PLA). The PLA in FIG. 1 is shown as comprising a codeword table AND-plane 113, a word-length table OR-plane 114, and a decoded-words table OR-plane 115, but may actually take the form of two PLAs each having an AND-and an OR-plane. Each codeword is represented as an entry in a codeword table AND-plane 113 according to the bit pattern of the codeword. Within the AND-plane the entry for each codeword consists of 16-bit positions. Since most codewords in a codeword library in which the maximum length word is 16-bits have fewer than 16 bits, the bit positions in the table entry for the bits beyond the actual codeword bit pattern are designated \"don't care\" positions. A codeword is detected when a sequence of input bits matches the bit pattern of one of the codeword bits patterns stored in the codeword table. Thus, for example, if one of the variable-length codewords is \"01\", its 16-bit table entry will be \"01XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" where each \"X\" represents a \"don't care\". If the received bit stream has a pattern \"0111110000011101 . . . \", then it is uniquely identified with this table entry since a match occurs on the first two bits. The first two bits are thus recognized as a variable-length word and the next word begins with the third bit.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above-described embodiments are illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Other embodiments could be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. If the cell has been programmed as a \"1\"-cell, the X 520 is \"0\" and Y 521 is \"1\". Transistor 505 is thus \"off\" and transistor 506 is \"on\". If Bit-- j lead 531 is \"1\", Bit-- j lead 530 is \"0\" and P 523 is \"0\". The Match lead 505 remains \"1\" thus indicating a match. If Bit-- j lead 531 is \"0\", Bit-- j lead 530 is \"1\" and P 523 is \"1\". Match lead 515 is thus pulled to \"0\", indicating a mismatch. In each group of cells associated with each possible codeword, if one bit of the input sequence is not matched, the Match line 515 is pulled to \"0\" thereby indicating that the input is not a match with the codeword stored in that group. Only the codeword that perfectly matches enables Match line 515 to remain \"1\" which is then used to read out the decoded codeword and word-length in the associated RAMs. If the cell is a \"0\"-cell, then X 520 is \"1\" and Y 521 is \"0\". Therefore transistor 505 is \"on\" and transistor 506 is \"off\". If the data of the Bit-- j lead 531 is \"1\", P 523 will be \"1\". Transistor",
