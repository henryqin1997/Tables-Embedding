    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the case where an optical information reading apparatus is miniaturized by using a lens of a wide field angle, when the specifications of the reading width remain unchanged from those of the conventional one, an output signal corresponding to an end of the image sensor has a lower amplitude. When a thin bar is to be read, furthermore, the amplification factor is lowered. Also in such a case, it is possible to obtain an output which can be easily binarized, with the result that the optical information reading apparatus can be miniaturized. As seen from the above description, according to the invention, a parallel circuit of an input resistor and a series circuit of a capacitor and another resistor is connected as the input circuit of the logarithmic amplifier to which an output signal of an image sensor is input. Therefore, the impedance of the logarithmic amplifier is varied in accordance with the frequency and the amplification factor is made larger as the frequency is higher. Even a signal obtained from a bar code consisting of thin bars or narrow gaps is enhanced in amplitude so that the output of the logarithmic amplifier has a waveform which can be easily binarized. Consequently, the optical information reading apparatus can sufficiently cope with bar codes consisting of bars of various thicknesses, or the like. When a window is formed so as to extend over the front portion",
