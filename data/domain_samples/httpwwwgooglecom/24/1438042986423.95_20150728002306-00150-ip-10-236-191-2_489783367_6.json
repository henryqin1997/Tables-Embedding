    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although illustrated and described herein with reference to certain specific embodiments, the present invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the spirit of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, the above described safety system is fitted within a breakaway system 90, so that upon a breakaway/release condition, the safety system is activated, shutting off fluid flow by seating of the valve bodies in the valve seats. In such a breakaway system, one or more connectors, such as multipoint connector 46 may be designed to allow separation from cable 48 or links 42/44 after enough force has been exerted to seat valve bodies 26/28 in valve seats 57/59. This would prevent further damage from pulling on the destination/source equipment, while still cutting off fluid flow. A condition that can cause such a breakaway condition is a container truck driving away with a transfer hose still attached to the fill/delivery station and the truck. When safety system 10 and breakaway system 90 are used a hose 50, containment of pressurized fluid is achieved at both ends during a breakaway failure condition. Breakaway system 90 may be used on one or both ends of a hose 50, but will generally be used on one end.",
