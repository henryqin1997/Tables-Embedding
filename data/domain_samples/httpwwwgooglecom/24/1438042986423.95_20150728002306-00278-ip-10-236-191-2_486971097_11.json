    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20789=A previous disclosure, U.S. Pat. Application No. 2006/0082699 describes one approach to reducing the cost of diffusion plates by laminating separate layers of a self-supporting substrate and an optically diffuse film. Although this solution is novel the need to use adhesives to laminate these layers together results in reduced efficiency of the system by adding light absorption materials. Also the additional processing cost to laminate the layers together is self-defeating. Also, this previous disclosure does not solve the issue of the thick form factor and heavy weight of the diffuser plate. Nor does this solution address the issue of warping of the diffuser plate., 21496=Another previous disclosure, US Pat. Application No. 2006/0171164 describes an optical film structure or element disposed between LC panel and a illumination source. This optical element uses film fixing parts attached to the optical films which are further attached to film tension controlling members which are connected to a frame. This disclosure describes the significant advantages of such an optical element in terms of preventing distortion of the optical films by maintaining tension on the films. One shortcoming of this disclosure, however, is that the use of film fixing parts as taught to connect the film tension controlling member to the film is very impractical in terms of a low manufacturing cost approach. The process of forming the film fixing parts and then attaching them to the optical films is a complex high cost means of providing a tensioning force to the optical films. Also, US Pat. Application No. 2006/0171164 does not teach how one could eliminate the thick plate diffuser by replacing it with a diffuser film that has equivalent optical performance., 56896=The optical diffuser film 214 may be provided with protection from ultraviolet (UV) light, for example by including UV absorbing material or material in one of the layers that is resistant to the effects of UV light. Suitable UV absorbing compounds are available commercially, including, e.g., Cyasorb\ufffd UV-1164, available from Cytec Technology Corporation of Wilmington, Del., and Tinuvin\ufffd 1577, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals of Tarrytown, N.Y., 17038=This application claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Ser. No. 60/900,895 filed on Feb. 12, 2007.}",
