The grinding results are shown in FIG. 9, where line 116 is the \u221226+34 mesh Example 4 belt and line 118 is the \u221234+48 mesh Example 4 belt. The grinding results on 304 stainless steel workpiece at a pressure of 9.1 kilograms and 1750 rpm are shown in FIG. 10, where line 128 is the \u221226+34 mesh Example 4 belt, line 126 is the \u221234+48 mesh Example 4 belt, line 130 is the \u221216+26 mesh electrostatic coated Example 4 belt and line 132 is the \u221216+26 mesh drop coated Example 4 belt. In addition, grade 50, 60, and 80 coated abrasive belts, available from the 3M Company under the trade designation \u201c977F REGALLOY\u201d, were also ground under the latter conditions. The grinding results of these grade 50, 60, and 80 coated abrasive belts are shown in FIG. 10 as lines 124, 120, and 122, respectively., 344022=Examples 7-10 were cut into 10 inch\ufffd2.5 inch (25.4 cm\ufffd6.4 cm) sheets and evaluated using the following test herein referred to as the \u201cRocker Drum Test\u201d. These samples were installed on a cylindrical steel drum of a testing machine. The steel drum was 13 inches (33 cm) in diameter, and was driven by an electric motor and a pushrod lever so that the drum oscillated (rocked back and forth in a small arc). A 1018 carbon steel workpiece (a workpiece is abraded by the abrasive article), {fraction (3/16)} inch (0.48 cm) square, was fixed in a lever arm arrangement above the abrasive article, and a load of about 8 lb (3.6 kg) was applied to the workpiece. As the abrasive article rocked back and forth, the workpiece was abraded, and a {fraction (3/16)} inch\ufffd5.5 inch (0.48 cm\ufffd14 cm) wear path was created on the abrasive article. There were approximately 60 strokes per minute on this wear path. A compressed air stream at 20 psi (138 kPa) was directed onto the abrasive article at the point of contact with the workpiece to clear grinding swarf and debris from the wear path., 301957=The \u221260+120 mesh dried particles were fed into a 40.6 cm disk pelletizer (obtained from Feeco International, Green Bay, Wis.) at 210 g/min. and mixed with acidified water (4.7% nitric acid) which was sprayed into the 40.6 cm disk pelletizer at 96 g/min. Uniform sized agglomerates were formed. The agglomerates were dried in aluminum trays a forced air oven at 95\ufffd C. for 16 hours. The dried agglomerates were calcined in a conventional box furnace at 650\ufffd C. for 8 hours. After cooling, about 1000 grams of the calcined agglomerates were soaked in 2000 ml of REO1 solution (see Example 1). An aspirator was used to pull a vacuum on the agglomerates/solution contained in the flask. After about 5 minutes, the vacuum was released, and the agglomerates placed in a B\ufffdchner filter with #54 paper. An aspirator was used to aid in the removal of excess surface liquid. The impregnated agglomerates were then dried, calcined, and fired/sintered as described in Example 1, except, the firing/sintering temperature was 1410\ufffd C., 299183=The wet make resin weight was about 145 g/m2. The agglomerate abrasive grain weight was about 600 g/m2 (\u221220+30 mesh) and about 1000 g/m2 (\u22126+20 mesh). Immediately after the make coat was applied, the agglomerates were drop coated. The make resin was precured for 90 minutes at 88\ufffd C. The wet size weight was about 650 g/m2 (\u221220+30 mesh) and about 900 g/m2 (\u221216+20 mesh). The size resin was precured for 90 minutes at 88\ufffd C., followed by a final cure of 10 hours at 100\ufffd C. A conventional KBF4 supersize coating (320 g/m2) was applied on top of the cured size coat. The coated abrasive discs were flexed prior to testing., 342122=The size resin was a 52:48 mixture by weight of cryolite:water-based phenolic (obtained from Georgia-Pacific Resins, Columbus, Ohio; product number GP23155B) and was applied to the samples by hand with a paint brush. The size coated samples were heated in the convection oven for about 1 hour at about 180\ufffd F. (82\ufffd C.), and then cured for about 2 hours at about 200\ufffd F. (93\ufffd C.), followed by about 30 minutes at about 220\ufffd F. (104\ufffd C.) and about 1 hour at about 245\ufffd F. (118\ufffd C.). After curing, the coated abrasive samples were flexed over a 2 inch (5 cm) diameter bar in order to make the coated sample more suitable for installation into the Rocker Drum Test apparatus (described below)., 318212=Example 5 was prepared as follows. A boehmite sol was prepared by mixing 1194 parts of boehmite (\u201cDISPERAL\u201d) with 3000 parts of acidified water (prepared by mixing 3000 parts of deionized water with 71 parts of concentrated nitric acid) using a continuous mixer. The sol was dried at less than 160\ufffd C. for less than 48 hours. The dried material was crushed, and then screened to produce \u221240 +80 mesh (U.S. Standards screen size) particles The retained particles were fed into a rotary calcining kiln to provide calcined material of gamrna alumina. The calcining kiln consisted of a 15 cm inner diameter, 1.2 meter in length, stainless steel tube having a 0.3 meter hot zone. The tube was inclined at a 3.0 degree angle with respect to the horizontal. The tube rotated at about 3.5 rpm, to provide a residence time in the tube of about 4-5 minutes. The temperature of the hot zone was about 650\ufffd C., 154840=This application claims priority to provisional applications having U.S. Serial Nos. 60/238,844 and 60/238,826, filed Oct. 6, 2000, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference., 291521=Example 1 was prepared as follows. A boehmite sol was prepared by mixing 1194 parts of boehmite (obtained under the trade designation \u201cDISPERAL\u201d from Condea Chemie, GmbH of Hamburg, Germany) with 3000 parts of acidified water (prepared by mixing 3000 parts of deionized water with 71 parts of concentrated nitric acid) using a continuous mixer. The sol was dried at less than 160\ufffd C. for less than 48 hours. The dried material was crushed, and then screened to produce \u2212100 mesh (U.S. Standards screen size) particles., 316582=The grinding performance of \u221216+26 electrostatic coated Example 4 belts, as well as Comparative Example E belts made from ANSI grade 36 abrasive particles available from the 3M Company under the trade designation \u201c321 CUBITRON\u201d were evaluated on cast aluminum at a pressure of 150 psi (1031 kPa) and 7380 surface ft./min. (2250 m/min.) Referring FIG. 11a, line 136 shows the grinding data for the \u221216+26 electrostatic coated Example 4 belt, line 134 is the grinding data for the Comparative Example E belt. The Comparative Example E belt was made as described above using electrostatic coated abrasive grain., 306990=The porosity value of the agglomerate abrasive grain was determined by dividing the interstitial porosity in the agglomerate abrasive grain by the total volume of the agglomerates and then multiply the result by 100%. This method of providing a porosity value was developed as follows. For spheres, which the agglomerates typically approximate, the maximum density obtainable for the random packing of uniform spheres is 63% (see \u201cMechanical Packing of Spherical Agglomerates\u201d, Journal of the American Ceramic Society, Vol. 44, No. 10, October 1961, pp. 513-22, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). For a mass of the agglomerate abrasive grain, the total volume, TV, is equal to the sum of the volume of agglomerate abrasive grain, VA, plus the volume of the void between agglomerate abrasive grain, VV. Note that the total volume, TV, is also the inverse of the tap density, TD., 240724=Gap 152 width may range, for example, from 25 micometers (1 mil) to 5080 micometers (200 mils). Typically, gap 152 width ranges from 127 micrometers (5 mils) to 1270 micrometers (50 mils)., 218491=converting the agglomerated particles into agglomerate abrasive grain (see, e.g., copending application having U.S. Ser. No. 09/972,316, filed Oct. 5, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. One embodiment of the method includes forming precursor agglomerate abrasive grain from a plurality of at least one of abrasive particles or precursor abrasive particles, curable binder precursor material, and ceramic binder precursor material. A composition comprising a plurality of at least one of abrasive particles or precursor abrasive particles, curable binder precursor material, and ceramic binder precursor material is passed through at least one orifice in a substrate. The resulting agglomerated particles (precursor agglomerate abrasive grain) are separated from the substrate. The precursor agglomerate abrasive grain is converted into agglomerate abrasive grain according to the present invention. Typically, converting the precursor agglomerate abrasive grain includes at least partially curing the curable binder precursor material present in the precursor agglomerate abrasive grain., 336484=The resulting calcined precursor agglomerate abrasive grain were further reduced in size to provide a desired size distribution for making coated abrasive articles. The calcined precursor agglomerate abrasive grain were further reduced in size by passing them through the size-reducing machine (\u201cQUADRO COMIL\u201d) using a carbide-tipped Arrow 1607 impeller at a 0.175 inch (4.44 mm) gap and a 0.079 inch (2.00 mm) grater screen. The resulting calcined precursor agglomerate abrasive grain were screened and the size fraction larger than 20 mesh (0.0320 in, 0.81 mm) and smaller than 12 mesh (0.0661 in, 1.70 mm) was retained., 304377=Example 3 and Comparative Example B coated abrasive discs were ground on a Slide Action Grinder using 10.5 kilograms pressure and 1018 mild steel workpieces. Each coated abrasive disc was mounted on a beveled aluminum back-up pad, and used to grind the face of a pre-weighed 1.25 cm\ufffd18 cm\ufffd10 cm 1018 mild steel workpiece. The disc was driven at 5,000 rpm while the portion of the disc overlaying the bevelcd edge of the back-up pad contacted the workpiece. Each disc was used to grind individual workpiece in a sequence of one-minute intervals. The initial, cut, final cut, and total cut for the \u221220+24 mesh coated abrasive discs were 80.4 grams, 26.8 grams, and 804.4 grams, respectively, and for the Comparative Example B coated abrasive discs, 113.6 grams, 5.3 grams, and 884.2 grams, respectively. Additional grinding data is presented in FIG. 7, wherein line 100 shows grinding data for the \u221220+24 mesh Example 3 coated abrasive discs, and line 102, grinding data for the Comparative Example B coated abrasive discs., 305498=Example 4 was prepared as follows. Dried material was prepared as described in Example 1, except it was screened to \u221260+120 mesh (15% +40 mesh; 41% +50 mesh; 11% +60 mesh; 20% +80 mesh; and 13% \u221280 mesh). The \u221260+120 mesh dried particles were fed into the 40.6 cm disk pelletizer at a rate of 275 g/min. and mixed with acidified water (5.45% nitric acid) which was sprayed into the agglomerator (onto the particles) at 108 g/min. Uniform sized agglomerates were formed. The resulting agglomerates were fed into a vibratory feeder and fed into a 6 meter belt oven at temperature of 115\ufffd C. The speed of the belt was a speed of 76 cm/min. The dried agglomerates were calcined as described in Example 1, and then screened over a 34 stainless steel screen (580 micrometers) to remove fines, and then through a 13TM screen (1650 micrometers) to remove coarse particles., 260399=Generally, the preferred abrasive particles have a length in the range from about 100 to about 5000 micrometers (typically in the range from about 100 to about 3000 micrometers), although other sizes are also useful, and may even be preferred for certain applications. In another aspect, the preferred abrasive particles typically have an aspect ratio of at least 1.2:1 or even 1.5:1, sometimes at least 2:1, and alternatively, at least 2.5:1., 200578=The type of iron oxide source employed to make abrasive grain described herein can vary. Preferably, it is a crystalline particulate material. Such particulate material can be spherical, acicular, or plate-like, depending upon the crystallinity of the particles and/or the method of preparation. Whatever the shape of the particulate material, it preferably has a surface area of at least about 60 m2/g (more preferably, at least about 80 m2/g, and most preferably, at least about 100 m2/g) and an average particle size of less than about 1 micrometer (more preferably, less than about 0.5 micrometer). In this context, \u201cparticle size\u201d is defined by the longest dimension of a particles. In preferred embodiments, the crystalline particles are acicular with an aspect ratio of at least about 2:1. One particularly preferred material has acicular particles with a length of about 0.04-0.1 micrometer and a width of about 0.01-0.02 micrometer. Such particles can be obtained from a variety of suppliers of magnetic media pigment such as Magnox Pulaski, Inc., Pulaski, Va., 340102=Coated abrasive articles with polyester cloth backings and phenolic-based make and size resins were prepared Examples 7-10 agglomerate abrasive grain. The Y-weight backing cloth was a sateen weave polyester with a basis weight of approximately 535 g/m2 (obtained from Wisselink Textiles, Aalten, Netherlands). The make resin was a 52:48 mixture by weight of CaCO3:water-based phenolic (obtained from Georgia-Pacific Resins, Columbus, Ohio; product number GP23155B)., 297100=A boehmite sol was prepared by mixing 1194 parts of boehmite (\u201cDISPERAL\u201d) with 3000 parts of acidified water (prepared by mixing 3000 parts of deionized water with 71 parts of concentrated nitric acid), 390 parts of magnesium nitrate solution (11% MgO solids; obtained from Mineral Research and Development Corp., Harrisburg, N.C.), and 400 parts of a 3.6%, on a theoretical oxide basis, Fe2O3 of a suspension of an iron oxyhydroxide (\u03b3-FeOOH; aqueous dispersion (pH=5.0-5.5), about 90 to 95% of which is lepidocrocite and goethite, acicular particles with an average particle size of about 0.05 to 0.1 micrometer, a length to diameter or width ratio of about 1:1 to 2:1, and a surface area of about 115.3 m2/g) using a continuous mixer. The sol was dried at less than 160\ufffd C. for less than 48 hours. The dried material was crushed, and then screened to produce \u2212100 mesh (U.S. Standards screen size) particles., 231956=Ultraviolet-activated photoinitiators suitable for the present invention may be obtained under the trade designations \u201cIRGACURE 651\u201d, \u201cIRGACURE 184\u201d, \u201cIRGACURE 369\u201d and \u201cIRGACURE 819\u201d from Ciba Geigy Company, Winterville, Miss., \u201cLucirin TPO-L\u201d, from BASF Corp., Livingston, N.J., and \u201cDAROCUR 1173\u201d from Merck & Co., Rahway, N.J. In one embodiment, the total amount of initiator (either photoinitiator, thermal initiator, or combinations thereof) may be in the range from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight of the curable binder precursor; in another embodiment, from about 1 to about 5 percent by weight of the curable binder precursor. If both photoinitiator and thermal initiator are used, the ratio of photoinitiator to thermal initiator is between about 3.5:1 to about 1:1., 199256=Suitable iron oxide sources can be prepared by a variety of techniques well known in the art. For example, a dispersion of hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) can be prepared by the thermal treatment of iron nitrate solutions, as is described, for example, by E. Matijevic et al., J. Colloidal Interface Science, 63, 509-24 (1978), and B. Voight et al., Crystal Research Technology, 21, 1177-83 (1986), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Lepidocrocite (\u03b3-FeOOH) can be prepared, for example, by the oxidation of Fe(OH)2 with a NaNO2 solution. Maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3) can be obtained, for example, by dehydrating \u03b3-FeOOH in a vacuum. \u03b3-FeOOH can also be converted to \u03b1-Fe2O3, for example, by heating or grinding \u03b3-FeOOH in air. Goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) can be synthesized, for example, by air oxidation of ferrous hydroxide or by aging a dispersion of ferric hydroxide at an elevated temperature and high pH. Additional information on the preparation of oxides of iron can be found, for example, in the articles by R. N. Sylva, Rev. Pure Applied Chemistry. 22, 15 (1972), and T. Misawa et al., Corrosion Science, 14 131 (1974), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference., 345120=The amount of steel removed after each 1000 cycles (one cycle being one back-and-forth motion) was recorded as the \u201cinterval cut\u201d and the \u201ctotal cut\u201d was the cumulative total of \u201cinterval cuts\u201d) amount of steel removed at the endpoint of the test. The endpoint of the test was determined to be when a predetermined number of cycles were completed or when the cut rate dropped to less than approximately 40% of the maximum interval cut recorded for that test. The results presented in Table 2, below, are an average of two samples per Example., 292059=Approximately 5.7 liters (1.5 gallon) of the \u2212100 mesh material were placed in the mixer pan of a Eirich mixer (Model RVO2, obtained from Eirich Machines Inc., Gurnee, Ill.). With both the pan rotation and beater bar at their lowest settings, 1000 ml of a rare earth nitrate solution (solution (hereafter referred to as \u201cREO1 solution\u201d) prepared by mixing a lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium nitrate (having, on a theoretical metal oxide basis, 23% rare earth oxide (i.e., La2O3, Nd2O3, and Y2O3); available from Molycorp of Lourviers, Colo.) with a sufficient amount of magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2.6H2O) solution (having, on a theoretical metal oxide basis, 11% MgO; available from Mallinckrodt Chemical of Paris, Ky.) and cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2.6H2O) solution (having, on a theoretical metal oxide basis 19% CoO; available from Hall Chemical of Wickliffe, Ohio) to provide a solution containing, on a theoretical metal oxide basis 5.8% La(NO3)3.6H2O, 5.8% Nd(NO3)3.6H2O, about 7.1% Y(NO3)3.6H2O, about 14.4% Mg(NO3)3.6H2O, about 0.4% Co(NO3)2.6H2O, and the balance deionized water) in a 4-liter flask) was slowly poured into the mixing pan, leading to agglomeration of the \u2212100 mesh material. After about 30 seconds of mixing, rotation was stopped and the pan emptied into aluminum trays. The agglomerates were dried in a forced air oven at 80\ufffd C. for 16 hours, and then screened using a No. 22 stainless screen (978 micrometer openings) to separate the agglomerates. The retained agglomerates were crushed using a pulverizer (Model UD, obtained from Braun Corp., Los Angeles, Calif.). The crushed material was then screened over a No. 70 stainless screen (269 micrometer openings). The retained agglomerates were fed into a rotary calcining kiln to provide calcined material. The calcining kiln consisted of a 15 cm inner diameter, 1.2 meter in length, stainless steel tube having a 0.3 meter hot zone. The tube was inclined at a 3.0 degree angle with respect to the horizontal. The tube rotated at about 3.5 rpm, to provide a residence time in the tube of about 4-5 minutes. The temperature of the hot zone was about 650\ufffd C., 301498=Example 3 was prepared as follows. A boehmite sol was prepared by mixing 1194 parts of boehmite (\u201cDISPERAL\u201d) with 3000 parts of acidified water (prepared by mixing 3000 parts of deionized water with 71 parts of concentrated nitric acid) using a continuous mixer. The sol was dried at less than 160\ufffd C. for less than 48 hours. The dried material was crushed, and then screened to produce \u221260+120 mesh (U.S. Standards screen size) particles.}",
