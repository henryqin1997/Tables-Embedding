The specific ratio of m:n used will depend on the particular polymerization system in which the polymerizable surfactant of the present invention is incorporated. Varying the ratio of m:n will vary the HLB (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) of the polymerizable surfactant compound. If the polymerization system requires a hydrophobic surfactant, m will be greater than n. Conversely, if the emulsion polymerization system requires a hydrophilic surfactant, then m will be less than n. The ratio of m:n should be chosen so that the resulting compound is capable of reducing the surface tension of water. Preferably, the surface tension of a 0.1 weight percent aqueous solution of the polymerizable surfactant compound at 25\ufffd C. is less than 38 dynes per centimeter. More preferably, the surface tension of such a solution is in the range of 30 to 35 dynes per centimeter. Surface tension may be measured by a Du Nouy tensiometer., 21258=This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser.

After the addition of the propylene oxide reactant, 500 grams of ethylene oxide was charged slowly to the autoclave, the contents of which were maintained at about 135\ufffd C. The pressure within the autoclave was maintained at about 100 psig (690 kPA) during the entire reaction period. Following the addition of the ethylene oxide reactant, the contents of the autoclave were stirred at 135\ufffd C. for about one hour. The reaction mixture was then neutralized with 1.5 grams of glacial acetic acid. The final product had a molecular weight of 1524 as determined by hydroxyl number (36.8). The product was analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which indicated that the product contained about 7 moles of propylene oxide and 19.3 moles of ethylene oxide.}",

The percent shrinkage was calculated, as described in Example 16, and is tabulated in Table 7. EXAMPLE 36 The emulsion polymerization procedure of Example 31 (Part B) was followed using the product of Example 34. Addition of the monomer emulsion was completed in 1-3/4 hours.
