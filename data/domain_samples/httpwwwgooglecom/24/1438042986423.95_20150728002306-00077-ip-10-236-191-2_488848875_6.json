The preceding flowcharts illustrate particular methods for effecting handoff between cellular network 12 and enterprise network 14. However, these flowcharts illustrate only exemplary methods of operation. While discussion sometimes focuses on handoff in the enterprise-to-cellular direction, similar techniques may be used to provide for handoff in the cellular-to-enterprise direction. Furthermore, communication system 10 contemplates devices using any suitable techniques, elements, and applications for performing these functions. Thus, many of the steps in the flowcharts may take place simultaneously and/or in different orders than as shown. In addition, the devices may use methods with additional steps or fewer steps, so long as the methods remain appropriate. Moreover, other devices of system 10 may perform similar techniques to support handoff between cellular network 12 and enterprise network 14. Thus, method 160 represents another embodiment of a method for effecting handoff between cellular network 12 and enterprise network 14. Furthermore, method 160 illustrates actions that may be taken by mobility application 26 and mobile station 28 to effect handoff of a communication session from enterprise network 14 to cellular network 12. Note that, as discussed above, analogous methods may be used",
