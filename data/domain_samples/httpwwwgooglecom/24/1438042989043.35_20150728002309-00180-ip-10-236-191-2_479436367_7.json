This diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. FIG. 17 is a block diagram of a network system comprising a control server 2100, edge routers 2020 to 2023 and meters 2010 to 2013 connected to a network 2002. The server 2100 manages and controls various components of the network.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{83244=The entry 711 allows more bandwidth to be allocated, since a measured delay time exceeds the upper limit value. The action can comprise increasing a bandwidth value by approximately 0.5 from the current set value. The control server transmits a control command to the router 1, which is an object component. As instructed by the command, the router 1 increases the allocated bandwidth value for the object flow A. Because the bandwidth value is fixed, an expansion value of the bandwidth to the queue 1301 a used by the flow A is subtracted from the allocated bandwidth value of the queue 1301 d shared by non-object flows., 105338=The data type field 21082 specifies characteristics, delay, throughput, and the like, of a flow to be measured by a meter. The arrival/departure field 21083 comprises a parameter for specifying whether the object meter measures the start of a flow or the end of the flow. A measurement interval field 21084 comprises intervals in seconds at which the object meter measures a flow of packets. A value of \u201c0\u201d indicates that every packet is measured. In a reference time field 21085, a basic time for starting a measurement is entered. This time can be referenced to measure a flow of packets. A basic delay time field 21087 can be set to a value related to a meter for which \u201cdelay\u201d is set in the data type field 21082 and \u201carrival\u201d set in the arrival/departure field 21083. This value is an average delay time and its average error range of the transfer from a \u201cdeparture\u201d meter to an \u201carrival\u201d meter. In the measuring time field 21086, a measuring time calculated on the basis of the reference time for measurement 21085 and the measuring interval 21084 can be entered. In the A/N field 21088, an indication whether the object rule is employed can be entered. A value of \u201cA\u201d means that the object rule is employed and a value of \u201cN\u201d means that an object rule is not employed., 115969=The control server 2100 compares each packet transferred from the meter 2010 with a plurality of packets transferred from the meter 2011. Thereupon, control server 2100 finds the packets agreeing with each other in content, and calculates a difference among the receiving times added to those packets so as to obtain a delay time of the flow 2540. The control server 2100 uses this delay time to compensate the basic delay time., 43739=This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Reference No. 11-342949, filed Dec. 2, 1999, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 83949=The entry 712 indicates a case for measuring a throughput. The entry 712 has a control policy in which the bandwidth value is increased (action A1 is executed) in accordance with a measured throughput value, which goes under the lower limit value (equivalent to condition C1). Further, the value is decreased (action A3 is executed) when the measured value is over the upper limit value. If a measured value matches with the condition, the router 1 that has received a control command operates the bandwidth for the queue 1301 b that uses a flow C., 112461=The control server 2100 compares each packet transferred from the meter 2010 with a plurality of packets transferred from the meter 2011. The control server 2100 finds the packets agreeing with each other in content and calculates a difference between the receiving times added to those packets, thereby obtaining a basic delay time of each packet flow 2518. In addition, the control server specifies the reference time, the time interval and the basic delay time used by the meter according to this basic delay time 2520. For example, if \u201cDec. 24, 15:00:00, 1999\u201d is set as the reference time, 180 seconds is set for the time interval, 10 seconds is set for the measuring time for both meters 2010 and 2011. Then the basic delay time is calculated as 750(ms)\ufffd50(ms) from the above set values., 94858=In a step 1605, the control server can collect measured data for the test packet. Then, in a step 1606, the server determines whether the measured data satisfies the user's request. If it satisfies the user's request, then in a step 1607, the server determines both route and QoS condition according to the measured data. In a step 1608, the server can instruct the router to control the communication so as to assure the requested communication quality and can instruct a meter to measure the communication data. If the measured data does not satisfy the user's request, then in a step 1609, the server rejects the request. Instructed to transmit a test packet by the control server, the meter generates a test packet in the test packet transmitter 210 and transmits the packet to the object network., 115483=The meter 2011 stores packets from the object flow detected between the start time and the end time of measurement notified by a timer interrupt respectively. Then, meter 2011 adds the packet receiving time to each of the packets in the flow, and transfers the flow to the control server 2532, 2534 and 2536. In addition, the meter 2011 transmits an end packet to the control server 2538 at the end time., 86112=The entry 715 that measures a delay time has a control policy in which action A2 is executed to raise the priority if a measured value agrees to condition C3. In this embodiment, because a measured delay time is over the upper limit value, the server transmits a control command for decreasing the priority of the object flow by one (level 1) from the current value to the router 2. The router 2 changes the current queue of the flow E from 1302 b to 1302 a., 95734=Upon receiving a packet, the measuring unit 202 determines if it is a test packet with reference to the test ID field 1503 of the packet header. If it is determined to be a test packet, the measuring unit 202 measures the data according to the test ID and the set data in the object field 1504. Then, the measuring unit determines whether the meter ID in the end point field 1505 of the header agrees with its own ID. If they agree, the measuring unit 202 discards the received test packet. If a meter does not have a packet transmitter, determining whether to discard by the end point field and the discarding processing are optional and can be omitted. If it is determined not to be a test packet, the measuring unit 202 measures according to the measurement rule. Measured data is then transferred to the control server as discussed above. Both test measurement and normal measurement can be substantially identical. In a specific embodiment, one difference between them is that a test measurement omits a determination for whether the test packet agrees with the object flow conforming to the measurement rule., 111213=The meter 2010 then sets the start time 2504 and stores the packets of the first flow detected after the start time notified by a timer interruption. The meter adds the packet receiving time to the packet and transfers it to the control server 2508. If the meter 2010 cannot detect the packets until the measurement end time is over, the meter 2010 so notifies the control server 2100. The control server sets \u201cN\u201d in the A/N field 21088 in the meter control rule table 2108 and excludes the flow from the application range of the rule., 94412=If the request source information processing terminal is not in the same domain, then, in a step 1604, the control server can instruct a meter in the same broadcast domain as that of the request source information terminal so as to transmit a test packet. If there is no such meter, the control server can instruct the meter closest to the requested source information terminal to transmit the test packet., 113343=If the above values are set for the two meters 2522 and 2524, each of those meters will make measurement under the following conditions., 100311=Each meter is connected to a wireless communication unit 2030 to 2033 for obtaining accurate time information. The network system may also obtain this time information from another time server through the network 2000. In a specific embodiment, techniques for measuring a packet delay generated between information processing terminals 2200 and 2300 within a range 2000 managed by the control server 2100 are provided.}",
