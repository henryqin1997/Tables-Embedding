The claims appended hereto are intended to encompass all such modifications and variations. The model for frontal views are generated from a training set of 35 people looking into a camera. On this set the positions of the eyes and the eye pairs are measured. These measurements provide valuable information to the system controller when running the eye-pair search. Eye pairs can be found easily and reliably. The eye-pair search drastically reduces the number of shapes that have to be taken into account for further analysis. Thus, the preferred method of searching begins with the eye-pair search. Other features and feature combinations are classified in the same way, and an order of the searches is established by the training procedure. Preferably, training procedures are used to provide the system controller with the necessary parameters for the n-gram search. The classifications are based on one or more head models chosen to represent expected situations. The models define all the size parameters required for the classifications and the order of the searches. To avoid a combinatorial explosion when exploring shape combinations, a greedy search is done, and a proper search order is thereby established. The order of",
