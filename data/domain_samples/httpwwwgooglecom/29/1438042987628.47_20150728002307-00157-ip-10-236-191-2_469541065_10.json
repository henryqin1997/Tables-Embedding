At about an f-ratio of 0.25, the two are nearly coincident. For an f-ratio of 0.25, the layer thicknesses are d1=71.43 nm and d2=250.00 nm. The hi and low bandedges are at 967 nm and 1037 nm at normal incidence, the same as for the f-ratio =0.75. The p-pol bandedges shift the same as for f=0.75 because the amount of material with a z-index of 1.50 is unchanged, but the s-pol bands shift more. For this stack, the low wavelength bandedge shifts the same for s-pol and p-pol. The p-pol band narrows from 70 nm to 52 nm while the s-pol band widens to 91 nm. These results are shown in FIG. 13., 36846=[0008] An iridescent plastic film is currently sold under the trade name BLACK MAGIC\u2122 by the Engelhard Corporation. The film has been advertised in Cosmetics & Personal Care Magazine (September-October 1997) as a black tinted, translucent film 0.7 mil thick but containing more than 100 layers which provides an effect similar to that seen with neon tetra fish, peacock feathers and oil films. The plastic film is a multilayer stack of optically thin films. Thickness variations in the films results in color variations across the area of the film. Although the deviations of the thickness caliper from its average value are not large, they are significant in terms of the color differences in adjacent areas. The various versions of the film are not labeled as a single reflectance color, but instead as dual colored films. For example, the film is commercially available in blue/green and red/green color combinations, among others., 403882=[0456] A group of antioxidants that are especially preferred are sterically hindered phenols, including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Vitamin E (di-alpha-tocopherol), Irganox\u2122 1425WL(calcium bis-(O-ethyl(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl))phosphonate), Irganox\u2122 1010 (tetrakis(methylene(3,5,di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate))methane), Irganox\u2122 1076 (octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), Ethanox\u2122 702 (hindered bis phenolic), Etanox 330 (high molecular weight hindered phenolic), and Ethanox\u2122 703 (hindered phenolic amine)., 312118=[0321] The cast web was length oriented with a draw ratio of about 3.8:1 at about 130\ufffd C. In the tenter, the film was preheated before drawing to about 138\ufffd C. in about 9 seconds and then drawn in the transverse direction at about 140\ufffd C. to a draw ratio of about 5: 1, at a rate of about 60% per second. The finished film had a final thickness of about 0.02 mm. The optical spectra are shown in FIG. 21., 156626=[0148] The same calculations were made for an isotropic stack, using n1x=1.75 and n1z=1.75, with n2x=1.50 and n2z=1.50. The results are given in FIG. 11. For an f-ratio of 0.50, the layer thicknesses are d1=142.86 nm and d2=166.67 nm. The hi and low bandedges are at 953 nm and 1052 nm at normal incidence, the same as the anisotropic material. With angle, the p-pol bandedges narrow dramatically, while the s-pol bandedges are identical to the anisotropic ones. The p-pol band narrows from 99 nm to 29 nm while the s-pol band widens to 124 nm. The center of the isotropic band is the same for s-pol and p-pol, while for anisotropic material, the center of the p-pol band decreases more than the center of the s-pol band. The separation of the s-pol and p-pol bandedges at 60\ufffd in air is greater than 30 nm. As the index differential of the isotropic materials is increased, the separation of the s and p-pol bandedges also increases. Separations of 50 nm are typical. See, for example, L. Songer, Photonics Spectra, November 1994, page 88., 381527=[0416] The films of the present invention typically contain between 10 and 1000 layers. For a single narrow band reflector, the range is preferably between 10 and 200 layers, and most preferably between 20 and 100 layers. A 50 layer stack of with 1.75/1.50 high /low indices will create a highly reflecting (99% peak R) band of about 10% fractional bandwidth FWHM (full width at half maximum). If the index differential is reduced by a fraction x, then the number of layers must be increased by 1/x to maintain the same peak reflectivity. The bandwidth is also narrowed by the fraction x, and to maintain the same bandwidth the number of layers would have to be increased again by approximately 1/x., 33722=[0001] This application is a continuation of pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/006,591, filed Jan. 13, 1998., 487389=[0567] As an example of how f-ratios can be varied to give a variety of spectral bar-codes from a single feed block, an infrared stack can be made with the 1st order peak placed at 1300 nm so that 2nd and 3rd order peaks will occur at approximately 650 and 450 nm. If another first order stack is added at 550 nm, three peaks appear in the visible region with varying intensity, depending on the f-ratio chosen during the manufacturing run., 316380=[0327] The feedblock used to make the film for this example was designed to give a linear layer thickness distribution with a 1.3:1 ratio of thickest to thinnest layers under isothermal conditions. To achieve a smaller ratio for this example, a thermal profile was applied to the feedblock. The portion of the feedblock making the thinnest layers was heated to 285\ufffd C., while the portion making the thickest layers was heated to 265\ufffd C. In this manner the thinnest layers are made thicker than with isothermal feedblock operation, and the thickest layers are made thinner than under isothermal operation . Portions intermediate were set to follow a linear temperature profile between these two extremes. The overall effect is a narrower layer thickness distribution which results in a narrower reflectance spectrum. Some layer thickness errors are introduced by the multipliers, and account for the minor differences in the spectral features of each reflectance band. The casting wheel speed was adjusted for precise control of final film thickness, and therefore, final color., 233417=[0232] In general, multilayer flow stability is achieved by matching or balancing the Theological properties, such as viscosity and elasticity, between the first and second materials to within a certain tolerance. The level of required tolerance or balance also depends on the materials selected for the PBL and skin layers. In many cases, it is desirable to use one or more of the optical stack materials individually in the various PBL or skin layers. For polyesters, the typical ratio between high and low viscosity materials is no more than 4:1, preferably no more than 2:1, and most preferably no more than 1.5:1 for the process conditions typical of feedblocks, multipliers, and dies. Using the lower viscosity optical stack material in the PBL and skin layers usually enhances flow stability. More latitude in the requirements for a second material to be used with a given first material is often gained by choosing additional materials for these PBL and skin additional layers. Often, the viscosity requirements of these third materials are then balanced with the effective average viscosities of the multilayer stack comprising the first and second materials. Typically, the viscosity of the PBL and skin layers should be lower than this stack average for maximal stability. If the process window of stability is large, higher viscosity materials can be used in these additional layers, for example, to prevent sticking to rollers downstream of casting in a length orienter., 128924=[0114] Conversely, the materials can be selected so that some layers have a z-index mismatch, wherein the z-index of the material having the higher in-plane indices of refraction is the lowest. One such combination is PEN/PETG. PETG, if stretched at temperatures above 1200 Celsius has an isotropic index of about 1.57. PEN, if stretched as described in example E1-1, has nx\u22451.75, ny\u22451.75, and nz\u22451.50. These layers will exhibit increased reflectivity at oblique angles for both polarizations so that, if used alone or in combination with z-index matched layers, the resulting film can be designed to appear colored at normal incidence and silver at oblique angles. Other copolyesters and polycarbonates with indices above 1.55 are suitable materials to use in combination with PEN to achieve this effect. While the above examples deal with making a composite film which is colorless for at least one angle of view, these same design techniques can be used to make unusual color shifts (desirable for decorative, security, etc.) which are not colorless at practically any angle of view., 200907=[0197] Furthermore, while it is preferred that the branch stream in each branch channel is simultaneously expanded and contracted so that the ratio of the rates of expansion to contraction is essentially about 1:1, other embodiments are possible wherein the ratio of expansion to contraction is less than or greater than 1:1. The expansion to contraction ratio may also be varied over a given range along the length of a branch channel (i.e., from 0.5:1 to 1.5:1) in either a linear or nonlinear fashion. Thus, for example, the expansion to contraction ratio could be varied stepwise or quadratically along the length (i.e., along the z-axis) of the branch channel., 184009=[0175] The various layers in the film preferably have different thicknesses across the film. This is commonly referred to as the layer thickness gradient. A layer thickness gradient is selected to achieve the desired band width of reflection. One common layer thickness gradient is a linear one, in which the thickness of the thickest layer pairs is a certain percent thicker than the thickness of the thinnest layer pairs. For example, a 1.055:1 layer thickness gradient means that the thickest layer pair (adjacent to one major surface) is 5.5% thicker than the thinnest layer pair (adjacent to the opposite surface of the film). In another embodiment, the layer thickness could decrease, then increase, then decrease again from one major surface of the film to the other. This is believed to provide sharper bandedges, and thus a sharper or more abrupt transition from reflective to transmissive regions of the spectrum. This preferred method for achieving sharpened bandedges is described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 6,157,490 (Wheatley et al.) titled \u201cOptical Film with Sharpened Bandedge\u201d, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference., 484112=[0562]FIG. 43 shows the computed spectra for a film constructed of three sets of 50 layers of PET and a 1.60 index co-PEN, with each set being either 0.8, 1.0, or 1.2 multiples of a 550 nm design wavelength. The layers in each set of 50 layers has an identical initial optical thickness. The upper and lower curves represent the extreme excursions of the spectra when each layer is varied by a 2% 1-6 standard deviation. This type of film construction is capable of encoding 9 to 10 bits of data over the spectral range of 400 to 1000 nm, which is equivalent to between 512 and 1024 individual codes. Additional codes may generated by varying the intensity of each peak; thus, over one million different codes can be created by using only four different intensity levels., 463728=[0542] FIGS. 36 to 39 show useful designs of cold mirrors and color selective mirrors wherein the mirror is used to reflect desired components of solar radiation into a building while passing infrared radiation not useful for plant growth out of the building. The figures also illustrate an alternative strategy of passing the desired radiation and reflecting the undesired components of sunlight. The mirror may be a broadband mirror which reflects essentially all of the solar spectrum of wavelength less than about 800 nm into the building as in FIGS. 36 and 37, or the mirror may spectrally filter out both infrared radiation and components of the visible spectrum that are not desired for plant growth. FIGS. 38 and 39 show constructions in which green light (from about 500-600 nm) and infrared light (from about 800-2000 nm) are transmitted or reflected by the film to exit the building, while magenta light composed of blue light (from about 400-500 nm) and red light (from about 600-800 nm) is reflected or directly transmitted into the building. The film shown would have a bimodal layer thickness distribution to produce the necessary reflective properties (e.g., one set of layers of the film illustrated in FIG. 39 would reflect green wavelengths, and the other set would be a 2 or 3 material IR reflecting/visible transmitting stack design as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,260 (Wheatley et al.) titled \u201cMulticomponent Optical Body\u201d. In FIG. 38, one reflectance band of the dual band reflecting film would reflect blue light (400-500 nm) and the other band red light (600-800 nm), at the designed angle of incidence. Depending on the required range of angles, a film designed to function in the mode shown in FIG. 39 could also function in the mode illustrated in FIG. 38. An example of such a film and the approximate required angles is given below. Also in FIG. 38, the color selective film is laminated or supported by a transparent base or open frame so the unwanted wavelengths can pass through. Two different types of systems are illustrated in FIG. 39, where the film can be used alone or in combination with a broadband reflector and the films works to filter both the direct solar light impinging on the film as well as redirected light reflected from the broadband reflector. Other filters can be made in accordance with the present invention which provide wavelengths that promote growth of specific plant parts. For example, a color selective film can be tailored to transmit primarily those wavelengths that promote flower growth rather than stem growth. Selective wavelengths of light can also be used to control plant movement. A common practice in raising plants is to rotate the plant periodically due to the tendency of the plant to move toward the light source (phototropism). Some commercial products address this issue by using light sources that physically rotate around the plant. Films can be made in accordance with the teachings of the present invention which are tailored to filter out the wavelengths used by plant photoreceptors to sense and move toward the light (primarily blue), while allowing other useful wavelengths to pass., 278789=[0283] A variety of polymer materials suitable for use in the present invention have been taught for use in making coextruded multilayer optical films. For example, the polyimer materials listed and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,937,134, 5,103,337, 5,1225,448,404, 5,540,978, and 5,568,316 to Schrenk et al., and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,905, 5,122,906, and 5,126,880 to Wheatley and Schrenk are useful for making multilayer optical films according to the present invention. Of special interest are birefringent polymers such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,486,949 and 5,612,820 to Schrenk et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,774 (Jonza et al.), and U.S. application Ser. No. 09/006,601 titled \u201cModified Copolyesters and Improved Multilayer Reflective Films\u201d (now abandoned), all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Regarding the preferred materials from which the films are to be made, there are several conditions which should be met to make the multilayer optical films of this invention. First, these films should consist of at least two distinguishable polymers; the number is not limited, and three or more polymers may be advantageously used in particular films. Second, at least one of the two required polymers, referred to as the \u201cfirst polymer\u201d, preferably has a stress optical coefficient having a large absolute value. In other words, it preferably should be capable of developing a large birefringence when stretched. Depending on the application, the birefringence may be developed between two orthogonal directions in the plane of the film, between one or more in-plane directions and the direction perpendicular to the film plane, or a combination of these. In the special case that the isotropic indices are widely separated, the preference for large birefringence in the first polymer may be relaxed, although birefringence is still usually desirable. Such special cases may arise in the selection of polymers for mirror films and for polarizer films formed using a biaxial process which draws the film in two orthogonal in-plane directions. Third, the first polymer should be capable of maintaining birefringence after stretching, so that the desired optical properties are imparted to the finished film. Fourth, the other required polymer, referred to as the \u201csecond polymer\u201d, should be chosen so that in the finished film, its refractive index, in at least one direction, differs significantly from the index of refraction of the first polymer in the same direction. Because polymeric materials are typically dispersive, that is, the refractive indices vary with wavelength, these conditions must be considered in terms of a particular spectral bandwidth of interest., 179816=[0170] In an alternate embodiment, the two component film may comprise a first portion of alternating layers comprising the six layer alternating layer repeating unit which reflects infrared light of wavelengths between about 1200-2000 nm. and a second portion of alternating layers having an AB repeat unit and substantially equal optical thicknesses which reflect infrared light of wavelengths between about 770-1200 nm. Such a combination of alternating layers results in reflection of light across the infrared wavelength region through 2000 nm, and is commonly known as a \u201chybrid design\u201d. Preferably, the first portion of the alternating layers has a repeat unit gradient of about 5/3:1, and the second portion of alternating layers have a layer thickness gradient of about 1.5:1., 331622=[0347] The feedblock used to make the film for this example was designed to give a linear layer thickness distribution with a 1.3:1 ratio of thickest to thinnest layers under isothermal conditions. To achieve a smaller ratio for this example, a thermal profile was applied to the feedblock. The portion of the feedblock making the thinnest layers was heated to 285\ufffd C, while the portion making the thickest layers was heated to 268\ufffd C. In this manner, the thinnest layers are made thicker than with isothermal feedblock operation, and the thickest layers are made thinner than under isothermal operation. Portions intermediate were set to follow a linear temperature profile between these two extremes. The overall effect is a narrower layer thickness distribution, which results in a narrower reflectance spectrum., 475055=[0551] The feedblock used to make the film for this example was designed to give a linear layer thickness distribution with a 1.3:1 ratio of thickest to thinnest layers under isothermal conditions. To achieve a smaller ratio for this example, a thermal profile was applied to the feedblock. The portion of the feedblock making the thinnest layers was heated to 285\ufffd C., while the portion making the thickest layers was heated to 265\ufffd C. In this manner, the thinnest layers are made thicker than with isothermal feedblock operation, and the thickest layers are made thinner than under isothermal operation. Portions intermediate were set to follow a linear temperature profile between these two extremes. The overall effect is a narrower layer thickness distribution which results in a narrower reflectance spectrum. Some layer thickness errors are introduced by the multipliers, and account for the minor differences in the spectral features of each reflectance band (see FIG. 40). The casting wheel speed was adjusted for precise control of final film thickness, and therefore, final color., 382270=[0417] A cold mirror typically has between 100 and 1000 layers, depending on the application. For horticultural applications, for example, 90% reflectivity is acceptable, and may even be preferable for cost reasons because it can be realized with only about 200 layers. For reflectivities approaching 99%, at least 500 layers are typically preferred, although this number can vary dramatically depending on choice of materials. For example, if the application is such that the tendency of PEN to undergo UV yellowing would be problematic (and if the application precludes the use of UV adsorbers or blockers), then a PET/coPET multilayer system can be substituted, but would require at least about 1000 layers for similar reflectivities., 370134=[0397] In EXAMPLES E8-7, E8-9, and E8-11, samples of PEN/PMMA multilayer color shifting film were placed on a 3M 2150 overhead projector illuminator, Model 2100, and viewed in transmission looking directly at the overhead projector stage. The films of EXAMPLES E8-7 and E8-9 were identical to those of EXAMPLES E8-3 and E8-5. The film of EXAMPLE E8-11 was made in a similar manner to the film of EXAMPLE E8-1, but using a slower casting wheel speed. The films of EXAMPLES E8-7, E8-9, and E8-11 appeared magenta, yellow, and cyan, respectively, when viewed in transmission at normal angles, and yellow, clear, and dark blue, respectively, at oblique angles., 176998=[0169] Another suitable film includes the film described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,659, incorporated herein by reference, which describes a two component film having a six layer alternating repeating unit suppresses the unwanted second, third, and fourth order reflections in the visible wavelength region of between about 380-770 nm while reflecting light in the infrared wavelength region of between about 770-2000 nm. Reflections higher than fourth order will generally be in the ultraviolet, not visible, region of the spectrum or will be of such a low intensity as to be unobjectionable. The film comprises alternating layers of first (A) and second (B) diverse polymeric materials in which the six layer alternating repeat unit has relative optical thicknesses of about 0.778A0.111B0.111A0.778B0.111A0.111B. The use of only six layers in the repeat unit results in more efficient use of material and simpler manufacture than previous designs. A repeat unit gradient may be introduced across the thickness of the film. Thus, in one embodiment, the repeat unit thicknesses will increase linearly across the thickness of the film. By linearly, it is meant that the repeat unit thicknesses increase at a constant rate across the thickness of the film. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to force the repeat unit optical thickness to double from one surface of the film to another. The ratio of repeat unit optical thicknesses can be greater or less than two as long as the short wavelength range of the reflectance band is above 770 nm and the long wavelength edge is about 2000 nm. Other repeat unit gradients may be introduced by using logarithmic and/or quartic functions. A logarithmic distribution of repeat unit thicknesses will provide nearly constant reflectance across the infrared band. In an alternative embodiment, the two component film may comprise a first portion of alternating layers comprising the six layer alternating layer repeating unit which reflects infrared light of wave lengths between about 1200-2000 nm. and a second portion of alternating layers having an AB repeat unit and substantially equal optical thicknesses which reflect infrared light of wavelengths between about 770-1200 nm. Such a combination of alternating layers results in reflection of light across the infrared wavelength region through 2000 nm. Preferably, the first portion of the alternating layers has a repeat unit gradient of about 5/3:1, and the second portion of alternating layers have a layer thickness gradient of about 1.5:1. This hybrid design may be provided as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,659, but has broader application in that it is useful with any of the broadband infrared reflectors or multicomponent optical designs described herein., 146318=[0139] We have subsequently discovered that birefringent multilayer stacks which have a relatively small z-index mismatch can function as non polarizing color filters in certain special cases. In these cases, only one of the bandedges (short or long wavelength edge) of the reflectance band of a simple graded Q\ufffdQ stack will be nonpolarizing, but not both. Certain color filters, such as, e.g., blue or cyan transmitting filters, can have their red bandedges sufficiently far into the IR portions of the spectrum that the polarizing effects there are of no consequence to the intended application. If computer optimization is utilized to adjust layer thickness values then either, or both, bandedges of a thin film stack having an approximate z-index match at the interfaces of two or more materials could be made nonpolarizing to a degree superior to that of an isotropic thin film stack. Two examples are given below of birefringent stacks which display an essentially nonpolarizing effect at their blue bandedges, and have simple layer thickness profiles. Such thin film stacks would provide a significant improvement over the art for nonpolarizing color beamsplitters, an example of which is given by L. Songer, Photonics Spectra, November 1994, page 88. The five layer ABCBA optical repeating unit stacks of Songer were designed to work at 37.5 degrees in BK-7 glass, which has an index of about 1.52., 182487=[0172] As described above, a hybrid design can also be used wherein a first portion of the multilayer stack is designed to reflect at wavelengths above about 1200 nm and a second portion of alternating layers having an AB repeat unit and substantially equal optical thicknesses which reflect infrared light of wavelengths between about 770-1200 nm. Such a combination of alternating layers results in reflection of light across the infrared wavelength region through 2000 nm., 383051=[0418] For a narrow band visible transmission filter, the range is preferably between 100 and 1000, and most preferably between 200 and 500. For a horticultural film having both a green reflector stack and an IR reflector stack, the range is preferably between 200 and 1000 and most preferably between 400 and 800. IR mirror films tuned to wavelengths beyond 1100 nm may require well in excess of 1000 layers, particularly if their stack designs involve more than two layers in the optical repeating unit in order to suppress higher order reflection bands., 244961=[0240] Temperature has a major effect on the characteristic average longest relaxation time of the material, and is thus a major factor in determining whether a given material experiences a weak or strong flow. The dependence of the characteristic time on temperature can be quantified by the well known WLF equation [cf. J.D.Ferry, Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1970]. This equation contains three parameters, c1, c2 and To. Often, T0 is associated with the glass transition temperature, Tg. Using the approximate \u201cuniversal\u201d values for c1 and c2, applicable as a first estimate for many polymers, the WLF equation shows the large dependence on relaxation times with temperature. For example, using a relaxation time at 5\ufffd C. higher than the Tg as a value for comparison, the relaxation times at 10\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C., and 20\ufffd C. higher than Tg are approximately 20, 250 and 2000 times shorter, respectively. Greater accuracy for WLF parameters can be obtained by using empirical curve fitting techniques for a particular class of polymers, e.g. polyesters. Thus, to a first approximation, the single most important parameter for temperature effects on the characteristic time is Tg. The larger the temperature difference between the web temperature and Tg, the smaller the characteristic time and thus the weaker the draw-flow. Further, it is reiterated that this discussion is most pertinent to the draw process prior to crystallization, especially strain induced crystallization. After crystallization occurs, the presence of crystals can further retard relaxation times and convert otherwise weak flows to strong flows., 310142=[0319] An approximate linear gradient in layer thickness was designed for the feedblock for each material with the ratio of thickest to thinnest layers being about 1.72:1. This hardware design of first-to-last layer thickness ratio of 1.72:1 was too great to make the bandwidth desired for the colored mirror of this example. In addition, a sloping blue bandedge resulted from the as-designed hardware. To correct these problems, a temperature profile was applied to the feedblock. Selected layers created by the feedblock can be made thicker or thinner by warming or cooling the section of the feedblock where they are created. This technique was required to produce an acceptably sharp bandedge on the blue side of the reflection band. The portion of the feedblock making the thinnest layers was heated to 304\ufffd C., while the portion making the thickest layers was heated to 274\ufffd C. Portions intermediate were heated between these temperature extremes. The overall effect is a much narrower layer thickness distribution which results in a narrower reflectance spectrum., 324763=[0337] PEN was fed at a rate of 81 lb/hr (37 kg/hr) and at a temperature of 525\ufffd F. (274\ufffd C.) into a 224 layer feedblock. A copolyester of 70% naphthalate and 30% isophthalate with ethylene glycol was fed into the feedblock at a rate of 117 lb/hr (53 kg/hr) and at a temperature of 540\ufffd F. (282\ufffd C.) for the skin layers, and at a rate of 115 lb/hr (52.3 k/hr) and a temperature of 525\ufffd F. (274\ufffd C.) for the optical layers. The temperature of the feedblock was maintained at 555\ufffd F. (290\ufffd C.). The web was cast at 20, 25, and 30 meters/min for EXAMPLES E2-1, E2-2, and E2-3, respectively, and was stretched in a tenter oven at 154\ufffd C. to a stretch ratio of 6:1 to produce colored polarizers., 403123=[0455] Antioxidants useful in the present invention include 4,4\u2032-thiobis-(6-t-butyl-m-cresol), 2,2\u2032-methylenebis-(4-methyl-6-t-butyl-butylphenol), octadecyl-3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate, bis-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, Irganox\u2122 1093 (1979)(((3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl)-dioctadecyl ester phosphonic acid), IrganoXTM 1098 (N,N\u2032-1,6-hexanediylbis(3,5-bis(1,1-dimethyl)-4-hydroxy-benzenepropanamide), Naugaard\u2122 445 (aryl amine), Irganox\u2122 L 57 (alkylated diphenylamine), Irganox\u2122 L 115 (sulfur containing bisphenol), IrganoxT LO 6 (alkylated phenyl-delta-napthylamine), Ethanox 398 (flourophosphonite), and 2,2\u2032-ethylidenebis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)fluorophosnite., 155058=[0146] The f-ratio of a thin film stack can be adjusted to aid in aligning the s and p-polarization bandedges of a reflectance band of the present invention. Assuming the following details for a PEN:PMMA quarterwave stack (n1x=1.75, n1z=1.50, n2x=1.50, n2z=1.50) at 1000 nm, for an f-ratio of 0.50 at normal incidence, with layer thicknesses of d1=142.86 nm and d2=166.67 nm, the bandedge positions can be calculated as a function of the angle of incidence. The hi and low bandedges are at 953 nm and 1052 nm at normal incidence. The p-pol bandedges shift more than the s-pol ones, particularly for the hi bandedge. The p-pol band narrows from 99 nm to 73 nm while the s-pol band widens to 124 nm. By evaluating this result at intermediate angles, the information in FIG. 10 can be generated., 395397=[0439] The optical films and devices of the present invention may also be provided with shatter resistant films and coatings. Films and coatings suitable for this purpose are described, for example, in publications EP 592284 and EP 591055, and are available commercially from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn., 239703=[0237] The choice of resin strongly effects the characteristic relaxation time. Average molecular weight, MW, is a particularly significant factor. For a given composition, the characteristic time tends to increase as a function of molecular weight (typically as the 3 to 3.5 power of molecular weight) for polymers whose molecular weight is well above the entanglement threshold. For unentangled polymers, the characteristic time tends to increase as a weaker function of molecular weight. Since polymers below this threshold tend to be brittle when below their glass transition temperatures and are usually undesirable, they are not the principal focus here; however, certain lower molecular materials may be used in combination with layers of higher molecular weight as could low molecular weight rubbery materials above the glass transition, e.g. an elastomeric or tacky layer. Inherent or intrinsic viscosity, IV, rather than average molecular weight, is usually measured in practice. The IV varies as MW\u03b1 where \u03b1 is the solvent dependent Mark-Houwink exponent. The exponent \u03b1 increases with solubility of the polymer. Typical example values of \u03b1 might be 0.62 for PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) and 0.68 for PET (polyethylene terephthalate), both measured in solutions of 60:40 Phenol:ortho-Dichlorobenzene, with intermediate values for a copolymer of the two (e.g., coPEN). PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) would be expected to have a still larger value of \u03b1 than PET, as would polyesters of longer alkane glycols (e.g. hexane diol) assuming improved solubility in the chosen solvent. For a given polymer, better solvents would have higher exponents than those quoted here. Thus, the characteristic time is expected to vary as a power law with IV, with its power exponent between 3/\u03b1 and 3.5/\u03b1. For example, a 20% increase in IV of a PEN resin is expected to increase the effective characteristic time, and thus the Weissenberg Number (as defined below) and the effective strength of the drawing flow, at a given process temperature and strain rate by a factor of approximately 2.4 to 2.8. Since a lower IV resin will experience a weaker flow, relatively lower IV resins are preferred in the present invention for the case of a second polymer of desired low final birefringence, and higher IV resins are preferable for the stronger flows required of the first polymer of high birefringence. The limits of practice are determined by brittleness on the low IV end and by the need to have adequate Theological compatibility during the coextrusion. In other embodiments, in which strong flows and high birefringence are desired in both a first and second material, higher IV may be desired for both materials. Other processing considerations such as upstream pressure drops as might be found in the melt stream filters can also become important., 471472=[0547] The film of the present invention can also be used in conjunction with conventional mirrors to control the intensity of any desired portion of the sunlight spectrum that reaches the plants. Generally, it is desirable to expose plants to a constant level of the wavelengths and intensity of light useful for plant growth throughout the entire day. On a typical sunny day, however, the light level peaks at about noon, and this light level may be excessive for many plants; the leaf temperature often rises, which decreases the plant efficiency. It is preferable to reduce the level of light reaching the plant during mid-day to provide a more uniform level throughout the day. For example, roses flower most efficiently when exposed to a maximum light level of 600 \u03bcmol/sec-m2, and this level is often achieved by 11:00 am during the winter months at a latitude of 45 degrees. Reducing the light level between 11:00 and 1:00 improves the plant yield. The combined usage of conventional mirrors with our wavelength selective mirrors, as illustrated in FIG. 39, can be used to change the intensity of light directed to plants during different hours of the day. For example, the use of the visible mirror in FIG. 39 can be discontinued during the hours of highest solar incidence by redirecting its angle of reflection to reject that portion of light from the sun. Other combinations of baffles and curtains can also be used with our wavelength selective films to control the intensity of light., 157775=[0149] The relative shift of the p-pol bandedges compared to the shift of the s-pol bandedges is substantially affected by the amount of birefringent materials in the stack as well as their absolute birefringence values. For example, increasing the f-ratio of a PEN/PMMA stack will increase the relative amount of material having an in-plane index of 1.75, and will promote a small blue shift in the s-pol reflection band . For an f-ratio of 0.75, and using n1x=1.75 and n1z=1.50, with n2x=1.50 and n2z=1.50, and layer thicknesses of d1=214.29 nm and d2=83.33 nm, the high and low bandedges are at 967 nm and 1037 nm at normal incidence. As shown in FIG. 12, this band is not as wide as the Q\ufffdQ stack one. There is also less shift with angle for the s-pol bandedges than for the p-pol edges. The p-pol band narrows from 70 nm to 52 nm while the s-pol band widens to 86 nm. While this stack design will not provide a non polarizing filter, it will promote a larger color shift with angle than the Q\ufffdQ (f=0.5) stack.}",
