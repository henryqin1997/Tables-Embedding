    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. When the extruder may be used for making both the dispersion and the foam, the cream time and gel time are relatively slow due to the size of the bunstock. The bunstock which is liquid at extrusion onto the conveyor, is firm after reaching the end of the conveyor and being released from the paper liners. The process described allows for large volume bunstock to be made, of very high quality. The extruder may alternatively be used to make the carbon black dispersion only, which is then fed to a tank for storage and later use. The foam was extruded from a die of an extruder, having a large cross-section, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, onto a conveyor lined with paper on the top, bottom and sides, to form bunstock having dimensions of about 27\" high\ufffd511/2\" wide. The cream time was 28 sec., the gel time was 2 min. 34 sec., the rise time was 3 min. 55 sec. and the tack free time was 4 min. 31 sec. The conveyor speed was about 9 to 10 ft./min. Bunstock may be extruded at a speed of about 200 lb./min. A typical bun may be about 27\"\ufffd511/2\"\ufffd10 ft. in size and may",
