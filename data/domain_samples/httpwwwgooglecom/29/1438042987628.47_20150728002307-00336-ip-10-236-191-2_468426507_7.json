To this end, the pulse sequences 300, to be described in detail with reference to FIG. 3, for generating navigator signals are arranged between a number of pulse sequences 200. The position determined from the navigator signal is used to adjust the pulse sequences 200 succeeding the navigator signal so as to generate echo signals in order to obtain imaging information concerning the moving part. FIG. 3 shows an example of a pulse sequence 300 for generating a 2D RF navigator signal 340. The navigator signal 340 is used to determine, for example a displacement in the z-direction. To his end, the navigator signal 340 is generated in a column of a moving heart and an adjoining part in the body 106. The pulse sequence 300 commences with an excitation pulse 301 which has a flip angle \u03b1. The selective excitation of the column is achieved by application of a first temporary magnetic gradient field 320 and a second temporary gradient field 330 having gradients which extends substantially perpendicularly to the direction of motion. A detailed description on the modulation of the RF-pulses and temporary magnetic gradient fields to generate the 2D RF navigator signal in the column pointed in the z-direction can be found in the article \"A k-space analysis of small tip angle excitation\", by J. Pauli et al., published in Journal of Magnetic Resonance 1989, No 81, pp 43-56. The third temporary gradient field 310 first dephases and then rephase the spins to provide an in-phase condition and thus an MR signal at the desired time \u03c41, after the excitation pulse 301. The frequency modulation is achieved by continuation of the third temporary magnetic gradient field 310 during the reception of the navigator signal 340, the gradient of the temporary magnetic gradient field 310 being oriented in the direction of motion, in his case being the z-direction. Subsequently, the navigator signal 340 received is sampled in, for example 256 points, after which a 1D Fourier transformation is performed on the sampled navigator signal. A 1D proton density profile of the region is derived from the result of the 1D Fourier transformation. A reference point can be determined from the 1D proton density profile, for example by execution of an edge detection algorithm. FIG. 4 shows a 1D proton density profile 400 and the action of the edge detection algorithm. The edge detection algorithm consists of, for example a low-pass filter which is followed by a high-pass filter. The low-pass filter, for example a 20-pixel wide average digital filter, removes the noise from the 1D proton density profile 400. The high-pass filter, for example a 5-pixel digital filter, subsequently determines the edges 402, 403 present from the transitions in the filtered proton density profile 401. The edge 402 is, for example a transition between the heart and the surrounding tissue. The measured position S1 of the edge 402 is subsequently used to adjust the pulse sequence 200., 48175=FIG. 1 shows a magnetic resonance imaging device which is known per se. The MRI device 100 comprises a first magnet system 101 for generating a steady magnetic field, a second magnet system 102 for generating temporary magnetic gradient fields in three orthogonal directions, and power supply units 103 for the second magnet system 102. The power supply for the first magnet system 101 is not shown. The system comprises an examination space which is large enough to accommodate a patient to be examined or a part of the patient to be examined. As is customary, in this Figure and in this description the z-direction of the coordinate system shown indicates the direction of the steady magnetic field. An RF transmitter coil 104 serves to generate RF fields and is connected to an RF source and modulator 105. The RF coil 104 is arranged within the examination space around or against or near a part of the patient. A receiver coil 107 is used to receive a magnetic resonance signal. This may be the same coil as the RF transmitter coil 104. The RF transceiver coil 104 is connected, via a transceiver circuit 108, to a signal amplification and demodulation unit 109. A phase and amplitude are derived from the MR signals received in the signal amplification and demodulation unit 109. Subsequently, the phase and amplitude obtained from this circuit are applied to a reconstruction unit 110. The reconstruction unit 110 processes the signals received so as to form an image. This image is made visible via an image processing unit 111, for example on a monitor 112. The magnetic resonance imaging device 100 also comprises a control unit 113. This unit controls the modulator 105 for the RF transmitter, the power supply units 103 for the temporary magnetic gradient fields, and the reconstruction unit 110. A detailed description of magnetic resonance images and magnetic resonance imaging devices can be found in the book \"Practical NMR Imaging, by M. A. Poster and J. M. S. Hutchison, 1987, IRL Press., 36651=Another method of reducing artifacts in MR images of a moving part is the so-called \"Respiratory Ordered Phase Encoding\" method. This ROPE method is known from the article \"Respiratory Ordered Phase Encoding (ROPE)\", by D. R. Bailes et al., published in Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 1985, No. 9, pp. 835-838. According to the ROPE method, during the generating of MR signals in a so-called Single Echo Multiple Shot (SEMS) method the phase encoding gradient is selected in the direction of a cyclic motion in the moving part. In order to counteract motion artifacts due to the cyclic motion, the phase to be used for the phase encoding for the echo signal to be generated is estimated from the cyclic motion of the moving part. It is a drawback of this method that the extrapolation can result in an incorrect position in the case of irregular respiration, so that the estimated position deviates from the actual position, motion artifacts occur as yet in the MR image, and the phase encoding direction must be chosen to extend in the direction of motion, this implies a restriction in respect of the imaging of slices which do not extend parallel to the direction of motion. Further ROPE does not compensate for blurring due to trough-plane motion of small objects.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations If desired, on the basis of the positions of parts of, for example the heart which have been determined by means of the navigator signals, other motion corrections can also be executed, for example a continuous rotation matrix adaptation or a continuous gradient intensity adaptation. The rotation matrix adaptation is applied to correct for a small heart rotation which also occurs during respiration. The gradient intensity adaptation is used to correct for the compression of the heart due to the respiration. When the linear volume compression is a factor f of the original volume, for example the slice thickness of the image is adapted by multiplying the intensity of the selection gradient by the factor 1/f. FIG. 8 shows an example of a graph 800 in which the motion of the heart is plotted as a function of time. The motion period is, for example Mt1 seconds. The acquisition amounts to, for example Mt2 seconds, it being assumed that the heart moves substantially uniformly during the acquisition period Mt2. Furthermore, in order to determine the position of the heart use can be made of the navigator signal 640. Furthermore, in order to reduce motion artifacts it is also possible to use respiration synchronization. Respiration synchronization is applied to counteract the motion artifacts caused by an irregular cardiac displacement which itself is caused by respiration. According to the respiration synchronization method, for example a part of the",
