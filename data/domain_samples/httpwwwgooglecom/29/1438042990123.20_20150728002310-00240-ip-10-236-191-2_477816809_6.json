    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The drawing necessarily shows a specific structural arrangement embodying my invention. It will be appreciated however that some changes and modifications can be made while still practicing the invention. The illustrated lid-straw assembly is somewhat similar to a lid-straw mechanism shown in aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,860. However, the mechanism there shown lacks the corrugated straw sections 43 and 47 used herein. Also, in the arrangement of U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,860 the lid fits onto an associated cup so that the lid plane is essentially coincident with the upper edge of the cup. The structure shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,860 therefore lacks the spacer feature provided by my annular wall 35. During the process of drawing liquid out of can 10 through straw 39 the liquid level will gradually be lowered until the liquid is concentrated in the annular corner space 53 at the junction between bottom wall 13 and annular side wall 11. The deflectable nature of the straw causes the lower open end of the straw to be in a position for extracting most of the liquid. The length of the elongated straw section 49 is slightly greater than the spacing between the can top wall 15 and the can bottom wall 13. Therefore, when lid 31 is placed on the beverage can, wall 13 deflects cylindrical section 49 of the straw laterally so that its lower open end 51 is located near",
