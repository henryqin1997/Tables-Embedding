However, it is to be understood that the invention can be carried out by specifically different equipment and devices, and that various modifications, both as to the equipment and operating procedures, can be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself As explained, auxiliary components, such as batteries and high voltage capacitors are adapted to be connected directly to the folded assembly, further reducing the interconnect complexity of the device and simplifying the manufacture of the device in question. The flat manufacturing configuration also permits ease of testing due to reduced fixture density and complexity. Once folded, however, the structure becomes very compact and can be readily fitted within the outer housing of the implantable device. By beveling one corner of each of the panels 12, 14, 16 and 18 (as best seen in FIG. 1), when the configuration is in its fully folded condition as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the resulting folded package is made to better conform to the profile of the housing in which the folded package is fitted. The use of auxiliary panels as low profile integrated shields permits noisy and sensitive circuits",
