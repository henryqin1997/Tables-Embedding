    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As this invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit of essential characteristics thereof, the present embodiments are therefore illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds thereof are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims. In the above embodiments, the orthogonal transform such as a DCT is used in performing high-efficiency encoding on the video and audio signals. However, a sub-band division method making use of a sub-band filter may be used, if the method is used, the same advantages can be obtained. As described, in the fourth embodiment, since the high frequency components of the high-frequency encoded video and audio signals are recorded at the ends of the recording tracks on the magnetic tape, the video and audio signal can be recorded simultaneously while preventing appreciable errors from appearing in the reproduced image or sound and thus minimizing degradation in the picture and sound quality. In the above fourth embodiment, both the video and audio signals are high-efficiency encoded in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment, but it will be appreciated that for applications where high-efficiency encoding is performed on either one of the video or audio signal, the same effects as",
