It will be understood that various modifications may be made that still fall within the following claims. For example, advantageous results still could be achieved if steps of the disclosed techniques were performed in a different order and/or if components in the disclosed systems were combined in a different manner and/or replaced or supplemented by other components. The techniques and concepts are applicable to home network devices other than a home-networking gateway. For example, a router, a digital hub, a general-purpose computer, or a single-purpose configuration management device may perform the functions described as being performed by the home-networking gateway. Although the techniques and concepts have been described in which a user account is authenticated and associated with information for a home-networking gateway or other communication device, the user account does not necessarily need to be a subscriber account. The techniques and concepts described with respect to a user account are applicable to a user identity or an operator operating a device or a home-networking gateway. Although the techniques and concepts have been described in which a host system stores configuration information and performs a proxy configuration service for a wireless device, a wireless access point, or a home-networking gateway, a trusted system that may not necessarily be in a host-client relationship with the",
