It is presumed for the purposes of the disclosed embodiment that the mobile station used by the wireless caller is PCS1900 compatible.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30611=The FCC has rolled out E911 in two phases. In 1998, Phase I required that mobile phone carriers identify the originating call's phone number and the location of the signal tower, or cell, accurate to within a mile. Phase I of the FCC's E911 rules requires that a 7, 8 or 10 digit number accompany each 911 call, which allows the PSAP dispatcher to either call back if the call is disconnected or to obtain additional information such as the mobile's callback number. It also gives the dispatcher the location at the cell site that received the call as a rough indication of the caller's location., 31807=Advances in technologies that employ new or upgraded handsets have demonstrated significant progress. However, as a practical matter, current FCC rules permit only network-based (i.e., independent of handset type) solutions to meet the Phase II requirements in the short term. As a result, the current rule effectively precludes use of a handset-based (i.e., GPS-assisted or other interaction dependent on the handset) approach, which needs to gradually replace or upgrade current handsets. Thus, in September 1999, the FCC revised its rules to permit the phase-in of new or upgraded handsets in order for handset-based solutions to be a viable competitor for initial ALI deployment under Phase II, while making other revisions aimed at promoting wireless E911 and improving public safety., 29356=E911 is short for Enhanced 911, a location technology advanced by the FCC that will enable mobile, or cellular, phones to process 911 emergency calls and enable emergency services to locate the geographic position of the caller. When a person makes a 911 call using a traditional phone with ground wires, the call is routed to the nearest public safety answering point (PSAP) that then distributes the emergency call to the proper services. The PSAP receives the caller's phone number and the exact location of the phone from which the call was made. Prior to 1996, 911 callers using a mobile phone would have to access their service providers in order to get verification of subscription service before the call was routed to a PSAP. In 1996 the FCC ruled that a 911 call must go directly to the PSAP without receiving verification of service from a specific cellular service provider. The call must be handled by any available service carrier even if it is not the cellular phone customer's specific carrier. Under the FCC's rules, all mobile phones manufactured for sale in the United States after Feb. 13, 2000, that are capable of operating in an analog mode must include this special method for processing 911 calls., 57979=FCC Order number 98-xxxx requires \u201cPhase II\u201d E911 wireless service to also provide the caller's location within 125 meters 95% of the time. Common channel signaling standards have added a new CGL parameter and the T1-628-2000 standard was revised to define the mapping of an E911 caller's latitude and longitude into the ISUP CGL parameter. This parameter is transferred into the ISDN GenericInformation (GI) parameter for the PSAP's display equipment to convert to a street address. As of early 2002, the CGL parameter is not able to select the PSAP at the local exchange carrier's selective router, and commercial PSAP equipment is typically not modified to convert an ISDN GI parameter to a street address. In other words, CAS Phase II may not be an E911 option for many years into the future for many PSAPs due to the less than optimal networks and equipment used by the PSAPs., 34666=A new ISUP CallingGeodeticLocation (CGL) parameter was defined in April 2000 to help a selective router select the appropriate PSAP based on the caller's precise location, not based only on the location of the serving cell tower, but this technology requires a software upgrade (e.g., to the ISDN User Part (ISUP) software) at many switches, thus deterring any emergence of this type solution. In fact, this particular technology may never appear since non-GSM wireless switches already utilize an existing protocol (J-STD-036) to determine PSAP selection prior to routing out of the wireless switch and it is only GSM wireless switches that would be served by this type of solution., 31240=In 2001, Phase II required that each mobile phone company doing business in the United States must offer handset- or network-based location detection capability so that the caller's location is determined by the geographic location of the cellular phone within 100 meter accuracy\u2014not merely to the location of the tower that is transmitting its signal. The FCC refers to this as Automatic Location Identification (ALI). Phase II of the FCC's wireless 911 rules allows the dispatcher to know more precisely where the caller is located., 27110=The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/187,934, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,340,241, entitled \u201cPublic Safety Access Point (PSAP) Selection for E911 Wireless Callers in a GSM Type System,\u201d filed on Jul. 25, 2005, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/314,278, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,922,565, entitled \u201cPublic Safety Access Point (PSAP) Selection for E911 Wireless Callers in a GSM Type System,\u201d filed on Dec. 9, 2002, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/367,706, entitled \u201cHybrid GSM/SUP,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2002, the entireties of all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 46382=In accordance with the principles of the present invention, GSM Phase I wireless E911 loop-around technology is combined with the Phase II J-STD-036 standard for PCS1900, aka North American GSM. Moreover, and importantly, the PSAP selection and the Phase I loop-around routing out of the GSM switch are delayed to see if a Phase II precise location becomes available for routing based on the E911 caller's location (i.e., position). To avoid dead time in an emergency E911 call, a configurable timer may be implemented. The timer is started during the call's routing. Then, if the configurable timer expires before any location for the E911 caller is obtained, routing based on cell sector (i.e., reverting back to Phase I requirements) can proceed by default.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described with reference to the exemplary embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiments of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. While the present invention describes routing based on location with respect to E911 applications, the present invention is equally applicable to non-E911 applications. With the present invention, GSM wireless switches in North America can achieve parity with ANSI wireless switches where J-STD-036 has provided a protocol to accomplish \u201crouting based on position\u201d that does not rely on selective router technology. Furthermore, call setup routing to the local exchange carrier's selective router is notoriously complex and not standard. By offloading the ESRK selection and hence the call setup routing that is ultimately required, the GSM wireless switch need only \u201ctandem\u201d an E911 call, rather than have to be configured to the myriad of parameter combinations that are currently in use. ISUP loop-around technology appears as a \u201ctandem\u201d call, and thus everything is pre-configured so that the GSM wireless switch merely passes thru what it receives from the outside node. Two main benefits to the present invention are 1) the ability for GSM to offload the management of ESRK assignments; and 2) the ability to use precise location information for wireless E911 calls to influence ESRK or ESRD or ESRV",
