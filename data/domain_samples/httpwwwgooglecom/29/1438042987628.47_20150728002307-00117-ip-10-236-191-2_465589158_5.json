Claffy Assistant Examiner-Alan Faber Attorney, Agent, or FirmE. J. Olinder; J. J. Torrente [57] ABSTRACT In a telephone station system the telephone apparatus is divided into two portions, a centralized network and one or more extensions or sets. The network is connected between the telephone sets and the line and may include, for example, a hybrid, amplifiers, auto- BC matic gain control circuitry and lightning protectors all of which are shared by the satellite sets. The sets [56] References Cit d preferably include only the minimum required compo- UMTED STATES PATENTS nents such as a transmitter, a receiver, associated am- 2,721,897 10/1955 Schneckloth 179/2.s R phfiers a tone finger Sounder and dmer and a 2,812,388 11/1957 Thomas 179/170 D 10 Claims, 13 Drawing Figures D.C.

Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said centralized network includes a ringing detector circuit and translating means for driving each of said ringing means in said sets. 9. Apparatus in accordance with claim 6 wherein said a.c. network portion of said centralized network includes a voice switching circuit. 8. Apparatus in accordance with claim 6 wherein said a.c. network portion of said centralized network includes an equalization circuit. 7. Apparatus in accordance with claim 6 including means for converting the outputs of said amplifiers from voltage sources to current sources. 6. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said repeater employs first and second operational amplifiers. 5. Apparatus in accordance with claim I wherein said centralized network includes a power supply circuit powered from said line, said power supply circuit comprising first and second voltage regulator circuits connected across first and second current source circuits, respectively. 4. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said centralized network is located at said telephone station at a position relatively remote from each of said sets. 3. Apparatus in accordance with claim 2 wherein said network includes electronic switchhook means responsively operative to any individual one of said sets going off-hook, thereby to effect a communication path from said line through said centralized network to any offhook ones of said sets.",
