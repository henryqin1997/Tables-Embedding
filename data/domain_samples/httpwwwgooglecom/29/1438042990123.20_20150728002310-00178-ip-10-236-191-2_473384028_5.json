    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by 77. Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, various alternatives, modifications and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the foregoing description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the inventions which are defined by the appended claims. 76. One advantage of this invention is that the shorter light path allows for a more compact, lighter weight retinal display device. Another advantage is that a viewer has less difficulty aligning and maintaining alignment with an exit pupil formed at the eyepiece. In particular, the expanded exit pupil, the multiple exit pupils or the multiple, expanded exit pupils make it easier for a viewer to find an exit pupil. Another advantage with regard to the diffractive optical element embodiment is that image brightness is generally uniform among various groups of exit pupils which form at the viewer's eye. Meritorious and Advantageous Effects 75. For a display device providing stereoscopic viewing two retinal display devices 10 are used. If combining two monocular systems to define binocular viewing, however, there is a potential conflict between distance cues and focus. 74. The components of the retinal display 10 can be made small, compact and lightweight so as to embody a hand-held display or to be mounted on a viewer's head without requiring a helmet or an elaborate head mounting support.
