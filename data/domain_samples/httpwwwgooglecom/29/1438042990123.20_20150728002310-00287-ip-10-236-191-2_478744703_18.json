No. 60/481,053, filed Jul. 2, 2003; and (c) Ser. No. 60/481,405, filed Sep. 22, 2003., 315140=In a preferred form of this method, the pixels are divided into two groups, hereinafter designated \u201ceven\u201d and \u201codd\u201d. The two groups of pixels may be arranged in a checkerboard pattern (so that the pixels in each row and column alternate between the two groups) or in other arrangements as described above and in the aforementioned 2003/0137521, Paragraphs [0181] to [0183] and [0199] to [0202], provided that each pixel has at least one neighbor of the opposite group, and different drive schemes are used for the two groups. If the stored data indicates that one of the available impulses will produce substantially the desired gray level transition, this impulse is applied for that transition for both the even and odd pixels. However, if the stored data indicates that the impulse required for a particular gray level transition is substantially half-way between two of the available impulses, one of these impulses is used for the transition in even pixels and the other of these impulses is used for the transition in odd pixels. Thus, if two adjacent pixels are intended to be in the same gray state (the condition where precise control of gray scale is of maximum importance) one of these pixels will have a gray level slightly above the desired level, while the other will have a gray level slightly below the desired level. Ocular and optical averaging will result in an average of the two gray levels being seen, thus producing an apparent gray level closer to the desired level than can be achieved with the available impulses. In effect, this balanced gray level method uses small-signal spatial dithering (applied to correct errors in applied impulse) superimposed on large signal true gray scale to increase by a factor of two the available impulse levels. Since each pixel is still at approximately the correct gray scale level, the effective resolution of the display is not compromised., 59487=Many of the aforementioned patents and applications recognize that the walls surrounding the discrete microcapsules in an encapsulated electrophoretic medium could be replaced by a continuous phase, thus producing a so-called \u201cpolymer-dispersed electrophoretic display\u201d in which the electrophoretic medium comprises a plurality of discrete droplets of an electrophoretic fluid and a continuous phase of a polymeric material, and that the discrete droplets of electrophoretic fluid within such a polymer-dispersed electrophoretic display may be regarded as capsules or microcapsules even though no discrete capsule membrane is associated with each individual droplet; see for example, the aforementioned 2002/0131147. Accordingly, for purposes of the present application, such polymer-dispersed electrophoretic media are regarded as sub-species of encapsulated electrophoretic media., 263568=It will immediately be apparent that, since each of the 800 array entries may have any one of the three possible voltage values, there are a huge number of possible arrays (waveforms), the number being far too large to search exhaustively. In theory, there are 3800 or about 5\ufffd10381 possible arrays; since there are about 1078 atoms in the universe and 109 seconds in an average human lifetime, practical capabilities are at least 200 orders of magnitude short of an exhaustive search. Fortunately, existing knowledge about the behavior of electro-optic displays, and especially the need for DC balance therein, impose additional constraints upon the possible waveforms and enable the search for an optimum or near optimum waveform to be confined within practicable limits., 52915=The terms \u201cbistable\u201d and \u201cbistability\u201d are used herein in their conventional meaning in the imaging art to refer to displays comprising display elements having first and second display states differing in at least one optical property, and such that after any given element has been driven, by means of an addressing pulse of finite duration, to assume either its first or second display state, after the addressing pulse has terminated, that state will persist for at least several times, for example at least four times, the minimum duration of the addressing pulse required to change the state of the display element. It is shown in published U.S. patent application No. 2002/0180687 that some particle-based electrophoretic displays capable of gray scale are stable not only in their extreme black and white states but also in their intermediate gray states, and the same is true of some other types of electro-optic displays. This type of display is properly called \u201cmulti-stable\u201d rather than bistable, although for convenience the term \u201cbistable\u201d may be used herein to cover both bistable and multi-stable displays., 249908=The pixel is now driven to gray level 6. Since this is a light gray level, it must, by rule (a) be reached by a black-going pulse. Accordingly, application of rules (a) and (c) requires that this level 3/level 6 transition be effected by a two-pulse sequence, namely a first white-going pulse 1106, which drives the pixel white (level 7), followed by a second black-going pulse 1108, which drives the pixel from level 7 to the desired level 6., 320097=The various methods of the present invention may make use of various additional variations and techniques described in the aforementioned applications, especially the aforementioned 2003/0137521 and application Ser. No. 10/814,205, which variations and techniques are described in the \u201cAdditional Background Information\u201d section below. It will be appreciated that in the overall waveform used to drive an electro-optic display, in at least some cases certain transitions may be effected in accordance with the various methods of the present invention, while other transitions may not make use of the methods of the present invention but may make use of other types of transitions described below., 275629=The impulse hysteresis phenomenon and the prior state dependence of electro-optic media, as discussed above and in the aforementioned patents and applications, require that the waveform for each transition vary depending upon the prior state history of the pixel being considered. As described in the aforementioned 2003/0137521, the optimum waveform for each transition may be determined (i.e., the transition table corresponding to the aforementioned data array may be \u201ctuned\u201d) by using an initial \u201cguessed\u201d transition matrix to create a waveform, which is used to address the electro-optic medium through a fixed, typically pseudo-random or prior-state-complete series of optical states. A program subtracts the actual optical state achieved in each prior state combination from the target gray states for the same combination to compute an error matrix, which is the same dimensions as the transition matrix. Each element in the error matrix corresponds to an element in the transition matrix. If an element in the transition matrix is too high, the corresponding element in the error matrix will be pushed higher. PID (proportional-integral-differential) control can then be used to drive the error matrix toward zero. There are cross-terms (each element in the transition matrix affects more than one element in the error matrix) but these effects are minor and tend to decrease as the magnitudes of the values in the error matrix decrease, as the tuning proceeds through multiple iterations. (Note that sometimes the I or D constants of the PID controller may be set to 0, yielding PI, PD, or P control.), 250452=The pixel is next driven to gray level 4. Since this is a light gray level, by an argument exactly similar to that employed for the level 1/level 3 transition discussed earlier, the level 6/level 4 transition is effected by a single black-going pulse 1110. The next transition is to level 3. Since this is a dark gray level, by an argument exactly similar to that employed for the level 3/level 6 transition discussed earlier, the level 4/level 3 transition is handled by a two-pulse sequence, namely a first black-going pulse 1112, which drives the pixel black (level 0), followed by a second white-going pulse 1114, which drives the pixels from level 0 to the desired level 3., 50459=This application is also related to application Ser. No. 10/249,973, filed May 23, 2003, which is a continuation-in-part of the aforementioned application Ser. No. 10/065,795. application Ser. No. 10/249,973 claims priority from Provisional Applications Ser. No. 60/319,315, filed Jun. 13, 2002 and Ser. No. 60/319,321, filed Jun. 18, 2002. This application is also related to copending application Ser. No. 10/063,236, filed Apr. 2, 2002 (Publication No. 2002/0180687)., 467279=The aforementioned drive schemes may be varied in numerous ways depending upon the characteristics of the specific electro-optic display used. For example, in some cases it may be possible to eliminate many of the reset steps in the drives schemes described above. For example, if the electro-optic medium used is bistable for long periods (i.e., the gray levels of written pixels change only very slowly with time) and the impulse needed for a specific transition does not vary greatly with the period for which the pixel has been in its initial gray state, a look-up table may be arranged to effect gray state to gray state transitions directly without any intervening return to a black or white state, resetting of the display being effected only when, after a substantial period has elapsed, the gradual \u201cdrift\u201d of pixels from their nominal gray levels has caused noticeable errors in the image presented. Thus, for example, if a user was using a display of the present invention as an electronic book reader, it might be possible to display numerous screens of information before resetting of the display were necessary; empirically, it has been found that with appropriate waveforms and drivers, as many as 1000 screens of information can be displayed before resetting is necessary, so that in practice resetting would not be necessary during a typical reading session of an electronic book reader., 57347=Numerous patents and applications assigned to or in the names of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and E Ink Corporation have recently been published describing encapsulated electrophoretic media. Such encapsulated media comprise numerous small capsules, each of which itself comprises an internal phase containing electrophoretically-mobile particles suspended in a liquid suspending medium, and a capsule wall surrounding the internal phase. Typically, the capsules are themselves held within a polymeric binder to form a coherent layer positioned between two electrodes. Encapsulated media of this type are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,930,026; 5,961,804; 6,017,584; 6,067,185; 6,118,426; 6,120,588; 6,120,839; 6,124,851; 6,130,773; 6,130,774; 6,172,798; 6,177,921; 6,232,950; 6,249,721; 6,252,564; 6,262,706; 6,262,833; 6,300,932; 6,312,304; 6,312,971; 6,323,989; 6,327,072; 6,376,828; 6,377,387; 6,392,785; 6,392,786; 6,413,790; 6,422,687; 6,445,374; 6,445,489; 6,459,418; 6,473,072; 6,480,182; 6,498,114; 6,504,524; 6,506,438; 6,512,354; 6,515,649; 6,518,949; 6,521,489; 6,531,997; 6,535,197; 6,538,801; 6,545,291; 6,580,545; 6,639,578; 6,652,075; 6,657,772; 6,664,944; 6,680,725; 6,683,333; 6,704,133; 6,710,540; 6,721,083; 6,724,519; and 6,727,881; and U.S. Patent Applications Publication Nos. 2002/0019081; 2002/0021270; 2002/0053900; 2002/0060321; 2002/0063661; 2002/0063677; 2002/0090980; 2002/0106847; 2002/0113770; 2002/0130832; 2002/0131147; 2002/0145792; 2002/0171910; 2002/0180687; 2002/0180688; 2002/0185378; 2003/0011560; 2003/0011868; 2003/0020844; 2003/0025855; 2003/0034949; 2003/0038755; 2003/0053189; 2003/0102858; 2003/0132908; 2003/0137521; 2003/0137717; 2003/0151702; 2003/0189749; 2003/0214695; 2003/0214697; 2003/0222315; 2004/0008398; 2004/0012839; 2004/0014265; 2004/0027327; 2004/0075634; and 2004/0094422; and International Applications Publication Nos.

In contrast, the prior temporal/gray level state method uses a look-up table indexed by at least R1 (=S1), R2 (=S2), R3 and S3. Optionally, the prior temporal/gray level state method may use a look-up table indexed by any one or more successive ones of R4, R5 etc., and any one or more successive ones of S4, S5 etc. It is not necessary that the prior temporal/gray level state method take account of an equal number of temporal and gray level prior states, nor is it necessary that the prior temporal/gray level state method take account of successive temporal prior states extending over the same time interval as the gray level prior states of which the method takes account. Indeed, since the variations in impulse due to changes in temporal prior states tend to be smaller than those due to changes in gray level prior states, it may, for example, in some cases be advantageous for the prior temporal/gray level state method to take account of (say) the first and second gray level prior states (R3 and R4 respectively) and only the first temporal prior state (S3), even though clearly the second gray level prior state R4 occurs at a time prior to the first temporal prior state S3., 49458=This application is also a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser. No. 10/814,205, filed Mar. 31, 2004, which itself claims benefit of the following Provisional Applications: (d) Ser. No. 60/320,070, filed Mar. 31, 2003; (e) Ser.

No. 60/557,094, filed Mar. 26, 2004., 288376=A preferred method for constructing a rail-stabilized waveform, using a transition table as described in the aforementioned 2003/0137521 is as follows:, 55799=Another type of electro-optic display uses an electrochromic medium, for example an electrochromic medium in the form of a nanochromic film comprising an electrode formed at least in part from a semi-conducting metal oxide and a plurality of dye molecules capable of reversible color change attached to the electrode; see, for example O'Regan, B., et al., Nature 1991, 353, 737; and Wood, D., Information Display, 18(3), 24 (March 2002). See also Bach, U., et al., Adv. Mater., 2002, 14(11), 845. Nanochromic films of this type are also described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,038, International Application Publication No. WO 01/27690, and in U.S. patent application 2003/0214695. This type of medium is also typically bistable., 70146=This accumulation of errors phenomenon applies not only to errors due to temperature, but also to errors of all the types listed above. As described in the aforementioned 2003/0137521, compensating for such errors is possible, but only to a limited degree of precision. For example, temperature errors can be compensated by using a temperature sensor and a lookup table, but the temperature sensor has a limited resolution and may read a temperature slightly different from that of the electro-optic medium. Similarly, prior state dependence can be compensated by storing the prior states and using a multi-dimensional transition matrix, but controller memory limits the number of states that can be recorded and the size of the transition matrix that can be stored, placing a limit on the precision of this type of compensation., 61498=A related type of electrophoretic display is a so-called \u201cmicrocell electrophoretic display\u201d. In a microcell electrophoretic display, the charged particles and the suspending fluid are not encapsulated within capsules but instead are retained within a plurality of cavities formed within a carrier medium, typically a polymeric film. See, for example, International Application Publication No. WO 02/01281, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0075556, both assigned to Sipix Imaging, Inc., 311778=Also as discussed in the aforementioned 2003/0137521 and above, many bistable electro-optic media are desirably driven with drive schemes which achieve long term direct current (DC) balance, and such DC balance is conveniently effected using a drive scheme in which a DC balance section, which does not substantially change the gray level of the pixel, is applied before the main drive section, which does change the gray level, the two sections being chosen so that the algebraic sum of the impulses applied is zero or at least very small. If the main drive section is modified in accordance with the interrupted scanning method, it is highly desirable that the DC balance section be modified to prevent the additional impulses caused by the insertion of the pause periods accumulating to cause substantial DC imbalance. However, it is not necessary that the DC balance section be modified in a manner which is an exact mirror image of the modification of the main drive section, since the DC balance section can have gaps (zero voltage frames) and most electro-optic medium are not harmed by short term DC imbalances. Thus, in the drive scheme discussed above using a single 10 ms pause period inserted among ten 20 ms frames, DC balance can be achieved by making the first frame of the drive scheme 30 ms in duration. Applying or not applying a driving voltage to a pixel during this frame brings the overall impulse to a multiple of 20 units, so that this impulse can readily be balanced later. In the drive scheme using three 5 ms pause periods, the first two frames of the drive scheme can similarly be 25 and 30 ms in duration (in either order), again bringing the overall impulse to a multiple of 20 units., 504484=In such a remnant voltage method, measurement of a remnant voltage is desirably effected by a high impedance voltage measurement device, for example a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) comparator. When the display is one having small pixels, for example a 100 dots per inch (DPI) matrix display, in which each pixel has an area of 10\u22124 square inch or about 6\ufffd10\u22122 mm2, the comparator needs to have an ultra-low input current, as the resistance of such a single pixel is of the order of 1012 ohm. However, suitable comparators are readily available commercially; for example, the Texas Instruments INA111 chip is suitable, as it has an input current on only about 20 pA. (Technically, this integrated circuit is an instrumentation amplifier, but if its output is routed into a Schmitt trigger, it acts as a comparator.) For displays having large single pixels, such as large direct-drive displays (defined below) used in signage, where the individual pixels may have areas of several square centimeters, the requirements for the comparator are much less stringent, and almost any commercial FET input comparator may be used, for example the LF311 comparator from National Semiconductor Corporation., 285178=As noted in Paragraphs [0073] to [0077] of the aforementioned 2003/0137521 and above, transitions in electro-optic media are typically temperature sensitive, and it has been found that the uncompensated stability of gray levels versus temperature is increased when all of the transitions to a particular gray level always come from the same optical rail. The reason for this is straightforward; as the temperature varies, the switching speed of the electro-optic medium becomes gets faster or slower. Suppose that, in a 2 bit gray level display, the dark gray to light gray transition bounces off the black rail, but the white to light gray transition bounces off the white rail. If the switching speed of the medium becomes slower, the light gray state addressed from black will become darker, but the light gray state addressed from black will become lighter. Thus, it is important for a temperature stable waveform that a given gray level always be approached from the same \u201cside\u201d, i.e., that the final pulse of the waveform always be of the same polarity. In the preferred drive scheme described above using the \u2212TM(R1,R2) IP(R1)\u2212IP(R2) TM(R1,R2), 264419=As discussed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,504,524 and 6,531,997 and the aforementioned 2003/0137521, it is known that most, if not all, electro-optic media require direct current (DC) balanced waveforms, or deleterious effects may occur. Such effects may include damage to electrodes and long term drift (over a period of hours) of gray states over a range of several L* units when DC imbalanced waveforms are used. Accordingly, it seems prudent to make every effort to use DC balanced drive wave schemes., 344892=This Example illustrates the use of FT sequences in improving the optical performance of a waveform designed at achieve 4 gray level (2-bit) addressing of a single pixel display. This display used an encapsulated electrophoretic medium and was constructed substantially as described in Paragraphs [0069] to [0076] of the aforementioned 2002/0180687. The single-pixel display was monitored by a photodiode., 49920=The aforementioned copending application Ser. No. 10/814,205 is also a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser.

No. 60/319,040, filed Dec. 21, 2001., 156308=Although typically frames with positive and negative polarity will be interleaved 1:1 (i.e., will alternate with each other), but this is not necessary; for example, all the odd frames could be grouped together, followed by all the even frames. This would result in alternate columns of the display being driven in two separate groups.}",

Accordingly, the foregoing description is to be construed in an illustrative and not in a limitative sense. As already indicated, a preferred type of electro-optic medium for use in present invention is an encapsulated particle-based electrophoretic medium. Such electrophoretic media used in the methods of the present invention may employ the same components and manufacturing techniques as in the aforementioned E Ink and MIT patents and applications, to which the reader is referred for further information. From the foregoing description, it will be seen that the remnant voltage method provides a method for driving electrophoretic and other electro-optic displays which reduces the cost of the equipment needed to ensure DC balancing of the pixels of the display, while providing increasing display lifetime, operating window and long-term display optical performance. Although the remnant voltage method has primarily been described in its application to encapsulated electrophoretic displays, this method may be also be used with unencapsulated electrophoretic displays, and with other types of display, for example electrochromic displays, which display a remnant voltage.
