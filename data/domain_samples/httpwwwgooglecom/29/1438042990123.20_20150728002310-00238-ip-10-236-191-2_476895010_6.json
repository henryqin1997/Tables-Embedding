No. 08/261,515, filed Jun. 17, 1994, still pending, entitled \"Self-Timed Interface,\" and assigned to the assignee of this application, byte synchronization starts by coupling the phase aligned data (now 2 bits wide) into a shift register 33 whose outputs are coupled to multiplexer 35. The control inputs to the multiplexer will be used to deskew the particular data line from the other data lines by whole bit times. The deserializer data output for a particular data line is monitored for the expected timing pattern (X 0 1 0 where X is a don't care) to determine the proper order of the received data. If at any time a zero is detected in the bit 3 position the multiplexer is incremented thus moving the byte boundary by one bit time. This process is repeated until the proper byte boundary is located. The multiplexer control wraps around from a binary 3 to a binary 0 in case the correct position was incorrectly passed through the previous time. This function allows synchronization of data lines skewed by more than an entire bit time., 15135=Application Ser. No. 08/262,087, filed Jun. 17, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,095, entitled \"Digital Phase Locked Loop with Improved Edge Detector,\" and assigned to the assignee of this application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in terms of a single preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. STI enables each I/O sub-element to operate asynchronously to the host clock, thereby avoiding the clock control complexity associated with the previously described variable clock multiplier logic. This permits the I/O sub-elements to be used by a wider range of hosts/host cycle times. Because of the high performance of STI, fewer are needed, thus the re-synchronizing buffers/logic at each end is not burdensome. A single STI is capable of supporting 32 channel functions. For those system configurations requiring only up to 32 channels therefore, only one STI port, cable and I/O sub-element need be used. This enables incremental cost advantages over current centralized I/O elements in which even the smallest channel configuration can incur the cost of hardware in place for the maximum (e.g., 256) channel configuration. Referring now to FIG. 5, a host processor 60 in this exemplary embodiment needs only eight STI ports 62 to support up to 256 input-output channels 64, which are in turn coupled to input-output controllers 65. STI links 66 couple the ports 62 to input-output sub-elements 68 labeled IOSE. The sub-elements 68, which may be integral with or physically located away from the host 60, each can support up to 32 channel",
