    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Because data from an L2 victim is cast-out by writing it to the system bus, the L3 cache is always coherent with system memory and never contains data which is modified with respect to system memory. Other devices in a multiprocessor system get updated earlier by snooping the cast-out from the system bus. When the H-MESI cache coherency protocol is utilized, horizontal devices go from the hovering state to the shared state more quickly. Although incurring the longer latency of a system bus operation, data evicted from an L2 cache is written to the system bus and snooped back into the L3 cache. This eliminates the necessity for a private or \u201cbackdoor\u201d data bus between the L2 and L3 caches. Only a single data path from the L2 cache, that connected to the system bus, is required, and the L3 cache need not be dual-ported. The reload path employed for updating the L3 cache is reused to snoop cast-outs from the L2 cache off the system bus. ECC checking at the L3 directory and cache, and the associated overhead, is also unnecessary. Data integrity may be verified by simple parity",
