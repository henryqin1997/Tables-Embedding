Any references made in this patent application to MPEG video data is to be understood to refer to video data that complies with MPEG-2 standards as defined in the November 1993 ISO-MPEG Committee drafts., 103413=MP@ML allows for pictures as large as 720\ufffd576 pels for a total of 414,720 pels per picture while US ATV allows for pictures as large as 1920\ufffd1080 pels per picture. Sequences received in the 1920\ufffd1080 pel picture format can be downsampled by a factor of 3 horizontally and a factor of 2 vertically to yield a maximum resolution of 640\ufffd540 pels for a total of 345,600 pels. In such an embodiment, the same amount of memory required to implement a full resolution SD decoder is satisfactory for storing a downsampled HDTV video picture. Thus, the memory provided for MP@ML would be adequate for the reduced resolution HD decoder as well, with an additional 830 KBits available for other purposes, e.g., for use as part of the coded data buffer 116 when operating in HDTV mode as described above., 38029=MPEG Main Profile at Main Level (\u201cMP@ML\u201d) specifies various requirements for an MPEG compliant standard definition television signal and associated decoding equipment. MP@ML allows pictures as large as 720\ufffd576 pels for a total of 414,720 pels per picture. The proposed standard for US ATV allows for pictures as large as 1920\ufffd1080 pels for a total of 2,073,600 pels per picture., 34467=This patent application is a continuation of allowed U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations can be used to provide picture-in-picture capability in a SDTV receiver as well as a HDTV receiver. Furthermore, the illustrated PIP decoder arrangement is in no way limited to a specific degree of resolution with regard to the primary decoder 401 and only requires that the secondary decoder(s) 402, 403 be implemented as reduced resolution decoders as compared to the resolution supported by the primary decoder. FIG. 4 It should also be noted that the arrangement illustrated in While the above PIP decoder embodiment of the present invention has been described in the context of using \ufffd\u05fc size pictures for the secondary pictures inserted into the primary picture, other size pictures could also be generated at reduced cost, e.g., \ufffd\u05fd size pictures, using the decoder 100 described above. In such a case, the downsampling would have to be performed in a manner that would produce the desired reduction in size and data rate. In a PIP embodiment, the MCP circuit 130 can perform interpolation on the reference frames for macroblocks whose motion vectors are not evenly divisible by four to achieve good prediction results. For a less expensive and somewhat lower quality implementation, motion vectors could be rounded to the nearest factor of 4 and applied without interpolation. In addition to reducing frame buffer size the preparser 112 serves to reduce channel buffer requirements and the complexity of the",
