    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims. At least one functional characteristic of the first field shaping unit 500 is identified and at least one functional characteristic of the second field shaping unit 500 is identified. The identified functional characteristic of the first field shaping unit 500 is different from the identified functional characteristic of the second field shaping unit 500. For example, the first field shaping unit 500 may be identified as being adapted for use with a particular size of workpiece, such as a 300 mm semiconductor wafer, and the second field shaping unit may be identified as being adapted for use with a different size of workpiece, such as a 200 mm semiconductor wafer. This identifying information may enable a user to select between the first and second field shaping units to adapt the reaction vessel to treat a selected type of workpiece. ) is provided, with the second field shaping unit 500 also having at least one wall (e.g., wall 510 b) adapted to be received in the wall-receiving space between the electrodes 600. The second field shaping unit 500 has a second virtual electrode unit 540",
