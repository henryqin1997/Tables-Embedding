It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims. From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects hereinabove set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the apparatus. Reviewing now the over-all operation involving the use of the above described float collar and cement and wiper plugs, and with the float collar installed in the casing string, as illustrated, the cement plug 20 would be lowered through the casing string onto the upper end of the float collar. As previously described, the cement plug is so lowered by means of a column of cement within the casing string above it. During this time, of course, downward movement of the cement plug will force drilling mud in the casing string downwardly past the check valve and thus into the well bore beneath the casing string and upwardly into the annulus from which it may be removed",
