    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed herein as the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention, but rather that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described in this specification except as defined in the appended claims. The present invention enables automatic alignment of image data on paper, even though the document deviates from the correct position and can straighten the image data position thereby ensuring finer reproduction quality of image data. The CPU reads out (106) each fiducial coordinate value of the horizontal and vertical lines stored in the memory 14, and finds a difference between the fiducial and compensatory coordinate values to compute a real coordinate value to be compensated. Initial coordinates P{X(i), Y{j}} are compensated by coordinates P{X(i)-\u0394X(i), Y(j)-\u0394Y(j)}. The CPU 10 produces (107) image data aligned with each compensated coordinate value of the pixels and allows the same to be printed as an image-formed product. The reference letters appeared in the equation 2 designate the following: i variable of vertical lines' coordinates; and m maximum number of pixels of vertical lines by paper size (m equals 1143 in A4 paper). The CPU 10 reads out (104) the respective coordinate values of the vertical lines of the document scanned by a scanner in serial order, and computes (105) each compensatory coordinate value \u0394X(i) of vertical lines with the",
