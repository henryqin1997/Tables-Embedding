L. Gladfelter, et al. \u201cAnhydrous Metal Nitrates as Volatile Single Source Precursors for the CVD of Metal Oxide Films\u201d, Chem. Vap. Dep. 1998, 4, No. 6, p.220 and references cited therein. The use of metal nitrate precursors in CVD applications is also disclosed in W.L Gladfelter, et al., \u201cLow Temperature CVD of Crystalline Titanium Dioxide Films Using Tetranitratotitanium(iv)\u201d, Chem. Vap. Dep. 1998, 4, No. 1, p.9 and W. L Gladfelter, et al. \u201cDoes Chemistry Really Matter in the Chemical Vapor Deposition of Titanium Dioxide? Precursor and Kinetic Effects on the Microstructure of Polycrystalline Films\u201d, JACS, 1999, 121, p.5220. Each of these references disclose that metal nitrate-containing precursors can be used in forming oxide films by CVD without the use of an oxidizing co-reactant. There is no disclosure in these references however of using the nitrate-containing precursors in ALD applications with oxidizing, nitriding or reducing co-reactants., 73184=In this example, the desired thickness was 100 nm, so 2000 cycles of gas switching, as described above, were performed. Any desired thickness of GaN may be obtained by adjusting the number of gas switching cycles., 74048=2000 cycles of the above gas switching were used in forming a Cr metal film having a thickness of 80 nm., 37342=Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) of metal oxides traditionally reacts a metal chloride precursor such as TiCl4 with water to form a metal oxide layer. One such method is described, for example, in \u201cAtomic Layer Epitaxy\u201d, by T. Suntola & M. Simpson (Chapman & Hall, 1990, New York, N.Y. U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,244 to Ackerman discloses the use of a hydrolyzable chloride of a metal and water to deposit a metal oxide film by ALE.}",
