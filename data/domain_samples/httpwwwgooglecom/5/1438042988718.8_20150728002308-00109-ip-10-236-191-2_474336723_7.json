Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements can be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention while the present invention has been shown in the drawings and described above in connection with the exemplary embodiments(s) of the invention. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications can be made without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims. The LEDs flash in random patterns which are extremely beneficial in attracting and keeping attention. The beacon can be configured to accept both AC and DC power, and can also be made with its own battery pack thus allowing it to be more portable. The high intensity LEDs provide a low current, high attention-getting light visible at up to one mile. The low current draw allows the beacon to run continuously without causing a power drain. The LEDs project the light out at a very tight angle to insure that the device is seen at very long distances, however at close range it does not impair an operator's line of sight. The invention thus provides an improved warning beacon with high output LED light technology, a strong triangular shape, and a clear housing to provide maximum visibility",
