    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Instead of inserting special synchronization frames, what are known as \"guard spaces\" in the data frames can be used as synchronization frames. This means that no degradation of transmission capacity is required for the synchronization. However, during synchronization the synchronization frame must be sampled at the same rate as the data frame and a shorter FFT carried out (type 1/8 data FFT) on this, which gives a worse resolution in frequency and correlation. This has, however, the advantage that the FFT operation is carried out much more quickly. An accurate estimate of frequency drift gives high potential for digital frequency regulation. By this is meant that if the limits of the frequency error are known, ie lie within a known interval, instead of regulation via analog components (numerically controlled oscillators, etc) regulation of the sampled signal can be carried out digitally. The method includes acquisition, ie finding the abovementioned initial parameters for the subsequent data, but provides a good basis for tracking (phase compensation, frequency regulation and channel correction during demodulation). The method gives a relatively high proportion of synchronization parameters from the same operations: time shift, phase turning, frequency drift and channel estimating. OFDM modulation by FFT technique automatically gives a high level of controllability of discrete frequencies and their phase position. The transmitter and receiver in an OFDM modem operate in the frequency domain. According to the invention, all synchronization parameters in the frequency",
