While the invention is not limited to using any particular bus or bus standard, interrupt controller 530, which may be an interrupt controller such as previously described, may be coupled to a bus interface that complies with the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus standards, such as PCI/ISA Bus Interface 550. In this particular embodiment, the interrupt controller may be further coupled to a bus that is compliant with the ISA and the Extended ISA (EISA) bus standards, such as ISA/EISA bus 540, and an Interrupt Control Bus 520. The PCI local bus specification 2.2, issued Jan. 25, 1999, is well-known and available from the PCI Special Interest Group, 2575 NE Kathryn Street #17, Hillsboro, Oreg. 97124. The ISA and ESIA bus standards are also well-known and are described in detail in ISA & EISA Theory and Operation, by Edward Solari, published November 1992, which is available, for example, from Annabooks Software, 12860 Danielson Court, San Diego, Calif. 92064. An Interrupt Control Bus, such as 520, may be used for transmitting an interrupt vector to a processor, such as 510, or receiving an EOI from such a processor. Interrupt requests may be received from both PCI/ISA Bus Interface 550 and ISA Bus 540, for example. Additionally, in certain embodiments such as this, an interrupt request may be generated within interrupt controller 530.}",
