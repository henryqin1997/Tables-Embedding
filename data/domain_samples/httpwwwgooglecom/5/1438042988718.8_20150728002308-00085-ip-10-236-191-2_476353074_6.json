This will allow the user to concentrate more fully, and to speak more freely regarding secret information. No training or special effort is needed, since the system works without intervention by the user. Sen M.

No. 4,417,098 and in the following publications, incorporated herein by reference, with copies attached: The portable device of FIG. 5 includes case 41 having a clip or band 42 for temporary attachment of the device to an ordinary telephone. Microphone 43 is mounted within the case, along with voice cancellation circuitry 44, power supply 45, and one or more voice cancellation speakers 46. This device permits the user to \"instantly\" convert any telephone system to one that includes voice cancellation in accordance with the concept",
