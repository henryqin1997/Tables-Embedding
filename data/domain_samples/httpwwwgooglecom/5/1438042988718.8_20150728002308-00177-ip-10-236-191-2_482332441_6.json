Consequently, in the signal communication system of the present embodiment, the signal communication apparatus 1 or 31, of the silence compression type, of the ATM communication network 54 and the signal communication apparatus 59, of the non-silence compression type, of the SDH communication network 57 can communicate with each other only by way of the ATM multiplexing apparatus 55 and the SDH multiplexing apparatus 56. In the signal communication system 51 having the construction described above, each of the signal communication apparatus 1 and 31 can transmit, although it is of the silence compression type as described above, encoded data in a condition such that the encoded data can be decoded by the signal communication apparatus 59 of the non-silence compression type, and can decode encoded data of the non-silence compression type. In the signal communication system 51 of the present embodiment, the signal communication apparatus 1 and 31 described above are connected to an ATM communication network 54 via ATM multiplexing apparatus 52 and 53, respectively. An SDH communication network 57 is connected to the ATM communication network 54 via an ATM multiplexing apparatus 55 and an SDH multiplexing apparatus 56, and a signal transmission unit",
