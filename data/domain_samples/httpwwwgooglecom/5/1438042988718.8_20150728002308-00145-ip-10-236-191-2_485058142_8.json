    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0053] The preceding description has been presented only to illustrate and describe the present method and apparatus. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure to any precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the following claims. [0052] In the implementations discussed with reference to FIGS. 1-4, the switch circuit (125, 125-1, 125-2) is configured to control voltage. In other implementations, the switch circuit (125, 125-1, 125-2) may be configured to control current. In such implementations the switch, may be a transistor that acts as a current source. For example, in the triode region the enable transistor could act as a resistor to control the current. Further, in saturation mode the enable transistor could directly act as a current source. As a result, a current pulse would accumulate on the input node (340). This pulse current would then be pulsed onto the variable capacitor to charge it. [0051] To store or \u201cwrite\u201d a desired charge to each MEM device (110-3) of a given row of MEM cells (410), a reference voltage having a selected value is provided to each of the N columns, with each of the N reference voltage signals potentially having a differently selected value. The clear signal for the given row",
