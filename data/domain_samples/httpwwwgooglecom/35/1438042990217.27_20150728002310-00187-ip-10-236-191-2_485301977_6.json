    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Since the terminal block is molded, the joining portion of the lead wires to the pins, electronic devices and a cord for power supply are sealingly held on the terminal block and certainly connected thereto, and excellent humidity resistance can be obtained. Further, since electronic devices, a cord for power supply and so on are connected to the motor body through the terminal block at a position out of the other casing, assembling work can be automated. Since the coil is directly wound on the stator in a parallel and crosswise state, the perimeter of the coil is reduced and an amount of wire is used for the coil can be small in addition that a former for winding the wires is unnecessary, the height of the coil ends can be reduced, and the bulging-out of the coil can be eliminated, this unncessitating a post-treatment. The motor having the construction described above of the present invention provides the following advantages. New inner ring magnetic pole portion 10 is forcibly fitted to the outer ring yoke portion 5 which is heated by a heating medium (not shown) so that they are certainly connected through the recesses for fitting 6a by the shrinkage of cooling at the yoke portion 5. Thus, the stator iron core 6 is formed. Further, the wedge 39 is inserted between the coil 30 and the yoke portion 5 for electrical insulation as shown",
