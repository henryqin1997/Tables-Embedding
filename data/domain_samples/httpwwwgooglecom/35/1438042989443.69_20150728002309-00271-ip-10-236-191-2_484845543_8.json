Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate another embodiment of the attachment generally designated by reference numeral 50 which includes a mounting structure 52 in the form of a bracket of generally L-shaped configuration with pivot lug 54 at one edge thereof for pivotally supporting a plurality of straps or brackets 56 each of which includes pivot lugs 58 at the upper ends thereof journaling pressure and seed release wheels 60 thereon which function in the same manner as the release wheels 42 in FIGS. 1-3. The mounting straps 56 are pivoted to the lugs 54 by pivot pins 62 and upwardly from the pivot pin 62 are attachment lugs 64 having an articulate connection 66 to the plunger or armature 68 of a solenoid 70 which is mounted at the upper end of the upstanding leg of the L-shaped bracket 52. The connection 66 between the plunger 68 and the mounting lugs 64 enables the mounting strap or bracket 56 to pivot about pivot pin 62 from an inoperative position spaced from the pneumatic",
