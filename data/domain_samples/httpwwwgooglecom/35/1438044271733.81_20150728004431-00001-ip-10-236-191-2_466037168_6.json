No. 5,413,571., 36281=A further approach to resolving the above-identified problem is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,364 granted to Kensey on May 17, 1988 and related U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,852,568, 4,890,612 and 5,021,059 granted to Kensey on Aug. 1, 1989, Jan. 2, 1990 and Jun. 4, 1991, respectively. The first two Kensey patents disclose a device for sealing an opening in the wall of a blood vessel which consists of an elongate tubular body having an anchor member removably disposed therein. The tubular body also includes an ejecting device disposed within the tubular body for forcing the anchor member from the tubular body into the interior of the blood vessel. A retraction filament is secured to the anchor member so that the engagement surface of the anchor member hemostatically engages the inner surface of the blood vessel contiguous with the puncture. The third Kensey patent discloses a device which includes a plug member having a holding portion which is adapted to engage portions of the tissue adjacent to the punctured vessel or organ to hold the plug member in place and a sealing portion formed of a foam material which extends into the punctured vessel or organ to engage the tissue contiguous therewith to seal the puncture. The final Kensey patent discloses a device which includes a pair of members which are positioned along the inner and outer surfaces of the blood vessel wall to seal the puncture., 34891=U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,994 granted to Kurth on May 16, 1989 attempts to resolve the above-described problem by providing an apron-like device consisting of a pelvic apron and a groin strap to apply a compressive force to the femoral vessel of the patient. Although this device effectively eliminates the need to have a nurse apply direct pressure to the incision site, the decrease in blood flow through the femoral artery caused by the use of this device may increase the likelihood of thrombosis formation in the compromised patient., 35443=Another approach to resolving the above-identified problem is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,246 granted to Sinofsky on May 29, 1990. The method of using the device disclosed in this patent includes the steps of advancing a semi-rigid tube having an inflatable balloon at its distal end through the overlying tissue to a location adjacent to the outer lumen of the punctured artery. The balloon is then inflated to apply pressure directly to the outer lumen of the artery. Laser energy is then directed to the outer lumen of the artery via an optical fiber centrally located in the semi-rigid tube such that the laser energy passes through the optical fiber and balloon of the semi-rigid tube to thermally weld the artery and seal the incision. Finally, the semi-rigid tube and balloon are removed from the incision.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing embodiment, various forms of the sealing member and collagen member are disclosed, it is anticipated that the various features described above with respect to the embodiments of the present invention may be interchanged or modified without departing from the basic invention which is defined by the following claims. Although the above described shaft members of the sealing members are preferably constructed of a relatively stiff bioabsorbable material such as lactide or glycolide polymers or copolymers, the sealing members may be constructed of a number of bioabsorbable materials as long as the elements of the sealing members have the qualities necessary to perform the desired functions as described above. The above described balloon members may also be constructed of a number of different materials as long as the bioabsorbability and flexibility of the balloon member is retained to enable the balloon member to perform the sealing and hemostatic functions as described above. Similarly, the collagen members or injectable collagen as described above may be constructed of a number of bioabsorbable materials as long as the collagen members or injectable collagen have the qualities necessary to perform the desired hemostatic functions as described above. In this embodiment, the sealing member 76 is preferably inserted into the incision in a manner similar to one or more of the insertion methods described above. As described above, the first balloon member 86 is initially inflated and positioned such",
