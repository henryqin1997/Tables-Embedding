However, other means for electronic imaging can be used such as Vidicons, image disectors, linear arrays and the like. Indeed, a mechanically scanned laser beam, like a flying spot scanner, can be used to sweep through space in order to find target points some of which envisioned could be particularly reflective or responsive to laser light. The primary goal is to find target points or features. However, the TV cameras also allow normal gray level part images to be obtained, a big seconday advantage since this is often combined with the target based guidance function for inspection, recognition or other purposes., 20160=This application is a divisional of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Note too that the CAD system could also design the target on the part--specifying special stamped in (cut in, molded in, etc.) targets etc. at certain points on the part surface. The CAD system too would not only know the location of the targets to other part features, but to all other targets on all other parts used to form the assembly. One of the fascinating aspects of all of this is that probably the optimum way in which the car was built could be totally laid out on a CAD system. Different cars would use different sequences or different ideas. You could build anything given this approach, just as humans could in a garage if they were presented with a kit of parts. A second way is to simply have them in racks 916, bring the racks in (as many of the parts are racked anyway) and bring them in with trucks to each of the individual job sites. For example, if each rack contains 16 parts, we can do a day's production with a single rack full at any one cell. The true flexibility of this is a distinct advantage. Clearly some sort of very clever material handling would be required in order to get the parts to these individual drops. The simpliest of all, of course, is an overhead monorail conveyor 914 bringing the parts in with the robot simply going over just",
