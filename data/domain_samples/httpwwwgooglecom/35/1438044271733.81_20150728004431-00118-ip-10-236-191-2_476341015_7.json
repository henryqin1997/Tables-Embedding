Such interactive systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,390,238 issued to Kirk et al. on Feb. 14, 1995, U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,611 issued to Tamura on Jul. 18, 1995, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,047 issued to David et al. on is Aug. 15, 1995. One disadvantage of these systems is that they either require a patient to call in to a central facility to be monitored or require the central facility to call the patient according to a rigid monitoring schedule., 42386=This application is related to U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,476 issued Dec. 7, 1999 and is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,493 issued Apr. 27, 1999 which claims priority from Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/041,746 filed Mar. 28, 1997 and from Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/041,751 filed Mar. 28, 1997. This application is also related to concurrently filed application titled \"Computerized Reward System for Encouraging Participation in a Health Management System\". All of the above named applications are hereby incorporated by reference., 92866=FIG. 18 is a schematic block diagram illustrating the components of apparatus 27 in greater detail. Apparatus 27 is similar in design to apparatus 26 of the preferred embodiment except that apparatus 27 includes an audio processor chip 120 in place of microprocessor 76. Audio processor chip 120 is preferably an RSC-164 chip commercially available from Sensory Circuits Inc. of 1735 N. First Street, San Jose, Calif. 95112., 71286=Screen 56 additionally includes a connection time field 100 for specifying a prescribed connection time at which apparatus 26 executing the script is to establish a subsequent communication link to server 18. The connection time is preferably selected to be the time at which communication rates are the lowest, such as 3:00 AM. During this connection time, apparatus 26 transmits to server 18 all responses 42 and device measurements 44 it has received during the day. During this same connection time, apparatus 26 also receives from server 18 all script programs 40 it will need for the following day or until the next prescribed connection time. This store and forward feature of apparatus 26 reduces communication expenses. However, if numerous patients are using apparatus 26, more than one connection can be made during the day in order to download necessary script programs 40. Screen 56 also includes a CREATE SCRIPT button 102 for instructing script generator 50 to generate script program 40 from the information entered in screen 56. Screen 56 further includes a CANCEL button 104 for canceling the information entered in screen 56.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the examples given, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. The invention may also be used for educational purposes, such as testing students remotely. Students can use the apparatus to take national standardized multiple-choice tests, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). In addition, the invention can be used for financial purposes. Banks, utilities, credit card companies, etc. can send billing information from their servers to customers using the apparatuses. Customers can then authorize the institutions to transfer funds, pay their bills, etc. Moreover, the invention is not limited to the specific applications described. The system and method of the invention have many other applications both inside and outside the healthcare industry. For example, the system may also be used by insurance companies and medical clinics to conduct all types of surveys of patients. Retailers and service companies can conduct all types of surveys of consumers. Marketing firms can use the invention to do widespread market research. In addition, stores can use the invention to receive information from customers regarding their shopping tastes. An example of this application would be a bridal registry. Although the above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention but merely as illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments. Many other embodiments of the invention are possible. For",
