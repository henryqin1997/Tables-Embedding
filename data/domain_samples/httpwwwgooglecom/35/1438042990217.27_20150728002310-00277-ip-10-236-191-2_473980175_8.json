    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is, therefore, not intended that the present invention be limited except as set forth in the following claims. It can be seen from FIG. 2 that the axial force exerted by the user in drilling the bone structure is transmitted through driver 50 to both primary drive member 30 and counterbore drill body 10. Part of the axial force exerted on driver 50 is transmitted through driver flange 60 and bearing flange 86 to drill body 10. The remainder of the axial force exerted on driver 50 is transmitted through pin 40 to primary drill member 30. Thus while the drill is cutting through the bone structure, sufficient force is transmitted to counterbore flutes 12 of body 10 and primary cutting surfaces 32 of primary drill member 30. When primary drill member 30 penetrates the bone structure, the entire axial force exerted on the drill will be transmitted to the forward faces 100 of counterbore flutes 12. Flutes 12 rest against the bottom of the counterbore hole and support the drill mechanism so that when the primary drill releases when it penetrates the skull, the remainder of the drill will not move forward toward the cranial cavity.
