    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{81165=As shown in FIG. 5a, the basic system will use a PC compatible board or chip (system on a chip, such as the STPC presently available from ST Microelectronics) running the compact disc recorder 30 software as an embedded system, to provide overall control of the assorted circuit elements. Such a system will be referred to hereinafter as a PCSystem [PCS]. The PCS will communicate with the rest of the system by means of a Main BUS (a bus meaning a grouping of conductors which is routed to the same parts of a circuit, such as an ISA or PCI type), each containing a Data, an Address and a Control sub-bus. The Main Bus, an ISA BUS in this case, is primarily controlled by the PCS and will connect the PCS to the DSP (such as a ADSP2111 DSP presently available from Analog Devices), Main Memory Ram [RAM], Boot Block Eeram, Real Time Clock & Configuration [RTC], Voice Processing & Storage [VPS], Latch System [LATCH], SCSI adapter [SCSI] and Memory Mapped Buffer System [BUFFER, including Memory Mapped Buffers 1 and 2 as illustrated in FIG. 5a]. There is a secondary bus referred to as the DSP BUS, which is primarily controlled by the DSP and connects the DSP to the BUFFER through bank switches SW1, SW2, and SW3, to the ANALOG BOARD through Digital OptoCouplers, and to the LATCH, and to the I/O PROCESSOR [IOP]. A third BUS, called the Serial Interface Bus [SPI] only connects to the ANALOG BOARD (shown in FIG. 5b), through Digital OptoCouplers, and passes data back and forth from the DSP and the CODEC (on the Isolated Analog Board). The SPI, together with the Analog Board Control Bus, also controls the DIGITALLY CONTROLLED GAIN UNITS [DCGU 1 and DCGU 2] (see FIG. 5b) and provides for connection to an External Digital Interface (which may be utilized in a Professional Unit). A fourth BUS, called the IDE BUS connects the HARD DISK SYSTEM [HD] to the PCS. A fifth BUS called the SCSI BUS connects the SCSI ADAPTER to the compact disc recordable drive 58., 44984=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/111,989, filed Jul. 8, 1998, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/051,999, filed Jul. 9, 1997., 102899=Essentially, the screen display shown in FIG. 7 is indicating that the session is called \u201cMetallica\u201d, the song track entitled \u201cFade to Black\u201d is the first song in the session, the total track time is being displayed and the song is 6:56 long, there is about 20% remaining in the session (the entire session will fit on a compact disc and some more sound tracks can still be added), the compact disc recorder 30 is in a stop mode, the inputs to the compact disc recorder 30 are low (\u221245 right channel and \u221245 left channel), and the user may use the corresponding push-button 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63 to select one of the following functions: utility, time, play a compact disc, make a compact disc, session and peak., 104203=Pressing push-button 57 causes the compact disc recorder 30 to enter a play CD mode wherein a compact disc placed in the compact disc tray 54 can be played back using the compact disc recordable drive 58. During play CD mode, the set 48 of push-buttons on the front bezel 44 may be operated much like the controls of a standard compact disc player. When the compact disc recorder 30 enters this mode, the display device 46 may appear as shown in FIG. 23 indicating that track one of the compact disc received is 00:00 long (essentially indicating that no compact disc has been inserted in the compact disc tray 54). At this time, the selection menu 272 includes two options: time and exit. Pressing the push-button 55 (corresponding to the time option) causes the center display 216 to indicate, for example, the time elapsed in the song, the amount of time remaining in the song, the amount of time elapsed on the disc and the amount of time remaining on the disc, etc. depending on how many times the push-button 55 is pressed. As the center display changes, the display indicia 218 changes to indicate what it is that the center display 216 is indicating. Pressing push-button 63 (corresponding to the exit option) causes the compact disc recorder 30 to exit the play back mode and revert back to the display illustrated in FIG. 7.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications and equivalents without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The compact disc recorder 30 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention provides several advantages which include, but are not limited to, being as easy to use in many respects as a modem-day audio tape recorder/player or compact disc player. Additionally, the compact disc recorder 30 in accordance with the present invention also provides that one can listen to a sound track before the sound track is to be recorded. In other words, one can truly audition a recording. Moreover, the compact disc recorder 30 can be used like a modern day juke box where songs are played directly from memory without needing to insert the compact disc containing the music. Additionally, the compact disc recorder 30 preferably provides enhanced features for editing the sound tracks recorded into the memory of the compact disc recorder 30. Using the compact disc recorder 30, one can easily customize the order in which sound tracks will appear on the compact disc and one can easily write several compact discs having different orders of songs or having slightly different compilations without having to re-enter the sounds into the device 30. Finally, unlike present-day compact disc",
