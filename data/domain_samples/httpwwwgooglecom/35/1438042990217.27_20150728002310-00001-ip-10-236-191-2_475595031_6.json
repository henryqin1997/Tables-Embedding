It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above teaching. Accordingly, this invention is intended to embrace all alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the attached claims. The wrapping set of executable instructions may further be associated with a validation set of executable instructions 400 wherein the validation set of executable instructions 400 locates or determines whether a valid license exists or is otherwise permissible 410. If the license is permissible, the data file/program 390 is allowed to execute or be used in 430, otherwise an owner associated with the data file/program 390 is notified electronically in 420. Validation and execution need not occur while the computing device 370 is in communication with any other external computing devices such as devices 350 and 360, since once the data file/program 390 is acquired from one or more of the external devices 350 or 360 the computing device is free to use the data file/program 390 and with each such use validation ensures that a proper authority exists to use the data file/program 390. depicts a schematic diagram of a system for",
