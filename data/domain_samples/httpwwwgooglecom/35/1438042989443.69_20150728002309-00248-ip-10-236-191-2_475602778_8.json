The disclosed circuitry repeats this process at fixed intervals to continually refresh the data from the game controllers 101 and 102 at the first and second sets of predetermined memory locations. When a computer game, running on the processor 104 needs signals from one of the controllers, it reads the memory cell which contains the byte of data for the one controller. If, as described above, a game allows multiple controllers to be used simultaneously, the processor 104 may periodically read the stored signal values for all of the controllers 101 and 102 and update the game display accordingly. Although not shown in FIG. 3, the control circuitry 318 may also control circuitry identical to the registers 316 and 312 and serial to parallel converter 314 which loads the signals from the controllers 101a and 101b. These values are loaded into a second set of predetermined memory locations which are reserved for the controllers connected to the second game port. This process continues until all four bytes of the register 316 have been filled or until a logic-one is detected in the last bit position of an eight-bit value loaded by the serial to parallel converter 314. When either of these events occurs, the",
