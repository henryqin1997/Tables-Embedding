The arm rest of the present invention provides an easy and convenient means for providing a full size arm rest in the use position while decreasing the lateral extent of the seat back occupied by the arm rest when in the stowed position. This enables the seat back size to be maintained while the vehicle width is being decreased. The O-rings 95, while providing a sufficiently tight fit to rotate the tube 30, also provide for some slippage between the cap 94 and tube 30. This is necessary since rotation of the support tube 30 is limited to 90\ufffd while the pivot tube 20 may pivot through an arc of more than 90\ufffd as the arm rest is moved between the stowed position and the use position. This is because the seat back is typically reclined rearward some extent from vertical. Since the drive cable 34 will tend to rotate tube 30 the same angular extent as the tube 20 is pivoted, which is greater than 90\ufffd, the connection of the cap 94 to the tube 20 provides for relative motion therebetween. A set screw 96 coupled to the pivot tube 20",
