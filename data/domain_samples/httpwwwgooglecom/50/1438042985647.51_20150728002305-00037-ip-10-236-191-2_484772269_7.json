    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{222729=FIG. 12 shows two examples of Engineering Change Control (FIG. 11, Block 106) and updating the Parts Manual (FIG. 11, Block 108). The first example in FIG. 12 is for drawing number 0051.01. Engineering Change Number 1010 indicates that this drawing is to be deleted (1010D) and replaced by 0051.01.01 (1010A) on 2/10/XX. Drawing number 0051.01 will be used prior to 2/10/XX. Drawing 0051.01.01 will be used beginning 2/10/XX. The second example in FIG. 12 is for a part replacement. The distributor 4030 will be replaced by 4030.01 on 2/5/XX, controlled by Engineering Change Number 1011. Distributor 4030 is to be used before 2/5/XX (1011D). Distributor 4030.01 will be used beginning 2/5/XX (1011A). FIG. 13 shows the parts lists in effect on 2/5/XX.- FIG. 14 shows the same parts lists in effect on 2/10/XX. The parts list in FIGS. 12, 13 and 14 represent three different parts lists over a period of time based on the criteria of each engineering change number., 249322=In the example of FIG. 32, the cumulative run hours prior to this planning cycle was 900. The actual run hours for the previous week was 100 hours. The new cumulative run hours is 1000. The projected cumulative run hours for each week is incremented by the planned run hours. The projected cumulative run hours for week 1 is 1100. This consist of the previous projected cumulative run hours of 1000 plus the planned run hours for week 1 of 100. This calculation continues for the entire planning horizon., 187445=The most commonly used effectivity control technique is a \"specified date\", for example: on April 15th, part A will be replaced by part B. Another effectivity control technique is \"spare parts inventory use-up\". With this technique, part B is issued when part A is no longer available. ECN control will ensure that part A is no longer ordered. Effectivity control can also be tied to a maintenance request \"serial number\". When this technique is used a particular change is implemented beginning with the maintenance request number specified and then applied to all subsequent maintenance requests., 248415=Non-assembly parts (Block 271) have their run hours converted to requirements (Block 278). FIG. 32 is an example. Part-C had actual run hours for last week of 100 hours. The planned run hours for this part is shown for weeks 1 through 21. The mean-time failure rate for this part is 1375 hours. The required quantity is calculated as follows:, 208358=The next step shown in FIG. 8B, corresponding to Block 51 of FIG. 7, calculates the usage dependent maintenance requests, shown as \"P/M\". The scheduled hours are added to the actual hours to project when a maintenance request needs to be generated (Blocks 49 and 50 of FIG. 7). For example complex 1A-1 has 800 actual hours prior to week one. At 1250 hours a maintenance request is to be created. Adding a weeks worth of scheduled run hours (112 hours per production week) to the actual hours indicates that complex 1A-1 will reach the 1250 maintenance point during week four. A tentative maintenance request to perform the usage dependent maintenance operations is scheduled for week four., 249846=Continuing with the example of FIG. 32, after each projected cumulative run hours is calculated, it is compared to the mean-time failure rate. A \"requirement\" is created each time that the mean-time failure rate is exceeded. This occurs twice in FIG. 32. Week 5 has a projected cumulative run hours of 1400. The mean-time failure rate is 1375. Since the projected cumulative run hours exceeds the mean-time failure rate by 25 hours (1400-1375) a requirement is created. The projected cumulative run hours is reduced by the mean-time failure rate and the calculations for projected cumulative run hours begins again. Week 6 has a projected cumulative run hours of 125 consisting of 25 projected cumulative run hours from week 5 (1400-1375) plus the 100 planned run hours for week 6. The second occurrence for creating a requirement is in week 21., 204831=(4) The planned run hours are then added to the actual life-to-date hours. At Block 56, when the projected planned run hours exceed a usage dependent event (for example: do a class A overhaul every 1250 production hours) a maintenance request is planned (Block 57).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims. The last function performed in the spare part planning cycle is the Buyer Recommendation (Block 287). Although the system calculates when to place an order or to advise the rescheduling of an existing purchase order, the Buyer is responsible for the actual company commitment. The system will not automatically issue or reschedule a purchase order. However, it will be understood by those having skill in the art that the system may be configured to automatically issue or reschedule a purchase order. Referring again to FIG. 30, at Block 283, the part is checked for ECN use-up control. If the part is to be phased out (replaced) when it is used-up, the remaining requirements for this part must be posted to the substitute part (Block 284). FIG. 34 shows this example. Part 01B16 Part-F is under control of ECN 456--use-up to be replaced by 01B15 Part-E. The first time the projected on-hand goes negative (-3) for this part (Part-F) is week 5 (Block 285). The remaining requirements for week 5 (-3) and all future requirements for this part are posted to the replacement part (01B15 Part-E) at Block",
