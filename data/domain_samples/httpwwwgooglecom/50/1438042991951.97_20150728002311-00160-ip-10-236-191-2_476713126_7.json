While the invention has been described with respect to the described embodiments in accordance therewith, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and improvements may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, it is understood that the invention is not to be limited by the specific illustrated embodiments, but only by the scope of the appended claims. [0032] In summary the present invention provides a method of collecting sample DNA that is non-invasive, allows rapid and positive personal identification of the accident victim, and does not disturb grieving family members by asking for reference samples for identification. The DNA sample is placed in a short-term or long-term storage and is promptly disposed of, once the individual completes his/her activity term. This requires less complex processes and attention than for other types of biological fluids. [0031] In the foregoing embodiments, instead of and in addition to storing the DNA sample for future identification purposes, it may be processed shortly after sample collection (Block 200) to obtain personal DNA information (Block 210) (i.e., the DNA code). Such information is stored at a databank (Block 220), which may be maintained by the DNA processing facility",
