The preceding description enables others skilled in the art to utilize the method and system in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the method and system be defined by the following claims. The preceding description has been presented only to illustrate and describe the present method and system. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present method and system to any precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The above burst acquisition processes can be equally applied to non-bursted communications systems, such as those systems employing Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques. In conclusion, the present method and system for obtaining improved burst acquisition in a digital receiver uses the beneficial aspects of both a QPSK burst correlator and a BPSK burst correlator to effectively reduce both falses and misses occurring in a demodulator. A multi-step burst detection process is also preferably employed first as part of the overall burst acquisition process. All of the above-mentioned enhancements to the correlators may be made with low implementation cost architectures resulting in minimal cost increase in the production of the",
