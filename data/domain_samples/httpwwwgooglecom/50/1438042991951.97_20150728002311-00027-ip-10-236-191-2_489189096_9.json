Thus the present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. For example, the particular optics used to separate, redirect and delay target reflections may be altered without departing from the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the invention is not limited to the particular pulsed illumination formats disclosed herein. Those skilled in the art may be aware of other illumination schemes which optimize the range of differential Doppler velocities which may be detected in particular imaging applications. Additionally, optical phase/frequency shifting elements having other suitable modulation properties may be appropriate for inclusion in alternative embodiments of the present invention. Additionally, with access to the teachings herein it may also be apparent to one skilled in the art to adapt the high speed electro-optic switches disclosed herein for utilization in other optical signal processing applications. In the preferred embodiments disclosed herein the electro-optic switches are preferably realized by transverse electro-optic modulators (modulating field applied normal to direction of light propagation). Transverse electro-optic modulators employ suitably electro-optic crystals such as KH2 PO4 (see e.g. A. Yariv, Introduction to Optical Electronics). The polarizers and beam splitters referred to",
