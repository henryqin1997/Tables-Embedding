    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described in the above preferred embodiments, a variable length coding and/or decoding system of the present invention requires smaller amounts of calculation and storage to be efficient. Specifically, the variable length coding and/or decoding system can be applied to a moving picture coding and/or decoding, and it is possible to provide an efficient moving picture coding and/or decoding system with smaller amounts of calculation and storage. While the decoded values have been determined every macro blocks in the decoded-value determining method of FIG. 76, the detected values may be determined every block or code word. As shown in FIG. 76(d), when an error is detected in the stuffing code and the decoding can not be decoded in the backward direction, the decoding is carried out only in the forward direction. When the error is detected, the decoded results of the upper layer with respect to the macro blocks after the error detected position are rewritten on the basis of the decoded results of the mode information of the upper layer so that the INTRA macro blocks are directly indicated by the last frame and the INTER macro blocks are indicated only by the motion compensation using the last frame. As shown in FIG. 76(c), when errors are detected in the same macro block both in the forward and backward decoded results, the decoded values in the macro block at the error detected position are abandoned",
