No. 60/128,892 filed on Apr. 12, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 87217=Referring now to FIG. 10D, a sample screen 1032 associated with a order management GUI is shown. Particularly, screen 1032 may be used to provision an access line needed in the VPN. The screen may include data entry fields 1034 for customer ID and customer name, fields 1036 for access line messages (e.g., router serial no. and port no., network access server/switch serial no. and port no., line type, etc.), and fields 1038 for customer contact information (e.g., name, employee ID, telephone, fax, etc.). The area 1004 may also include buttons 1040 to handle \u201cinform customer\u201d and \u201cprovisioned\u201d functions. The \u201cinform customer\u201d button on the provisioning screen is used by the provisioning agent to let the system know that the customer was informed regarding setup of an access line (e.g., a T1 line) from the customer site to the point of presence (POP). The \u201cprovisioned\u201d button on the provisioning screen is used by the provisioning agent to let the system know that the customer was informed by the provisioning agent that the provisioning of the access line from the customer site to the POP has been successfully completed., 84762=Particularly, FIGS. 10A and 10B illustrate sample screens associated with the customer management GUI. Referring initially to FIG. 10A, screen 1000 comprises a browser-specific information and control area 1002 and a management system information and control area 1004. It is to be understood that the area 1002, which may include menus, entry fields, etc, is dependent on the particular browser software (e.g., Netscape\u2122, Internet Explorer\u2122, etc.) that the user is employing to access the system and, thus, is not shown in detail. The management system interface is contained in area 1004. Area 1004 includes a subsystem/function selection area 1006 where the user may highlight the subsystem or function he desires and select it (e.g., using a mouse or keyboard). Various control buttons 1008 may be clicked on to select other features and functions associated with the system, e.g., help, documentation, and support features. FIG. 10B illustrates a customer management screen 1010 that is used to add a customer. In the area 1004 are data entry fields 1012 for customer identification (ID) and customer name information, data entry fields 1016 for customer contact information (e.g., name, employee ID, telephone, fax, etc.), and data entry fields for customer locations (e.g., name, P.O. box, address, city, state, country, etc.). Also, area 1004 includes buttons 1020 for submitting, resetting, deleting and undeleting data entered in the fields., 88427=Referring now to FIG. 10E, a sample screen 1042 associated with a network database management GUI is shown. Particularly, screen 1042 may be used to create a point of presence (POP) in the VPN. The screen may include data entry fields 1044 for POP ID, POP name and SU ID (a Service Unit or SU is a combination of one or more remote access servers on a local area network with a POP router, e.g., a PacketStar 6400), fields 1046 for equipment information (e.g., serial no., vendor, equipment type, model no., IP address, etc.), fields 1048 for information relating to wide area network (WAN) switches in the POP's area (e.g., WAN switch serial no. and switch assignment states, etc.), and field 1050 for POP service area information (e.g., postal code, etc.). The area 1004 may also include buttons 1053 to submit and reset the information on the screen., 86331=Referring now to FIG. 10C, a sample screen 1022 associated with a configuration management GUI is shown. Particularly, screen 1022 may be used to create a VPN service. The screen may include data entry fields 1024 for customer ID, customer name, a VPN service order ID, a target service date, status, and an indication whether the service is fully meshed or not. In addition, area 1004 includes fields 1026 for host group information (e.g., group name, customer premise equipment router IP address, port no., port type, and indication whether the group is configured, etc.), fields 1028 for VPN link information (e.g., desired QoS, desired bandwidth, traffic direction, and tunnel end identification: A-end and Z-end, etc.), and fields 1030 for host group locations (e.g., name, P.O. box, address, city, state, etc.).}",
