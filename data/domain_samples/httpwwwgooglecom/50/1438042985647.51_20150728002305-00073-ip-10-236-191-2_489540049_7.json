Magnani et al, Science 212: 55 (1981); Pukel et al, J. Exp. Med. 155: 1133 (1982). For example, Magnani, supra defines a sialyated antigen with a monoclonal antibody designated 19.9. The antigen is a serum marker for pancreatic, colon, and gastric carcinoma. Herlyn et al, J. Clin Immunol 2: 135 (1982). OC 125, a serum marker for ovarian cancer, has been defined by Bast et al, New Engl. J. Med. 309: 883 (1983), and appears to be a mucin related molecule, see e.g., Kawabat et al, Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol 2: 275 (1983). Yet another antigen defined by McGee et al, Lancet ii: 7 (1982), and labelled Ca.1, has some properties of a mucin molecule., 27279=Reactivity with blood group A, B, H, Lewisa, Lewisb, X and Y determinants as described by Lloyd et al, PNAS 61: 1470 (1968), was determined by a solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay as described by Lloyd et al, Immunogen 17: 537 (1983), except that the antigen preparations were dissolved in water., 24214=For adherent target cells, 200-500 trypsinized cells were plated in 0.01 ml wells of Terasaki plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Nonadherent target cells were attached to the wells by pretreating the wells for 45 minutes at room temperature with 0.01 ml concanavalin A at 1.0 mg/ml in Dulbecco's PBS. After washing the plates twice and blotting, target cells in DPBS were added and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature as described by Mattes et al, J. Immunol. Meth. 61: 145 (1983). The immune rosetting assay has been described by Carey et al, PNAS 73: 3278 (1976). To test for neuraminidase sensitivity, target cells were treated for 1 hour at 37\ufffd with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase diluted 1:10 in 0.05 M citrate pH 5.5, 0.1M NaCl, 0.01M CaCl2. To detect cytoplasmic antigens, plated target cells were washed twice with PBS, then fixed with 2.0% buffered formaldehyde as described by Farr et al, J. Immunol. Meth. 47: 129 (1981) for 30 minutes. All incubations were at room temperature. After 2 washes with PBS, they were incubated with 0.05% NP40 in PBS for 15 minutes. After 2 washes with PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), monoclonal antibody was added, starting with a 1:500 dilution. After a 45 minute incubation, plates were washed twice, and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig was added for 45 minutes. Following 2 washes with PBS, substrate was added (prepared immediately before use by mixing 1.0 ml 0.05 M acetate buffer pH 5.0, 0.05 ml 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole at 4.0 mg/ml in N,N-dimethylformamide, and 0.005 ml 3.0% hydrogen peroxide. Graham et al, J. Histochem Cytochem 13: 150 (1965). After 15 minutes, the plates were washed twice with PBS, once with water, and examined., 16985=In 1975, Kohler and Milstein published their now well known method for production of mouse/human hybridoma cell lines. By immunizing a murine animal, such as a mouse, with samples of human cancer cells, antibody producing cells are generated by the mouse specimen. These cells are then fused with an immortal human cell line which does not produce antibodies. As each antibody producing cell produces only one kind of antibody, it is then possible, by screening, to determine hybridoma cell lines which produce a particular, desired antibody. The hybridoma cell line, thus identified, can be cloned to produce great amounts of antibody. The antibody produced is all of one type, and can be traced back to a single clone--hence the term \"monoclonal antibody\"., 29334=To test heat stability, labeled extracts were heated at 100\ufffd for 5 minutes; precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (7,000 rpm, 15 minutes), then standard immunoprecipitations were performed using the supernatant. Preparation of chloroform:methanol (C:M), 2:1 cell extracts and their use in inhibition assays has been described by Mattes et al, PNAS 81: 568 (1984). To determine whether the mucin-like molecule precipitated by Ab MQ49 was soluble in C:M, [3 H]glucosamine-labeled cells were pelleted and extracted with C:M, 2:1 for 1 hour at room temperature. After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm, the pellet was extracted with the standard solubilization buffer, while the supernatant was dried by evaporation, then suspended in the same buffer. Both fractions were tested for antigens detectable by immuno-precipitation. Treatment of precipitated antigens with chondroitinase ABC followed Bumol et al, PNAS 79: 1245 (1982).}",
