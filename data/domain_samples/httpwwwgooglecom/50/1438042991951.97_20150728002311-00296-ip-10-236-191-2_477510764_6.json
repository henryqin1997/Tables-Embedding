The microcontroller in the hardware token 22 uses SK-ij to perform the internal decryption of the encrypted session key ESK and transmits the resultant unencrypted session key SK to the communication system software in the computer 20. The sender serial number SN-i is read based on the supplied user I's identification number from the non-volatile memory by the microcontroller in the hardware token 22. Simultaneously, the microcontroller of token 22 reads the serial number SN-j of token 22 and combines serial numbers SN-i and SN-j using the special secret algorithm to receive decryption key-DK-ij (see block 50) that is a counterpart for the encryption key EK-ij and should be used to decrypt the encrypted session key SK. This algorithm could be the same that was used during the encryption process in which case the encryption and decryption keys EK-ij and DK-ij could be the same or the algorithms could be complimentary to each other and the keys will be different. The deciphering process is shown on the flow chart of",
