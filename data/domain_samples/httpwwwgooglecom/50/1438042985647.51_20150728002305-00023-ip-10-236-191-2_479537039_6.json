    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40317=Various conventional methods are known for determining the receive and transmit weights. See for example, above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,378, and 5,592,490, and above-cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/729,390, as well as co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/948,772 to Parish, et al. (filed Oct. 10, 1997). In general, the weights are chosen so that the antenna array receives or radiates most of the energy from or towards a particular subscriber unit, e.g., \u201cbeam-forming\u201d, and/or it receives or transmits minimal energy from or toward co-channel interferers, e.g., \u201cnull-placing.\u201d One method of determining transmit weights, for example, is to compute the set of transmit weights 128 directly from the set of receive weights 130 generated by receive signal processor 116 for the particular remote user, the computation carried out by transmit weight generator 126 in real time. In such a case, during this computation, transmit weight generator 126 must take into account the gain and phase differences between the uplink and downlink propagation signal paths where the signal paths include both the air-path from and to a subscriber unit and the variation among the different signal parts within the receive RF electronics and also within the transmit RF electronics. This information is stored in calibration vector generator unit 132 in the form of a calibration vector 134., 34243=The embodiments of the present invention are preferably implemented in wireless communication systems that include communication stations (e.g., cellular base stations) that have an array of antenna elements together with adaptive smart antenna processing. For example, FIG. 1 shows a communication system 100 which includes a base station 102 with a multi-element antenna array 104 that issues time slot commands for mobile subscriber units 106, 108 to respond to it in an orderly manner. In one implementation, the communication system 100 operates using the personal handy phone (PHS) communications protocol which is popular in Japan. The mobile subscriber units 106,108 may be mobile or fixed. A mobile or WLL system may be analog or digital, and may use frequency division multiple access (FDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), or time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques, the latter usually in combination with FDMA (TDMA/FDMA). Barratt et al., describe a PHS FDMA/TDMA base station having four antenna elements, in above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/729,390, filed Oct. 11, 1996, incorporated herein by reference. A PHS FDMA/TDMA base station for a wireless local loop (WLL) system that may have any number of antenna elements is described by Yun in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/020,049, filed Feb. 6, 1998, incorporated herein by reference., 26682=Systems with an array of multiple-antenna array are therefore being proposed and implemented. In some cases, the simple difference in location of one antenna over another in the same antenna array will result in a stronger, or weaker, received signal. Such spatial \u201cdiversity\u201d is now conventionally used to improve radio system performance and reliability. The difference in received signal strengths amongst individual antennas in an otherwise seemingly closely grouped array may result from the way reflected multipath signals arrive at each one. Smart antenna systems also are being proposed which add adaptive \u201cspatial\u201d processing to improve performance. Each antenna contributes to a weighted combination of received signals and the combination can then be input to a spatial processor which determines optimal weights for improved performance. This can even allow for more than one \u201cspatial\u201d channel to exist in a conventional (frequency, time-slot, and/or code) channel. Such multiplexing is sometimes called spatial division multiple access (SDMA). For a description of smart antenna SDMA systems that can work with more than one spatial channel per conventional channel, see, for example, co-owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,378 (issued May 7, 1996) and 5,642,353 (issued Jun. 24, 1997) entitled SPATIAL DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, Roy, III, et al., inventors, and co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,490 (issued Jan. 7, 1997) entitled SPECTRALLY EFFICIENT HIGH CAPACITY WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, Barratt, et al., inventors. For a smart antenna system that has only one spatial channel per conventional channel, see co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/729,390, filed on Oct. 11, 1996, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DECISION DIRECTED DEMODULATION USING ANTENNA ARRAYS AND SPATIAL PROCESSING, Barratt et al., inventors.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, although the present invention has been described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not to be interpreted as limiting. The present invention is useful in all communication systems in which more than one antenna is used by a single receiver or transceiver, e.g., for spatial diversity. Various alterations and modifications will no doubt become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art after having read the above disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Also, although the present invention has been described in terms of an average of signal quality measures, other statistics may be used. For example, the maximum over the period of time may be used, with any antenna whose maximum value is relatively low indicating fault. While the present invention has been described in terms of RSSI values, alternate implementations may use other signal strength or signal quality measures. Thus the term signal quality measure refers to any signal strength or signal quality measure, including RSSI and log-RSSI. See for example, above referenced and incorporated herein by reference U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/020,049 to Yun for one alternate signal quality generator. Using a measure that already is available, such as RSSI which commonly already is determined in receivers, enabled",
