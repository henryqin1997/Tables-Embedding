    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37693=Referring first to FIG. 3, coal strata No. 1, 2 and 3 are shown separated by layers of shale. Each coal stratum can be divided into one or more blocks of coal which can be subjected to one or more production phases as described herein. In FIG. 3, these blocks are identified as Blocks 1 through 9. In accordance with a preferred method, in Phase 1, carried out in coal block 7, a well 201, FIG. 1, or a plurality of such wells possibly of the type shown in FIG. 4 are subjected to gasification with the objectives of generating combustible gases, generating heat for conversion into steam, driving off coal tar mists for condensation at the surface, and converting the sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. This method is described in detail in my copending applications Ser. Nos. 510,409 filed Sept. 30, 1974 and 531,453 filed Dec. 11, 1974. The production plan calls for a reducing environment underground in the wells in block 7 and injection of an oxidizer in such a way as to prevent unplanned burning of the exit gases. In order to avoid dilution of the exit gases, the preferred oxidizer is oxygen from a conventional oxygen supply Plant 101, FIG. 1, provided for this purpose. A suitable mine pressure is selected, for example the pressure necessary to balance the hydrostatic head. Wells into coal block 7 are equipped for the purpose intended. Wells to be ignited are pumped free of water, ignition material, such as hot ceramic balls 10, are positioned in the coal strata, and oxygen is injected into the coal formation through an injection conduit 12 as the formation is set of fire. Mine pressure is stabilized by controlling oxidizer injection rates in consonance with gas withdrawal rates. The manner of ignition and stabilizing mine pressure is set forth in the aforementioned application Ser. No. 531,453. Hot exit gases are withdrawn through a heat exchanger 14, FIG. 4, installed in the well bore which is also disclosed in detail in application Ser. No. 531,453. Purified water from a conventional water treating Plant 104, FIG. 1, is circulated through the heat exchanger wherein a portion of the sensible heat in the hot exit gases is transferred to the water converting the water into steam. The steam from the heat exchanger is delivered to a conventional electrical generating Plant 105, FIG. 1, where a portion of its energy is converted into electricity. Steam is condensed in Plant 105 and the condensate is returned to the water Plant 104 to repeat the cycle., 43713=For the preferred method, in Phase 3, carried out in coal block 2, the zone is in the latter stages of an in situ gasification process having wells 203, FIG. 1, which may be similar or identical to the well 201 shown in FIG. 4, completed therein. By way of example, half of the coal in place may have been consumed, using the plan of either Phase 1 or Phase 2. Oxidizer injection is terminated and raw water injection from the water Plant 104 is begun through the injection conduit 12 previously used for oxygen injection. As an alternate, if the coal in block 2 is aquifer, mine pressure can be lowered to permit encroachment of surrounding formation water. The incandescent coal in block 2 reacts with injected water for form producer gas (H2 + CO) as described in more detail in my copending application Ser. No. 558,423 filed Mar. 14, 1976. The producer gas can be further processed to adjust the ratio of H2 to CO to form synthesis gas. Producer gas and steam are delivered to the gas clean-up Plant 103 for segregation, for use as described in Phase 5 later, or for other purposes. Phase 3 is a cool down phase that is continued until the remaining coal is cooled down to the desired temperature, for example at least as low as 800\ufffd F. Upon reaching the desired temperature, water injection is stopped and the remaining coal in block 2 is ready for liquefaction as described in Phase 5 later. If it is desirable to prolong the cool down, steam may be injected instead of water., 19179=Some prior art has dealt with fluidizing coal in situ. The preponderance of this work has been involved with in situ gasification of coal with the objective of producing combustible gases. Large scale operations were undertaken in Russia with lesser projects of shorter duration undertaken in the United States, England, Morrocco and other localities All have been plagued with problems of underground burning consuming the combustible gases before they could be delivered to the surface. All have produced low BTU gases (in the range of 85 to 300 BTU per standard cubic foot) compared to natural gas of petroleum origin containing approximately 1000 BTU per standard cubic foot. These low BTU gases, while not suited to long distance pipelining, are quite satisfactory for nearby use if the BTU content can be stabilized at a reasonably constant level., 26695=A survey of the coal research and development shows that the preponderance of effort is directed to work above ground in gasification and liquefaction. All projects are plagued with a common problem; the hydrogen deficiency of coal. To understand the magnitude of the problem, consider the manufacture of fuel gases from coal. As previously mentioned, it is well known in the art how to derive producer gas (sometimes called blue water gas) by reacting steam with incandescent carbon to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are good fuel gases, each containing slightly over 300 BTU per cubic foot. Both fall woefully short in heat values; however, when compared to natural gas of petroleum origin which contains approximately 1000 BTU per cubic foot. It is well known in the art how to upgrade producer gas into gases with higher BTU content, but if upgrading is expected to be compatible with natural gas (principally methane, CH4), makeup hydrogen is required in substantial quantities. For a typical coal to be upgraded into methane, almost three times as much hydrogen is required as is contained in the original coal. For liquefaction of coal, makeup hydrogen is also required because synthetic crude oil from coal contains approximately twice as much hydrogen as the original coal contained. Coal chemicals, however, can be extracted from raw coal without makeup hydrogen, simply by subjecting the coal to heat in the absence of air and capturing expelled gases and oozing tars., 45238=In the preferred method, in Phase 4, carried out in coal blocks 4 and 6, the gases are subjected to pyrolysis as described in my copending application Ser. No. 750,714 filed Apr. 23, 1975 with the objectives of driving off volatile matter as gases and oozing tars. This phase is begun after coal blocks 7 and 9 have been under gasification for a period of time, for example, 3 months. The gasification projects in blocks 7 and 9 have generated a substantial amount of heat underground, a portion of which has been transferred through the overlying layer of shale 16 into the coal in blocks 4 and 6. Wells 204, FIG. 1, are drilled into blocks 4 and 6 and are equipped as shown in FIG. 5, so that gases may be withdrawn and delivered to the gas clean-up Plant 103 and so that oozing tars may be collected and delivered to the distillation Plant 108. A complete description of the wells 204 as shown in FIG. 5 can be found in the aforementioned application Ser. No. 570,714. Produced gases are segregated in clean-up Plant 103 for uses as described in Phases 1 and 2 above. Produced tars are distilled into coal chemicals and solvents, with a residue of pitch. Production in Phase 4 continues as long as heat is being added or until substantially all of the volatiles are driven off. Upon completion of Phase 4, the remaining coal may be further produced by gasification as described in Phases 1 and 2 above., 28746=Referring again to producer gas generated from coal, either above ground or in situ, it is easy to understand the commercial desirability of upgrading. First is the problem of transportation. Cross country pipelines experience about the same amount of costs whether the gas transported be producer gas at 320 BTU per cubic foot or natural gas at 1000 BTU per cubic foot. It, therefore, follows that a million BTU's of producer gas at the destination will cost approximately three times as much in transportation charges as the same amount of BTU's delivered as natural gas. Second, while producer gas is an excellent fuel, it is not compatible with natural gas at the burner tip. Heating devices must be designed for one or the other, and substantial mechanical modifications normally must be made to convert from one gas to another.}",

In addition to the functions of the heat exchanger 14 described in the foregoing processes, the heat exchanger also serves a useful purpose in protecting the well bore. Referring to FIG. 4 it can be appreciated that the protective casing 30 is subjected to a substantial amount of heat from the hot exit gases, particularly in the lower part of the casing. Without the heat exchanger the casing would ultimately be heated cherry red, with resultant expansion and damage to the surrounding concrete seal. The heat exchanger removes heat from the casing area and thus prevents overheating and damage to the concrete seal. In the preferred embodiment, the scrapers 22 are in the form of elongated augers, which impart swirling motion to the exit gases and thus provide for a more efficient heat transfer to the circulating water in the heat exchanger. Referring to FIG. 7, hot exit gases from production Wells 201 and 202 (FIG. 1) contain a certain amount of paticulate matter including fly ash from the mineral matter in the coal and free carbon that was not completely consumed in the",
