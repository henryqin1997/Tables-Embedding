This suspension is injected into a peripheral vein using an injection syringe. An ultrasound emitter of an ultrasonic apparatus (Toshiba, FSH 160a, Japan) is held on the thorax of the experimental animal so that a typical cross-section through the right and left heart is obtained. As soon as the ultrasonic contrast agent reaches the right half of the heart it is possible to see on the monitor of the ultrasonic apparatus how the blood labeled by the contrast agent reaches the right atrium, then the right ventricle and subsequently leaves the heart again via the pulmonary artery. After passage through the lungs, the left half of the heart can be seen owing to the contrast agent. The ultrasonic contrast is of equal intensity before and after passage through the lungs so that it can be assumed that there is essentially complete retention of the air in the polymers and essentially loss-free transport of the microparticles to the left half of the heart., 42218=In analogy to Example 1, various polysuccinimide-co-\u03b1,\u03b2-(hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamides of, inter alia, the compositions 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 were prepared from polyanhydroaspartic acids of various molecular weights (MW=7000; about 13000; 30000) and reacted with decanoyl chloride as described in Example 4 to give the corresponding polysuccinimide-co-\u03b1,\u03b2-(nonylcarbonyloxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamides., 36485=The described process for the preparation of the ultrasonic contrast agents according to the invention can result in particle sizes in which 90% of the particles are between 0.1 \u03bcm and 15 \u03bcm. Using the spray-drying process it is possible to obtain particle size distributions in which 90% of the particles are smaller than 3 \u03bcm. Larger particles are removed by screening out, for example with a 15 \u03bcm screen fabric and/or 3 \u03bcm screen fabric. When these microparticles are used as ultrasonic contrast agents for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, particle sizes of 0.1 \u03bcm to 7 \u03bcm have proven suitable, and particle sizes of 0.1 \u03bcm to 3 \u03bcm are preferably employed. The ultrasonic contrast agents are injected, for example, into the blood circulation. Per injection, 0.1 mg to 1000 mg of the microparticles, preferably 1 mg to 100 mg, are employed., 44933=6 g of polysuccinimide-co-\u03b1,\u03b2-(hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamide (10:90) (=40 mmol of hydroxyethyl groups), prepared in analogy to Example 1 with a 1:9 molar ratio of polyanhydroaspartic acid to 2-aminoethanol, are reacted with 20 g of distilled oleyl chloride in analogy to Example 3. The heterogeneous reaction mixture becomes homogeneous on addition of dichloromethane. It is precipitated twice in methanol which is cooled to -20\ufffd C. The yellowish-colored polymer is thermoplastic., 16848=This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/690,761, filed Apr. 24, 1991, U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,928., 22692=x+y is 2 to 1000, and, 39424=Excess thionyl chloride and one drop of DMF are added to monobutyl succinate. The reaction takes place with evolution of gas. The mixture is left to stir with exclusion of moisture overnight and subsequently the excess thionyl chloride is removed by distillation under atmospheric pressure. The remaining crude product is fractionally distilled under 0.05 mbar, and the pure product is obtained at about 70\ufffd C. The characterization of the product by IR spectroscopy shows bands at 1800 cm-1 (acid chloride) and 1740 cm-1 (ester) of equal intensity.}",
