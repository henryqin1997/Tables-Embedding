    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{48050=Recently, the advantages of using underbalanced drilling, particularly in mature geological deepwater environments, have become known. Deepwater is considered to be between 3,000 to 7,500 feet deep and ultra deepwater is considered to be 7,500 to 10,000 feet deep. Rotating control heads, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,181, have provided a dependable seal between a rotating pipe and the riser while drilling operations are being conducted. U.S. Ser. No. 09/033,190, filed Mar. 2, 1998, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Drilling a Borehole Into A Subsea Abnormal Pore Pressure Environment\u201d proposes the use of a rotating control head for overbalanced drilling of a borehole through subsea geological formations. That is, the fluid pressure inside of the borehole is maintained equal to or greater than the pore pressure in the surrounding geological formations using a fluid that is of insufficient density to generate a borehole pressure greater than the surrounding geological formation's pore pressures without pressurization of the borehole fluid. U.S. Ser. No. 09/260,642, filed Mar. 2, 1999, proposes an underbalanced drilling concept of using a rotating control head to seal a marine riser while drilling in the floor of an ocean using a rotatable pipe from a floating structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,181 and Ser. Nos. 09/033,190 and 09/260,642 are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Additionally, provisional application Serial No. 60/122,350, filed Mar. 2, 1999, entitled \u201cConcepts for the Application of Rotating Control Head Technology to Deepwater Drilling Operations\u201d is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 57760=Turning to FIG. 2, the riser or upper tubular R is shown positioned above a gas handler annular blowout preventer, generally designated as GH. While a \u201cHYDRIL\u201d GH 21-2000 gas handler BOP or a \u201cHYDRIL\u201d GL series annular blowout handler could be used, ram type blowout preventers, such as Cameron U BOP, Cameron UII BOP or a Cameron T blowout preventer, available from Cooper Cameron Corporation of Houston, Tex., could be used. Cooper Cameron Corporation also provides a Cameron DL annular BOP. The gas handler annular blowout preventer GH includes an upper head 10 and a lower body 12 with an outer body or first housing 14 therebetween. A piston 16 having a lower wall 16A moves relative to the first housing 14 between a sealed position, as shown in FIG. 2, and an open position, where the piston moves downwardly until the end 16A\u2032 engages the shoulder 12A. In this open position, the annular packing unit or seal 18 is disengaged from the internal housing 20 of the present invention while the wall 16A blocks the gas handler discharge outlet 22. Preferably, the seal 18 has a height of 12 inches. While annular and ram type blowout preventers, with or without a gas handler discharge outlet, are disclosed, any seal to retractably seal about an internal housing to seal between a first housing and the internal housing is contemplated as covered by the present invention. The best type of retractable seal, with or without a gas handler outlet, will depend on the project and the equipment used in that project., 49732=It has also been known in the past to use a dual density mud system to control formations exposed in the open borehole. See Feasibility Study of a Dual Density Mud System For Deepwater Drilling Operations by Clovis A. Lopes and Adam T. Bourgoyne, Jr., \ufffd 1997 Offshore Technology Conference. As a high density mud is circulated from the ocean floor back to the rig, gas is proposed in this May of 1997 paper to be injected into the mud column at or near the ocean floor to lower the mud density. However, hydrostatic control of abnormal formation pressure is proposed to be maintained by a weighted mud system that is not gas-cut below the seafloor. Such a dual density mud system is proposed to reduce drilling costs by reducing the number of casing strings required to drill the well and by reducing the diameter requirements of the marine riser and subsea blowout preventers. This dual density mud system is similar to a mud nitrification system, where nitrogen is used to lower mud density, in that formation fluid is not necessarily produced during the drilling process., 60178=As best shown in FIGS. 2 and 7, the bearing assembly, generally designated 28, is similar to the Weatherford-Williams Model 7875 rotating control head, now available from Weatherford International, Inc. of Houston, Tex. Alternatively, Weatherford-Williams Models 7000, 7100, IP-1000, 7800, 8000/9000 and 9200 rotating control heads, now available from Weatherford International, Inc., could be used. Preferably, a rotating control head with two spaced-apart seals is used to provide redundant sealing. The major components of the bearing assembly 28 are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,181, now owned by Weatherford U.S. Holdings, Inc. The '181 patent is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Generally, the bearing assembly 28 includes a top rubber pot 30 that is sized to receive a top stripper rubber or inner member seal 32. Preferably, a bottom stripper rubber or inner member seal 34 is connected with the top seal 32 by the inner member 36 of the bearing assembly 28. The outer member 38 of the bearing assembly 28 is rotatably connected with the inner member 26, as best shown in FIG. 7, as will be discussed below in detail., 42520=This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/122,530, filed Mar. 2, 1999, entitled \u201cConcepts for the Application of Rotating Control Head Technology to Deepwater Drilling Operations,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention are illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various changes in the details of the illustrated apparatus and construction and method of operation may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Because of the deeper depths now being drilled offshore, some even in ultradeepwater, tremendous volumes of gas are required to reduce the density of a heavy mud column in a large diameter marine riser R. Instead of injecting gas into the riser R, as described in the Background of the Invention, a blowout preventer can be positioned in a predetermined location in the riser to provide the desired initial column of mud, pressurized or not, for the open borehole B since the present invention now provides a barrier between the one fluid, such as seawater, above the seal 18 of the blowout preventer, and mud M, below the seal 18. Instead of injecting gas into the riser above the seal 18, gas is injected below the seal 18 via either the choke line CL or the kill line KL, so less gas is required to lower the density of the mud column in the other remaining line, used as a mud return line. As can now also be seen, the present invention along with a blowout preventer could be used to prevent a riser from venting mud or gas onto the rig floor F of the",
