The prior art techniques as exemplified in US. Pat. No. 3,017,512, issued Jan. 16, 1962 to Wolbert, relate to reflective measurements on a specular surface; however, basic radiation-beam-formation apparatus and apparatus for the subsequent detection of reflected beam components is illustrated and described and the technique of this invention is applicable to such apparatus for eliminating interference error. In a typical prior art specular reflection arrangement, the radiation sensor or detector is positioned in geometrical relationship to the radiation source so that specularly reflected radiation will be incident to a radiation receptor surface of the sensor as these components are of much greater magnitude than any diffusely reflected components that may be present. Such an arrangement results in an interference error in the measurement because there will be a relative phase displacement between radiation components specularly reflected from the first and second surfaces. This interference error is also present in a measurement of a film having a diffuse second surface where the sensor is positioned to primarily detect specularly reflected radiation components in accordance with prior art apparatus and techniques., 9585=ilnited States Patent Brenton Sept. 19, 1972 [54] APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ELIMINATING INTERFERENCE ERRORS IN DUAL-BEAM INFRARED REFLECTION MEASUREMENTS ON A DIFFUSELY REFLECTING SURFACE BY GEOMETRICAL ELIMINATION OF INTERFERENCE-PRODUCING Muller ..356/161 Primary Examiner-James W. Lawrence Assistant ExaminerMorton J. Frome Att0rney-Cennamo, Kremblas & Foster 5 7] ABSTRACT Interference error elimination is provided for infrared reflection measurement of a film having a diffusely reflecting surface by apparatus and method which utilizes geometrical arrangement of apparatus components for geometrical selection of only diffusely reflected radiation components and elimination of specularly reflected radiation components that would produce interference error. A specific application of this measurement technique is in connection with a two-layer, sheet-form product having a film of infrared-radiation-transmissive material formed on a substrate or base layer with the interface surface being diffuse. A radiation source forms and directs two beams of infrared radiation of discrete wavelengths in angularly incident relationship toward an exposed, specular surface of the film producing reflective-components at both the specular surface and the diffuse interface surface. Only diffusely reflected components of incident beams of radiation are detected by a radiation-responsive sensor which is disposed in a particular geometrical arrangement such that only the diffusely reflected beam components are incident to a radiation receptor surface of the sensor. Thus, interference errors are eliminated as the specularly reflected beam components will not be'incident to the radiation sensors receptobsurface.}",
