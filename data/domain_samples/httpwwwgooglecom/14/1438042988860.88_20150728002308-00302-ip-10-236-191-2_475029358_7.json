    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{94889=Classification engines 306 function to classify the VoIP traffic that enters the VoIP processor by extracting various fields from the VoIP packets. In an embodiment, VoIP processor has one or more pre-processed classification tables 307. When a packet arrives, classification engines 306 examine values of packet header fields such as the protocol field, the source and destination IP address fields, and the source and destination port fields. A table look-up is made for the extracted fields in the classification tables 307, which yields a tag value for each packet. The VoIP packets are tagged accordingly. Switching circuitry 302 also may use the resulting tags to forward the VoIP packets to other components in the system. In one embodiment, classification engines 306 may also examine the Type of Service field and DSCP value. Relevant packets that have been classified into a pre-identified protocol such as Q.931, H.245 or SIP also may be parsed to obtain other relevant parameter values. Such parameter values may include lower level protocol port values, such as the port numbers that are negotiated in the Q.931 protocol for use in an associated H.245 stream. Other parameter values include the caller identifier, called number, type of codec, etc. Such deeper protocol parsing can be done either by the host processor or a network processor., 118428=In one embodiment, RTP aggregation application 414 ensures a prescribed limit on the induced latency. For example, RTP streams are partitioned based on certain criteria including the destination subnet of the RTP stream, and the codec of the RTP stream. When the first packet of a trunk arrives at VoIP processor 300, a timer may be started. The timer is set to expire at an allowed maximum value of latency. The allowed maximum value of latency may be user-selected. As packets continue to arrive at VoIP processor 300, the packets are aggregated either when the number of packets reach a pre-selected number or when the timer expires., 117459=Using RTP aggregation application 414, VoIP processor 300 aggregates a number of calls to share the \u201ccost\u201d of headers between packets belonging to different calls. RTP aggregation application 414 uses compression algorithms that use general protocol parsing techniques for tracking calls, maintaining the state of calls, identifying codecs, etc. A detailed description of an example aggregation algorithm is provided in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/775,214, filed Jan. 31, 2001, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Call Aggregation,\u201d by named inventors S. Mohaban et al., the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Using RTP aggregation application 414, VoIP processor 300 causes a substantial bandwidth reduction, while improving other aspects of the network behavior, such as reducing the load on routers and improving the behavior of queues., 108480=Transcoding routine 462 is called to cause the coder/decoder used by VoIP processor 300 to carry voice or fax media to change in real time (on the fly). For example, transcoding routine 462 may be called when the two endpoints of a call do not support the same codec types., 139342=RTP packets that are dropped or lost on the way from the sender endpoint to the receiver endpoint can result in a severe reduction in the audible quality of a call. The human ear is sensitive to such loss and even a loss of a fraction of the packets can lead to an unacceptable quality, depending on the actual codec that is in use. However, most of a lost RTP packet can be recovered and reconstructed based on various extrapolation techniques. Such techniques can work on either compressed voice media packets, or on uncompressed analog voice information. However, most endpoints do not have the CPU power or sufficient programmed intelligence to be able to recover such lost packets., 116770=Most VoIP gateways send a stream of small packets for each call. Each such packet carries approximately 80% of redundant data (packet headers) versus 20% of actual media encoding. Thus, this stream of many small packets effectively reduces the available bandwidth. Using unique call aggregation and compression techniques, VoIP processor 300 can increase the number of calls issued for a given bandwidth significantly, e.g., by a factor of 2 to 5. An example of a header compression technique is further described in RFC 2508. Header compression techniques may be used in conjunction with RTP compression techniques to improve bandwidth utilization., 74209=This application claims domestic priority from prior U.S. Provisional application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Further, the VoIP processor provides a flexible voice PEP with a set of voice PDP applications controlling the primitives. This architecture allows for very efficient primitive implementation and enables external applications containing the actual logic to be developed and deployed rapidly on top of it. Another benefit of the VoIP processor is its focus on voice traffic rather than on general data traffic. The primitives are structured specifically for voice applications. Beneficially, the VoIP processor provides abstraction of underlying protocols. Specifically, the VoIP processor can hide from the applications the details that are protocol specific, thus creating an abstraction layer. The abstraction allows applications to focus on the specific logic that they implement rather than on non-important details. Such abstraction can scale to new protocols as they evolve over time. A VoIP processor, primitive function software elements, and associated application programs are disclosed herein. In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. 5. CONCLUSION The received code may be executed by processor 804 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 810, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In",
