    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23083=As shown in FIG. 2, the painter 27 is roller painting a wall at a location remote from the paint pump 28. Paint is supplied by the pump from the reservoir 29 through a hose 31 and the handle 32 of the roller to the roller cover 33. Such a system is generally shown in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,011, as a safety measure. The original application Ser. No. 218,354, filed Dec. 22, 1980, and from which that patent issued, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, included a disclosure of a remote control transmitter in the paint roller handle, and a receiver generally adjacent the paint pump such as at 34 in FIG. 2 herein, and which controlled the paint pump motor 172. Therefore, FIG. 2 herein shows the radio antenna symbol 11 associated with the wrist transmitter, and the radio antenna symbol 36 at the receiver 34, whereby the receiver can turn the pump on and off in response to signals received from the transmitter 11 herein mounted to the wrist of the painter. The receiver is tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter., 17139=Painting systems having the paint supplied to the applicator under pressure, are known. There are a number of patents which disclose the use of a pump to pump paint from a reservoir to an applicator. Among these are patents which show a valve at the handle of a paint roller to control the paint supplied to the roller. An example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,231,668 issued to Groth et al. on Nov. 4, 1980. It shows a paint control valve on the roller handle to pinch the hose 19. A pump stop switch 22 is provided adjacent the pump. A different type of control is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,457,017 issued July 22, 1969 to J. W. Bastian. That patent discloses the idea of an electrically-powered paint pump controlled by a manually operable switch 24 on the roller handle and wired to the pump to turn it on and off. U.S. Pat. No. 4,422,789 issued Dec. 27, 1983 to Charney et al. discloses a motor-driven paint pump supplying paint to a roller assembly. A switch 84 is mounted to the roller handle and wired to a pump and operable to turn the pump on and off. Shio U.S. Pat. No. 3,960,229 issued June 1, 1976 shows remote control of a ship hull painting carriage. Remote control by radio control is mentioned as a possibility in one sentence at the end of column 5. There is a U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,011, issued Jan. 4, 1984, based on an original application by me and my co-inventors and which disclosed radio operated remote control of a pump in a power painting system, with the radio transmitter and control for it being mounted on the roller handle. Although that control was significant in terms of added convenience of painting, the present invention is a further and significant step toward added convenience.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. It should be noted that, in the claims hereinafter, the term \"digit\" means one of the five fingers of a hand. It should be apparent that the present invention provides for convenient control of a paint pump from a location remote from the pump, and it materially simplifies the paint applicator handle. While shown and described as turning a pump on and off, the present invention is contemplated as applicable to control of material flow or pressure in other ways such as by valve control, or other pump mode control such as pump speed or direction control, or a combination thereof. If multiple functions or modes are to be controlled, additional switch buttons may be used, or specific operating sequences developed for particular control functions to be performed. The wearing of the switch on a ring or clip is shown and described as the preferred embodiment. The switch might also be attached to the person by other means such as adhesive tape or in a glove or otherwise. Also, it is conceivable that equipment miniaturization",
