A connector surrounds the anti-reflux valve on the outside of the bulb and a combination cap and latch is secured to the connector. A separate collection bag such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,141 issued Nov. 5, 1985, may be latched onto the bulb evacuator in fluid communication with the anti-reflux valve so that when the bulb evacuator is squeezed to displace fluid contained in the bulb evacuator, it passes through the anti-reflux valve and into the separate collection chamber. The bulb may be squeezed until it is completely evacuated and the bulb anti-reflux valve prevents the fluid from re-entering the bulb and prevents sucking in air into the bulb and maintains the bulb in a collapsed suction activated state so that only fluid entering the bulb from the closed wound drain will allow the bulb to expand. The collection bag is then removed from the bulb evacuator and capped for disposal. A sterile replacement collection bag is then attached to the collapsed bulb which has remained collapsed due to the anti-reflux valve in the bulb. During the replacement procedure the anti-reflux valve also helps prevent exogenous bacteria that are in the air from being sucked back into the unit. Thus, according to the present invention a completely closed system is provided for removing fluids from a closed wound and passing the fluids into a bulb evacuator and for reusing the bulb evacuator by displacing the fluids collected from the bulb evacuator into a separate collection bag.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Fluid from the closed wound flows through the drain tubes and inlets 20 and 21, through the one-way valve 23 and into the bulb 10. When emptying and reactivation of the bulb is desired, the collection bag as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,141 is unrolled, the bulb is compressed to expel the contents from the bulb through the anti-reflux valve 20 and into the collection bag. The collection bag is then removed by releasing the latches through the tube, capped for measurement and disposal. The sterile replacement collection bag is placed onto the sleeve of the bulb. A bulb will remain in the collapsed state during the removal and replacement of the collection bag due to the anti-reflux valve 12. The anti-reflux valve 12 prevents the reflux of air from the outside back into the bulb when the bulb is being emptied even if the user temporarily releases the bulb. The user is able to squeeze the unit until it completely evacuated and the bulb anti-reflux valve prevents it from rebounding and sucking in air or fluid which may contain exogenous bacteria. The anti-reflux valve also prevents exogenous bacteria that are in the air from being sucked back into the bulb.
