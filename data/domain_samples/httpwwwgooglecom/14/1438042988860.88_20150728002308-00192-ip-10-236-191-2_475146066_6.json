Techniques for forming electrodes on a surface using laser ablation are known. See, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/411,940, filed Oct. 4, 1999, and entitled \u201cLASER DEFINED FEATURES FOR PATTERNED LAMINATES AND ELECTRODE\u201d, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, electrodes 14, 16 are created by removing the electrical conductor 13 from an area extending around the electrodes to form a gap of exposed support substrate 12. Therefore, electrodes 14, 16 are isolated from the rest of the electrically-conductive material on substrate 12 by a gap having a width of about 25 \u03bcm to about 500 \u03bcm, preferably the gap has a width of about 100 \u03bcm to about 200 \u03bcm. Alternatively, it is appreciated that electrodes 14, 16 may be created by laser ablation alone on substrate 12. It is appreciated that while laser ablation is the preferred method for forming electrodes 14, 16 given its precision and sensitivity, other techniques such as lamination, screen-printing, or photolithography may be used in accordance with this disclosure.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to a preferred embodiment, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of the invention, on as described and defined in the following claims. In addition, the biosensor 210 will make contact with electronics of the meter, which determines the resistance between the interconnected pads. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the meter will determine which pads exist on the biosensor 210, and the resistance of the interconnected pads 260. The information can be stored in the meter as described above with reference to biosensors 10 and 110. In use, when the user inserts biosensor 210 into the meter (not shown), the biosensor 210 makes contact to the connector and the electronics of the meter inquire as to how many pads 260 are showing continuity. Information related to this continuity is similar to that previously described with reference to biosensor 110. While pattern 240 illustratively includes nine generally square-shaped pads that are interconnected, it is appreciated that the pattern 240 can take on any number of shapes and patterns in accordance with this disclosure, which would give various resistance levels. These differing resistance levels can be correlated to a reagent lot. For example, the pattern 240 can be varied by disconnecting the internal links between the pads 260. This disconnection can be done, for example, by a laser. By changing the number of",
