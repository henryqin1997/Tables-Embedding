    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. Generally, a femur is prepared to accept the femoral component 650 by first removing the distal end of the femur and then reaming and chiseling a portion of the femur to accept the box 656. When the top 662 of the box 656 includes a radius, the chiseling and reaming is substantially reduced and lessened when compared to the preparation necessary for a box that is substantially square or has sharper angles at the corners of the box. Therefore, the box 656 with the radius top 662 can decrease the amount of surgical time required to prepare the femur for implantation of the femoral component 650. In addition, it reduces the amount of bone that must be removed to accept the femoral component 650. Moreover, by removing a smaller portion of bone in the resection of the femur there is more bone over which the load, especially a side load, may be distributed. In addition, the rounded resection does not create stress corners which concentrate stress when a side load is applied to the femur. Nevertheless, the",
