With reference to FIG. 6, an alternative embodiment of the guide pin mount and is shown. In this embodiment, guide pin mount 116 has a pair of circular holes 118 therethrough to receive guide pins 120 that has a constant cross-section between tapered ends, that is, there is no reduced diameter snap portion. In such embodiment, the pins are inserted through holes 118 and then are secured in place by suitable means, for example, welding. The distance between opposed shoulders 104a, b on guide pin 92 is slightly greater than thickness T of guide pin mount 86 to allow for some float of pins 92 in cut-out 106 in the z-axis as well as accommodate any angular cocking of guide pin 92 within cut-out 106. The various floating fits of components of the present invention are allowable because the crucial alignment mechanism of two opposed connectors is the relative locations of guide pin holes 50a, b on large end face 44. As long as ends 94 and 96 of guide pin 93 find the guide pin holes in opposed large end faces, the connectors will align with",
