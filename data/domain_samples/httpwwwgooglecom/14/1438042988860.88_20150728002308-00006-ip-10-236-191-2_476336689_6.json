Comparing to U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,072 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,973,403, when the upper and lower chips of the packages disclosed therein are of the same type, the bonding pads on the upper and lower chips have a common address assignment. Thus, address assignment of the bonding pads on the upper and lower chips in U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,072 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,973,403 mirror each other thereby requiring a quite complicated circuit layout on the substrate to electrically interconnect the upper and lower chips. On the contrary, according to the present invention, the chips 210, 230 are both oriented face up (with their bonding pads up with respect to the substrate 260) for bonding to the substrate 260. Thus, address assignment of the bonding pads on the chips 210, 230 conforms to each other. Consequently, circuit layout on the upper and lower surfaces of the substrate 260 can use substantially the same design wherein common conductive traces on the upper and lower surfaces of the substrate 260 are electrically connected by plated through holes 261. Comparing to the stacked chip package of FIG. 1 and the multichip stacked device of FIG. 2, the chip 230",
