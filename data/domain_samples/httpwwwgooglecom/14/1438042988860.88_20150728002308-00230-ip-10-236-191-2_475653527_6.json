The apparatus 100 includes a drum 110 rotating about an axis 114 and having a surface speed V1. The drum 110 is glycol cooled to provide a cooled external surface 112. The temperature of the cooled external surface is maintained between 0\ufffd C. and 5\ufffd C. For orientation purposes, the drum 110 has a first quadrant 111 a between 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock, a second quadrant 111 b between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock, a third quadrant 111 c between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock, and a fourth quadrant 111 d between 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59500=The plurality of elastic strands 23 is preferably made of a resiliently elastic thermoplastic material. The elastic strands may be made from liquid elastic that can be extruded through a die to achieve a desired strand elastic diameter and/or shape. The elastic strands are preferably styrene block copolymers, polyurethane or latex rubber having a diameter ranging between about 0.15 mm and about 0.5 mm and a density ranging from about 600 kg/m3 to about 1250 kg/m3., 23875=Elastomeric nonwoven laminates typically include elastic bonded to a nonwoven. The elastic may include elastic film or elastic strands, however, elastic strands are generally preferred over elastic films since strands require less material and provide flexibility in arrangement and stretch properties. In one such laminate, a plurality of elastic strands is joined to a nonwoven while the plurality of strands is in a stretched condition so that when the elastic strands relax, the nonwoven gathers between the locations where it is bonded to the elastic strands forming corrugations. The resulting laminate is stretchable to the extent that the corrugations allow the elastic to elongate. Such a laminate is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,415 to Vander Wielen, et al., issued Jan. 19, 1988., 38039=The apparatus 100 includes an extruder 120 for extruding a molten stream of elastomeric polymer. The extruder 120 extrudes the molten stream of polymer through a plurality of nozzles 122 forming a plurality of elastic strands 23 that flow in parallel alignment onto the cooled surface 112 of the rotating drum 110. Preferably, the elastic strands are extruded onto the cooled surface 112 of the drum 110 such that the distance between any two adjacent strands ranges between about 1 mm and about 3 mm. More preferably, the distance between any two adjacent strands is about 1.5 mm. The extruder 120 is mounted between the first and fourth quadrants 111 a, 111 d and deposits the plurality of strands 23 onto the cooled surface 112 of the drum 110 near 12:00 o'clock.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention. All documents cited herein are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. Although the first nonwoven 21, second nonwoven 24 and plurality of elastic strands 23 have been described as adhesively bonded, they may be joined by any joining means known in the art. Some examples of suitable joining means and/or methods for joining include, but are not limited to, adhesives, cohesives, thermal bonding, pressure bonding, mechanical bonds, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency bonds and/or any combination of any known methods of joining such materials. The plurality of elastic strands 23 is preferably made of a resiliently elastic thermoplastic material. The elastic strands may be made from liquid elastic that can be extruded through a die to achieve a desired strand elastic diameter and/or shape.
