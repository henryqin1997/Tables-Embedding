In this case, therefore, the number of the light-emitting diodes mounted is 1920\ufffd1080\ufffd (the number of the three types of light-emitting diodes, i.e., the red light-emitting diode, the green light-emitting diode, and the blue light-emitting diode, which constitute one pixel) and is thus about 6,000,000. Therefore, as a method for mounting such a vast number of light-emitting diodes on a display substrate, there is a method of forming a light-emitting diode array of a size smaller than a screen size and successively mounting light-emitting diodes on a display substrate from the light-emitting diode array while shifting the positions, i.e., a step transfer method (step mounting method)., 73160=Such a step transfer method is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2004-273596 and 2004-281630. In a technique disclosed in these patent application publications, basically, elements are buried in an adhesive layer formed on a surface of a transfer substrate so that the elements partially project from the substrate, and then buried deeply in the adhesive layer using a roller or the like (refer to, for example, paragraphs [0045] to [0048] of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-273596 and paragraphs [0038] and [0046] of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-281630).}",

In this configuration, for example, when the first, second, and third connection portions 124, 224, and 324 are formed, an allowance may be obtained for the distances between these connection portions 124, 224, and 324 and the fourth connection portions 424. Therefore, short-circuiting may be securely prevented from occurring between these connection portions 124, 224, and 324 and the fourth connection portions 424. This modified example may be applied to the other embodiments.
