The conditions in the HAVING clause of query Q, denoted by GConds(Q), consists of a Boolean combination of built-in predicates formed using columns in Groups(Q), aggregation columns of the form AGG(Y) where Y is in Cols(Q), and constants. In the example of query Qe, Conds(Qe) is B=C, and GConds(Qe) is SUM(D)>1000., 96879=Conds' is the same as Conds(Q4), i.e., P1 =PI1 &Y1 =1995 since no conditions are enforced in V4., 67326=Condition C1 302 and the first part of condition C4 308 essentially guarantee that the view is multiset equivalent to its image under \u03c6: these are a reformulation of the conditions presented in S. Chaudhuri and M. Y. Vardi, \"Optimization of real conjunctive queries\", In Proc. ACM PODS, 1993 for testing equivalence of conjunctive queries under the multiset semantics. Note that the 1-1 mapping is necessary because of the multiset semantics, whereas a many-to-1 mapping would suffice in the case of sets. Condition C4 308 ensures that constraints not enforced in the view can still be enforced in the query when the view is used, since they do not refer to columns that are projected out in the view and hence are no longer available. Conditions C2 304 and C3 306 ensure that the view does not project out any columns that are required in the SELECT clause of the query., 32236=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/024,635, filed Aug. 27, 1996., 70951=Assume that the telephone company maintains call data for December 1995 as the view V2 below:, 82881=Assume that the telephone company maintains detailed call data for 1995, for calls whose charge exceeds $1, as the view V3 below:, 37515=Recently, the problem of using materialized aggregation views to answer aggregation queries using a purely transformational approach has been considered in A. Gupta, V. Harinarayan, and D. Quass, \"Aggregate-query processing in data warehousing environments\", Proc. VLDB, 1995. They perform syntactic transformations on the operator tree representation of the query such that the definition of the view would be identical to a sub part of the definition of the query. Additional information of queries involving aggregation have been proposed. The transformational approach is more restrictive than our semantic approach. For example, these techniques would neither determine the usability of view V1 in evaluating query Q1 in Example 1.1, nor the usability of view V1 ' in evaluating Q1 in the same example. Also, no formal guarantees of completeness are provided., 86767=Consider the telephone company database from Example 1. The following query Q4 can be used to determine the total earnings of various calling plans as well as the maximum charge under each calling plan in 1995., 51044=Assuming that the telephone company is interested in determining calling plans that have earned more than a million dollars in one of the years between 1990 and 1995. The following SQL query Q1 may be used for this purpose:, 38453=A related problem is studied in A. Gupta, I. S. Mumick, and K. A. Ross. \"Adapting materialized views after redefinitions\", In Proc. ACM SIGMOD, 1995. They assume that a materialized view may be redefined, and investigate how to adapt the materialization of the view to reflect the redefinition. This problem is clearly a special case of the one we study., with the additional assumptions that the system knows the type of modification that took place, that the new view definition is \"close\" to the old definition, and that the view materialization may be modified., 81920=Consider again the telephone company database from Example 1.1. The following query Q3 can be used to determine, for each customer, the maximum charge for a single call under the calling plan \"TrueUniverse\" in December 1995, provided the charge exceeds $10., 100382=The rewriting algorithm takes these additional refinements of the conditions of usability into account. Specifically, step S3 a 1006 determines a GConds' in addition to Conds', using GConds(V) and GConds(Q) (resulting from the preprocessing step). Steps S4 a 1008 and S5 a 1010 are augmented to compute aggregation columns appearing in GConds(Q) in addition to those appearing in Sel(Q)., 54300=View V1 can still be used to evaluate query Q1, However, not all the table in Q1 can be computed using V1 ': the summary information computation for 1990 would have to access the Calls table, and the rewritten query Q1 \": involves a UNION ALL., 70096=Consider the telephone company database from Example 1. The following query Q2 can be used to determine the total earnings of each calling plan as well as the total number of calls charged under each calling plan in December 1995., 97365=Consider again the telephone database from Example 1.1. The following Q6 can be used to determine the total earnings of various calling plans in 1995, considering only calls whose charge exceeds $1., 94610=If conditions C1 a -C4 a 902-908 are satisfied, the rewritten query Q' is obtained from Q by applying algorithm AggViewSingleBlock, presented in FIG. 10. Steps S1 a 1002,S2 a 1004,S3 a 1006 are similar to steps S1 402, S2 404 and S3 406 of algorithm ConjViewSingleBlock. Steps S4 a 1008 and S5 a 1010 deal with the various kinds of aggregation that may occur in the view and the query., 52385=View V1 can be used to evaluate the query Q1 by joining V1 with the table Calling-- Plans, collapsing multiple groups corresponding to the monthly plan earnings into annual plan earnings, and enforcing the additional conditions to get the summaries of plans earning more than a million dollars in one of the years between 1990 and 1995. The rewritten query Q1 that uses V1 is:, 35600=Caching of previous query results was explored in T. Sellis, \"Intelligent caching and indexing techniques for relational database systems\", Information Systems, pp. 175-188, 1988, as a means of supporting stored procedures. This corresponds to using materialized views when they match syntactically a sub-expression of the query. In the ADMS optimizer, subquery expressions corresponding to nodes in the query execution (operator) tree were also cached. A cached result was matched against a new query by using common expression analysis. Grouping and aggregation issued were not addressed.}",

There is a 1-1 column mapping from V7 to Q7, Sel(V7) contains all the columns required in Sel(Q7), and the conditions enforced by the WHERE clauses are identical. Even through COUNT(T2) has the required multiplicity information, this information cannot be used in an SQL query to \"replicate\" the tuples in V7 the appropriate number of times.
