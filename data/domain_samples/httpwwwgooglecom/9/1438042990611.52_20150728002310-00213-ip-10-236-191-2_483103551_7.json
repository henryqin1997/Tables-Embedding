    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27398=The present invention is particularly adapted to restoring communication between nodes that terminate a failed link in a high-speed transport system, such as the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) prescribed by American National Standard, ANSI T1.105-1988, \"Digital Hierarchy Optical Interface Rates and Formats Specification,\" 10 Mar. 1988. Such a network may normally be a fiber optic arrangement comprising broadband digital cross-connect systems (DCS) connecting network links at the STS-1 level (Synchronous Transport Signal level 1, 51.84M bit/s). Since the network will not uncommonly be utilized in applications, such a broadband ISDN, requiring multiple STS-1 bands, it is of particular advantage that the present network recovery procedure is designed to locate the restoration path, or paths if necessary, having the largest contiguous bandwidth to thereby economically restore the interrupted service., 25768=One such recovery system which relies upon centralized management to reconfigure a network around a failure is described by Hasegawa et al. in \"Dynamic Reconfiguration of Digital Cross-Connect Systems with Network Control and Management,\" Proc. of Global Communications Conference, November 1987. While such a centralized method can recover from individual logical switch problems as well as physical link failures, the extensive communication necessary between the control and operating elements of the system taxes available facilities and extends response time to as much as thirty minutes. On the other hand, a distributed recovery method, such as discussed by Grover in \"The Selfhealing Network: A Fast Distributed Restoration Technique for Networks Using Digital Cross-Connect Machines,\" Proc. of Global Communication Conference, November 1987, with its inherent parallel processing achieves significantly higher response times, yet it suffers from message overloading due to the uncontrolled \"flooding\" (see Stallings, \"Data and Computer Communications,\" Macmillan, 1985, pp. 256-261) employed in intrasystem message propagation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus disclosed the invention, we anticipate that other embodiments will be apparent from the foregoing description to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such embodiments are likewise to be considered within the scope of the invention as set out in the following appended claims. The failure recovery process of the present invention has the ability of uniting the distributed intelligence of digital cross-connect systems to autonomously restore SONET communications in near real time with economical use of available facilities. The key advantage of the procedure is its ability to intelligently use surviving connectivities and spare bandwidth to respond to a variety of failure situations, including multiple link failures. Unlike the uncontrolled flooding of previous distributed network restoration procedures, the selective message broadcasting of the present process enables cross-connect facilities to achieve fast response times with minimal message transmission and the avoidance of congestion delays. This critical distinction is readily apparent in FIG. 9 which shows the comparative message generation resulting, at 901, from earlier unlimited flooding procedures and, at 902, from the selective broadcasting employed in the present invention. Whereas the present process is self-limiting in its use of the network switching and transmission facilities, prior methods propagate restoration request messages at an exponential rate that quickly saturates the network and prevents effective failure recovery. In common network arrangements the several fibers connecting one node to another may be situated within a single conduit.",
