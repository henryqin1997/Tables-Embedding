The resultant of handling flimsy material in this manner is a localized mass of balled-up tape positioned in direct proximity of the entrance to the reservoir. Eventually a jam will occur where the tape back feeds and wraps around the rollers of the cover tape drive system, thus jamming the mechanism and preventing additional cover tape from being pushed into the reservoir. In a 3M Technical Bulletin dated November 2001 entitled \u201cPrevention of Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Cover Tape Jamming in Feeders with Nip Gear and/or Collection Bins Systems\u201d there is disclosed an arrangement of two or more rollers that fold the edges of the cover tape, along the longitudinal sides of the cover tape, back onto themselves and thereby encapsulate the PSA therebetween. However it is notable that this process also produces a 2-ply cover tape resulting in a substantial increase in column strength and thickness. This approach works well in isolating the PSA, and provides rigidity to assists in the pushing of the cover tape into the reservoir. However, upon further analysis, it was discovered that this added stiffness of the cover tape may actually limit the ability for the tape to freely flow within the reservoir due to the lack of compliance of the cover tape within the confined perimeter of the reservoir. Preferably, upon the tape exiting the drive mechanism and just entering the reservoir, it would be advantageous to have the thin film respond as if it were again in a \u201cliquid state\u201d, that is to say, the cover tape should preferably react within the cover tape drive gears as a rigid member and then experience a change in state upon entering the reservoir, whereas the tape should desirably respond as if it was being \u201cpoured\u201d into the reservoir cavity, thus reducing voids or air pockets within the reservoir. Accordingly, the present invention discloses a unique process whereby the cover tape drive gears corrugate the cover tape and thus provide for an unanticipated improvement in packing density., 23506=\u201cREVOLVING COVER TAPE RESERVOIR FOR A COMPONENT FEEDER,\u201d David Lyndaker et al., application Ser. No. 10/042,601, filed Jan. 9, 2002.(abandoned).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In recapitulation, the present invention is a method and apparatus for the efficient containment of spent cover tape by improving the means by which the tape is presented to a reservoir that has a geometric shaped tuned to the free flow of the cover tape. The objective to provide a higher cover tape packing density within the same reservoir is accomplished and monitored in accordance with the present invention. It is, therefore, apparent that there has been provided a component tape feeder having a high density cover tape reservoir and fullness monitor in accordance with the present invention. While this invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims. ). It will be appreciated that this surface texture on one or more reservoir surfaces may be achieved by surface treatments such as sand blasting or peening, as well as various non-randomized machining operations. Additionally, it is possible to chemically erode one or more of the reservoir inner surfaces or mold a pattern thereon to alter the finish so as to reduce the surface contact area with the cover tape.
