This embodiment is related with the case of reading bar codes. However, needless to say, the present invention is also applicable to cases of reading optically readable letters, mark cards or the like. If the control unit 24 recognizes the desired parameters necessary for image processing and registers them in an internal register (in step S48), the control unit 24 outputs a notification signal to the buzzer 25 (in step S49). Thus, the buzzer 25 sounds and the operator becomes aware that the prescribed parameters are reliably registered in the control unit 24. If the buzzer 25 does not sound, it can be determined that an error occurs in reading of the bar code, and the operator uses again the image scanner 2 to trace the bar code, so that the parameters can be read. Even in case where the buzzer 25 sounds after the parameters have been registered, a desired image could not be obtained, if the formats or the like of the parameters are changed In such a case, a reset signal is supplied by using the reset key 12f",
