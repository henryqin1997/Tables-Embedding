Furthermore, it should be remarked that the hydraulic cylinder 12 and the wedge mechanism with the elements 14, 15, 18 and 19 could also be provided on the opposite side of the common bearing 3, i.e. between the fixedly mounted ends 9 and 5 of the scissor arms and the common bearing 3. Still the placement at the loose or moving ends of the scissor arms is preferred because this contributes to the stability of the lifting table. In the construction as shown the connections 20, 21 between the hydraulic cylinder 12 and the cross-bars 13 and 14 are constructed as pivotable links, while the connection between the sleeve 15 and the scissor arm is a slide bearing only. Between the scissor arm 1 and the sleeve 15 there may, in particular on the lower side of the scissor arm, be provided a lining of a suitable bearing material, for example bearing nylon or PTFE which may then be replaced when it is worn out. In order to make it possible by means of the hydraulic cylinder 12 to swing the scissor arms out of",
