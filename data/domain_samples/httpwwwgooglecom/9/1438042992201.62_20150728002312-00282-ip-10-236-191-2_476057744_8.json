    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations By now it should be appreciated that there has been provided a novel way to fabricate optical interconnect for electronic modules. Attaching a semiconductor die to the end of an optical fiber and utilizing a removable cover to position the fiber assembly on a circuit board provides a simple, low cost technique for providing optical interconnect. Complicated optical alignment mechanisms are eliminated thereby reducing the cost of optical interconnect. Large tolerance electrical contacts are used to couple the optics to the electronics thereby providing coupling that is easily removed and reconnected. The invention has a variety of system applications including use in telephone central office switching systems, communication networks, clock distribution networks within a computer system, interconnection of parallel computer systems, and others. Electronics required to operate optical semiconductor die 13, such as drivers for optical emitters and amplifiers for optical detectors, could be mounted in cover 19. Electronics that are mounted in cover 19 couple to means for electrical connection 24 replacing coupling between optical assembly 10 and means for electrical connection 24. In the preferred embodiment, means for aligning 22 is formed by a three sided rectangle that projects from inside cover 19 and forms a slot that aligns optical assembly 10. Sides 26 guide optical assembly 10, while end 27 provides a stop that controls penetration of optical assembly 10 into cover 19. An adhesive or press fit is used to secure optical",
