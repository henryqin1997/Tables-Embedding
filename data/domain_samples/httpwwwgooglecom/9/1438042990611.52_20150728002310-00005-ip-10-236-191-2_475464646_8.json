Nos. 2,713,822 and 3,744,611 use the electric ink transfer paper (electric ink transfer recording material) comprising three layers such as insulating layer, electrically conductive layer and ink layer. (ii) Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 7246/1978 uses the electric ink transfer paper comprising two layers such as metal powder dispersed electric layer (metal powder dispersed conductive layer) and ink layer. These hitherto proposed recording systems using electric ink transfer recording materials comprise applying electricity in a ribbon for generating Joule's heat therein, melting the ink contained in an ink layer by Joule's heat, and transferring the melted ink to a sheet to be recorded. However, these electric ink transfer recording materials are defective in that said Joule's heat softens the substrate contacting the electrode needle (recording electrode needle) and scrapes off part of the substrate, and this scraped-off substrate part adheres onto the surface of the electrode needle, whereby the travelling faculty of the electrode needle is deteriorated, in other words the normal recording operation is hampered., 20742=The ink sheet used in the method according to the present invention, as previously stated, is one designed to generate Joule's heat when electrified and have a thermo-melting ink layer. Accordingly, the recording materials disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,713,822 and 3,744,611 in the preceding (i) and the recording material disclosed in Japanese Laid-open No. 7246/1978 in the preceding (ii) may be regarded as the objects of the method according to the present invention., 33192=Polycarbonate resin having a softening point of 230\ufffd C.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Recording was carried out under the voltage impressing conditions such as 200 V and 1 m sec using a commercially available electrically anisotropic base-having electric ink transfer sheet (namely, an electric ink transfer recording paper comprising an electrically anisotropic base consisting of a resin and copper powder dispersed therein and a thin paper superimposed thereon, said thin paper being impregnated with an electrically conductive substance) and omitting the step of coating silicone oil to find that an ink transfer image formed on plain paper was of a high density such as 1.2-1.3, but the dot shape was out of order and discharge pattern-like. When the recording conditions (voltage impressing conditons) were lowered to 100 V and 1 m sec, it was observed that the image density was lowered to 0.8 and further the dot shape was amorphous and out of order. Comparative Example 2 The surface of the ink sheet which had been recorded under the voltage impressing conditions such as 250 V and 1 m sec was observed to find that melted traces greater than the diameter of said multistylus were left thereon and further the ink was attached to part of the multistylus. Electric ink transfer recording was carried out using the ink sheet prepared according to the above example and omitting the step of coating silicone oil to find that the electric contact between the recording needle (multistylus) and the ink",
