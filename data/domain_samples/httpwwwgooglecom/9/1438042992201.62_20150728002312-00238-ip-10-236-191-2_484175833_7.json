First, a content owner (such as studio) requests use of the BCA on their DVDs. Based on request, the replicator (examples include WAMO, Panasonic, Nimbus, Technicolor, Pioneer, Crest) adds unique BCA number to every DVD. Adding BCA number to each DVD requires a special (YAG) laser. This may be the very last step in the manufacturing process. The BCA numbers for a specific DVD must then be entered into InterActual's BCA database. Information to track includes: DVD title, i.e. \u201cLost in Space\u201d; BCA #/range, i.e. 12345687890; and Shipping Packaging/Tracking Container, i.e. Box 52221 to Hollywood Video., 67740=Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Bemers-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)., 31841=Further details concerning technical aspects of multicasting may be found in the Internet documents Request for Comments (RFC) 1112 and 1458 which are reproduced at Appendices A and B of the Savetz book and in D. P. Brutaman et al., \u201cMBONE provides Audio and Video Across the Internet,\u201d IEEE Computer, Vol. 27, No. 4, pp. 30\u201336 (April 1994), all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 100021=In operation 1000, a type of the playback devices of the client apparatuses is first identified. Such \u201ctype\u201d may refer to a make, model, or any other distinguishing characteristic of the particular playback devices. A command associated with the identified type of the playback device is then looked up in a look-up table. Note operation 1002. Such table may be located at the host server, or at any other location such as the client apparatuses., 39052=A standard referred to as Digital Video Interactive (DVI) format developed by Intel Corporation is a compression and storage format for full-motion video and high-fidelity audio data. The DVI standard uses interframe compression techniques similar to that of the MPEG standard and uses ADPCM compression for audio data. The compression method used in DVI is referred to as RTV 2.0 (real time video), and this compression method is incorporated into Intel's AVK (audio/video kernel) software for its DVI product line. IBM has adopted DVI as the standard for displaying video for its Ultimedia product line. The DVI file format is based on the Intel i750 chipset and is supported through the Media Control Interface (MCI) for Windows. Microsoft and Intel jointly announced the creation of the DV MCI (digital video media control interface) command set for Windows 3.1 in 1992.}",
