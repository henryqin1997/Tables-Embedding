A cathode paste was prepared which consisted of 33% Ag3 O powder, 33% carbon powder and 33% weak (1%) sulfuric acid solution. The paste was placed into a cathode cavity shown schematically in FIG. 6. The membrane/anode composite was placed in contact with the cathode paste such that the cathode and anode were on opposite sides. Total membrane area was about 1 square centimeter. The cell assembly was attached to a reservoir assembly where the fluid sack was filled with water. The cell was driven with a silver oxide battery through a 16000\u03a9 resistor. The amount of fluid dispensed was determined gravimetrically. A plot of the fluid dispensed over time is shown in FIG. 1.

Soc., March 1977, describe the problem encountered with electrochemical cells which utilize alkaline electrolytes. Leakage of the caustic electrolyte is very difficult to prevent at the cathode. \"One driving force for this phenomenon is the production of OH- ions arising from the electrochemical reduction of oxygen and/or the evolution of hydrogen occurring in a thin reaction zone above the observed electrolyte meniscus.\" Hydroxyl ions are produced through reactions 3 or 4 below:, 46359=An anode of about 0.2 square centimeters was adhered to a perfluorinated sulfonic membrane, the membrane was Nation 115 from DuPont. The electrode consisted approximately of 11% RuO2 powder, 60% graphite powder, and 29% 1100 equivalent weight Nation. A cathode paste was prepared which consisted of 81% CuO powder and 19% weak (1%) sulfuric acid solution. The paste was placed into a cathode cavity shown schematically in FIG. 1. The membrane/anode composite was placed in contact with the cathode paste such that the cathode and anode were on opposite sides. Total membrane area was about 1 square centimeter.

No. 5,242,565 disclosed \"a device for electrochemical generation of gases for the transportation of fluids and similar mediums.\" Winsel discloses two approaches. In one approach, the device is constructed very similar to a zinc-air battery. To function, the device must be operated in total absence of oxygen, then it will release hydrogen in a controlled manner. This approach has two disadvantages: 1) in many applications hydrogen is undesirable to collect because it is difficult to contain in a flexible bladder and also is flammable, 2) maintaining an oxygen-free condition is very difficult since most flexible bladder materials are somewhat permeable to oxygens. The other approach which is disclosed by Winsel again is similar to a zinc-air battery except that instead of zinc in the cathode, a reducible oxide or nitrate is present with an alkaline electrolyte. This approach has the advantage that oxygen is released instead of hydrogen; however, cells with alkaline electrolytes are difficult to seals thus a safety hazard may be present or unreliability may result. A description of and explanation for alkaline electrolyte creepage are presented in \"Why Alkaline Cells Leak,\" M. Hull and H. James; J. Electrochem. Soc., March 1977, pp. 332-339., 31896=Several electrodes are available which may be utilized to evolve oxygen at the anode. They are disclosed in the article \"Bifunctional electrodes for an integrated water-electrolysis and hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell with a solid polymer electrolyte,\" J. Ahn & R. Holze, J. Applied Electrochemistry 22 (1992) 1167-1174; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,039,409, LaConti et al. The information in these references is incorporated herein by reference.}",
