As shown in FIGS. 1, the switch section 42a is supported from the console 22 by the switch 28. The remaining board section 42b is mounted on the vehicle frame 12 by a bracket 98 for convenient access during assembly, servicing and repair of the vehicle. Prior to installation in the vehicle 10 as well as during servicing of the vehicle, the vehicle system circuits may be checked outside of the vehicle. Additional components such as time delay circuits, bulb checks or PTO brake coil circuits can be easily added to the section 42b. As best seen in FIGS. 2-4, the PCB 42 is scored or otherwise weakened at a location line 82 so that the sections 42a and 42b may be snapped apart when it is necessary to mount the switch 28 on the section 42a at a location remote from the section 42b (such as shown in FIG. 1 wherein access space is determined too be to limited for conveniently supporting the entire board 42 rom the console). The pattern of the copper conductor on the PCB 42 includes narrow conduction paths 84 extending across the line 82 and electrically connecting the sections 42a and 42b. When the PCB is snapped into two separate sections",
