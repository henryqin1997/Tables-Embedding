The EMT program determines the structure of the system, that is, the order of the system, the parameters and the constant coefficients of the variables of the differential equations. In the preferred embodiment, the structure is determined by developing an information matrix utilizing the input and output data. The row by row rank seareh of this matrix is utilized to determine the structure of the system. The theoretical concept in determining the row by row rank seareh is explained more fully in a published paper entitled: State Space Representation of the Open-Loop Dynamics of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, by Ahmet Duyar, Vasfi Eldem, Walter C. Merrill and Ten-Huci Guo, December 1991, Vol. 113, Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control at pages 684-690, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While certain exemplary preferred embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention. Further, it is to be understood that this invention shall not be limited to the specific construction and arrangements shown and described since various modifications or changes may occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed. The second difference that arises between the two algorithms is that the MCM is necessarily constrained by operational requirements. For example, the input signal applied to the motor is dependent on the requirement imposed by the application. One may appreciate that the input applied to model 44 may not be as \"rich\" of an input signal as could be applied during MQM testing. Further, under MCM testing, the actual load applied to the motor is unknown and may vary during the period in which measurements are obtained from sensor 34-38. Under these circumstances, only that portion of the model unaffected by the load is modeled. As an example, only equation (6) will be used to model the current signal using measured voltage and speed input signals to obtain results using the diagnostic observer. In alternative embodiments, techniques, such as taking the derivative of equation (7) in the case of a constant load, may be",
