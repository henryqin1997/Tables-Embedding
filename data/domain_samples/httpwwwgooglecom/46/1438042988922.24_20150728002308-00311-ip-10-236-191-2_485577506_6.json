    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As has been described above, according to the present invention, in an image pickup device, operations accompanying no horizontal processing are performed to obtain wide-band components in generation of R, G, and B components by a matrix operation of outputs from an image pickup element. The resultant wide-band components are mixed with the R, G, and B components, thereby obtaining wide-band digital R, G, and B outputs coping with multimedia applications. Therefore, a high-quality image free from color blurring at a high resolution can be obtained. Although the operations for generating the wide-band R, G, and B components every other line are different from those in the first and second embodiments, the difference can be corrected by switching inputs to selectors 717 to 719 in units of lines. The subsequent operation of the third embodiment is the same as those of the first and second embodiments. B+(G-B)=G (10) The adder 716 adds the B component as the output from the coincidence and matrix circuit 112 and the output from the wide-band signal generation circuit 113 to obtain a wide-band G signal as follows: G-(G-B)=B (9) To the contrary, in the next TV line, the subtracter 715 subtracts the output from the wide-band signal generation circuit 113 from the G component as the output from the coincidence and matrix circuit 112 to obtain a wide-band B signal as follows:",
