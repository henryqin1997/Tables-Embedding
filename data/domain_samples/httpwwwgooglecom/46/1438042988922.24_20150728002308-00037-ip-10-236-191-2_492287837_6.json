    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the normal form of pump the step on the barrel and the step in the wall of the bore 11 would be disposed just below, the fuel supply gallery. If this construction, however, is adopted it becomes necessary to establish a circumferential seal between the barrel and the wall of the bore 11 between the inlet 30 and outlet 33. Normally such a seal would be established using an elastomeric seal member which would be located in a groove. Such seal members are perfectly adequate at low temperatures but where the pump is for supplying fuel which has to be heated, fairly rapid deterioration of the seal member can take place. It would be possible therefore in the event of failure of the seal for fuel to contaminate the lubricating oil. It is therefore a feature of the pump that the steps in the pump barrel and the wall of the bore 11 which provide the axial location of the barrel within the body, are positioned between the inlet 30 and outlet 33. The junction of these two steps is shown at 34. Metal-to-metal contact between the barrel and the body is therefore established and there is no possibility of transfer of fuel along the clearance so that it could contaminate the lubricating oil. An elastomeric sealing member 35 is provided below the lubricating oil inlet 30 to prevent leakage so far as is possible,",
