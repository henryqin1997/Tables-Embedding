Database integration is performed using SQL via Microsoft Active Server Pages, PERL, VBScript, JavaScript, and other Web-enabled server-side scripting languages. Database development uses Microsoft Access. None of these limit the implementation of the system 20 and are cited by way of example only. The interface and animation used at the Optasia Web site has been created using third party development tools such as, but not limited to nor dependent upon, Macromedia Flash, Director, RealProducer, etc. and requires browser plug-ins or stand-alone players. None of these limit the implementation of the system 20 and are cited by way of example only. It is within the broadest scope of this invention to include a \u201cleased-learning\u201d model, which enables sites to pay for tutorials and access to the learning objects individually on an as-needed basis. With respect to \u201cE-Commerce\u201d, (electronic commerce), a site administrator must develop a roster of eligible students and requested courses prior to registration of students in the courses. When a client requests an account be initiated for them, the Optasia database administrator activates the client's account. The site administrator then adds students and chooses the courses to be studied. Upon submission of the roster, the client has the option of printing an invoice and",
