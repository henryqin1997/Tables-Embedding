    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment and certain alternatives, other alternatives, modifications, and variations may be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. This invention is not restricted to the use of magnetic field-sensitive rotational position sensors. It can also be used, for example, with optical sensors. primarily in the provision of the groove 151 in the motor cover 147 which receives the magnet ring 152 and allows the rotational position sensor 156 to face the magnet ring across a cylindrical air gap vis-a-vis a planar gap in the embodiment shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is a variant of FIG. 14 as items 140 and 150, can be avoided. Of course, the incorporation of a labyrinth seal of this type provided with these two interlocking L-shaped leg profiles has an independent significance in connection with data storage disk drives and is not required by the other design features of this motor. As already mentioned, the additional recesses 165\u2032\u2033 provide further enhancement of the sealing action of the labyrinth seals. Elements of this type are manufactured as large volume extrusions or deep drawn die pressings and their cost hardly bears",
