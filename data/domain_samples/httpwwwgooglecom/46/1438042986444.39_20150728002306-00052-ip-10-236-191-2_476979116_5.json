While the subject matter disclosed herein has been described in terms of storage arrays formed from HDD storage units, the subject matter disclosed herein is applicable to storage systems formed from arrays of other memory devices, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) storage devices (both volatile and non-volatile), optical storage devices, and tape storage devices. Additionally, it is suitable to virtualized storage systems, such as arrays built out of network-attached storage. It is further applicable to any redundant system in which there is some state information that associates a redundant component to particular subset of components, and that state information may be transferred using a donation operation. . Instead of rebuilding the contents of unit 1C onto unit 2F, it may be beneficial to rebuild half of unit 1C onto half of unit 2F, and the other half of unit 1E onto half of unit 2E.
