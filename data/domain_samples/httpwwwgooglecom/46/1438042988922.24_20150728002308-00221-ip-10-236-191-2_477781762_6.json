    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The resulting composite structure of the invention is high in strength, is light in weight, is biocompatible, and provides non-reactive surfaces for fluids and medications. The composite device can be produced at a lower cost than all-metal devices, without sacrificing the non-reactive features of such all metal devices. The composite construction of the present invention takes advantage of the low-cost, high quality production methods made possible through the use of molded, light weight, plastic materials, and characteristics of selected non-reactive materials such as metals (including titanium and stainless steel) and ceramics (including glass). Housing 12 may be subdivided into upper and lower segments 12a, 12b each being molded of any biocompatible non-metallic material such as for example, polyethersulfone. Metallic chamber liner 22 sits inside interior chamber area 14 and in effect serves as a reservoir cup for the fluid medication. During assembly, the upper and lower housing segments 12a, 12b, are assembled together, for example by being bonded, screwed, pinned, snapped, etc. with the septum 20 and liner 22 captured therebetween. The upper rim 38 of the liner is in tight sealing engagement with the underside or circumference of the septum, the latter in turn being in tight sealing engagement as at 40 with the underside of an inwardly projecting rim 42 surrounding the inlet opening 16. Alternatively, access port device 10 may be integrally molded around the septum 20 and the metallic chamber liner 22",
