More specifically, it relates to improved measuring apparatus of the type disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 169,858, filed by Keith S. Champlin on Mar. 18, 1988, and to U.S. Pat. No. 3,873,911 and 3,909,708, issued to Keith S. Champlin on Mar. 25, 1975, and on Sept. 30, 1975, respectively.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations These, and other variations of embodiments are believed to be well within the scope of the present invention and are intended to be covered by the appended claims. Still further, the means providing an output display to the user need not be simply a dc milliameter as has been disclosed herein. In the case of a direct-reading battery tester, the requisite numeric display could just as well be provided by a digital meter, a numeric printer, or a computer terminal. In the case of a \"pass-fail\" battery tester, the requisite qualitative display could just as well be provided by a plurality of light-emitting diodes, colored lights, or an audible display. Other, equally effective, means for implementing an output display will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Further, the number of different nominal voltages identified by the circuitry, as well as their particular values, is completely arbitrary and is not restricted to the numbers and voltage values described herein. In addition, the selectable attenuator can, of course, be inserted at any point in the amplifier chain between the oscillator and the readout device. The invention is therefore not limited to only selectable attenuators that are placed at the oscillator output as disclosed herein. Other, equally effective, means for selectively scaling the output indication provided to the user will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, the battery undergoing test can be measured,",
