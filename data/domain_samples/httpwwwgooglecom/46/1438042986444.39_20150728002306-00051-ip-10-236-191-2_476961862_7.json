Each of the remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n is associated with a specific transceiver radio unit (TRU) in the RBS 3141, . . . 314n so that the CATV network is totally transparent to the radio operation. The operating frequency of the CAP units 3081, . . . 308n is set to exactly match the frequency of the remote antenna transmitter. Up to six TRUs in a specific one of the RBS 314n feed one of the CAP units 3081, . . . 308n which in turn serves several fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n in the CATV network. A combiner within the CAP units 3081, . . . 308n provide six transmit input ports from the RBS 3141, . . . 314n in order to support a maximum of six TRUs. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n convert the telephony carrier signals to CATV frequency signals and feed them to the CATV headend 300 over a bidirectional coaxial cable., 54041=The CATV headend 300 includes an amplifying and electrical/optical converting circuit 302 which is used for interfacing the CATV headend 300 to the optical fibers 2501, . . . 250n. The amplifying and electrical/optical converting circuit 302 is connected to combining and splitting circuitry 304 which is connected to a video source 306 and cable access processing (CAP) units 3081, . . . 308n which at least correspond in number to the fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n of the system. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n are connected to radio base stations (RBS) 3141, . . . 314n and a hub 310. The hub 310 is further connected to a remote antenna management system (RAMS) 312. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n are also connected to an operation support system/switching center (OSS/SC) 350. The OSS/SC 350 includes a mobile switching center 352, a base station controller 354, an operation support system 356 and its own RAMS 358. The RAMS 358 of the OSS/SC 350 may communicate with the RAMS 312 of the CATV headend 300 so that a plurality of CATV headends may be controlled at a central location. The base station controller 354 is also connected to a macro cell 360 which includes a RBS 362. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n provide the frequency conversion and power level adjustments for placing telephony carrier signals on the CATV infrastructure as well as controlling and monitoring the status of the remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n., 56910=In the CATV headend 300, the telephony carrier signals are combined with the video signals and both signals are transmitted over the fiber optic cables 2501, . . . 250n to fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n. At the fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n the signals are converted back to electrical signals and distributed over a tree and branch coaxial network. Each individual one of the remote antenna 2021, . . . 202n taps off the coaxial cabling 204, filters the carrier signals, converts the frequency and transmits the carrier signals over the air interface. The video signals continue unaltered to each CATV subscriber. For the uplink, the remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n receive two diversity signals from the air, down convert each to a different frequency, and transmit the diversity carrier signals over the CATV infrastructure. In the CATV infrastructure at the fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n, the electrical signals are converted to optical signals and transmitted back to the CATV headend 300. These signals are then converted back to electrical signals and routed to the CAP units 3081, . . . 308n over the bidirectional cable. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n convert the uplink carrier signals back up to frequencies for the input to the TRUs. The CAP units 3081, . . . 308n receive digital control information from the RAMS 312 and forward remote antenna control information to the desired one of the remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n., 53037=FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a CATV system infrastructure that may advantageously utilize Applicants' system and method for reducing noise. The infrastructure includes fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n which are connected to a CATV headend 300 by respective optical fibers 2501, . . . 250n. The CATV headend 300 may support a number of fiber nodes 2001, . . . 200n, each of which may generally support approximately 500 to 1500 homes or subscribers through a plurality of remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n. The remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n are respectively connected by the optical fibers 2501, . . . 250n to the CATV headend 300. Also, a plurality of the remote antenna units 2021, . . . 202n are connected to an amplifying and optical/electrical converting circuit 206n by coaxial cabling 204n.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the scope of the invention, which is determined by the following claims. All such modification that would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. Because each one of the remote antenna units covers a small area, multicasting provides a more efficient use of radio resources to cover larger areas. The number of remote antenna units in a multicast group is limited by the addition of receiver thermal noise resulting from each remote antenna unit in the uplink. By the signal strength detection system and method of this invention, the number of remote antenna units that are used in a multicast group may be increased because the cumulative noise resulting from the uplink stages is reduced. For example, if 50 remote antenna units are included in a multicast group, but only two remote antenna units are receiving valid signals, the 48 remote antenna units that are not receiving a valid signal may be shut off from the network connection and the cumulative noise introduced to the network by these remote antenna units is eliminated. Therefore, the only noise contribution in this case is from the two remote antenna units that have a valid signal and",
