The surface impurity concentration and thickness of the substrate 1b are designed in accordance with the breakdown voltage and the like of a power device formed later. For example, when a breakdown voltage of 1000 V is required, a thickness of about 70 \u03bcm and a surface impurity concentration of about 1014 cm -3 are selected., 21300=This is a Division of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. FIGS. 13 and 14 show a second preferred embodiment according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, impurities of high concentration are diffused on the bottom surface of the single-crystal Si substrate 1b to form the N+ region 11b. This provides a structure similar to the lower bonding material 50 of FIG. 3. SIMOX technique is carried out by implantation with oxygen ions at high energy from the surface opposite to the N+ region 11b, so that the relatively thin single-crystal layer 1a and oxide film 20 are formed on the substrate 1b. The single-crystal layer 1a is made with the thickness of about 2 to 5 \u03bcm by annealing after ion implantation. However, since the power device is not formed in this portion, the thickness of the single-crystal layer 1a may be increased by epitaxial growth, if necessary. Thereafter the execution of similar steps of FIGS. 6 to 12 provides for the power IC according to the present invention. According to the second preferred embodiment, the thickness of the single-crystal layer 1a is controlled by an acceleration voltage in oxygen ion implantation. The second preferred embodiment, although it is necessary to adjust",
