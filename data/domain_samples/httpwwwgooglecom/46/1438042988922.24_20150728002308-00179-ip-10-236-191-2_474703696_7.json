A progress bar 94 can be used to graphically display the percentage of progress to the user via a display portion of the host 12. FIG. 4 . Execution of the simulation thus commences, continuing automatically in a loop with step 124 until the required number of cycles (y) have been completed for each power mode 82 of FIG. 4 At step 122, the user can start the simulation by pressing the start button shown in . The algorithm 100 then proceeds to step 122. FIG. 4 At step 120, the algorithm 100 records a timer type which is selected by a user. The user can select from the timer aboard the host 12, i.e., a computer timer, when the delays are requested at longer than 100 ms. A microcontroller timer option can provide more accurate delays of multiples of 1 ms. Such an option can be displayed within the experiment control field 88 shown in , such a field is represented as \u201cIGN SW Settings\u201d at 90. Field 90 allows a user to select or configure ignition switch voltage levels and activation for",
