The publication \"RF PERFORMANCE OF MACROSCOPIC DIVERSITY IN UNIVERSAL PORTABLE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS: FREQUENCY REUSE CONSIDERATIONS\" by Richard C. Bernhardt, from IEEE International Conference on Communications, Jun. 22-25, 1986, Toronto, Canada describes different types of cells and placing of transmitters and the result of simulations of such a system. The publication \"USER ACCESS IN PORTABLE RADIO SYSTEMS IN THE NOISE LIMITED ENVIRONMENT\" by Richard C. Bernhardt, from ICC'87, Jun. 1987, Seattle, Wash., U.S.A., describes different types of cell and placing of transmitters as well as comparsions between different criteria and algorithms for the selection of base transmitter., 51123=It is conceivable to use different kinds of digital modulation in a mobile radio system, whereby somewhat different relationships can exist between information transmission rate and modulation time interval. In digital modulation of the radio signals involving transmission of one symbol at a time of a sequence of uncorrelated symbols, the modulation time interval will be the time during which a single symbol is decisive for the digital modulation. For example, if a sequence of binary symbols individually and one at a time determines the modulation, the modulation time interval will be the time during which one symbol determines the modulation. This can also be expressed by saying that the modulation time interval will be the inverted value of the transmission rate in bits. In digital modulation of the signals involving two or more at a time of a sequence of digital symbols being decisive for the modulation during wholely or partly overlapping times, the modulation interval can be the time when a preceeding, but not the nearest subsequent symbol affects the modulation. For example, in digital modulation according to SE 8102802-9, FIGS. 1-2, a symbol affects the phase of a carrier wave during a time interval 3T. The nearest preceeding symbol also affects the phase change of the carrier wave during a first part 2T of the time interval 3T. The nearest subsequent symbol also affects the change of phase of the carrier wave during a last part of 2T of the time interval 3T. In this case modulation time interval will be T, which agrees with what is called the symbol time interval in SE 8102802-9. In general, it can be said that the modulation time interval is to be interpreted as the interval in time between two successive changes in the transmitted digital modulation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A method in accordance with the invention is not limited to described embodiments or mobile radio systems according to FIGS. 1 and 2, but can be applied and varied within the scope of the claims. In actual fact, a method in accordance with the invention is not restricted to mobile radio systems with two or more base transmitters per cell, and it is conceivable to apply embodiments of a method in accordance with the invention in a mobile system, the method involves, summarily explained, that the same radio channel is used both before and after handover, if possible, for transmitting message information to the mobile. A decision on handover is preferably made in the mobile radio exchange or other stationary part of the system, and the handover takes place without the mobile being formed beforehand. If the mobiles have equalizers and the system transmits message information digitally by digital modulation of radio signals, it is also preferably in this case as well that the transmission of message information is started from the base transmitter to which responsibility is to be handed over, before transmission of the same information is terminated from the base transmitter from which responsibility is to be handed over. In this case also, the same message information is transmitted during a transition period to the mobile from two base transmitters. If it is not possible to utilise the same radio channel for some",
