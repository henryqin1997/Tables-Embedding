This model is summarized in the \u201cNavstar Interface Control Document\u201d, ICD-GPS-200, published by Rockwell International Corporation, Satellite Division, Revision B, Jul. 3, 1991. The material from the Navstar Interface Control Document is incorporated by reference herein. The required parameters for this model are broadcast by the GPS satellites. Reference station measurements of Ionospheric time delay may be used to calculate improved values of these model parameters, which are then distributed by the network. A single frequency GPS station can use the single frequency model, with parameters supplied by the GPS satellites or by the network. A double frequency GPS station can use this single frequency model, or the station can measure and determine the Ionospheric time delay using a two-frequency model, such as that disclosed in the ICD-GPS-200 document, op cit., 89370=At step 1008, the stored Cs corrections are retrieved., 88598=At step 1002, satellite measurement data is collected from a plurality of satellites. For example, receiver 904 can collect the satellite measurement data., 88382=FIG. 10 illustrates one embodiment of a flow diagram for a process 1000 to use satellite position error corrections Cs. Initially, process 1000 begins at step 1002., 20489=This application is a Continuation-in-Part and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/906,176 entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COLLECTING, PROCESSING, AND DISTRIBUTING DIFFERENTIAL GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM INFORMATION USING THE INTERNET,\u201d filed on Aug. 4, 1997, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 59045=To determine the satellite error vector \u03b5rsat for a particular satellite, measurements of that satellite from at least three different real reference stations are required. Methods of determining the satellite location error vector \u03b5rsat are known in the art. For example, Patent Cooperation Treaty publication WO 95/18977 titled \u201cA network For Code Phase Differential GPS Corrections\u201d published Jul. 13, 1995 explains how the satellite error vector \u03b5rsat can be determined if independent satellite observations from three different real reference stations are available. Thus, in the present invention, the central computer system can combine the satellite observations from three different real reference stations in order to generate the satellite error vector \u03b5rsat., 89072=At step 1006, the Cs corrections are stored in a database accessible via the Internet. For example, server 908 can receive the Cs corrections from receiver 904 and store the Cs corrections in corrections database 912., 19965=The present patent application is a Continuation of application Ser.

No. 6,324,473, issued Nov. 27, 2001, which is hereby incorporation herein by reference., 88787=At step 1004, satellite position error corrections (Cs) are computed based on the collected satellite measurement data. Receiver 904 can compute the Cs, corrections and transmit the Cs corrections to server 908., 89462=At step 1010, the retrieved Cs corrections are used. In one embodiment, processor 910 retrieves the Cs corrections to compute PRC corrections, which are then sent to user 906. For example, user 906 can request server 908 to calculate PRC corrections based on a given location. In another embodiment, user 906 requests server 908 to send directly stored Cs corrections, which are then processed and used by user 906.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, a method and system for providing WAAS like corrections using a server on the Internet have been described. In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense. Thus, such a process allows WAAS like corrections to be used for \u201cpost-processing\u201d in a large and wide area instead of a localized area for a GPS device having Internet access capabilities. At step 1010, the retrieved Cs corrections are used. In one embodiment, processor 910 retrieves the Cs corrections to compute PRC corrections, which are then sent to user 906. For example, user 906 can request server 908 to calculate PRC corrections based on a given location. In another embodiment, user 906 requests server 908 to send directly stored Cs corrections, which are then processed and used by user 906. At step 1008, the stored Cs corrections are retrieved.
