The closest known prior art to the present construction is disclosed in Blair U.S. Pat. No. 4,124,944 which issued Nov. 14, 1978 and is assigned to Applicants' assignee. The Blair patent discloses a device for teaching persons to weld while at the same time evaluating the person's skill as a welder, and it includes means for making a visual presentation as to the person's performance. These same things are also generally true of the present construction. However, the present construction represents a marked advance over the Blair construction. More specifically, the present construction can be used to stimulate more different kinds of welding operations and devices than Blair, it can be used to train and evaluate a person's skill as a welder, and it can produce a printed record thereof., 37905=Another prior art patent that is of some interest is recently issued Paton et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,014, issued July 14, 1987. To the limited extent that the Paton et al patent discloses a weld trainer that uses a cathode ray tube it is pertinent. However the construction, operation and the approach to weld training as taught by the present invention are all different from what is disclosed in Paton et al. For example the present device is PROM based, microprocessor controlled, can be used with many different kinds of welding tools, uses light sensitive images on the CRT screen to establish different selected operating parameters, and the present device uses unique sensor means on the simulated welding tool and on the CRT to produce responses, all of which are completely different from anything disclosed in the Paton et al patent. Furthermore, and importantly the present device uses an electrostatic receiver system to determine arc length and angle functions, the electrostatic system using signals applied to the CRT and receiver rings which transmit information that is thereafter used to determine arc length and angular orientation of the simulated welding gun or gun electrode. The patented construction by contrast uses screen reflectivity to determine arc length and it uses a gravity sensor to determine angular orientation. These and other differences are important and fundamentally effect the construction and operation of the present device as compared to other known devices. Other features of the present device which distinguish it from prior art devices are also readily apparent including the fact that the present device requires no initial position calibration and does not produce any profile ambiguity. Also the present system can be used to simulate regular movable stick arc welding operations as well as MIG and TIG torch operations which is not true of known devices and the present device may include means to provide a print out of errors by type, it has more operational parameters than known devices that can be selected to provide greater variation in the operation and skills required and the present device is more versatile and is able to test a greater range of skills and ability. Also the present device has on-screen warning for the hearing impaired and is software driven to allow performance improvements and the addition of new functions as they are developed, none of which is available in any known weld trainer device.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus there has been shown and described a novel weld training and testing device which fulfills all of the objects and advantages sought therefor. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, however, that many changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications for the subject device are possible. All such changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention which is limited only by the claims that follow. From what has been said and described above it can be seen that the present device represents a very versatile, easy to operate, compact weld trainer device that can be used by persons of widely varying skills and experience and can also be used as an effective training and practice device. When the set up screen 100 appears the various parameters can be established as described above all of which are included in block 436 which has the legend Subroutines For Operating Parameters. The set up screen 100 enables going into the start of the Mainloop Program 438 which is the simulated welding program. Once the program is initiated the operator has the option of prematurely aborting the welding program and repeating the set up procedure and/or going back to the logo screen 432 or tuning out the simulated welding operation after which the Complete Exercise",
