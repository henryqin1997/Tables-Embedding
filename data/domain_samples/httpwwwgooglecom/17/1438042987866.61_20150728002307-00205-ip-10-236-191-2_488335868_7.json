    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38543=One way to resolve this difficulty would be to implement the basestation transceiver apparatus using a high speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and equipment which makes use of efficient digital filters. On the transmit side, the basestation would also include an inverse FFT processing combiner which outputs a combined signal representative of the contents of the communication channel signals processed thereby. In this manner, relatively compact, lightweight, inexpensive, and reliable digital integrated circuits may be used to cover the entire channel capacity offered by the service provider, rather than only the subset of the available channels. For an more detailed description of such a system, please refer to our co-pending United States patent application entitled \"Transceiver Apparatus Employing Wideband FFT Channelizer with Output Sample Timing Adjustment and Inverse FFT Combiner for a Multichannel Communication Network\" filed Apr. 10, 1994 and which is assigned to Overture Systems, Inc. the assignee of this application., 60748=For a more detailed explanation of a preferred embodiment of the channelizer 16-1, reference should be had to a co-pending U.S. Patent Application entitled \"Transceiver Apparatus Employing Wideband FFT Channelizer with Output Sample Timing Adjustment and Inverse FFT Combiner for a Multichannel Communication Network\", filed Apr. 10, 1994, and which is assigned to Overture Systems, Inc., the assignee of the present application.}",

In addition, rather than use the architecture of FIG. 3, the channelizers 16 may make use of a digital integrated circuit which accepts a wideband digital input and provides a downconverted output, such as HSP 50016 Digital Downconverter sold by Harris Semiconductor, Inc., of Palm Bay, Fla. An alternate arrangement of the functions performed by the front end portion of the basestation 10, including the power splitter 12, amplifiers 14-1, 14-2, . . . , 14-L, and digital tuner sections 15-1, 15-2, . . . , 15-L is also possible. 14-2, . . . , 14-L, and digital tuner sections 15-1, 15-2, . . . , 15-L is also possible.
