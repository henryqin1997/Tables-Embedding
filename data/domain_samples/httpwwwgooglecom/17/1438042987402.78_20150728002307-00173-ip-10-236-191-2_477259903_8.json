It is also noted that, while the present invention is described as a machine with two-directional planar motion, the machine can be reduced to a one-directional linear motion by eliminating one wheeled frame. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation, the invention being defined by the claims. The present invention represents what is considered to be the basic best configuration for the intended purpose. ALTERNATIVES AND ENHANCEMENTS When horizontal motion of the wheeled frames, and user for Configuration No. 2, is caused by use of the foot grips, the body load path is through the feet, legs and hips, causing exercise of all muscle groups in these areas. A secondary effect is in the muscles of the upper body due to stabilization. The degree of strain is through use of the braking systems, as determined by the user. When horizontal motion of the wheeled frames, and user for Configuration No. 2, is caused by use of the hand grips, the body load path is through the hands, arms, shoulders, and upper body, causing exercise of all muscle groups in these areas. A secondary effect is",
