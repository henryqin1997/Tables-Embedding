Further, the joint portion of the shaft 4 at which two kinds of metals join, is not limited to the above described embodiment. For example, the joining may be attained at a different place such as shown in FIG. 3. Further, the recessed portion 12 and the journal portion 13 may be made of the same metal. While the present invention has been described and shown as joining the protruded portion and recessed portion by shrinkage fit by cooling from a high temperature, it is not limited to be so. For example, the protruded portion and recessed portion may be joined by shrinkage fit by temperature variation from a sub-zero temperature, press fit, or a joining method of pouring a mass of molten brazing metal into a space between the recessed and protruded portions which are heated up to a high temperature and cooling them so that the recessed portion tightly or firmly holding the protruded portion by way of the brazing metal. It will be further understood that the present invention makes it possible to strongly join the turbine wheel 3 and the shaft 4 by means of a simple structure for setting, depending upon the outer",
