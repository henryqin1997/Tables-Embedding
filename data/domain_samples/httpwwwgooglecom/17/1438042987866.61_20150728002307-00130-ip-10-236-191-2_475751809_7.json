    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87495=From microscopy, it was determined that a 3:1 layer thickness gradient existed for about 36% of the layers, while the remaining 64% of the layers were of a substantially uniform thickness. From the measured distribution of layer thicknesses, 236 layers of the PMMA/PVDF blend varied in optical thickness from about 0.25 \u03bcm to about 0.74 \u03bcm. Of these, 94 layers (40% of PMMA/PVDF layers or 7% of total layers) were in the iridescent optically thin film range of 0.09 \u03bcm to 0.45 \u03bcm. The optical thickness of the polycarbonate layers varied between about 0.8 \u03bcm and 2.4 \u03bcm, in the optically thick range., 87135=The multilayer film which was formed had a total thickness of about 82 mil (2083 \u03bcm), with the polycarbonate skin layers comprising about 22% of total film thickness. The 657 polycarbonate core layers had an average layer thickness of about 1.86 \u03bcm, and the 656 layers of the PMMA/PVDF blend had an average layer thickness of about 0.62 \u03bcm., 64902=By proper selection of the f-ratio, one can exercise some degree of control over the intensity of reflection of the various higher order reflections. For example, first order visible reflections of violet (0.38 micrometer wavelength) to red (0.68 micrometer wavelength) can be obtained with layer optical thicknesses between about 0.075-0.25 \u03bcm., 86260=A multilayer reflective film was produced using microlayer coextrusion equipment as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,773,882 and 3,884,606, incorporated herein by reference. The multilayer film comprised alternating layers of polycarbonate (CALIBRE\ufffd 300-22) and a blend of 40% by weight polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF,. Kynar 720) and 60% by weight polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, Acrylite H15003). The two materials were coextruded into 1313 alternating layers and capped on both surfaces of the sheet with polycarbonate skin (CALIBRE\ufffd 300-22). All melt temperatures were approximately 500\ufffd F., and the extruder pumping rates were as follows: 1) polycarbonate in the microlayer core: 40.6 lb/hr.; 2) PMMA/PVDF blend in microlayer core: 13.5 lb/hr.; 3) Polycarbonate in the skin: 15.5 lb/hr. The material was cooled on cooling rolls in an S-wrap configuration.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations 400 optically thin layers of polycarbonate (refractive index=1.59) having a gradient layer thickness of between 65 nm and 110 nm and 400 optically thin layers of polymethyl methacrylate (refractive index=1.49) having a gradient layer thickness between 65 nm and 150 nm were coextruded with 329 optically thick layers (approximately 0.7 \u03bcm) of polycarbonate and 328 optically thick layers (approximately 0.7 \u03bcm) of polymethyl methacrylate. The resulting sheet had the appearance of polished chrome with no iridescence. The 800 optically thin and the 657 optically thick layers reflected substantially across the entire visible spectrum. EXAMPLE 4 116 optically thin layers of polystyrene (refractive index=1.59) and 115 optically thin layers of polymethyl methacrylate (refractive index=1.49) having thicknesses of 70 nm and 75 nm respectively were coextruded with 929 optically thick layers of polystyrene and 928 optically thick layers of polymethyl methacrylate. The average thickness of the optically thick layers was about 0.7 \u03bcm. The resulting sheet was substantially colorless and an average reflectance of about 70%. The calculated Pf was about 0.43. EXAMPLE 3 The iridescent film was then placed between the 21st and 22nd glass slide counting from the top of the exterior surface. Light reflected from the sample was colorless, and the sample appeared as a mirror with no perceptible color. The Pf was calculated as follows: (0.82-0.76)/0.76<0.1. The iridescent film was then placed between the tenth and eleventh glass slide counting",
