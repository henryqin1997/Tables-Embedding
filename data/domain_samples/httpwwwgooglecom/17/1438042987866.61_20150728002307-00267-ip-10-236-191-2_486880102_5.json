    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6303=The surgeon may then implant the corneal implant 200 in the patient's cornea. To access the interior of the cornea, a flap may be cut into the cornea and lifted to expose the cornea's interior, e.g, stroma bed of the cornea. An example of this is shown in FIG. 5C, in which a flap 1120 is cut into the cornea 600 and pulled backed to expose the stroma bed 1100 of the cornea. The flap 1120 is attached to the cornea 600 by a flap hinge 1110. The flap 1120 may be cut using a laser, e.g., femtosecond laser, a mechanical keratome or manually. Several methods for forming flaps in corneal tissue, and other related information, are described in further detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/924,152, filed Aug. 23, 2004, entitled \u201cMethod for Keratophakia Surgery,\u201d which is fully incorporated by reference herein. Once the interior is exposed, the surgeon positions the inserter 100 so that implant 200 is at the desired location on the cornea 600, e.g., the patient's pupil or visual axis as shown in FIG. 5A. Prior to positioning the inserter 100, the surgeon may use a surgical sponge to remove excess fluid on the outer surface of the inserter 100 being careful not to remove the saline from the holding space 101. The clearance bend 104 allows the inserter to clear the patient's facial features (e.g., nose) as the surgeon manipulates the inserter 100. To precisely position the implant 200 the surgeon may view the cornea 600 through the inserter slots 102 and 110 and the implant 200, which is transparent. When the implant 200 is at the desired location, the surgeon holds down the implant 200 on the cornea 600 using a surgical cannula, Sinskey Hook or other tool 610 such that implant 200 gently touches the stroma bed of the cornea 600 through the bottom slot 110. This tool 610 holds down the implant 200 through the top inserter slot 102 as shown in FIG. 5B. The surgeon then retracts the inserter 100 from the cornea 600 to release the implant 200 from the inserter 100 and deposit the implant 200 at the desired location. If the implant 200 is not precisely at the desired location, then the surgeon may gently move the implant 200 into position using a surgical sponge, rounded-tip tool, or other tool. In the example shown in FIG. 5C, the implant 200 is centered on the patient's pupil 1130. After the implant 200 is correctly positioned, the surgeon places the flap 1120 over the implant 200.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{48102=The implant 200 may be implanted concurrent with a LASIK procedure or post-LASIK. Since a flap is cut into the cornea during a LASIK procedure, the same flap may be used to implant the implant 200. If the implant 200 is implanted post-LASIK, then the LASIK flap may be re-opened or the inserter 100 may be advanced between the flap and the underlying corneal tissue to the desired position. In this example, the LASIK procedure may be used to correct distance vision while the implant is used to provide near vision. Additional details can be found, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/554,544, entitled \u201cSmall Diameter Inlays,\u201d filed on Oct. 30, 2006, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference., 57270=The implant 1000 may also be implanted using other procedures including implantation through a channel, pocket or pathway cut into the cornea for access to the desired position in the cornea. In these procedures, the inserter 900 may be moved to the desired position through the channel, pocket or pathway. The thin cross section of the inserter 900 minimizes stress on the cornea as the inserter 900 is advanced through the channel, pocket or pathway. A second channel may also be cut into the cornea to provide access for the surgical tool used to hold down the implant 1000 at the desired location.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. As another example, each feature of one embodiment can be mixed and matched with other features shown in other embodiments. As yet another example, the order of steps of method embodiments may be changed. Features and processes known to those of ordinary skill may similarly be incorporated as desired. Additionally and obviously, features may be added or subtracted as desired. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents. The inserter systems described herein may to used to implant various types of corneal implant. For example, the inserter systems may be used to implant corneal implants deep within the cornea such as intraocular lenses or at lower depths such as inlays. The inserter systems may also be used to place an onlay on the surface of the cornea. Thus, the inserter systems may be used to implant corneal implants of various rigidity, sizes and properties at various depths in the cornea. The corneal implant may be an inlay, lens, or the like. The implant 1000 may also be implanted using other procedures including implantation through a channel, pocket or pathway cut into the cornea",
