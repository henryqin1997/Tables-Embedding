    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6495=With reference to FIGS. 27A-C, in yet another embodiment, the valve 100 is stapled or clipped into place with a single or multiple detachable staples, clips, barbs or hooks. As shown in FIG. 27A, the valve 100 can be positioned over the native aortic valve 24. In this embodiment, the valve 100 is temporarily secured by control wires 230 as will be explained in more detail below. A surgically inserted or percutaneously insert tool 232 is positioned near the valve 100 and is used to insert clips 234 or other type of anchor around the annulus and allows them to engage the tissue and/or portion of the valve 100. The staples, clips, hooks or barbs could also be delivered percutaneously with a device that positions the staples, clips, hooks or barbs near or below to the native valve. These could be attached through a balloon, pull wire or other force mechanism to push or pull them into position. The tool 232 used to stapled in place the valve 100 can be similar to those used to connect the mitral valve leaflets together by the company E-Valve and described in U.S. patent publication 2004/0087975 Lucatero, Sylvester et al, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. FIGS. 27D and 27E illustrate an embodiment in which the tool 232 includes a tensioning wire 233, which has a distal end that is preferably coupled to the distal end of the device 232 and has a proximal end that extend through the device 232. By applying tension to the wire 233, the top of the too 232 can be bent towards the wall of the aorta as shown in FIGS. 27D and 27E.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{189273=Attachment of the valve 104 to the cuff 102 can be completed in any number of conventional methods including sewing, ring or sleeve attachments, gluing, welding, interference fits, bonding through mechanical means such as pinching between members. An example of these methods are described in Published Application from Huynh et al 06102944 or Lafrance et al 2003/0027332 or Peredo U.S. Pat. No. 6,409,759, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. These methods are generally know and accepted in the valve device industry. As mentioned above, the cuff 102 may additionally house an inflation mold where the structure is formed within the body or the cuff made be the mold where the fluid is injected to create the support structure. The valve, whether it is tissue, engineered tissue, mechanical or polymer, may be attached before packaging or in the hospital just before implantation. Some tissue valves are native valves such as pig, horse, cow or native human valves. Most of which are suspended in a fixing solution such as Glutaraldehyde., 164649=In the preferred embodiment, the fabric inflation channels contain a liner in a form of the balloons 111 as described with reference to FIGS. 3A-C. The balloon 111 preferably is a thin wall tube made from a biocompatible material. In one embodiment, the balloon 111 is blown from nylon tubing the tubing diameter is about 0.030 of an inch with a 0.005 inches wall thickness. The tubing is then necked to an outside diameter of approximately 0.020 inches the tubing is then placed inside a mold and pressurized to about 200 PSI the mold is then heated in the area where the balloon should be formed. The heating step may be accomplished using a stream of heated air at approximately 300 degrees F. The final diameter of the balloon in this embodiment is 0.060 inches at one portion of the balloon and 0.090 inches a second portion of the balloon. The total length of the balloon 111 is approximately 18 cm. The balloon 111 may be blown in a shape that conforms to the cuff, or the balloon may be shaped to conform to the cuff in a secondary step. Alternatively the liner may be a different shape than the fabric cuff, where the liner is larger than the fabric cuff, allowing the assembly to inflate to a size determined by the fabric., 209815=The mixed uncured inflation media preferably has a viscosity less than 2000 cps In one embodiment the epxy based inflation media has a viscosity of 100-200 cps. In another embodiment the inflation media has a viscosity less than 1000 cps., 199850=Details of compositions suitable for use as an inflation medium in the present invention are described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/496,231 to Hubbell et al., filed Feb. 1, 2000 and entitled \u201cBiomaterials Formed by Nucleophilic Addition Reaction to Conjugated Unsaturated Groups\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/586,937 to Hubbell et al., filed Jun. 2, 2000 and entitled \u201cConjugate Addition Reactions for the Controlled Delivery of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds\u201d. The entirety of each of these patent applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 73521=Since surgical techniques are highly invasive and in the instance of a heart valve, the patient must be put on bypass during the operation, the need for a less invasive method of heart valve replacement has long been recognized. At least as early as 1972, the basic concept of suturing a tissue aortic valve to an expandable cylindrical \u201cfixation sleeve\u201d or stent was disclosed. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,657,744 to Ersek. Other early efforts were disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,979 to Moulopoulos and U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,854 to Boretos, relating to prosthetic valves carried by an expandable valve support delivered via catheter for remote placement. More recent iterations of the same basic concept were disclosed, for example, in patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,411,552, 5,957,949, 6,168,614, and 6,582,462 to Anderson, et al., which relate generally to tissue valves carried by expandable metallic stent support structures which are crimped to a delivery balloon for later expansion at the implantation site., 64353=This application claims the priority benefit of (1) U.S. Provisional Application 60/568,402, filed May 5, 2004, (2) U.S. Provisional Application 60/572,561, filed May 19, 2004, (3) U.S. Provisional Application 60/581,664, filed Jun. 21, 2004, (4) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,054, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (5) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,110, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (6) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,005, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (7) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,002, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (8) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,055, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (9) U.S. Provisional Application 60/586,006, filed Jul. 7, 2004, (10) U.S. Provisional Application 60/588,106, filed Jul. 15, 2004, (11) U.S. Provisional Application 60/603,324, filed Aug. 20, 2004, (12) U.S. Provisional Application 60/605,204, filed Aug. 27, 2004 and (13) U.S. Provisional Application 60/610,269 filed Sep. 16, 2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.}",
