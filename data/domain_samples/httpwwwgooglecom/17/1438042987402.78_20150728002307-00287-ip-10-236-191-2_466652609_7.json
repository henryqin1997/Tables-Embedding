In particular, these access systems provide a much more economical approach to serve a small remote community of subscribers than the use of expensive local switching systems or proprietary remote switching modules. Typically DLC systems support between 100 and 2000 subscribers., 28922=The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 11/257,140, entitled \u201cSwitch Proxy for Providing Emergency Stand Alone Service in Remote Access Systems,\u201d filed on Oct. 24, 2005.

    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by It is to be understood that the above-described embodiments of this invention are merely illustrative of the present invention and that many variations of the above-described embodiments can be devised by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. It is therefore intended that such variations be included within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents. While this exemplary embodiment is described in terms of a direct connection between switch proxy management system 134 and one or more switch proxies and external databases through interfaces 710 and 712, one skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to provide this interconnection. For example, these connections may be over dial-up modems, Ethernet, or proprietary telemetry networks. If, in decision block 804, a change affecting one or more lines served by a switch proxy is detected, then a database lookup is performed on the affected line or lines in block 806. Changes are recorded in database 704 in block 808. Finally, all changes are transmitted to the affected switch proxy via communications unit 706. The changes may be transmitted when discovered or may be transmitted as a batch job during non-peak times. . Processing starts in circle 800. In block 802, controller 702 causes communications unit 706 to interrogate external databases through interfaces 710 and 712",
