No. 08/278,471, filed Jul. 21, 1994 (abandoned)., 149083=Load value=4096\u2212n, where n=2500/(2*ring frequency)., 157590=In operation, the 80 kHz clock is retimed with the 2 mHz clock to produce two output signals. Two exemplary output signals are shown in FIG. 13. The frequency of the two outputs signals is also 80 kHz. Each of these signals drives HEXFET transistors 1220, 1225 respectively. These signals guarantee that both HEXFET transistors are never \u201con\u201d at the same time. Although not shown on the waveforms illustrated in FIG. 13, the 80 kHz outpulses are gated off for a small period of time near the ring frequency zero crossings (i.e., where each pulse reaches its lowest level). This is done to create a smaller crest factor (or peak to RMS ratio) on the actual ring waveform., 156713=An alternative circuit for producing frequencies to be supplied to a ring circuit is shown in FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 12, a complex programmable logic device (CPLD) 1205 is included. This CPLD is a pulse modification circuit which receives as input the signal RNGFRQ (which is received from line 74 in FIG. 10), the signal 80KHZCLK (which is received from line 70 in FIG. 10), and the clock signal CLKZM. The output of CPLD 1205 is transmitted through a plurality of HEXFET transistors (MOSFET resistors) 1220, 1225 and is then received by transformer 253 as shown. Transformer 253 is also coupled to a voltage source (e.g., +13.7 volts). The purpose of HEXFET transistors 1220, 1225 is to act as switches to create a switching waveform for use by the transformer., 149224=n=2500/(2*20)=62.5, 150394=The clock signal from lead 240 is applied to clock counter 234, and it is also applied to inputs of a divide-by-32 circuit 249 and an AND gate 248. Counter 234 is enabled to count {fraction (1/32)}nd of the time, i.e., at 2500 Hz, by the output of the divide-by-32 circuit 249. The 80 kHz clock also clocks flip-flop 237 to synchronize the terminal count output of counter 234. A RINGENA signal, from a DSP-controlled ASIC register, enables the AND gates 248 and 239 so each gate produces its respective 80 kHz and 20 Hz output in bursts occurring at the ringing cadence frequency., 60002=SLIC 56 provides an electrical interface between the subscriber unit and the subscriber loop, and it is advantageously a circuit which includes a built-in capability to operate with different loop output voltages for different ranges of load (i.e., telephone subscriber loop) resistance. Heretofore in a typical wire-line network application, and using the commercially available SLIC previously identified (AMD 79534), the SLIC output voltage, at 30 milliamperes, to the subscriber loop was approximately 36 volts for a total loop resistance of 1200 ohms, i.e., a loop power consumption of 1.08 watts. Less voltage and less power are needed for lower loop resistances.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been depicted in terms of a particular illustrative embodiment, other embodiments and modifications which will be apparent to those skilled in the art are included within the scope of the invention. In this alternative embodiment, a large amount of current can be switched with low line resistance. Furthermore, by gating off the outpulses for a small period of time near the ring frequency zero crossings, a waveform which resembles a sine wave is obtained. Thus, by removing the high frequency components of the square wave, crossover between adjacent lines is decreased. The effect of gating off the 80 kHz pulses during ring frequency zero crossings is illustrated by FIGS. 14a and 14 b. The waveform in FIG. 14a is the ring signal and the waveform in FIG. 14b is RNGFRQ 74. As can be seen from FIG. 14a, the ring signal is close to zero volts for a small period of time near the RNGFRQ 74 zero crossings. In operation, the 80 kHz clock is retimed with the 2 mHz clock to produce two output signals. Two exemplary output signals are shown in FIG. 13. The frequency of the two outputs signals is also 80 kHz. Each of these signals drives HEXFET transistors 1220, 1225 respectively.
