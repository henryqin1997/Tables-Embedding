    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is equally possible to use, as the first mask pattern, instead of an elongated strip having constant width over its entire length, an elongated strip having alternately wide and narrow part strips or, alternatively, a strip having identical part strips which are joined to one another in an offset manner. In these cases, a similar alignment of the second mask pattern with respect to the first mask pattern is necessary, as indicated in the embodiment described with reference to FIG. 4 to FIG. 9 inclusive. Then the second etching step of dry-etching in an RIE process is performed. This involves the uncovered sections of the top layer 12 of InP being etched away up to the light-guiding InCaAsP layer 10. In the process, the remaining sections of the top layer 12 underneath the elongated strip 24 between the half-strips 34 and between the half-strips 36 are provided with vertical side walls 38. FIG. 13 shows a transverse section along the line XIII--XIII in FIG. 12 through a half-strip 34 after the second etching step. Such a transverse section through a half-strip 36 produces the mirrored image of FIG. 13. A cleaning step is again performed as the last step, in which the remaining quartz sections, viz. the strip 24 and the half-strips 34 and 36 of the first and the third mask pattern, respectively, are removed. Subsequently the whole is again covered on the top",
