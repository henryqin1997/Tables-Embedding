These reactions are carried out at temperatures in the range of from about -20\ufffd C. to about 120\ufffd C., preferably from about 0\ufffd C. to about 35\ufffd C.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been illustrated by certain of the preceding examples, it is not to be construed as being limited thereby; but rather, the invention encompasses the generic area as hereinbefore disclosed. Various modifications and embodiments can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Two grams of the product (Example 12) is polymerized with 4 grams of end-capping monomer (Example 3) under the conditions of Example 12. The end product is light brown and NMR indicates the attachment of the end-capping monomer. EXAMPLE 13 3,5-Diacetoxybenzoic acid (9.67 g, 41 mmol), 1,1,1-tris(4-acetoxyphenyl)ethane (1 g, 2 mmol), Dowtherm A (100 g) and KOAc (0.01 g) were placed into a 3-neck round bottom flask fitted with a thermowell, mechanical stirrer, and distillation head. The Dowtherm A was used to help reduce the melt viscosity. The polymerization was conducted at 260\ufffd C. for 2 hours. A brown solid was isolated by precipitating the dendrimer into MeOH. The brown solid was filtered and dried under vacuum. 13C NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 168.93, 163.55, 162.67, 157.38, 151.22, 148.95, 146.48, 146.09, 131.66, 130.94, 130.76, 129.74, 128.77, 123.23, 121.30, 120.93, 116.88, 115.26, 51.59, 30.5, 20.84. The peaks at 166 and 115 in the 13C NMR indicate partial hydrolysis of the acetate end-groups.
