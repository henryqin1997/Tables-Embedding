See fast imaging with steady precession. Gyngell M. L. The Application of Steady-State Free Precession in Rapid 2DFT NMR Imaging: FAST and CE-FAST Sequences. Magn Reson Imaging 6, 415-419, 1988., 76324=The choice of the flip angle for the RF excitation pulse in the gradient-echo sequence represents a trade-off between increasing the signal strength corresponding to a given phase-encoding step and increasing the effects of the acquisition on the relaxing magnetization. The employment of a constant flip angle for the acquisition, as disclosed in Mugler III J. P., Brookeman J. R., may not yield optimum results in all situations. Three-Dimensional Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo Imaging (3D MP RAGE). Magn Reson Med 15, (152-157), 1990. The theoretical model includes a flip angle that is variable as a function of the phase-encoding step. By proper choice of the flip angle values, the shape of the tissue dependent PSF can be controlled. In optimizing the sequence we would try to derive a flip angle combination that would provide well-behaved (i.e., real, symmetric, relatively low amplitude sidelobes) PSFs and at the same time minimize the net effect of the acquisition on the relaxing magnetization within the CNR and resolution constraints. We note that a TR dependent on the phase-encoding step may also be important for achieving this goal., 48005=Whether 2D or 3D is more efficient in a given imaging situation depends on the repetition time TR, which is chosen based on the desired contrast behavior and the properties of the pulse sequence, and the minimum time for an excite-acquire cycle, TRmin, which is also dependent on the properties of the pulse sequence. The relative values of TR and TRmin determine how many different slice acquisitions can be time-multiplexed within TR. For the pulse sequence techniques in clinical use today, TRs greater than approximately 100 to 200 ms are usually best suited for 2D multi-slice imaging, whereas TRs significantly less than 100 ms are best suited to 3D volume imaging. There is of course an intermediate region where a hybrid approach, multiple 3D volume imaging, is applicable as disclosed in Wilk RM, Harms SE. Temporomandibular Joint: Multislab, Three-Dimensional Fourier Transform MR Imaging. Radiology 167, 861-863, 1988., 94133=Hybrid: Haacke E. M., Bearden F. H., Clayton J. R., Linga N. R. Reduction of MR Imaging Time by the Hybrid Fast-Scan Technique. Radiology 158, 521-529, 1986., 53896=The 3D short-TR gradient-echo sequences can be divided into two general categories, those which employ a steady state of only the longitudinal component of the magnetization vector (e.g., FLASH, FFE) and those which employ a steady state of the complete magnetization vector (e.g., GRASS, FAST, FISP). The major practical difference between the two sequence categories is the resulting image contrast properties as disclosed in van der Meulen P, Groen J. P., Tinus A. M. C., Bruntink G. Fast Field Echo Imaging: An Overview and Contrast Calculations. Magn Reson Imaging 6, 355-368, 1988) and Tkach J. A., Haacke E. M. A Comparison of Fast Spin Echo and Gradient Field Echo Sequences. Magn Reson Imaging 6, 373-389, 1988. It is important to note that the 3D implementations of the longitudinal steady-state sequences, which are employed if T1-weighted contrast is desired, have been prone to slice-to-slice intensity banding artifacts as disclosed in Wood ML, Runge V. M. Artifacts Due to Residual Magnetization in Three-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Med Phys 15, 825-831, 1988. In these sequences, some type of spoiling is employed to destroy the coherence of the transverse magnetization after the echo signal is sampled. Therefore, the transverse magnetization generated by a given excitation pulse contributes only to the signal measured in the echo period immediately following the pulse. This is the ideal case, and if the spoiling is incomplete the residual transverse magnetization may create artifacts in the image. Traditionally, various combinations of magnetic field gradients have been employed in an attempt to eliminate these artifacts as disclosed in Wood ML, Runge V. M. Artifacts Due to Residual Magnetization in Three-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Med Phys 15, 825-831, 1988 and Frahm J., Hanicke W., Merboldt K-D. Transverse Coherence in Rapid FLASH NMR Imaging. J Magn Reson 72, 307-314, 1987 and Wood M. L., Silver M, Runge V. M. Optimization of Spoiler Gradients in FLASH MRI.

However, gradients alone generally have been found to be incapable of totally preventing the artifacts in the 3D case., 30548=The importance of rapid imaging techniques is discussed in the Manual of Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging, (CMRI) by Heiken et al., Raven Press, New York, 1991. It is therein explained that the impetus for the development of rapid imaging techniques has been primarily twofold: to improve the efficiency of clinical MRI and to decrease artifacts that arise from cardiac, respiratory, and other patient motion. The synopsis of the more important rapid imaging techniques discussed in CMRI, at pages 24 through 39, is incorporated herein by reference, as though set forth in detail. At page 31, it is noted that steady state GE images with short TRs and low flip angles provide a myelogram effect in which the spinal cord can be easily differentiated from surrounding CSF., 77548=The order of the phase-encoding is critical in determining the contrast properties of the image. Various phase-encoding schemes have been successfully employed in previous MR techniques such as respiratory ordered phase encoding as disclosed in Bailes D. R., Gilderdale D. J., Bydder G. M., et al. Respiratory Ordered Phase Encoding (ROPE): A Method for Reducing Respiratory Motion Artefacts in MR Imaging. J Comput Assist Tomogr 9, 835-838, 1985 and RARE imaging. The modification of the phase-encoding order to improve the characteristics of the point spread function and provide access to a wider range of image contrast properties is discussed in Mugler III J. P., Spraggins T. A.. Improving Image Quality in Snapshot FLASH and 3D MP RAGE Sequences by Employing Reordered Phase Encoding. \"Works-in-Progess\" Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 9th Annual Meeting, 1310, 1990., 87417=FIG. 4 shows images from a 3D MP RAGE acquisition of the head of a normal volunteer acquired in the sagittal orientation. The image matrix was 128 (180 mm) by 128 (250 mm) by 256 (250 mm), interpolated to 128\ufffd256\ufffd256. This yields voxels with dimensions of 1.4 by 1.0 (interpolated) by 1.0 mm. The total imaging time was 5.92 min. The magnetization preparation consisted of an inversion pulse followed by a 500 ms delay which produced strong T1 weighting in the image. Each RAGE acquisition acquired 128 lines in 1280 ms (TR/TE 10/4.15, FLASH type sequence, 10\ufffd flip angle). The recovery period was 1 s. FIGS. 4b-4d show coronal (b and c) and transverse (d) images reformatted from the original sagittal acquisition. The images display excellent gray/white contrast compared to the standard T1-dependent imaging sequences we currently employ (400/15 2D spin echo and 30/5 3D FLASH). Due to the very short TE of the RAGE acquisition and the small voxel sizes, the images do not show any significant susceptibility artifacts at air/soft tissue and bone/soft tissue interfaces. In FIG. 4c, note the bright appearance of the blood in the arteries surrounding the pituitary. During the 500 ms delay period, fully magnetized blood flows into the transmit/receive head coil resulting in an inflow enhancement effect for the arteries. Blood that experiences the inversion pulse, such as that in the venous structures, appears dark in the images., 99396=Snapshot FLASH imaging: Haase et al (Haase A., Matthaei D., Bartkowski R., et al. Inversion Recovery Snapshot FLASH MR Imaging. J Comput Assist Tomogr 13, 1036-1040, 1989. Haase A. Snapshot FLASH MRI. Applications to T1, T2, and Chemical-Shift Imaging. Magn Reson Med 13, 77-89, 1990., 58524=The vast majority of pulse sequences in clinical use today employ a steady-state acquisition. This may be in the form of a steady state of the longitudinal component of the magnetization vector (e.g., spin-echo or FLASH) or of the complete magnetization vector (e.g., GRASS or FISP). In either case, each line (assuming a Fourier transform method) of spatial frequency space is equivalently weighted with respect to the tissue relaxation parameters. There are some notable exceptions which sample the magnetization during a transient, for example Echo-Planar, Hybrid imaging and RARE imaging, but these techniques have not yet found widespread clinical use. Echo-Planar is disclosed in Mansfield P. Multi-Planar Image Formation Using NMR Spin Echos J Phys C 10, L55, 1977. Hybrid imaging is disclosed in Haacke E. M., Bearden F. H., Clayton J. R., Linga N. R. Reduction of MR Imaging Time by the Hybrid Fast-Scan Technique. Radiology 158, 521-529, 1986 and RARE imaging is disclosed in J, Nauerth A., Friedburg H. RARE Imaging: A Fast Imaging Method for Clinical MR. Magn Reson Med 3, 823-833, 1986., 46266=Truncation artifacts in the third dimension usually become pronounced with slice thicknesses greater than about 2 to 3 mm, as disclosed in Carlson J., Crooks L., Ortendahl D., et al. Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Section Thickness in Two-dimensional versus Three-dimensional Fourier Transform MR Imaging. Radiology 166, 266-270, 1988., 79491=As one can seen from the outline of the theoretical model, numerous parameters combine to determine the image SNR and CNR behavior in 3D MP RAGE sequences. (Even for the very simple case of an inversion recovery preparation, fixed flip angle acquisition, and a specific phase-encoding scheme, there are 6 variables.) In addition, many of the parameters are coupled and constrained based on requirements on the total imaging time, minimum resolution, maximum chemical shift artifact, and so on. Some imaging applications require only simple optimization goals such as maximizing the SNR from a single tissue, or the CNR for a single tissue pair, subject to the other imaging requirements and constraints. However, given the complexity of the human body, such simple requirements are not always sufficient. For example, a very reasonable goal would be to maximize the CNR for one tissue pair while minimizing the signal from one or more other tissues. Thus, it will be necessary for the optimization technique to search for maxima or minima based on multiple, possibly interrelated goals. For the situation described, optimization by global search would be far too time consuming. The routine employed must handle a multi-dimensional, nonlinear, constrained optimization and complicated goal functions. Traditional optimization strategies such as direction-set methods or conjugate gradient methods, are not suited to this type of problem are disclosed in Brent R. P.

RARE Imaging: A Fast Imaging Method for Clinical MR. Magn Reson Med 3, 823-833, 1986., 62765=In an MP RAGE sequence, the data acquisition occurs during a T1-dependent transient. Sampling the magnetization during a transient presents many technical problems with the design of MP RAGE sequences, analogous to some of those encountered with T2 decay in echo-planar and RARE imaging. Whereas the original technique of Haase acquires the complete image data in one-shot, there have already been extensions as disclosed in Edelman R. R, Atkinson D. J., Wallner B, et al. Breath-Hold Abdominal STI. R. and T2-Weighted Imaging Using an Interleaved Ultrafast Gradient-Echo Sequence. \"Works in Progress\", Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 8th Annual Meeting, 35, 1990 and Bottcher U., Norris D., Leibfritz D. Sequential Inversion Recovery Snapshot-FLASH. Magn Reson Imaging 8(S1), 16, 1990 (abstract) to collecting the data for a 2D image in several distinct prepare-acquire cycles (i.e. a multi-shot approach), thus reducing the effects of the transient acquisition on the image contrast by employing a set of shorter RAGE acquisitions in place of the original longer RAGE acquisition., 50153=For the in-plane image matrix sizes commonly employed (128 or 256), a TR of less than 100 ms is required for high-resolution large-volume (e.g., 64 or more phase-encoding steps in the third dimension) 3D image sets to be acquired in clinically reasonable times (less than approximately 15 minutes). This sequence requirement was met with the introduction in the mid-1980s of the short-TR, partial flip angle gradient-echo sequences, such as FLASH, FFE, GRASS, FAST and FISP. FLASH is disclosed in Haase A, Frahm J, Matthaei D, et al., FLASH Imaging. Rapid NMR Imaging Using Low Flip-Angle Pulses.

Other applications include magnetic resonance angiography., 66564=When the snapshot FLASH technique was implemented on whole-body machines, results similar to those demonstrated by Haase were obtained, as disclosed in Kiefer B., Deimling M., Finelli D. Ultrafast Measurement of T1- and T2-weighted Images with \"SNA. P.SHOT\"-FLASH. Book of Abstracts, 8th Annual Meeting of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 1989, p 367. However, due to the very low flip angles and to the high sampling bandwidth secondary to the very short repetition time, the signal to noise ratios per volume of these images were very low compared to those for the spin-echo or gradient-echo techniques routinely employed in clinical imaging. If the sequence were simply repeated, as in a direct transformation to a 3D multi-shot implementation, some improvement in the signal-to-noise would of course result due to the second phase-encoding direction. However the contrast properties would be greatly affected due to the repeated application of the preparation and acquisition, and for more than a very few cycles the advantage of a very short total scan time would be lost. The short scan time was the primary impetus behind the magnetization prepared snapshot FLASH technique. Thus, it appeared that the potential role of the magnetization prepared snapshot FLASH technique was imaging moving structures or dynamic processes with relatively high temporal resolution and freely controllable image contrast. It was not obvious that some sort of extension to a multi-shot three-dimensional imaging strategy would yield results of any particular value., 46616=Three-dimensional volume techniques can provide several advantages over two-dimensional multi-slice techniques. As discussed above, the 3D acquisition inherently provides contiguous slices and the functional form of the slice profile does not change with the spacing between the slices. If the 3D acquisition employs isotropic, or nearly isotropic, resolution, the volume data set can be reformatted to yield high-resolution contiguous image slices in any arbitrary orientation, as disclosed in Lai C-M, Lauterbur P.

Fast Three-Dimensional Snapshot FLASH MR Studies. Radiology 173(P), 289, 1989 (abstract). The multi-shot 3D approach, of the instant invention, known as 3D MP RAGE as disclosed in Mugler III J.

Reordered phase encoding can provide an improved point spread function and a substantial increase in the CNRs as disclosed in Mugler III J. P., Spraggins T. A. Improving Image Quality in Snapshot FLASH and 3D MP RAGE Sequences by Employing Reordered Phase Encoding. \"Works-in-Progress\" Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 9th Annual Meeting, 1310, 1990., 96661=Matrix size: Specifies the number of data points along each dimension in the digital image or volume image set. For example, a 2D image might be specified as 128\ufffd256, and a 3D image set might be specified as 128\ufffd128\ufffd128, or equivalently 1283., 89365=FIG. 6 shows transverse T2-weighted head images (2 mm thick) of a normal volunteer from a 3D set of 32 slices. The total acquisition time was 4.3 minutes (preparation: driven equilibrium (90\ufffd-180\ufffd-90\ufffd) with an echo time of 56 ms followed by a 42 ms delay for spoiling; acquisition: FISP sequence with TR/TE/Flip 14/5/10\ufffd, matrix 32\ufffd128\ufffd256, FOV 250 mm, centrally reordered phase encoding in the slice select direction; recovery: 1454 ms)., 59643=A pulse sequence technique, called snapshot FLASH imaging, is initiated by some type of contrast preparation, followed by a very rapid, or snapshot, FLASH image acquisition. The use of a distinct magnetization preparation period largely separates the generation of the image contrast from the acquisition of the 318 image data. Haase's snapshot FLASH sequence acquired a 64\ufffd128 image in less than 200 ms. The speed of this technique clearly makes it suitable for imaging certain dynamic processes or for reducing flow and motion artifacts. Decoupling the contrast preparation from the acquisition potentially provides many interesting applications. It is noted that the use of a contrast preparation followed by a rapid acquisition has also been demonstrated with echo-planar imaging as disclosed in Stehling M. K., Ordidge R. J., Coxon R, et al. Ultra-High-Speed Inversion Recovery Echo Planar MR Imaging: Technique and Application. Radiology 169(P), 377, 1988 (abstract). Stehling M. K., Ordidge R. J., Coxon R., Mansfield P. Inversion-Recovery Echo-Planar Imaging (I. R.-EPI) at 0.5T. Magn Reson Med 13, 514-517, 1990., 65144=Generalizing and extending the work of Haase et al on snap-shot FLASH to the general three dimensional case presented several problems. For example, due to the structure and complexity of our technique, 3D MP RAGE, the contrast behavior of the images displays a complicated dependence on many sequence parameters. The snapshot FLASH technique which employs repetition times for the gradient-echo sequence on the order of 5 ms or less and flip angles of 5\ufffd or less, was designed to acquire an image or images very rapidly in comparison to existing routine clinical techniques. The snapshot FLASH technique is disclosed in Haase A., Matthaei D., Bartkowski R., et al. Inversion Recovery Snapshot FLASH MR Imaging, J Comput Assist Tomogr 13, 1036-1040, 1989. Haase A. Snapshot FLASH MRI, and Applications to T1, T2, and Chemical-Shift Imaging. Magn Reson Med 13, 77-89, 1990. The original published work demonstrated 64\ufffd128 images acquired in approximately 200 ms. As presented by Haase, the combination of the very short acquisition time and the minimal effect of a series of very low flip angle pulses on the longitudinal magnetization allowed the snapshot FLASH technique to be used in combination with specific contrast preparations and yield meaningful imaging results. It is noted that the experimental work of Haase was performed on a 40 cm. bore 4.7 Tesla imager, that is, a nonclinical machine., 92745=FLASH: Fast Low-Angle Shot. Haase A., Frahm J., Matthaei D., et al. FLASH Imaging. Rapid NMR Imaging Using Low Flip-Angle Pulses. J Magn Reson 67, 258-266, 1986., 45203=In the 3D case (neglecting any effects of the RF pulses), the integrand for all directions is proportional to the inverse Fourier transform of the corresponding filter function in spatial frequency space. Assuming ideal conditions and no data windowing, the multiplicative term (i.e., the point spread function or PSF) for the weighted proton density has the same form for each direction. This fact is advantageous if the image data is acquired with isotropic, or nearly isotropic, resolution and the 3D volume of data is reformatted to yield images in planes other than reference orientation. However, if the slice thickness (spacing in the second phase-encoding direction) is large compared to the in-plane resolution, truncation artifacts arising from the sidelobes of the PSF will be significantly worse in the slice direction as disclosed in Carlson J., Crooks L., Ortendahl D., et al., and Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Section Thickness in Two-dimensional versus Three-dimensional Fourier Transform MR Imaging. Radiology 166, 266-270, 1988., 44746=The cross-talk between closely spaced slices can be a disadvantage of 2D multi-slice acquisitions for closely spaced or contiguous slices, but we note that a tremendous amount of research effort has been dedicated to optimizing RF inversion, excitation, and refocusing profiles to minimize slice-to-slice interference, as disclosed for example in Warren W. S., Silver M., in Advances in Magnetic Resonance, Academic Press, 12, 248, 1988., 60784=The snapshot FLASH technique is the first member of a rapidly growing new family of pulse sequences which employ as the basic sequence element a magnetization preparation period followed by a data acquisition period using a short-TR gradient-echo sequence. The acquisition period can employ any of the standard gradient-echo techniques, such as FLASH, GRASS or FISP, or specially modified gradient-echo techniques. The acquisition period should be relatively short compared to the T1 values of interest. The acronym applicable to the acquisition portion of this type of sequence is RAGE for rapid gradient echo. The 2D implementations of these magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP RAGE) sequences have already shown very promising initial results for perfusion, cardiac and abdominal imaging The perfusion imaging is disclosed in Finelli D. A., Kiefer B., Deimling M., et al. Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Perfusion Studies of the Brain with Snapshot FLASH. Radiology 173(P), 42, 1989 (abstract) and Atkinson D. J., Burstein D, Edelman R. R.

R. and T2-Weighted Imaging Using an Interleaved Ultrafast Gradient-Echo Sequence. \"Works in Progress\", Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 8th Annual Meeting, 35, 1990., 85836=Imaging was performed on a standard whole-body imager operating at a field strength of 1.5T (Siemens Magnetom 63SP, Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, N.J.). FIG. 3 shows images from a 3D MP RAGE acquisition through the abdomen of a normal volunteer in the sagittal orientation. The image matrix was 128 (350 mm) by 128 (350 mm) by 256 (700 mm). This yields cubic voxels 2.7 mm on a side. The total imaging time was 7.18 min. The magnetization preparation consisted of an inversion pulse followed by a 350 ms delay which produced strong T1 weighting in the image. Each RAGE acquisition acquired 128 lines in 1024 ms (TR/TE 8/3.3, FLASH type sequence, 10\ufffd flip angle) and was performed at end expiration. The recovery period was 2 s. Respiratory triggering was not used and instead, the subject voluntarily respired in synchrony with the sequence. FIGS. 3b-3d show coronal (b and c) and transverse (d) images reformatted from the original sagittal acquisition. Since each RAGE acquisition was only 1 s, image artifacts from stomach, bowel, and cardiac motions appear predominantly in one phase-encoding direction (horizontal in FIG. 3a). Note the sharp definition of the upper edge of the liver in FIGS. 3a-3c. Examination of the anterior subcutaneous fat in FIGS. 3a and 3d reveals only minor artifacts from respiration. Note the relatively black appearance of flowing blood as seen in FIG. 3c. This feature may prove very valuable in relation to studies of vessels diseased with atherosclerosis., 39466=The three-dimensional (3D) MRI technique of the present invention employs a magnetization preparation-data acquisition-magnetization recovery cycle as the basic sequence element. Our new pulse sequence technique generalizes and extends the basic, prepare-acquire, philosophy introduced by Haase et al in 1989 with the snapshot FLASH technique., 57461=Another class of sequences that have played a minor role in 3D imaging are the spin-echo sequences which employ pulse angles other than 90\ufffd for the RF excitation pulse as disclosed in Tkach J. A., Haacke E. M. A Comparison of Fast Spin Echo and Gradient Field Echo Sequences. Magn Reson Imaging 6, 373-389, 1988 and Mugler III J. P., Brookeman J. R. Rapid 3D Spin-Echo Imaging Using Large Flip Angle Excitation. Magn Reson Imaging 6(S1), 53, 1988 (abstract). These sequences can provide TR's of 100 ms or slightly less, yielding much more reasonable 3D acquisition times than the standard 90\ufffd-180\ufffd sequences. The 3D spin-echo sequences of course provide the advantage of a decreased sensitivity to artifacts from field inhomogeneities and susceptibility changes in comparison to their gradient echo counterparts. At higher field strengths, however, power deposition may be a problem due to the closely spaced 180\ufffd pulses. These 3D spin-echo sequences have not yet found widespread application., 42105=Each discrete intensity value (assuming a magnitude representation) in the image data represents an integral of the proton density, weighted by the T1 and T2 relaxation times, over a small volume (neglecting flow or other effects). For the standard Fourier transform imaging technique, the data values are equally spaced along each of 2 (or 3) mutually orthogonal axes corresponding to the read out direction and phase-encoding direction(s). In the 2D case, the integrand corresponding to the two in-plane directions is proportional to the inverse Fourier transform of any filter function applied to the spatial frequency data in the given direction. In the ideal case, assuming the data is not windowed with a smoothing function, the integrand is the weighted proton density times a sinc function, as disclosed in Bracewell RN. The Fourier Transform and its Applications, 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978. For the axis perpendicular to the image plane, the integrand is the weighted proton density times the slice profile for the image, which is determined by the net effect of the radio frequency (RF) pulse or pulses in the sequence, as disclosed in Rosen B.
