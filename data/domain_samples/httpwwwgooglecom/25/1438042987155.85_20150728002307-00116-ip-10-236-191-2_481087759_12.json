Macrolides are generally bacteriostatic, but have been shown to be bacteriocidal in high concentration against very susceptible organisms. Macrolides are most effective against gram-position cocci and bacilli, although they do possess some activity against some gram-negative organism. Macrolides exert their bacteriostatic activity by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the 50 S ribosomal subunit.

This class of agents kills insects by acting on the gamma-butyric acid receptor of invertebrates. Such agents are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,429, U.S. Pat.

The compounds which belong to this series are either natural products or are semi-synthetic derivatives thereof. The structure of these two series of compounds are closely related and they both share a complex 16-membered macrocyclic lactone ring; however, the milbemycin do not contain the aglycone substitutent in the 13-position of the lactone ring. The natural product avermectins are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,519 to Albers-Schonberg, et al., and the 22, 23-dihydro avermectin compounds are disclosed in Chabala, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,199,569. For a general discussion of avermectins, which include a discussion of their uses in humans and animals, see \u201cIvermectin and Abamectin,\u201d W. C. Campbell, ed., Springer-Verlag, New York (1989).

(See, e.g., the Example, wherein for instance 0.25 75/25 PLGA was dissolved in glycerol formal to provide a 2.5 ml solution; in a separate flask 75/25 PLGA was dissolved in triacetin to provide a 2.5 ml solution; the two solutions were mixed and added to a flask containing 0.50 g active ingredient which was dissolved into the mixed PLGA solutions; the amount of triacetin present in the formulation to be about 42% by weight; other formulations contain as little as 6.7% and 5% PLGA content with the drug content at 10% or 5%.), 55105=The present invention further provides a liquid polymeric composition comprising: (1) about 1-30% w/v of at least one bioactive substance (e.g., hydrophobic bioactive substance); (2) about 1-20% w/v of at least one biologically acceptable \u201cpolymer\u201d (including \u201ccopolymer\u201d, a polymer polymerized by at least two comonomers) (e.g., poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer), for instance, wherein the weight ratio of the polymer to the bioactive substance can be 1:1 or less, e.g., 0.5:1 to 1:1; and (3) at least one lipophilic solvent or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic solvent and at least one lipophilic solvent, e.g., at least one biologically or physiologically or medically or veterinarily acceptable hydrophilic solvent and at least one biologically or physiologically or medically or veterinarily acceptable lipophilic solvent wherein the volume ratio of the hydrophilic and lipophilic (or hydrophobic) solvents is from about about 80:20 to about 0:100, for instance about 80:20 to about 10:90 or about 80:20 to about 5:95, hydrophilic and lipophilic solvents, e.g., about 65:35 to about 35:65, and/or wherein the the water immiscible or lipophilic solvent is present in an amount of at least about 16.5% by weight (e.g., including 16.465% by weight), such as at least about 16.5% to about 45% by weight, for instance at least about 16.5% to about 30% by weight (e.g., at least about 29% by weight), or at least about 20% or about 25% by weight to about 30%, 35%, 40% or 45% by weight, or at least greater than 40% by weight (for instance and at least about 42-45% by weight); e.g., such compositions wherein there is less than 10% of the polymer and 1 to 10% of the bioactive active substance or about less than 7% (e.g., 6.7%) or 5% or less polymer, with the bioactive substance content at less than or equal to about 10% or 5%., 69763=The androgens and antiandrogens structurally related to the estrogens and progestins as they are also biosynthesized from cholesterol. These compounds are based on testosterone. Androgens are used for hypogonadism and promote muscle development. Antiandrogens are used, for example, in the management of hyperplasia and carcinoma of the prostate, acne, and male pattern baldness as well as in the inhibition of the sex drive in men who are sex offenders. Estrogen, progestins, and androgens are described, for example, in \u201cGoodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,\u201d 9th ed., J. G. Handman and L. Elimbird, eds., Ch. 57 to 60, pp. 1411-1485, McGraw Hill, New York (1996) or in \u201cPrinciples of Medicinal Chemistry,\u201d 2nd ed., W. O. Foye, ed., Ch. 21, pp. 495-559, Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia (1981)., 88453=The presence of the lipophilic solvent in the liquid composition of the present invention reduces the initial delivery of bioactive compound, thus eliminating the bursting drug release typical of existing liquid injectable formulations where a large portion of hydrophilic vehicle is used. The presence of the hydrophilic solvent facilitates the formation of the polymer skin while preventing precipitation of the bioactive compound, thus allowing a much higher level of drug delivery than possible when only lipophilic vehicles are used. In the present invention, the prefered hydrophilic:lipophilic solvent ratio is between 80:20 to 20:80, most preferably between 65:35 to 35:65., 85994=\u201cPoly(lactide-co-glycolide)\u201d means a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids having a lactide:glycolide ratio of from 95:05 to 50:50, preferably 75:25 to 65:35. The lactic acid can be d- or l- or dl-. The copolymer may be a single copolymer of a mixture of copolymers within the above-defined parameters., 37463=Mention is also made of: Shah et al (J. Controlled Release, 1993, 27:139-147), as relating to formulations for sustained release of bioactive compounds containing various concentrations of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid copolymer (PLGA) dissolved in vehicles such as triacetin; Lambert and Peck (J. Controlled Release, 1995, 33:189-195), as a study of the release of protein from a 20% PLGA solution in N-methylpyrrolidone exposed to aqueous fluid; and Shivley et al (J. Controlled Release, 1995, 33:237-243), as a study of the solubility parameter of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer in a variety of solvents, and the in vivo release of naltrexone from two injectable implants (5% naltrexone in either 57% PLGA and 38% N-methylpyrrolidone or 35% PLGA and 60% N-methylpyrrolidone).}",

Plasma levels of eprinomectin were determined in swine treated with eprinomectin formulation 2 of Example 3. Three swine (inoculated with 2,000 infective ova of Trichuris suis on day -50, and orally with 15,000 infective larvae of Oesophagostomum sp. on day 0) were injected subcutaneously with formulation 2 of Example 3 at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Ten ml blood samples were collected from each animal on days 3, 7 and weekly thereafter. The plasma level profile is shown in FIG. 3 (with alternate formulation of drug/PLGA in 100 glycerol formal). Plasma Level Profiles of Long-Acting Eprinomectin Formulation in Swine Example 6 Plasma levels of ivermectin were determined in healthy cattles treated with ivermectin formulations 1, 2 and 3 of Example 2. Each formulation was given to a group of five cattles (generally weighing 125 to 250 kg) as a single subcutaneous injection dosed at 1 mg/kg. Ten ml haparinized blood samples were collected from each treated animal on Days 1-7 (daily), 10, 14, and weekly thereafter for 15 weeks. The plasma level profiles (average of the five animals",
