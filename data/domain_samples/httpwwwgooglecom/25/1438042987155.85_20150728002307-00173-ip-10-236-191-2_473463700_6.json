Techniques for denaturing and binding are well known in the art. (See for example, P. 331, Molecular Cloning, by Maniatis, Fritsch, and Sambrook, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982, reproduced as Appendix A herein.), 14624=This is a division of application Ser. No. 06/681,055, filed Dec. 13, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,750., 43032=Sample bacteriophage \u03bb-DNA was obtained from Bethesda Research Laboratories in Gaithersburg, Md., Catalogue Number 5250. The target sequence chosen corresponds to the sequence of nucleotides starting at base 145 and ending at base 224. (See \"Nucleotide Sequence of cro, c II, and part of the 0 gene in Phage \u03bb-DNA,\" E. Schwarz, et al., Nature, 272, Mar. 30, 1978.), 61980=6 \u03bcl \u03b3-32 P ATP, specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol, concentration 3.3 pmol/\u03bcl, 61675=1 \u03bcl \u03b3-32 P ATP, specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol, concentration 3.3 pmol/\u03bcl, 18199=This direct Southern blot approach used for sickle-cell disease cannot be used, however, for genetic diseases where the mutation does not alter a restriction site, for example, as in \u03b11 -antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disease which subjects the individual to greatly increased risk of developing pulmonary emphysema or infantile liver cirrhosis. There, the mutant gene has a single base change (G\u2192A) that leads to an amino acid substitution (GLU\u2192LYS) at residue 342, thereby producing a non-functional protein. This substitution does not, however, create or destroy a restriction site for any of the currently known restriction enzymes as in sickle-cell anemia. Hence, a straightforward analysis of restriction fragments to search for an altered restriction site is not possible. A technique has been developed, however, which can be used in this situation. (See \"Detection of Sickle-cell \u03b2s -globin Allele by Hybridization with Synthetic Oligonucleotides,\" by Brenda J. Conner, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol 80, pp. 278-282, (Jan 1983), and \"Prenatal Diagnosis of \u03b11 -Antitrypsin Deficiency by Direct Analysis of the Mutation Site in the Gene,\" by Vincent J. Kidd, et al., New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 310, No. 10, (March 1984).) This second technique is to synthesize a 19-base long oligonucleotide (hereinafter a 19-mer) that is complementary to the normal \u03b11 -antitrypsin sequence around the mutation site. The 19-mer is labeled and used as a probe to distinguish normal from mutant genes by raising the stringency of hybridization to a level at which the 19-mer will hybridize stably to the normal gene, to which it is perfectly complementary, but not to the mutant gene, with which it has the single base pair mismatch. (By stringency, it is meant the combination of conditions to which nucleic acids are subject that cause the duplex to dissociate, such as temperature, ionic strength, and concentration of additives, such as formamide. Conditions that are more likely to cause the duplex to dissociate are called \"higher\" stringency, e.g., higher temperature, lower ionic strength, and higher concentration of formamide.) Similarly, if it is desired to detect the mutant gene, instead of the normal gene, a 19-mer is used which is complementary to the mutant \u03b11 -antitrypsin sequence around the mutant site. Hence, by using synthetic probes complementary to the sequence of interest in a Southern blot analysis, and varying the stringency, normal and mutant genes can be distinguished.}",
