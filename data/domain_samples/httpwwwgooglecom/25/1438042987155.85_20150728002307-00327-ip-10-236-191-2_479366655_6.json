    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{54764=[0048] Q=0.1056 A, 71046=[0072] The axis of rotation of the tibia on the femur is 90 degrees to the path of the tibial plateau against the femoral condyle. The two tibial plateaus (medial and lateral) are not in the same plane with each other but do act in a relatively constant radius to its respective femoral condyle. In other words, although the symmetry of the device's femoral side may be matched with the femoral condyle while the leg is in full extension, the rotation of the tibial plateau against the femoral condyle is along a constant axis of rotation (90 degrees to the axis of rotation), thus the angularity of the axis of symmetry of the femoral condyle relative to the axis of symmetry of the tibial plateau is not parallel but at some acute angle. Also, the axis of symmetry of the tibial plateau is not parallel to the path of rotation of the tibia relative to the femur but also at some mildly acute angle. Thus, the true orientation of the device, regardless of the relative orientations of symmetry of the tibial side to the femoral side is 90 degrees to the true axis of rotation as described in Hollister et al., \u201cThe Axes of Rotation of the Knee\u201d, Clin. Orthopaedics and Rel. Res., 290 pp. 259-268, J. B. Lippincott Co., 1993, herein incorporated by reference. Any localized positions of higher loads are self-limiting due to the ability of the device to translate both rotationally and laterally which mimics the true motion of the natural meniscus as described by Hollister., 44798=[0015] Newer materials technologies in development include filling the joint space by injecting polyurethane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,353) into the joint and anchoring it with holes drilled into the tibial plateau. Others include a series of polymeric materials such as PVA Hydrogels in a titanium mesh as described by Chang et al, \u201cHistorical Comparison of Tibial Articular Surfaces Against Rigid Materials And Artificial Articular Cartilage,\u201d Journal of Biomedical Material Research, 37, 51-59, 1997, biodegradable anhydride prepolymers that can be cross linked with irradiation by UV light (U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,599) and in-vivo grown articular chondrocytes in a collagen fiber or other bio-compatible scaffold (U.S. Pat. No. 5,158,574). Other low surface energy materials, such as low temperature isotropic (LTI) pyrolitic carbon, have been investigated as bearing surfaces as well., 54825=[0049] Y=0.1152 A, 68106=[0069] The high modulus of the present device thus allows for the provision of recessed or non-contacting areas of the device to encourage articular cartilage regeneration. In softer, lower modulus materials, the naturally occurring loads, which may exceed 1000 lbs/in2, in certain cases, will cause the softer devices to deform and allow ordinarily non-contracting areas to contact bone or cartilage for which contact is not desired. A flexural modulus of elasticity for load bearing portions of the present device should therefore be preferably greater than 2\ufffd105 psi, and more preferably greater than 3\ufffd106 psi. Portions of the device not exposed to the highest loads may be made of lower modulus materials, which may be softer as well (e.g., in a non-limiting sense, nylon, polyurethane, polypropylene, polyester, and the like, optionally fiber reinforced).}",
