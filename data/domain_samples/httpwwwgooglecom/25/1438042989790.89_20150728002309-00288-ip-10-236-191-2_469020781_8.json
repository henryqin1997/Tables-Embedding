The circuit 5 comprises a voltage level control circuit 51 including a voltage conversion device 511, an N type MOS power transistor 512 and an inductor 513. The voltage conversion device 511 receives a DC input of a first voltage level from a DC power source Vin, which can be for example 10-13 volts of direct current, and converts the input voltage to an output voltage Vout having a second level that is different from, preferably greater than, the first voltage level. An example of the voltage conversion device 511 is IC model No. LTC 1624 available from Linear Technology Corporation, Milpitas, Calif., U.S.A.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention which is intended to be defined by the appended claims. FIG. 6 shows a third embodiment of the circuit of the adapter system of the present invention. The circuit 5 comprises a switch 48 arranged in the casing 1. The switch 48 is changeably switched among the second ends of the resistors R3-R6 (namely the voltage selection lines or the voltage selection terminals V1-V4) and has an output connected to a conductive member Vs fixed in the housing of the second end connection device 3. In this case, the conductive members associated with voltage selection terminals V1-V4 are omitted from the housing of the second end connection device 3. Corresponding to omission of the voltage selection terminals V1-V4 of the second end connection device 3, the voltage selection terminals V1\u2032-V4\u2032 of the connector 4 are omitted too. Instead, a conductive member labeled Vs\u2032 is provided in the connector 4 for engaging the output Vs of the switch 48 of the circuit 5. The conductive member Vs\u2032 is connected to the negative power terminal V\u2212\u2032. Although in the first embodiment with reference to FIG. 4, one of the voltage selection terminals V1\u2032-V4\u2032 and the corresponding",
