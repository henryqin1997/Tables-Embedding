    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{46286=The optical assembly 60 used in the preferred embodiment is well known in the art and is fabricated from a lightweight, impact-resistant plastic material. The optical assembly comprises a focusing lens 62 and a linear CCD array 64, which comprises 2048 elements or pixels. The focusing lens 62 serves to focus an image of the target bar code symbol 3 onto the CCD array 64 for image capture and subsequent processing as desired. The juxtaposition of the optical assembly 60 within the housing 6 of the scanner 1 is arranged to provide a focused image at the plane located below the symbol illumination window 38. Sharp focus of the image of the bar code symbol 3 is critical in this contact scanning operation since the scanner 1 is capable of scanning and decoding high density PDF417 symbols., 53059=The bar code digitizer circuit 100 thus operates to provide a digital bar pattern DBP from the CCD analog output a the high scan rate of 1000 scans/second in order to allow high speed scanning of the symbol 3 at the high resolution of 800dpi in accordance with the present invention. The user may the advantageously scan a dense PDF417 symbol 3 at a faster rate of speed than has heretofore been possible in the prior art., 49905=In order to obtain successfully scan and decode a dense PDF417 symbol 3, the scanner 1 scans at a resolution of 800 dots per inch (dpi). Since prior art CCD page scanners typically collect data at a rate of approximately 200 scans/second, it would take a user approximately four seconds to scan down across a one inch long PDF417 symbol. This relatively long scan time of the symbol results in the user inadvertently misaligning the scanner 1 as he sweeps it down across the symbol, which ultimately results is misdecodes by the computer. Thus, in order to properly obtain the requisite amount of scan data for a dense PDF417 symbol 3, the scanner 1 of the present invention scans the symbol at the rate of 1000 scans/second, which results in a scan time of only 8 seconds for a one inch long PDF417 symbol., 27452=This application claim the benefit of U.S. Provision Application No. 60/019,789, filed Jun. 4, 1996.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the following claims. In a further alternative embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in FIG. 14, the scanner 1 of the present invention is used in conjunction with a mating card tray 80. This mode of operation of the scanner 1 allows the user to easily scan symbol located on small substrates such as business cards and the like. Attempting to hold onto the business card with one hand and roll the scanner 1 over the card can be unwieldy and difficult to maintain in constant alignment. By using the tray 80 of the present invention, the user simply snaps the scanner into a receiving portion on the tray 80, inserts the target card into the recess on the tray, and triggers and pulls the scanner over the card for scanning thereof The alignment of the card and the scanner 1 remains constant throughout the scanning operation, thus ensuring quick, accurate imaging and decoding of the target symbol. The tray 80 is fabricated from a lightweight",
