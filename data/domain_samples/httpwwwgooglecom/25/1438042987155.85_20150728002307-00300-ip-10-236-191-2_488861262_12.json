Accordingly, the invention is intended to embrace all of the alternatives and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The above references are hereby incorporated by reference. The adhesion is measured immediately after extrusion and 8 days later. The adhesion was evaluated by peeling with a free peeling angle at a crossing rate of 200 mm/min on precut test pieces 15 mm wide and 20 mm long. In Examples 50, 51 and 52, the binders:L 48,1 and L 49,1 were evaluated as binders of the PP/binder/EVOH 3-layer system, compared with a standard binder (OREVAC 2). The PP is PP 3021 GN 3 and EVOH is SOARNOL ET.
