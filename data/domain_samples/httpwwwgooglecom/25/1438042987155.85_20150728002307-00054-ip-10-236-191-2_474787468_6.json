It should be understood, however, that the foregoing description of the invention is intended merely to be illustrative thereof and that other modifications, embodiments and equivalents may be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from its spirit. It may be appreciated that the above-described method may be used to insert other medical devices, such as flexible fiberscopes and microsurgical instruments, into the epidural space through catheter introducer 24, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Following withdrawal of catheter 30 through catheter introducer 24, the catheter introducer may be withdrawn from the epidural space. Alternately, a non-balloon catheter, suitable for long term placement in the epidural space, may be inserted through catheter introducer 24 and the introducer thereafter removed from the epidural space. The size and shape of the epidural space will affect the extent of radial and longitudinal expansion of balloon 36. An epidural space having a narrow cross-sectional profile will cause balloon 36 to have decreased radial expansion while having increased longitudinal expansion within the epidural space. Conversely, an epidural space having a wider cross-sectional profile will cause increased radial expansion and only minimal longitudinal expansion of balloon",
