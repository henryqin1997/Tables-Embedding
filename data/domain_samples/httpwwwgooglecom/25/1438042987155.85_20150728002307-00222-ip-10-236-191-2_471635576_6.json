Therefore, the embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined in the following appended claims. Various club heads also may be utilized in the testing to determine which type of club head may be appropriate for a specific type of golfer. The club heads may vary in material composition, mass, weight placement (e.g. center of gravity purposes), and the like. As above, one example would have a golfer swing each type of club head to determine which one was appropriate for that specific type of golfer. Alternatively, the data may be used to determine an appropriate club head for a specific type of golfer. Further, the data may be used to design a golf club that is appropriate for a specific type of golfer, or even for an individual golfer. Various shafts may be utilized in the testing to determine which type",
