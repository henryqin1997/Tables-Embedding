    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6098=In a further variant, the patient support may have a form other than an elongated bed. For example, as seen in FIG. 8, the patient support includes a chair having a seat 223 projecting in a forward or horizontal plane and a back 224 projecting upwardly from the seat so that the seat is disposed forward of the back. The back defines a first patient support surface 226 extending generally in a vertical plane whereas the seat defines a second patient support surface 227 extending generally in a horizontal plane. The seat is mounted in the patient-receiving space of a horizontal field magnet as discussed above. A first antenna 234 extends in or on the back so that it is closely juxtaposed with the first support surface 226. The first antenna has one or more coils with coil vectors Vc234. A second antenna 235 extends in or on seat 223 so that it is closely juxtaposed with the second support surface 227. The second antenna 235 includes one or more coils with a coil vector Vc235. Both of these coil vectors are transverse to pole axis 214 and, therefore, both antennas can interact with atomic nuclei in the subject's body. The seat can be supported for pivoting motion and/or for vertical or horizontal movement within the patient-receiving space as discussed above. Even if the seat is pivoted about a horizontal axis parallel to the pole axis, the coil axes of both antennas will remain perpendicular to the pole axis. Apparatus according to this embodiment can be used, for example, to image the spine of a patient in the seated position or to image the perineal region or to image other structures in the patient's body. In particular, the apparatus of FIG. 8 may be advantageously used to image the pelvic region of a patient, as described in commonly assigned U.S. Application No. 60/342,382, filed on Dec. 20, 2001, and commonly assigned non-provisional United States application of Damadian, et al., entitled \u201cMRI Apparatus Including Planar RF Coil Provided in a Seat,\u201d filed on even date herewith, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.}",

As disclosed, for example, in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/978,084, filed on Nov. 25, 1997, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,414,490, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein, and in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/718,946, filed on Nov. 22, 2000, the disclosure of which is also incorporated by reference herein, a magnet having poles spaced apart from one another along a horizontal axis provides a horizontally oriented magnetic field within a patient-receiving gap between the poles. Such a magnet can be used with a patient positioning device including elevation and tilt mechanisms to provide extraordinary versatility in patient positioning. For example, where the patient positioning device includes a bed or similar device for supporting the patient in a recumbent position, the bed can be tilted and/or elevated so as to image the patient in essentially any position between a fully standing position and a fully recumbent position, and can be elevated so that essentially any portion of the patient's anatomy is disposed within the gap in an optimum position for imaging. As further disclosed in the aforesaid applications, the patient positioning device may include additional elements such as a platform projecting from the bed to support the patient when the bed is tilted towards a standing orientation. Still other patient supporting devices can be used in place of a bed in a system of this type. For example, a seat may be used to support a patient in a sitting position. Thus, magnets of this type provide extraordinary versatility in imaging.}",

It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. In particular, quadrature coils may be designed for many more parts of the human anatomy, e.g., the ankle, wrist, shoulder, neck, foot, breast, etc., that would provide improved signal-to-noise ratio performance. , a patient P may be positioned within the patient-receiving space 1035 such that the long axis 1055 of the patient's body is transverse to static magnetic B0. The patient may be positioned in the sitting or standing position in accordance with the requirements associated with the medical procedure. In addition, the patient may also be fitted with any of the quadrature coil antennas described in detail hereinabove so that magnetic resonance scanning may be advantageously performed. In particular, the signal-to-noise ratios improvement of up to \u221a{square root over (2)} may be achieved in accordance with this embodiment. FIG. 12 In accordance with the embodiment shown in .
