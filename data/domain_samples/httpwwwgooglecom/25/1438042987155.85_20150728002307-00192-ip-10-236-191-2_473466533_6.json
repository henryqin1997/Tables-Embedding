The apparatus and method can be used with infusion control pumps, such as enteral feeding pumps or IV pumps, or as a replacement for such pumps. While the present disclosure discloses embodiments which are currently preferred, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications which can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, the relative size of the infusion set and occluder could be changed by providing an occluder which shrinks sufficiently under pressure to create fluid flow passages. The appended claims are intended to cover such modifications. As shown in FIG. 5D, compressing opposing sides of the infusion set can open fluid flow channels both above and below the occluder. In FIG. 12B, the tube 642 of the infusion set 604 is pressed against one half of the occlude 634, thereby forming a single fluid flow channel 646 on the opposing side. If the portion 604 b of the infusion set 604 containing the occluder 634 is pulled from the channel 630, the infusion set will engage the occluder prevent fluid flow. FIG. 12B shows a close-up, cross-sectional view of the portion of the pump 600 having the channel 630 formed therein taken along the line A\u2014A. The channel 630 receives the infusion set 604 in such a manner",
