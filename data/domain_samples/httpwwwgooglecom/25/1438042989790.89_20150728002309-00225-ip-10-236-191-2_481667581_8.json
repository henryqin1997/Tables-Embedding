For example, it is disclosed in Rubber Chem. Technol. 49 353 (1976), Japanese Laid-Open Application No. 60-99149, and Japanese Laid-Open Application No. 1-182340. Although the aforementioned conventional chlorinated ethylene-\u03b1-olefin copolymer rubber is a rubber excelling in ozone resistance and heat aging resistance, it poses problems such that one having a high vulcanization speed is inferior in heat resistance, while another having good heat resistance gives a low vulcanization speed, hence poor processibility, and a poor rubber elasticity., 73673=A thermoplastic elastomer composition was obtained in the same manner as in Example 12 except that 35 weight parts of PP (2) instead of 25 weight parts of PP (1) and 65 weight parts of Cl-rubber (4) instead of 75 weight parts of Cl-rubber (1) were used: 50 weight parts of naphthene-based process oil (the tradename: Sunthen 4240, manufactured by Nippon Sun Oil Co.) (hereinafter referred to as \"Softener (1)\") and 50 weight parts of dioctylphthlate (hereinafter referred to as \"Softener (2)\") were additionally used: and 5 weight parts of zinc oxide instead of magnesia, 12 weight parts of alkylphenol resin (the tradename: Hitanol 2501, manufactured by Hitachi Kasei Kogyo Co.) instead of dibutylaminotriazine-2,4-dithiol and a weight part of stannous chloride (SnCl2.2H2 O) instead of piperidine benzoate were used, and the obtained molding was measured for its properties.}",
