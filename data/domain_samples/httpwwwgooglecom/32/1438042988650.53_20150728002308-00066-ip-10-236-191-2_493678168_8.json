R-values were obtained by correlating sensor output to the externally derived meter values, and performing a least squares analysis, such as described with reference to copending U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 09/916,858 filed Jul. 27, 2001 and entitled \u201cDEVICE AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING ANALYTE LEVELS,\u201d as well as issued patents including U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,067 issued Dec. 14, 1999 and entitled \u201cDEVICE AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING ANALYTE LEVELS\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,167 issued Feb. 19, 1991 and entitled \u201cBIOLOGICAL FLUID MEASURING DEVICE\u201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,022 filed Jul. 12, 1988 and entitled \u201cBIOLOGICAL FLUID MEASURING DEVICE.\u201d All of the above patents and patent applications are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference., 137461=[0168] As a first noted advantage, the cylindrical geometry of the sensor body 120 allows for discreet placement within or between tissue types when the overall surface area-to-volume ratio can be optimized to provide a maximal surface area with a minimal volume. That is, although the volume of a sensor often depends on the necessary electronics within the sensor body, the evolution of smaller batteries and circuit boards sanctions the design and manufacture of a cylindrical sensor with minimal volume; simultaneously, the surface area inherent in a cylindrical geometry allows for maximal tissue anchoring in vivo (e.g., as compared to a substantially rectangular or oval structure). In one exemplary embodiment, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) may be designed to fit within the geometric design of any of the embodiments disclosed herein to maximize the electronic capabilities while minimizing volume requirements as compared to conventional circuit boards. Sensor electronics requirements vary depend on the sensor type, however one example of electronics for a glucose sensor is described in more detail with reference to copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ filed on Aug. 1, 2003 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING ANALYTE SENSOR DATA,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 159029=[0194] In a preferred embodiment, the sensor is formed by substantially entirely epoxy encapsulating the sensor electronics; that is, the sensor body, outside the sensor head, is comprises an epoxy resin body. During the manufacture of the sensor body of the preferred embodiment, the sensitive electronic parts (e.g. battery, antenna, and circuit board, such as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ filed on Aug. 1, 2003 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING ANALYTE SENSOR DATA\u201d) are substantially entirely encapsulated in epoxy, with the exception of the sensor head. In some molding processes, the epoxy body may be formed with a curvature on a portion thereof. After the epoxy has completely cured, additional curvature may be machined, milled, laser-etched, or otherwise processed into the epoxy body to form the final geometric shape. In alternative embodiments, a light epoxy coating may be applied to the sensitive electronic parts, after which injection molding or reaction injection molding (RIM) may be used to form the final shape of the epoxy body. While a preferred sensor is constructed of epoxy resin, a non-conductive metal, ceramic or other suitable material may be used., 178026=[0212] Weekly infusion studies were conducted for four-weeks to investigate the effects of sensor geometries of preferred embodiments on the functional performance of glucose sensors. A first group of sensors (n=5) included a cylindrical geometry similar to that described with reference to FIG. 4. A second group of sensors (n=6) included a thin, oblong geometry similar to that described with reference to FIG. 5. The functional aspects of each sensor were constructed in a similar manner, such as described in Published Patent Application No. 2003/0032874, which is incorporated herein by reference. The sensors were then implanted into the subcutaneous tissue in dogs between the fascia and adipose tissues, and sensor function evaluated by weekly glucose infusion tests., 108313=[0141]FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing that illustrates a classical foreign body response (FBR) to an object implanted under the skin. There are three main regions of a FBR. The innermost FBR region 12, adjacent to the device, is composed generally of macrophages and foreign body giant cells 14 (herein referred to as the barrier cell layer). These cells form a monolayer of closely opposed cells over the entire surface of a microscopically smooth, macroscopically smooth (but microscopically rough), or microporous (i.e., less than about 1 \u03bcm pore size) membrane. The intermediate FBR region 16 (herein referred to as the fibrous zone), lying distal to the first region with respect to the device, is a wide zone (about 30-1000 microns) composed primarily of fibroblasts 18, contractile fibrous tissue 19, and fibrous matrix 20 (shown as empty space, which is actually filled with this fibrous matrix). It may be noted that the organization of the fibrous zone, and particularly the contractile fibrous tissue 19, contributes to the formation of the monolayer of closely opposed cells due to the contractile forces 21 around the surface of the foreign body (e.g., membrane 10). The outermost FBR region 22 is loose connective granular tissue containing new blood vessels 24 (herein referred to as the vascular zone). Over time, the foreign body capsule becomes muscular due to differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and contracts around the foreign body so that the foreign body remains tightly encapsulated.}",

[0221] As described above with reference to FIG. 11B, the average R-value at week 4 was better for the thin, oblong group as compared to the cylindrical group. Additionally the average standard deviation of the thin, oblong group as compared to the cylindrical group was much lower, indicating greater consistency and tighter tolerances with the thin, oblong group. As described above with reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, this performance differential may be due to additional geometric factors such as surface area-to-volume ratio, size, mass, and surface area-to-density ratio, for example. at Week 4",
