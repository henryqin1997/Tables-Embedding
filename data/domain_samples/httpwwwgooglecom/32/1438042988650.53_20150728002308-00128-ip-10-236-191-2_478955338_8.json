Following formation of the microlenses, heat is applied and the microlens material is reflowed. FIG. 9 has a planar top surface, which is advantageous for reducing the stripe defect in the microlenses 206. The step height between the top of spacer 204 b and the post-passivation pad portion 224 is substantially less than the sum of height 118 and height 119 between top of spacer 104 b and the bond pad 122 (4.5 \u03bcm+[1.5 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm]=6 \u03bcm to 6.5 \u03bcm) shown in FIG. 1C. FIG. 8 shows the steps of forming the color filter layers 211, 213 and the spacer layer 204 b. The spacer layer 204 b is formed of the same material as the planarization layer 204 a, and completely covers the color filter layer(s) 211, 213. In preferred embodiments, the spacer layer 204 b also covers the scribe line, so that only the post-passivation pad portion 224 is exposed. The resulting configuration shown in FIG. 8",
