    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6344=Referring now to FIG. 6, there may be occasions when the drying cycle is interrupted, such as when the door is opened to add an article or check the dryness of the load. In such cases, the dryer pause flow diagram 130 of FIG. 6 illustrates the calculation of an add-on dry time. The routine 130 is initiated by the opening of the dryer door or other drying cycle pause condition 132. At a time expiration determination step 134, the routine 130 evaluates whether the time since the initiation of the cycle is greater than or equal to five minutes. If not, the time expiration determination step 134 is repeated until a \u201cyes\u201d answer results. The routine then evaluates at a mode determination step 136 whether either mode 1 or mode 2 has been initiated. A \u201cno\u201d answer means that the dryer is operating in Auto Dry Mode as a result of there having been more than 1250 wet hits at the initiation of the drying cycle (FIG. 3). If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then whether an add-on time has previously been calculated is evaluated at an add-on time determination step 138.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been specifically described in connection with certain specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not of limitation. Reasonable variation and modification are possible within the scope of the forgoing disclosure and drawings without departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined in the appended claims. The dryer configuration and operation described herein enable accurate and efficient drying of small loads and avoids the problems in the prior art with small loads being under dry at the end of the drying cycle. The dryer is operated to accommodate small drying loads which register fewer than a threshold number of wet hits, or to accommodate a situation wherein the moisture sensing circuitry is not functioning properly. Heater off time is utilized as the primary input to an empirically-based calculation of drying time. The determination of an optimal drying time is based upon real information about the size of the clothes load and its moisture content, and results in optimal drying with an optimal use of energy. Cool Down Time=a cool down time determined as previously described herein. The Add on Dry Time is then added to the time already elapsed since the beginning of the drying cycle for completion of the drying cycle. , and FIGS. 4A-5B Heater Off Time Value=preestablished value based upon dryer configuration, clothes",
