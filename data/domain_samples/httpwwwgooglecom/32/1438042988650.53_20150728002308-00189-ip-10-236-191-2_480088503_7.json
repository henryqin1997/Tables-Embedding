In this embodiment, commercial paper transaction 202 is illustrated as a portion of an IRD 200, which may be considered a legal representation of transaction 202. Transaction 202 is associated with two MICR codes 204 and 206, each generated or captured at different points during transaction processing. For example, MICR code 204 may be preprinted on the check prior to the actual transaction. In this example, MICR code 204 includes a type indicator of \u201c1,\u201d a routing number of \u201c12345,\u201d an account number of \u201c12345678,\u201d and a check number of \u201c101.\u201d In this example, MICR code 204 has been supplemented with the captured amount, \u201c100.00,\u201d perhaps at the receiving entity 102 or the financial institution 104 of first deposit. MICR code 206 is substantially similar to MICR code 204, with the difference involving the type indicator. In MICR code 204, the type indicator is \u201c1\u201d, while MICR code 206 includes a type indicator of \u201c4.\u201d}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although this disclosure has been described in terms of certain embodiments and generally associated methods, alterations, and permutations of these embodiments and methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, receiving entity 102 may process electronic checks, as well as physical checks and other commercial paper. Accordingly, the above description of example embodiments does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes, substitutions, and alterations are also possible without departing from the scope of this disclosure. The preceding flowchart and accompanying description illustrate exemplary method 400. In short, system 100 contemplates using any suitable technique for performing this and other tasks. Accordingly, many of the steps in this flowchart may take place simultaneously and/or in different orders than as shown. Moreover, system 100 may use methods with additional steps, fewer steps, and/or different steps, so long as the methods remain appropriate. Method 400 begins at step 402, where scanner 128 (or scanner 102 c) identifies a check identification data 140 from a commercial paper transaction. Check processing engine 135 determines a hash value based on at least part of the identified check identification data 140 at step 404. As described above, check processing engine 135 may determine the hash value using any appropriate technique or via implementing any suitable algorithm, such as MD-5, a proprietary technique, and others. Check processing engine 135 then communicates the determined hash value to",
