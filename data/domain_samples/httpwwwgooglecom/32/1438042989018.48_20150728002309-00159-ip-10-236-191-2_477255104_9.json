The spirit and scope of the present invention is only limited by the terms of the appended claims. As described above in detail, the first embodiment has a structure for reading information such as a tape width proper to a tape cartridge and adjusting and controlling a character size according to the tape width, a combination of a line number and a character size, and a feeding torque of the tape. The second embodiment records a type of the tape cartridge including the tape width as electrically readable data and allowing specific information to be written. The third embodiment automatically sets lengths of left and right margins on a label according to the tape width. The fourth embodiment prohibits driving of a printing head out of the tape width. The essential features of these embodiments may be combined with one another according to the requirements. Although a series of characters are laid out within the tape width in the first embodiment, the essential features of the fourth embodiment, that is, prohibition of driving the dot elements on the thermal head 532 out of the tape width, may preferably be combined with the first embodiment.
