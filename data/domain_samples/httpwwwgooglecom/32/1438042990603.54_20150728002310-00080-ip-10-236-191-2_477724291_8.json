The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. [0047]FIG. 4B also illustrates another advantage of the present invention by showing relationships between the focused lines as previously described. For example, many of the data sets that are processed by the analysis module occur or are created over time. Thus, the lines in the data set have a temporal relationship, meaning that the first lines of the data set occurred before later lines of the data set. When the user applies a filter, the lines that meet that filter are displayed to the user. When a second filter is applied to the data set, those lines are also displayed to the user along with the lines that satisfy the first filter. By displaying these lines simultaneously, the user is able to view the temporal relationship between the lines because they are displayed in the order they occurred in the original data set. This reasoning can be expanded to include all of the filters and markers such that",
