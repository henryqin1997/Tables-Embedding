    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6887=Stage three addresses any stochastic blurring by the CsI:T1 scintillator. The scintillator blur represented as T3(u,v) is determined from the measured presampling MTF (MTFpre) for each of the four CsI:T1 scintillators (300, 375, 450 and 525-\u03bctm thick) using a 1\ufffd1-inch back-illuminated laboratory CCD coupled to the scintillator by a straight fiberoptic coupler. The laboratory CCD system used has pixel dimensions of 24\ufffd24-\u03bcm and is operated in the 4\ufffd4 binning mode to provide a pixel pitch of 96\ufffd96-\u03bcm. Measurements are performed using a 10-\u03bcm wide slit oriented at a light angle (<4\ufffd) to the pixel matrix as per the technique described by Fujita et al. From the acquired slit image, the finely sampled line spread function (LSF) is determined; Fourier transformed; and deconvolved of the finite dimension of the slit. The resultant presampling MTF (MTFpre) describes the MTF of a preferred embodiment of the system inclusive of the pixel presampling MTF. While the pixel presampling MTF can be represented as a sinc function for imagers with physical separation between neighboring pixels such as amorphous silicon photodiodes, such an assumption for the CCD imager which has no physical separation between pixels is verified in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Hence, measurements are repeated with the CCD operating in a 24\ufffd24-\u03bcm pixel pitch mode. The scintillator blur along the u-axis represented as T3(u) is calculated as: T 3 ( u ) = MTF pre ( u ) \ufffd \u03c0 \ufffd a pix \ufffd u sin ( \u03c0 \ufffd a pix \ufffd u ) ( 37 ) Since, T3(u) determined using the 24\ufffd24-\u03bcm and 96\ufffd96-\u03bcm pixel pitch images are identical, the assumption that the pixel presampling MTF can be represented as a sinc function is thus validated. The measurement can also be repeated along the v-axis and the scintillator blur T3(v) is found to be identical to T3(u) for each scintillator. Hence, the assumption of isotropy is made for a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Siewerdsen et al have approximated the scintillator MTF[T3(u,v)] for Lanex screen by a Lorentzian fit. However for the CsI:T1 scintillators, the measured T3(u) is best described by the fit: T 3 ( u ) = 1 1 + B \ufffd ( u + u 2 ) ( 38 ) where, B is the fit parameter. As an example, the measured T3(u) for the 525-\u03bcm thick CsI:T1 scintillator and the fit to measured data using the equation of the form shown in equation 38 are plotted in FIG. 30. It should be noted that the fit parameter B is smaller than the attempted Lorentzian fit parameter which did not yield a satisfactory fit. Further, the fit parameter B is also plotted as a function of scintillator thickness (t, expressed in microns) to describe the scintillator blur for any intermediate thickness of the CsI:T1 scintillator and is shown in FIG. 31. The fit parameter, B, is well described within the thickness range studied, by the equation: B=a\ufffdln(t)+c\u2003\u2003(39) where, a is approximately 0.1451 and c is approximately \u22120.6186. Thus, the signal and NPS at the output of stage three can be written as: q 3(u,v)={overscore (q 0)}\ufffd{overscore (g 1)}\ufffd{overscore (g 2)}\ufffdT 3(u,v)\u2003\u2003(40) \u2003W 3(u,v)={overscore (q 0)}\ufffd{overscore (g 1)}\ufffd{overscore (g 2)}\ufffd[1+T 3 2(u,v)\ufffd({overscore (g 2)}+\u03b5g 2 )]\u2003\u2003(41)}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{166375=The preferred embodiment as described hereinbefore includes four, three-side buttable, 8\ufffd8-cm large area interlined CCDs, coupled to a structured CsI:T1 scintillator by a straight (non-tapering) fiberoptic plate. The four CCDs are tiled in a seamless fashion, with the readout pins oriented away from the seam, to achieve a field of view (FOV) of 16\ufffd16-cm. Each CCD can have a 2048\ufffd2048 pixel matrix with a fundamental pixel pitch of 39-\u03bcm. The CCDs are capable of being operated in 3 different pixel pitch modes of 78, 156 and 234-\u03bcm, resulting in Nyquist limits of 6.4, 3.2 and 2.1 cycle/mm, respectively. The variable pixel pitch is achieved by grouping or binning 2\ufffd2, 4\ufffd4 and 6\ufffd6 adjacent pixels, respectively. This preferred embodiment having a CCD with an interline architecture hereinafter referred to as the interlined CCD facilitates frame rates of up to 30 frames per second (fps) even at the highest resolution mode of 78-\u03bcm. In addition, the x-ray source can be continuously on, as the time taken for transfer from the active area of the pixel (photosite) to the data line (interline or interpixel channel) is extremely short (5-\u03bcs) and does not contribute to smearing. This allows the use of these embodiments with cost efficient fluoroscopic devices, which do not employ a pulsed fluoroscopic source, such as some mobile C-arms. The interline channel is opaque to light resulting in degradation of the fill factor. The width of the interline channel is approximately 11-\u03bcm and traverses the length of the pixel, resulting in an active area of 28\ufffd39-\u03bcm for each fundamental pixel. This results in a fill factor of approximately 72%. The charge readout process for a single CCD module operating in the 2\ufffd2-binned (78-\u03bcm) mode is described with respect to FIG. 9C. Each CCD module has eight (8) output ports as discussed previously in FIG. 9C., 142662=The charge readout process for a single CCD in accordance with a preferred embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 9B. The time duration for transfer from the photosite 322 (active area of the pixel) to the data line (interpixel channel 324) can be extremely short, for example, in the order of approximately a few microseconds (\u03bcs) and therefore, any smearing due to the continuous x-ray beam is minimized. During this short period, the photosites in the imager do not integrate the charges and there is no shifting of charges along the vertical direction. This period is referred to as the vertical blanking time. Once the charges are transferred to the interline or interpixel channel, it takes a short time, for example, approximately 15 \u03bcs to transfer one row of 1024 pixels on to the horizontal register., 128193=The light emitted from the scintillator and is transported to the CCD sensor via the fiberoptic plate 226, 238. Upon interaction with the CCD sensor 224, 239, light energy is converted into electrons which are stored in each pixel of the CCD sensor 224, 239. A single CCD sensor 224, 239 of the present embodiment consists of 2048\ufffd2048 pixels, but such sensors come in a number of different sizes. The pixel matrix can vary in the range from 256\ufffd256 pixels to 4096\ufffd4096 pixels. Preferred embodiments include 1024\ufffd1024 pixels for certain applications to improve geometric fill factors such as required for cardiac and vascular applications. The CCD sensor \u201cintegrates\u201d the image signal from the scintillation screen in that it senses the optical image and stores charge during the entire x-ray exposure interval. After termination of the x-ray exposure, the discrete representation in the CCD 224, 239 is read out by controller 230. The controller 230 reads the image representation from the CCD sensor 224, 239 pixel by pixel and organizes it into a digital array. The digital array, representing spatial position and x-ray intensity, is then output to a memory or image store 232. From the image store 232, the image can be accessed by a data processor 234 for performing image processing techniques. A cathode ray tube (CRT) 236 or other type of electronic image display is also provided to allow the image to be displayed before or after processing by the data processor 234., 143520=In a preferred embodiment, the interline channel can be made insensitive to light, therefore, image smearing during the readout is avoided. The readout process can occur in the background without interfering with the image acquisition since the CCD reads out its charge through the interline channel, from a given frame, while the subsequent frame is being acquired in the photosites (pixels). Vertical binning is achieved by transferring two or more rows of data on to the horizontal register at the same instant. Following this, all the pixels in each of a row are transferred to the summing well and on-chip amplifiers of the output port within a short duration for example, approximately 10 \u03bcs, such that the horizontal register is cleared of all the pixels prior to transfer of the next row of pixels to the horizontal register. Horizontal binning is achieved by transferring two or more pixels at the same instant to the summing well of the output port from the horizontal register. Thus a preferred embodiment of the system is capable of reading out a complete frame of, for example, 1024\ufffd1024 pixels in 15.4 ms (5 \u03bcs+1024\ufffd15 \u03bcs), which corresponds to a frame rate of 65 frames/sec. Higher frame rates can be achieved by increasing the number of output ports and also by reducing the transfer duration by increasing the clock rate in alternate preferred embodiments. An important advantage of this readout method is that the x-ray source can be operated in the continuous mode without affecting the readout process as the interline channel and the horizontal register can be made insensitive to light. The system derives its speed from the interline architecture. Hence, the imager in accordance with a preferred embodiment is capable of operating in both continuous and pulsed fluoroscopic modes and can be switched instantaneously to the radiographic or digital cine acquisition mode., 77590=Video pick-up tube-based image intensifiers for fluoroscopy was invented in about 1940 and has been in use since 1948 when Coltman built the first practical image intensifier. Now, image intensifiers are a standard and essential component of fluoroscopic systems. Although several aspects of this technology have evolved over the years, the basic approach of detection remains the same. Image intensifier technology with video tube-based cameras and more recently charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have made a major impact in the field of x-ray fluoroscopy. In spite of the technical improvements, this technology suffers from several inherent limitations. Veiling glare and contrast loss is one of the more typical problems inherent in the electro-optic design of the image intensifier. After conversion of the light from the scintillator to the photocathode, electrons are accelerated in a field potential of about 30 kV. During this stage, a fraction of the electrons undergo scatter within the tube. At the output stage, after conversion from electrons to photons, the light scatters within the optical elements of the output. S-type distortion is also a well-known phenomenon, which makes imaging of a straight object to appear as having an S-shape due to the influence of the earth's magnetic field on the trajectories of electrons within the image-intensifier tube. Shielding of image intensifiers with \u201cmu-metal\u201d is essential but in many cases a significant amount of S-type distortion is still present. This distortion is not only bothersome during treatment procedures requiring high spatial accuracy, but also changes spatially as the intensifier is moved, making it difficult to correct mathematically. Other types of distortion such as pincushion and barrel type distortions are caused by the inherent limitations of the electron focusing optics. Pincushion and barrel distortions are tolerable in many instances but they present a hindrance in the proper visualization of anatomy. Similar effects but for different physical reasons also arise from lens-based optical coupling. The glass input window typically has been the input window of image intensifiers (typically 1 to 3-mm thick), which absorbs useful x-rays and produces forward scatter, but has now been replaced with a thickness of 0.7 to 1.2-mm, of aluminum (Al). While this represents a significant improvement, the input window itself absorbs about 20 to 30% of the useful x-ray beam depending on the photon energy. The high vacuum of the intensifier requires a relatively thick metal window for maintaining mechanical integrity of the tube. In addition to this aluminum layer of the input window, x-rays must pass through another 0.5-mm thick aluminum layer, the scintillator substrate, before they reach the scintillator. In addition, the gain of image intensifiers is known to degrade with time due in part to out-gassing of components in the vacuum chamber and degradation of the photocathode. The image quality is noticeably lower after three years of operation and their useful lifetime, if good image quality is to be maintained, is about 3 to 5 years. Also, the relatively large size of image intensifiers may be problematic in biplanar installations. Even in simple fluoroscopic installations the camera tower frequently interferes with the overhead radiographic x-ray tube and other structures., 119768=Systems for quantitative radiographic imaging are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,864,146 issued on Jan. 26, 1999 to Karellas and in WO 97/42877 published on Nov. 20, 1997 also by Karellas, both of which being incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.}",
