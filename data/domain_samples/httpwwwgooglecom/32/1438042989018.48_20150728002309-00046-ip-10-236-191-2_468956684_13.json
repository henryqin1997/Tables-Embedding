    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6274=We have described the use of liposomes in combination with Quil A or QS-21 to induce cytolytic T cells (CTL) to either soluble antigen or peptides [Lipford, G. B., Wagner, H. & Heeg, K., Vaccine 12, 73\u201380 (1994), Lipford, G. B. et al., J. Immunol. 150, 1212\u20131222 (1993)]. Liposome entrapped antigen alone was an ineffective inducer of CTL activity, but with the addition of immunostimulatory saponins the inoculum became effective. To test the in vivo T cell immunomodulatory potential of oligomers we utilized this vehicle to demonstrate primary activation of CTL. FIG. 1 shows a substantial primary CTL response induced by an inoculum of ovalbumin liposomes plus ssDNA matching transcription response elements. The lytic units value interpolated from these curves was approximately 500 L.U. as compared to <20 L.U. for ovalbumin liposomes only (Table 3). CTL memory, an important quality for vaccine protection, could also be demonstrated with these inocula. If mice were rested for two weeks after the first injection and reinjected with the same inoculum, CRE recalled CTL displaying lytic units measured at approximately 1500 L.U. (Table 3). Additional, when the inoculum was formulated with the immunodominant Kb restricted ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 3), the oligomers induced a specific primary CTL response. Thus, oligomers serve as a strong in vivo stimulus resulting in T cell activation and the proliferation of antigen specific CTL effectors. The inoculum can contain protein or peptide as the target antigen.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{84305=For lethal shock, Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 nmol 1668 in 200 \u03bcl PBS plus 20 mg D-galactosamine in 200 \u03bcl PBS. Alternatively mice were injected intravenously with 10 nmol 1668, AMP or PBS followed at four hours with 50 \u03bcg LPS., 79860=Three sequences containing the sequence motif of 5\u2032Pu-Pu-CpG-Py-Py-3\u2032 are described in the literature for having immunostimulating properties. One sequence is derived from the ampicillin resistance gene of E. coli, here termed AMP (TCATTGGAAAACGTTCTTCGGGGC; SEQ ID NO: 1). The second sequence is derived from a BCG gene and is termed BCG-A4A (ACCGATGACGTCGCCGGTGACGGCACCACG; SEQ ID NO: 2). The third is a synthetic sequence claimed to be a prototype of bacterial CpG sequences, referred to by Krieg et al. as 1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT; SEQ ID NO: 4). These sequences were synthesized to include a phosphorothioate linkage to reduce destruction by DNase. These oligomers served as an adjuvant in combination with ovalbumin to induce a cytolytic T cell response., 80822=We observed that the above-described oligomers could be highly toxic in vivo for mice sensitive to TNF-\u03b1. The 1668 oligomer was previously described by Krieg and co-workers for its ability to induce murine B cell proliferation, induce IL-6 release from B cells and induce IFN-\u03b3 release from B cells and induce IFN-\u03b3 release from NK1.1 cells. We found in addition that 1668 and AMP were highly lethal in mice sensitized to the effects of TNF-\u03b1 (Table 1). However, under certain circumstances these sequences may be useful therapeutically. One could foresee the use of these sequences once the risk is properly assessed., 71720=Liposomes may be manufactured by a rehydration entrapment method. Preferably the liposomes are prepared as follows. 18.0 mg phosphatidylcholine; 2.0 mg phosphatidylglycerol and 5.0 mg cholesterol, at a 2:0.2:1 ratio, are suspended in 5.0 ml chloroform in a 100 ml round bottom flask. The mixture is rotary evaporated under reduced pressure until a thin lipid film forms on the flask wall. Residual chloroform is removed by vacuum desiccation. 3 mg of ovalbumin is solubilized in 1.0 ml of PBS., 84795=Due to toxicity, the need is established for the discovery of non-toxic sequences for safe human and animal use. Since toxicity is at issue when developing vaccine adjuvants and therapeutics, we were interested to develop oligomers that circumvented toxicity but retained immunostimulatory properties. We screened eukaryotic sequences displaying the absence of lethality but maintaining immunostimulatory qualities. One such sequence was the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) which is the consensus binding site for the transcription factors CREB/ATF as well as the AP-1 family, sequence (GATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAG; SEQ ID NO: 8) [Roesler, W. J. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9063\u20139066 (1988)]. Table 2 demonstrates the loss of lethality of the CRE sequence. To further evaluate the sequence specificity of these effects we made sequence exchanges between CRE and 1668. An exchange of only two nucleotides between CRE and 1668 resulted in a loss of lethality (Table 2)., 37631=This application claims priority to PCT Patent Application No. PCT/EP98/00367, filed Jan. 23, 1998, and published in English as WO 98/32462, which in turn claims priority to EP Patent Application No. EP 97101019.4, filed Jan. 23, 1997., 54191=As has been stated above, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the aforementioned regulatory sequences or antigens, either alone or in combination, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are well known in the art and include phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, emulsions, such as oil/water emulsions, various types of wetting agents, sterile solutions etc. Compositions comprising such carriers can be formulated by well known conventional methods. These pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to the subject at a suitable dose. Administration of the suitable compositions may be effected by different ways, e.g., by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, topical or intradermal administration. The dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician and other clinical factors. As is well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one patient depends upon many factors, including the patient's size, body surface area, age, the particular compound to be administered, sex, time and route of administration, general health, and other drugs being administered concurrently. Generally, the regimen as a regular administration of the pharmaceutical composition should be in the range of 1 \u03bcg to 10 mg units per day. If the regimen is a continuous infusion, it should also be in the range of 1 \u03bcg to 10 mg units per kilogram of body weight per minute, respectively. Progress can be monitored by periodic assessment. Dosages will vary but a preferred dosage for intravenous administration of DNA is from approximately 106 to 1022 copies of the DNA molecule. The compositions of the invention may be administered locally or systemically. Administration will generally be parenterally, e.g., intravenously; DNA may also be administered directly to the target site, e.g., by biolistic delivery to an internal or external target site or by catheter to a site in an artery.}",
