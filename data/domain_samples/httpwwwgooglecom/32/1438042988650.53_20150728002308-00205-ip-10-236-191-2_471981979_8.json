J. et al.: Nature 315, 641 (1985))., 41496=T cells from the spleen of C3H/HeJ mice, separated on nylon wool as reported by Julius, M. H. et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 3, 645 (1973), are incubated in duplicate for 48 hours at 37\ufffd C. in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO), supplemented by N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine N'-2-ethanesulphonic acid (HEPES), L-glutamine, gentamycin, 10% bovine foetal serum and 2-mercaptoethanol (2.5\ufffd10-5 M), in the presence of graduated concentrations (840-420-210 \u03bcg/ml) of the synthetic peptide 163-171 and of purified human IL-1B as standard, with the addition of concanavalin A (ConA) as costimulant., 20122=In particular, we operated in accordance with the method proposed by Hopp, T. P. et al. in \"Synthetic Antigens\" P. 47-60 Annuali Sclavo 1984, which makes use of a particular scale of hydrophilic properties, referred to as acrophilic properties, and which is particularly effective in individually identifying zones of the protein molecule which are exposed to the solvent., 39915=The test consists in culturing for 72 hours at 37\ufffd C., in 5% of CO2, 0.2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% of bovine foetal serum, in the presence of submitogenic doses of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). To a batch of thymocytes activated subliminally by PHA, there are then added increasing doses of the peptide 163-171 (50-100-200-400-800 \u03bcg/ml) and to the remaining batch of thymocytes a purified human IL-1B standard (Genzyme Boston Mass.)., 31354=At the conclusion of the said period, the resin is separated by filtration and washed as follows: 3 times with 50 ml, in each instance, of DMF; 3 times with 50 ml of a solution DMF:H2 O (1:1, V/V); 50 ml of water; 50 ml of glacial acetic acid, 50 ml of water and finally with 50 ml of absolute ethyl alcohol., 42107=At the end of the period of incubation, the supernatant is separated from the culture and a determination is made of its capacity to promote the growth of CTLL-2 cells dependent upon IL-2 according to the method reported by Gillis S. M. et al. (J. Immunol. 120, 2027 (1978)).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Non-Patent Citations On the basis of these results, we can thus conclude that the peptide 163-171 is capable of reproducing the activity of the entire molecule of human IL-1, promoting the production of IL-2 and, in consequence, the proliferation of immunocompetent cells. Murine splenocytes were incubated for 48 hours in 5% CO2 at 37\ufffd C. with the substances under investigation, and the supernatants collected for the purpose of incubation were tested for the capacity to induce proliferations of CTLL cells dependent on IL-2.

It can be seen from the results reported in Table 2 given below, that the synthetic peptide 163-171 is capable of stimulating the production of IL-2 by T cells of the spleen activated by ConA",
