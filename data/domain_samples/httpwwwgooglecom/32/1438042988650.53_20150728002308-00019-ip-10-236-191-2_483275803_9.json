FIG. 10(b) illustrates the overlap area 1000 between corrected leaf cell J1 910 and the corrected leaf cell K1 920. As discussed above with respect to FIGS. 2 and 4, during the linking process for cell E1, this overlap area is determined and the data corresponding to this area is flattened. The flattened overlap area is then provided to the OPC operation engine 240 which operates on the data to provide an intermediate correction plane 1020. Note that in the case described here where the primitive structures overlap a discrete amount, negative serifs 1010 are provided for the intermediate correction plane. In the situation described below with respect to FIG. 10(b), an alternate parent E1 is illustrated in which the corrected leaf cells K1 and K2 shown as 910 b and 920 b respectively. This situation illustrates an infinitesimal overlap between the two corrected primitive geometries. In one embodiment of the invention, an intermediate correction plane 1020 b is provided for these infinitesimal overlap situations such that a \u22122 layer is provided to compensate for end butting effects., 170197=FIG. 14 illustrates an example screen snapshot of the final output from a computer system executing one embodiment of the invention to provide OPC correction to the input design of FIG. 13. The design window 1330 of user interface 1300 shows a cell 1310 comprising primitive structures 1320 which have been OPC corrected. The cell 1310 comprises OPC features such as hammerheads 1410, assist lines 1420, bias lines 1430, positive serifs 1440, and negative serifs 1450. The output depicted in FIG. 14 is representative of all of the corrections which would have to be made to compensate for all OPC effects on the entire design. Thus, these corrections represent the final linked output of this embodiment of the present invention in which all overlaps between cells in the hierarchy have been resolved and compensated for. The OPC features depicted in FIG. 14 are shown in greater detail in FIG. 15 which is a zoomed in example screen snapshot of FIG. 14., 171256=FIG. 16 illustrates an example screen snapshot of a \u22121 OPC correction layer from a computer system executing one embodiment of the invention to provide OPC correction. This layer contains corrections to cell 1310 including assist lines 1420, bias lines 1430, and negative serifs 1450., 166131=The simulated image of the corrected mask is then compared to the desired design image at block 1220 to determine whether or not the initial rule based OPC correction was sufficient to correct the design to within a set of user defined design parameters as shown at block 1225. Methods for performing this comparison are disclosed in the aforementioned United States provisional patent application entitled, \u201cMask Verification, Correction, and Design Rule Checking\u201d, and the United States utility application of the same name. If the result of the comparison is that the design parameters have been achieved, the corrected design data can then be input to a design rule checker which analyzes the corrected design for any violations of the established design rules for the particular integrated circuit design as shown at block 1235. If the corrected design is within design rules, the corrected design data can then be flattened and a mask can be produced using an EB machine as shown at block 1245. If the design rules have not been met, a decision must be made as to whether or not to redesign the mask as shown at block 1250., 164419=FIG. 12 illustrates a further method for providing OPC correction to a design layout using one embodiment of the present invention. At block 1200 an integrated circuit design layout is first provided. The hierarchically formatted design data corresponding to this design layout is then provided to a system which performs a rule based OPC correction on the design data in accordance with the system of FIG. 8 as shown at block 1205. The system of FIG. 8 generates an output of hierarchical correction data as described above, and this correction data is combined with the original design data to generate a hierarchically described rule-based OPC corrected design data as shown at block 1210. Using this corrected design data a simulated image of the mask which this corrected design data would produce is generated at block 1215. This simulation can be generated utilizing a Hopkins equation based simulation device such as that described generally in the U.S. provisional patent application entitled, \u201cMask Verification, Correction, and Design Rule Checking\u201d having Ser. No. 60/059,306, filed Sep. 17, 1997, and invented by Fang-Cheng Chang, Yao-Ting Wang and Yagyensh C. Pati, United States patent application entitled, \u201cMask Verification, Correction, and Design Rule Checking\u201d, filed Sep. 16, 1998, and invented by Fang-Cheng Chang, Yao-Ting Wang and Yagyensh C. Pati, and also more specifically in the United States patent application entitled \u201cVisual Inspection and Verification System\u201d, filed Aug. 7, 1998, and invented by Fang-Cheng Chang, Yao-Ting Wang, Yagyensh C. Pati, and Linard Karklin, each of which were previously incorporated by reference herein., 162838=FIG. 11 illustrates how the method of FIG. 4 would generate the delta plane of parent cell E1 of FIG. 1 for an OPC operation according to one embodiment of the invention. As described by block 1100, at the link stage for cell E1, the overlap areas within E1 are determined and the area data is flattened. This is illustrated as overlap area 1000. Next, as described by block 1110, an intermediate correction plane 1020 for this overlap area 1000 is generated as described above with respect to FIG. 10(a). At block 1120, the correction planes 910 and 920 of all the children cells of E1 are summed to generate summed children correction data 1140. The last step as described by block 1130 is to generate the delta plane 1150 for cell E1 and store this data hierarchically. This is accomplished in one embodiment by subtracting the summed children correction data 1140 from the intermediate correction plane 1020 to obtain the delta plane 1150. Also illustrated in FIG. 11 is the final correction plane 1160 for cell E1 which as defined earlier represents the total of the corrections needed to be applied to the cell's design data in order to properly apply the particular operation, which here is OPC, to the cell. The correction plane 1160 comprises the E1's delta plane summed with the correction planes 910 and 920 of its children J1 and K1 respectively., 93730=U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/059,306 entitled \u201cMask Verification, Correction, and Design Rule Checking\u201d having inventors Fang-Cheng Chang, et al., filed Sep. 17, 1997;, 93527=U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/069,549 entitled \u201cData Heirarchy Advanced Mask Correction and Verification\u201d having inventors Fang-Cheng Chang, et. al., filed Dec. 12, 1997;, 93931=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/130,996 entitled \u201cVisual Inspection and Verification System\u201d having inventors Fang-Cheng Chang, et al., filed Aug. 7, 1998; and, 94114=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/931,921 entitled \u201cPhase Shifting Circuit Manufacturing Method and Apparatus\u201d having inventors Yao-Ting Wang, et al., filed Sep. 17, 1997., 172214=FIG. 19 illustrates an example screen snapshot of an individual cell 1310 that has been OPC corrected by a computer system executing one embodiment of the invention. The design window 1330 illustrates a cell 1310 to which its linked correction layer has been applied. The corrections applied to the cell 1310 include hammerheads 1410, assist lines 1420, positive serifs 1440, and negative serifs 1450. Note that the corrections to cell 1310 are different than those illustrated in FIG. 14 because FIG. 14 is a representation of all the corrections to the entire design\u2014while FIG. 19 only illustrates those corrections necessary to correct cell 1310 individually. In other words, the corrections illustrated in FIG. 19 do not take into account the interactions of cell 1310 with other cells adjacent to it. For instance, note that the bias lines 1430 of FIG. 14 are not present in FIG. 19., 157934=Operation engines which simply provide for OPC correction given a hierarchical input are well known in the field. In one embodiment of the system of FIG. 8, the OPC engine 240 is a rule-based OPC engine capable of generating OPC features in a manner that is controllable by the user of the system. For instance, the user can define the correction rules to be applied, and the size of the features to be applied to the design layout. Further, in one embodiment of the system, the location and size of bias lines 766 can be dependent upon the size and pitch of the IC pattern features being corrected, and/or restricted to being used only in critical areas of the design such as transistor gate regions. Still further, in another embodiment of the system the OPC engine 240 is capable of applying assist features 764 either in a localized manner to critical areas such as transistor gates or to the entire IC design globally. Still further, in another embodiment, the OPC engine can selectively place correction features in critical areas while not placing those correction features in areas that do not require them for accurate circuit performance. In one instance of this embodiment, the OPC engine can restrict the placing of biasing and assist features to transistor gates, while leaving the non-critical interconnect regions of the polysilicon gate layer uncorrected. In another instance, the OPC engine distinguishes critical transistor gate line-ends and applies hammerhead corrections to these areas to alleviate line-end shortening. Lastly, in another embodiment of the invention, the OPC operation engine is capable of providing for OPC correction of Phase Shifting Masks such as those disclosed in the U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cPhase Shifting Circuit Manufacture Method and Apparatus\u201d having Ser. No. 08/931,921, filed Sep. 17, 1997, and invented by Fang-Cheng Chang, Yao-Ting Wang and Yagyensh C. Pati which was previously incorporated by reference herein., 171588=FIG. 17 illustrates an example screen snapshot of a +1 OPC correction layer from a computer system executing one embodiment of the invention to provide OPC correction. This layer contains corrections to cell 1310 including hammerheads 1410, assist lines 1420, and positive serifs 1440., 94493=U.S. Patent application Ser. No. 09/154,397 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Data Hierarchy Maintenance in a System for Mask Description\u201d having inventors Fang-Cheng Chang, et al., filed Sep. 16, 1998; and, 169415=The remaining FIGS. 13-19 illustrate example screen snapshots from a computer system executing one embodiment of the present invention to provide OPC corrections for a hierarchical input IC design layout. For instance, FIG. 13 illustrates an example screen snapshot of the input design layout which is to be OPC corrected. The user interface 1300 of the design program comprises a design window 1330 in which is illustrated a portion of the IC design layout to be corrected. The design layout includes a diffusion layer 1390 and a layer of polysilicon structures such as primitive structures 1320. A cell 1310, similar to the sample parent cells E1 and F1 of FIG. 1, is also depicted in design window 1330., 167315=If the decision is not to redesign, but to try and fix the problem by continuing with the iterative correction process, a model based OPC algorithm is then run on the corrected design. Similarly, if the original corrected design data did not meet the design parameters of block 1225, the original corrected design data is input to a model based OPC algorithm. The model based OPC algorithm is then used to perform more detailed specific corrections to the original corrected design as shown at block 1230. The model based OPC corrected design can then be provided to block 1215 where a simulated image of the model based OPC corrected design is produced and once again compared to the desired image. Before entering the OPC corrected design into a conventional design rule checker product for analysis of the design, the simulated image of the model based OPC corrected design must be manipulated into a format that is acceptable by a conventional design rule checker. One way of doing this is to generate a Manhattan geometry representation of the simulated image based on an edge checking technique as described more fully in the aforementioned and incorporated United States provisional patent application entitled, \u201cMask Verification, Correction, and Design Rule Checking\u201d and the United States utility patent application of the same name. This whole process can be continued until a corrected design is produced which meets both the user defined design parameters and the circuit specific design rules., 171921=FIG. 18 illustrates an example screen snapshot of a \u22122 OPC correction layer from a computer system executing one embodiment of the invention to provide OPC correction. This layer contains corrections to cell 1310 including end butting correction feature 1810.}",
