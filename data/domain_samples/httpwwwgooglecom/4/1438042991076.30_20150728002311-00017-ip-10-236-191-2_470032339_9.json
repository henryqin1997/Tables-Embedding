    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure and the appended claims. The example discussed above included only one work site, however, the present invention may be implemented to cover multiple work sites and multiple machines at each work site. Since the excavator has binding updates for the service laptop 76 and the mobile router 78, the packets are no longer routed over the wide area network 86. This utilizes network resources efficiently and minimizes the use of the low speed wide area network. Note that in the foregoing example, the Route Optimization software on the excavator 80 must perform double encapsulation in order to send packets directly to the service laptop 76. The excavator 80 receives the packet. Excavator 80 also receives the two binding updates from the home agent 88. The excavator 80 uses the binding updates to add entries to its binding cache. Once the excavator has binding cache entries for the service laptop 76 and the mobile router 78, it can send packets using Route Optimization until the binding cache entries expire. The excavator 80 first checks its binding cache, then the packet is encapsulated using the service laptop's 76 care-of address as the destination address, which is the mobile router's 78 address. The excavator 80 again finds an entry in its binding cache, this time for mobile router 78.",
