For additional discussion, see Arridge. Inverse Problems 15:R41-R93, 1999., 139616=[0070] According to the plot, in order to obtain the minimum saturation error, one of the two wavelengths needs to be in the range of 640-720 nm, and the second wavelength in 850 to 1000 nm range. Decreasing the oxygen saturation from 85% to 45% does not change the optimal wavelengths, nor does it have a significant effect on the saturation error., 196540=[0101] Scattering and absorption coefficient values were assigned to each of the layers. Simulations were performed for different thicknesses of the maternal and amniotic fluid layers. The fetal layer was kept semi-infinite for all the simulations. The Monte Carlo method was used for simulating trans-abdominal measurements as described in Jacques et al. \u201cMonte Carlo modeling of light transport in tissues,\u201d In: Optical-Thermal Response of Laser-Irradiated Tissue,\u201d Welch et al., eds., Plenum, New York, 1995, pp 73-100. In this method, the histories of individual photons are simulated as they undergo scattering and absorption events in the medium. Each photon is followed until it disappears (gets absorbed or has a negligible contribution) or escapes the surface of the medium and therefore gets detected. In other words, the Monte Carlo method simulates the \u201crandom walk\u201d of the photons in the medium as perturbed by spatially varying absorption and scattering properties. The rules of photon propagation are given as probability distributions for the incremental steps of photon movement within the medium. One million photons were used in our simulation., 105571=[0061] One of the first oximeters, built in 1935 (Kramer, Klin. Wochenschr. 13:379, 1943), utilized only one wavelength located in the red reunion of the spectrum. Using only one wavelength prevented the device from compensating for changes in hemoglobin concentration. Subsequently, an oximeter using one red wavelength of around 660 nm (for oxy-hemoglobin), and one infrared wavelength as a reference (about 805 nm) was developed. The latter light beam is a wavelength at which the extinction coefficients of both oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin are the same (isosbestic point), and therefore the optical density depends on the total hemoglobin concentration and not the oxygen saturation. The use of two wavelengths therefore reduces the expression for oxygen saturation to SaO2=a+b(OD\u03bb1-OD\u03bb2), where the constants a and b are empirically determined., 45446=[0031] Pulse oximeters are widely used to monitor patient well being (Peterson, Science 232:G135-G140, 1986: Schmitt, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Engineer. 38:1192-1203, 1991; Marble et al., Applied Optics 33:1279-1285, 1994: and Mendelson et al. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Engineer. 35:798-805, 1988), as they provide accurate information on arterial blood oxygen saturation. The advantage of pulse oximetry over oxygen tension monitors is that they provide a rapid response to changes in blood oxygenation and are non-invasive. The first oximeter used in a clinical environment was an ear oximeter, in which the transmission through the ear lobe was measured by a lamp and photocell attached to the ear (Petersen, supra)., 139406=[0069]FIG. 4A demonstrates the dependence of the saturation error on wavelengths over the range of 600 to 1000 nm.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0133] It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the claims. Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the following claims. Other Embodiments [0132] Fetal arterial blood saturation is measured using the procedures and devices described in Example 2 above, with the following modifications (FIGS. 9 and 10). The emitter optode delivers light of two specific wavelengths, 700 nm and 830 nm. Both wavelengths of light are emitted and detected simultaneously. The intensity of back-scattered light of both wavelengths is detected at the abdominal surface and converted into electronic signals. A Fourier transform of the signals removes the maternal contribution so that the fetal contributions can be isolated. The fetal oxygen saturation (S) is then calculated using equations (7) and (8), which are described above. Pulse Oximetry Using Two Wavelengths Example 3 [0131] These results demonstrated the possibility of obtaining fetal signal through the mother's abdomen. It has been demonstrated herein that trans-abdominal fetal pulse oximetry is feasible. [0130] The dependence of the detected light intensity on the source/detector separation for three different depth ranges is given in Table 7. As one can see,",
