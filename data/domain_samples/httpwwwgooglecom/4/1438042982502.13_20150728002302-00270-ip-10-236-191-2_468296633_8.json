Trademark) Anterior Cervical Plate System of Sofamor Danek USA, 1800 Pyramid Place, Memphis, Tenn. 38132. The Orion\u2122 system teaches a plate having two pair of guide holes through which the screws are inserted to fix the plate to the vertebral body. The plate further includes external annular recessions about each of the guide holes which are radially non-symmetric in depth. More particularly, the annular recessions serve as specific angle guides for the screws so that they may be inserted non-perpendicularly with respect to the overall curvature of the plate. In addition, the Orion\u2122 plate includes an additional threaded hole disposed between each of the pairs of guide holes so that a corresponding set screw may be inserted to lock the bone screws to the plate., 18693=The present application is a continuation-in-part of applications U.S. Ser. No. 08/624,110 filed Mar. 29, 1996, Ser. No. 08/632,560 filed Apr. 15, 1996, and Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there has been described and illustrated a cervical implantation device for stabilizing and immobilizing regions of the cervical spine by affixing a polyaxial locking screw plate to the anterior portion of adjacent bones, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that variations and modifications are possible without deviating from the broad spirit and principle of the present invention which shall be limited solely by the scope of the claims appended hereto. Referring now to FIGS. 4a and 4 b, the pre-assembled and fully assembled screw 120, elongate coupling element 132, and plate 100 are shown, respectively, in cross-section views. As stated previously, the coupling element 132 is snapped into the corresponding elongated tapered through hole 110 of the plate 100. In this initial position, the coupling elements 132 are free to be independently and selectively moved by the surgeon, within the through holes, into the ideal position relative to the vertebral bone to which the assembly is to be affixed. The lower outer lip 137 of the coupling element 132 prevents the coupling element from falling out of the plate 110 in this initial position. Once properly positioned, the surgeon drills holes into the bone in order to prepare the sites for the screws 120 to be advanced thereinto. The screws 120 are then advanced through the interior 140 of the coupling element 132 until the head 122 thereof seats into the",
