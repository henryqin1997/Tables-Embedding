    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31114=Precision approaches, carried out under poor visibility conditions, require navigational guidance both horizontally and vertically, and place stringent requirements on the accuracy of position estimates. Vertical guidance, in particular is of critical importance. Currently, precision approaches require local instrumentation, such as Instrument Landing System (ILS), and the Microwave Landing System (MLS), installed at each runway to provide navigational guidance to suitably equipped aircraft. The ILS and MLS are expected to be phased out in favor of satellite navigation. In the future, precision approaches using satellite navigation will use GPS in either differential mode, local mode, or wide area mode. The latter of such may be Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which is planned to provide such capability over conterminous U.S. by the year 2000. Satellite navigation systems however, are thought to offer significantly better horizontal than vertical position estimates. Thus, an important challenge in the industry is to provide systems with enhanced vertical position accuracy., 29680=This invention was made with government support under contract no.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Variations, modifications, and other implementations of what is described herein will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed. Accordingly, the invention is to be defined not by the preceding illustrative description but instead by the following claims. Under the RNP concept, the NSE alarm limit varies from aircraft to aircraft, pilot to pilot, and situation to situation. As noted earlier, the tunnels are at their narrowest at the DH, and the NSE alarm limits at its most stringent, and at earlier instants during the approach, both TSE and NSE alarm limits are larger. As noted earlier, the requirement on probability of undetected violations of the containment tunnel is specified on a `per approach` basis. This probability will be allocated appropriately along the approach path to obtain the probability of undetected violation on a `per sample` basis. With navigational guidance from WAAS, a pilot following the flight path closely could be virtually assured of meeting the integrity requirements of Category 1. However, a pilot with a significant FTE if the aircraft is on the edge of the inner tunnel may have to abort the approach, execute a go-around, and try again with better control of the airplane. An aircraft with a smaller FTE can tolerate a larger navigation error, and vice versa. This trade off is cited as an important benefit of the",
