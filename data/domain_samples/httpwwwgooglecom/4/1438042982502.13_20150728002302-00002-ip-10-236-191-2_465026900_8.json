As for the method of forming the toner image 5 on the transparent film as the recording material, an electrophotographic process and electrostatic printing process are generally usable, but the invention is not limited to those processes, and other processes are acceptable if the toner image can be formed on the transparent film. As for the toner, the toner usable with the above-mentioned processes, that is, the toner having a binder in which dye, pigment and the other additives are dispersed and mixed. The toner can contain magnetic materials if the amount, the particle size and the material thereof are such that they do not impede the light transmitting therethrough. The present invention includes any combination of the above-described structures. The heating source is not limited to the heater 3 provided inside the roller. An external heater, heat pipe, PTC ceramic heater or the like may be used in place thereof. The rollers may be replaced by belts or pressing plates, although it is preferable to use pressing means having a resiliency to accomplish the close contact between the toner image and the processing sheet.
