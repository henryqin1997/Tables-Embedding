    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the above explanation of exemplary systems, it will be appreciated that other embodiments of the present invention may be employed in many applications to accumulate statistical data, process such data, and define subsets of callers of concern. While certain exemplary operations have been stated herein, and certain detailed structures have been disclosed, the appropriate scope hereof is deemed to be in accordance with the claims as set forth below. In the operation of the system of FIG. 9, the call distributors CD are coupled to a telephonic communication system and accordingly allow the interface units I to provide interface communication between the central processing unit 251 and a multitude of remote terminals T1-Tn as illustrated in FIG. 1. With data accumulated in the cells, it may be variously down loaded as to a central processing station. Thus, the distributed-component system is capable of executing the various formats as explained above with reference to the illustrative structure. Call distributors CD1-CDn are at different geographic locations along with associated interface units IA1-IAn and IB1-IBn. Each of the interface units, as unit IA1 is coupled to a central processor 251 as indicated by lines 252, 254, 256 and 258. Each of the lines may take the form of a dedicated telephone line or a polling telephonic coupling. As explained above, the arrangement of the function unit (or units) may be variously embodied in a single processor",
