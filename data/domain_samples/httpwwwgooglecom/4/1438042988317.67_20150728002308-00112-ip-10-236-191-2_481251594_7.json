(3) The operation manager is informed by electronic mail saying that a message desired to be posted including heed-required words was posted on the electronic bulletin board. The operation manager can utilize this notification as effective data for deciding future handling of the heed-required words in the electronic bulletin board system. (2) When a message desired to be posted is not posted on the electronic bulletin board, the operation manager is informed of the event that posting was rejected by an electronic mail. Thus, the operation manager can fully seize the processing that has been performed by the electronic bulletin board system, simply by confirming the electronic mail.
