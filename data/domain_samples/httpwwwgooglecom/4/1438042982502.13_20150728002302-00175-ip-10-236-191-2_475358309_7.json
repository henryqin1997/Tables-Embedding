    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, but are not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways and techniques for implementation. The disclosed examples are illustrative and not restrictive. In some examples, execution of the sequences of instructions may be performed by a single computer system 500. According to some examples, two or more computer systems 500 coupled by communication link 520 (e.g., LAN, PSTN, or wireless network) may perform the sequence of instructions in coordination with one another. Computer system 500 may transmit and receive messages, data, and instructions, including program (i.e., application code) through communication link 520 and communication interface 512. Received program code may be executed by processor 504 as it is received, and/or stored in disk drive 510, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. Common forms of computer readable media includes, for example, floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read. The term \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor 504 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile",
