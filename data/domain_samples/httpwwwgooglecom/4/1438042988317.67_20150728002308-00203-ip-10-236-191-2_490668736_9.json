On the contrary, the intention of this application is to cover all modifications and embodiments fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Utilizing the circuit packages as disclosed above in the display system 300, allows the display controller 308 and the display driver 328 to have a low profile where the optical transmitter 320 and the optical receiver 332 are coupled to the circuit substrate, respectively, which may assist in the design and placement of components in the base portion 302 and the display 304 unit, respectively. Further, most or all of the components of the display controller 308 and the display driver 328 may be coupled to their circuit substrate in a similar manner, thereby lowering the overall profile of the display controller 308 and/or the display driver 328. In turn, the base portion 302 and/or the display unit 304 may have lower overall profiles. Although the display system 300 is disclosed as including an optical transmitter 320 in the base portion 302 and an optical receiver 332 in the display unit 304, optical transceivers, as disclosed above, may be utilized instead, thereby allowing for two-way communications between the display controller 308 and the display driver 328, such",
