For example, United States Patent No. 1,669,362, Watson, May 8, 1928, presents a filter plate made up of a mass of silica particles which are heated to a temperature at which adhesion occurs without complete fusion and then cooling the mass to retain it in that state. The resultant filter, therefore, has bafiled openings between the grains making it sufficiently porous to permit gases and liquids to filter therethrough., 8135=OOXOj/OOOOO INVENTOR l'lE/NO AL TOSAAR ATTORNEY y 3, 1956 H.

A method of making a glass filter as claimed in claim 7, including the additional step of polishing said severed portions. 7. A method of making a glass filter comprising the steps of threading a length of metallic Wire through a glass capillary of lesser length than said wire, heating and drawing the glass capillary along the Wire to reduce the diameter of the glass capillary, cutting the glass coated wire into substantially equal lengths, inserting the cut lengths of glass coated wire in juxtaposed axial parallel alignment within a hollow glass tube having internal and external dimensions corresponding to the desired size of the filter and of substantially greater length than the cut wire lengths, subjecting the combined glass tube and glass coated Wire lengths to sufficiently high temperatures to melt the Whole into a homogeneous mass while applying vacuum to one end of said glass tube to Withdraw air from between said glass coated wire lengths and the inner surfaces of said glass tube, severing the homogeneous mass so produced transversely of the axis of said wire lengths into portions equal to the desired thickness of the filter, and removing said wire by immersion of the severed portions in an acid bath reactive with the metal of the wire to form a soluble salt thereof. 6.",
