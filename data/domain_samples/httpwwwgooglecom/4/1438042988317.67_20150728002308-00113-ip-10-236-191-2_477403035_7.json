No. 07/983,348, filed on Nov. 30, 1992, now abandoned., 18615=Cellular communication systems are divided into a plurality of contiguous specific geographical coverage areas called cells. Access, via mobile subscriber (MS) radiotelephones, to the telephone network is through a cell site or macrocellular base station (BS) located in each cell, (i.e., equipment which includes antennas, radio transceivers and control equipment operative to facilitate radio air interconnection between a MS and the BS assigned to cover the geographical area where the MS is located). The BS is connected to a mobile switching center (MSC) which is in turn connected to the public switched land telephone network (PSTN). A detailed description of the cellular telecommunications system may be found in \"The Cellular Concept\" by V. H. MacDonald in The Bell System Technical Journal, January 1979, Vol. 58 No. 1, pages 15-42.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Overall TDM interface circuit protection is provided by a TDM bus sanity and control interface circuit 304. A network processing circuit 308 provides information transfer, including a serial to parallel conversion, between the T1 link interface 321 and the TDM buffer 301. The TDM bus interface 322 plugs into a normal RCU TDM bus slot with lead 311. The bus interace 322 includes a TDM buffer circuit 301 which is connected to a TDM bus slot of either the BS or microcell access station depending on the location of the TDM bus interface at either the BS or microcell access station. The TDM buffer is connected to the TDM multi-address control logic circuit 302. A manually switched group address control is connected to an input of the control logic circuit 302 to provide manual addressing control. A dual port memory 314 is connected to a bus coupling the controller 323 to the protocol controller 313. The protocol controller 313, connected to the dual port memory operates to provide data retransmission to the T1 link interface 321 and provide formatting functions such as CRC checking and framing. Within the bus interface 321 the DS1 digital interface facility 310 is connected to a framing and controller circuit 309. This circuit packages the digital signal frame for transmission over the T1 carrier link and provides the proper framing format. Control of the bus interface circuitry is directed by a",
