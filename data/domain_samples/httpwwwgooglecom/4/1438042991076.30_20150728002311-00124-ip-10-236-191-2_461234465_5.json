The limited success of the general purpose computer in performing pattern anaylsis and classifications is due to the extremely long processing time to process images with very many data points or pixels. A more promising approach is the use of special purpose processors which implement a mathmatical technique applicable to data in the form of images, integral geometry being such a technique. One such approach considers the input data as an M by N array of zeroes and ones representing black or white picture elements. From the input array another M by N array is derived wherein each point in the second array is a function of the state of the equivalent point in the initial array. A series of these transforms may be peformed to determine some of the characteristics of patterns displayed in the initial array. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,214,574 discloses a special purpose image processor used for counting lympocytes in blood. Devices employing similar forms of processors for implementing these so called \"neighborhood transforms\" are disclosed in Pattern Detection and Recognition by Unger, Proceedings of the I.R.E. 1959, page 737; Feature Extraction by Golay Hexogonal Pattern Transforms, Preston, Jr., IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. C-20, No. 9, September 1971; and A Parallel Picture Processing Machine by Kruse, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. C-22, No. 12, December 1973., 27128=Another class of special purpose machines for implementing a form of integral geometry analysis employing what the author terms \"hit-or-miss transformations\" is disclosed in \"The Texture Analyzer\", Journal of Microscopy, Volume 95, Part II, April 1972, pages 349-356., 40974=In the prior art, this is generally performed by a group of shift registers which have an appropriate number of stages such that the proper pixel values in adjacent lines of the matrix defining the window are presented for analysis or extracted in the appropriately timed sequence. The number of stages in the shift registers determined the maximum sensor scan line lengths that could be processed by the system. For example, if the shift registers had 1024 stages the maximum permissible sensor scan line lengths would be 1027 for a 3\ufffd3 window. Shorter sensor scan line lengths could be handled but it required placing dummy pixels in the data stream to fill up the gaps. For example, if the sensor scan line length was only 64 pixels wide, 963 (1027-64) dummy or invalid pixels were required. This greatly slows down the processing time for the system., 27724=1. G. Matheron, Random Sets and Integral Geometry, Wiley, 1975., 60899=The preceding analysis is generally considered to be of a two dimensional variety. According to a feature of this invention, neighborhood analysis logic circuitry 48 is capable of performing a wide variety of alternative functions, including three-dimensional analysis, in the same stage. Three-dimensional analysis is generally made by adding particular contribution values to all of the neighborhood pixels and then detecting the maximum value within the window, with the maximum value being used as the stage transformation output. The present invention not only has this capability but may also detect which particular pixel or pixels in the neighborhood has the highest value. This is particularly advantageous where it is desired to locate a steep drop-off in the image, for example, to locate an edge of a table. This is accomplished through the use of a comparator 108 which sequentially compares the outputs of adder 92 with the preceding highest pixel value in each window. For example, the first pixel value (after including the bias and contribution) may be 10. This is coupled to the A input of comparator 108. At this time the B input of comparator 108 is at 0 since this is the first pixel in the window. Consequently, the pixel value on input A is both greater than or equal to (A\u2267B) and greater than (A>B) comparator input B causing both comparator output lines 110 and 112 to go high. The A input to comparator 108 is also coupled to an input A of a 3:1 multiplexer 77. A truth table for multiplexer 77 is shown in FIG. 10D. With line 112 high and the remainder of the select inputs low, the multiplexer 77 will be conditioned so that its output SELOUT will be coupled to input A. Multiplexer output SELOUT is connected to the data input of a current maximum register 114. The Q output of current maximum register 114 is connected to the B input of comparator 108. Thus, current maximum register 114 provides the maximum detected pixel value within the window, at least as far as the analysis has progressed., 56697=A predetermined bias level or dynamic correction value may be added to the selected pixel value by adder 80. The bias value may be a function of the pixel value of the center cell Z and is generated by circuit components 82 and 84. Briefly, the bias value may be chosen to bring all of the pixel values within a given range that can be more accurately analyzed by the system. Other advantageous functions of this biasing circuitry will be later explained herein. The bias or dynamic data correction feature is disclosed in more detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 73,716, entitled \"Dynamic Data Correction Generator For An Image Analyzer System\", filed Sept. 10, 1979, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,290,049 which is hereby incorporated by reference., 43933=Turning again to FIG. 1, a master controller 32 communicates with each stage of the pipeline over the serial communication link 14. Controller 32 may be any of a wide variety of data processing devices capable of generating and transmitting transformation control instructions and pixel data from source 20 over link 14 to the pipeline. In the preferred embodiment, controller 32 consists of a microprocessor such as the 2900 from Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif., 27807=2. Albert B. J. Novikoff, \"Integral Geometry As A Tool In Pattern Reception\", in Principals of Self Organization, edited by Von Foerstn and Zopf, Pergamon Press, 1962., 57484=The output of adder 80 is coupled to one input of an eight element AND gate 88. The other inputs to AND gate 88 are the input bit mask ITBMSK from internal control registers 50. The input bit mask signals can be used to selectively disable a particular bit or bits from being considered in calculating the transformation. There is also an output bit mask OTBMSK (FIG. 9) which forms an input to output generation multiplexers 56 (FIG. 7C). When a particular bit of the output bit mask is a 0 the output multiplexer 56 will select the corresponding bit of the original center value Z as shown in truth table of FIG. 10B. Combined use of the input bit mask and output bit mask can selectively disable bits from undergoing any transformation and thus those bits will pass to the next stage unmodified. This so called bit level enabling feature is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 73,817, entitled \"Bit Level Enable Circuitry For An Image Analyzer System\", filed Sept. 10, 1979, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this embodiment, the input bit mask ITBMSK and output bit mask OTBMSK are derived from the internal control registers 368, 370 as shown more clearly in FIG. 9., 55691=Turning now to FIG. 8, there is shown the details of the neighborhood analysis logic circuitry 48. Each of the nine neighborhood extraction registers 36 are coupled to selected inputs of 9:1 multiplexer 76. Multiplexer 76 serves to sequentially couple one of its inputs to its output labeled NABOR. A line shift multiplexer 78 takes in nine control signals C0-C8 from timing and control logic 46 and provides a coded output to the select input of multiplexer 76 for selecting one of the neighborhood extraction registers 36. Generally, multiplexer 76 sequentially selects neighborhood registers A-H and Z in that order. However, a wide variety of sequences can be established, if desired. A truth table for the line shift multiplexer 78 is shown in FIG. 10C. Hence, it can be seen that the particular neighborhood extraction register that is selected will depend upon the contents of multiplexer 78, input lines C0-C8 and a line shift signal LNSHFT from the timing and control logic 46., 29246=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 73,818 to Sternberg, filed Sept. 10, 1979, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,322,716, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses pattern recognition circuitry capable of analyzing three dimensional images represented by multi-valued pixel image data. The specific embodiment shown in that application utilizes two different pipelines of transformation stages, one for two-dimensional image analysis and one for three-dimensional image analysis. While the stages in each pipeline are substantially identical, the stages in one pipeline differ from those in the other pipeline. The stages in the two dimensional pipelines are specifically adapted to perform transformations generally associated with two-dimensional image data, while the stages in the three dimensional pipeline are particularly adapted for performing three dimensional data analysis. A central controller routes the image data to one or the other of the pipelines depending upon the type of analysis to be performed, with the central controller being parallel coupled to the control portions of each stage. The controller sends control instructions to the transformation logic to define the type of transformations to be generated in each stage of the selected pipeline., 28004=3. J. Sera, \"Stereology and Structuring Elements\", Journal of Microscopy, Vol. 95, Part 1, February 1972, pages 93-103., 58718=The output of AND gate 88 is coupled to a buffer register 90. The output of register 90 is coupled to input A of adder 92. The other input B to adder 92 is a contribution value CONTRB from the internal registers 50. The particular contribution value will vary depending upon the analysis desired of the particular stage. For example, if one is interested in all of the pixel values in the window having a value of 5, the contribution value would be chosen to be the two's complement of 5; namely -5. Therefore, all pixel values having a value of 5 will produce a zero or logical low level at the output of adder 92 when added with the -5 contribution value. This zero level is detected by an eight low-true-input AND gate 93 which supplies a logical 1 (true) level over line 95 to one input of multiplexer 94. Multiplexer 94 is a modified 7:2 multiplexer which selectively couples up to two of its seven inputs to its two outputs 99 and 100. The select inputs for multiplexer 94 are derived from the internal registers (see FIG. 9) and an off image signal OFFIMG to be later described. A truth table for multiplexer 94 is shown in FIG. 10A. With all of the select inputs at a logical zero level, the multiplexer 94 couples the zero detect input line 95 to output line 100. Output line 100 is coupled to an input of a flip flop 102. The Q output of flip flop 102 is coupled to the D input of an eight bit serial-in-parallel-out shift register 104. Thus, shift register 102-104 will be loaded with a logical true level if the pixel value is equal to and opposite from the contribution value CONTRB and will otherwise be loaded with a logical false level. This process occurs for all of the pixels in the neighborhood window. After the last bit in the neighborhood window has been analyzed and loaded into flip-flop 102, the next clock pulse will cause the output of shift register 104 and flip flop 102 to simultaneously be dumped into a nine bit buffer 106. Each bit position in buffer 106 corresponds with a particular pixel in the neighborhood wiondow. The output NRMADR of buffer 106 provides the NRAM address vector to address and hold circuitry 64 (FIG. 3).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other memory organizations could be used in different embodiments. For example, the memory 22 could be organized as four separate banks of memory; two pixel line storage banks, an NRAM bank, and a PRAM bank. This would allow memory access to be performed in parallel, thus allowing a higher processing speed. While this invention has been described in connection with a particular example, other modifications will become apparent to one skilled in the art by studying the specification, drawings, and the following claims. Generally, the image processing continues down the pipeline where the output of the last stage is coupled to a utilization device 34 (FIG. 1). A wide variety of diagnostic operations can be performed by appropriate use of the Local Readback-Internal (LRI) and Local Readback-Memory (LRM) instructions. Individual stages can be reprogrammed by the appropriate use of the local no operation (NOP) and Local Program instructions.
