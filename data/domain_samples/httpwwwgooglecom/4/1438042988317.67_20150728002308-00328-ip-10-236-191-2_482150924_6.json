The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. [0083] A further UV release tape (not shown) is applied to a rear of the wafer 16 and the tape 140 is removed. The sacrificial layers 108, 112, 120, 128 and 134 are stripped in oxygen plasma to provide the final nozzle assembly 10 as shown in FIGS. 8r and 9 r of the drawings. For ease of reference, the reference numerals illustrated in these two drawings are the same as those in FIG. 1 of the drawings to indicate the relevant parts of the nozzle assembly 10. FIGS. 11 and 12 show the operation of the nozzle assembly 10, manufactured in accordance with the process described above with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9 and these figures correspond to FIGS. 2 to 4 of the drawings. [0082] An ultraviolet (UV) release tape 140 is applied. 4 \u03bcm of resist is spun on to a rear of the silicon wafer 16. The wafer 16 is exposed to mask 142 to back etch the wafer 16 to define the ink inlet channel",
