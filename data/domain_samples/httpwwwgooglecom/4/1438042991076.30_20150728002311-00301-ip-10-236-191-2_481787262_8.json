The model included the channels 92, 94 and 96, shown in FIG. 6, with one cascade 245 in each tunnel 222 and 224, the end plates 234 and 236 acting as outer edge end plates for the cascades 245 and the engine and transmission fairing sidewalls 246 and 248 acting as inner edge end plates. The model of the car 220 was tested with and without the channels 92, 94 and 96. Regardless of the ride height, the model without the channels, 92, 94 and 96 suffered flow separation from the ceilings of the tunnels near the area of the rear axle 242. The flow exited the tunnels in a discrete stream positioned midway between the ground surface and the trailing edge of the tunnels. When the model of the car 220 was equipped with the channels, 92, 94 and 96, tufting and local total head readings showed fully attached flow had been established over the entire lengths of the tunnels 222 and 224. The result was that the downforce increased over 25%, while the downforce to drag ratio was improved 7%, meaning that a car built like the model with less horsepower will be faster both in the corners and on the straightaways if the present invention is included therein., 78005=As reported in NACA Research Memorandum, A8F21 entitled \"An Experimental Investigation of a Large Scale of Several Configurations of a NACA Submerged Air Intake\", published 19 Oct., 1948, devices are known for generating strong vorticity by passing flow over the sharp corners of the intersections between channel walls and a reference body surface adjacent an inlet ramp surface. Typically, NACA inlets have a ramp surface of generally V-shape which extends to an inlet duct lip thereabove and is bounded on the opposite sides by reflexed sidewalls extending upwardly to the body surface at approximately 90\ufffd. However, since all NACA inlets are intended to be inlets for rectangular cross-section intake ducts, their sidewalls must become parallel to the connecting duct sidewalls, hence the reflex and inlet duct lip must be carefully designed. The inlet lip forms the beginning of a fourth wall for the duct at the location of flow entry into the vehicle. The planform of a NACA inlet is always defined by the chosen ramp angle, that is, the included angle between the flat ramp floor and the body's external body surface. The length of the NACA inlet is always a direct result of that choice of angle. This grossly reduces the design choices available, especially when it is desired to reduce the aerodynamic drag of a body having a poor slenderness ratio., 105741=In full-scale tests, using a stock 1980 Volkswagon diesel pickup truck, a camper shell was constructed with an array of individual channels 30, as shown in FIG. 2, which commenced at the shell's upper suface immediately behind the truck's roof. The upper surface of the shell was then curved downward 30\ufffd over the bed of the truck to terminate at tailgate height. Tufts verified the flow was attached at all surfaces. Despite a severe induced drag penalty due to lift, the CD fell from the 0.49 of a stock truck and the 0.47 of a commercially available streamlined fiberglass shell to 0.42, allowing the otherwise stock truck to give over 60 mpg in steady state cruise at 55 mph. The unwanted lift and drag increment, which in this case arose from the use of an upper surface for boat-tailing, could have been avoided by simply utilizing flow control surfaces of aerodynamic symmetry, such as the rear fenders 208 and 210, shown in FIGS., 11, 12 and 13.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus there has been shown and described vortex generating, flow separation preventing channels which can be used in numerous ways to improve the lift and drag characteristics of flow-control surfaces subjected to adverse pressure gradients or to eliminate surface structure otherwise required to avoid adverse pressure gradients, which fulfill all the objects and advantages sought therefore. Many changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications of the subject channels will become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering this specification and the accompanying drawings. All such changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention which is limited only by the claims which follow. In FIG. 16, channels 300, 302 and 304 similar to the channels 202, 204 and 206 in FIGS. 11 through 13 are shown applied to modify an existing car 306 whose rear end 308 exists with an unfavorable height 310 so that as the channels 300, 302 and 304 camber around the rear end 308, the floor surface 312 of the last channel 304 must become unacceptably wide. To assure that separation does not occur on the floor 312 a pair of walls 314 and 316, similar to those shown between the dotted lines 317 in FIG. 7, are employed to generate vortices and prevent flow separation adjacent the sides of",
