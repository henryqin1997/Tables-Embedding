In the later case, this will ensure that the sponsor server must first use SUID to access ER1, and then decrypt CUID\u2032 with ER1 to derive UID before separately accessing Eak, and customization information Cl using decrypted UID, as described above. Optionally secured ER1,NR1 are preferably stored in database 1000 or 1000\u2032, as applicable, at the same location as that at which optionally secured ER,NR had previously been stored in database 1000 or 1000\u2032., 84637=More particularly, as for example disclosed in U.S. application Ser.

As in the conventional split key asymmetric cryptosystems discussed above, each of the key portions can be applied to an original message separately or in sequence and the partial results combined to form a transformed, i.e. encrypted, message, and the other key, e.g. the public key, can be applied to the transformed message to verify authenticity of the message preferably by recovering the original message, which authenticates the user. Conversely a message transformed, i.e. encrypted, with the other key, e.g. the public key, can be decrypted by applying each of the split key portions, e.g. the private key portions, to the transformed message separately or in sequence and the partial results combined to decrypt the original message., 173926=If a match is found, at step 715 the processor retrieves the public augmenting key Eak, the Cl, and the second private key portion DU2 and public key EU that have been previously stored in association with the matched UID in the database 1000. If Eak, DU2 and/or EU is stored in an encrypted state, in step 717 the processor 500 of sponsor station 50 decrypts Eak, i.e. Eak=Decrypt(CEak, KEak), DU2, i.e. DU2=Decrypt(CDU2, KU), and/or EU, i.e. EU=Decrypt(CEU, KU)., 65857=However, more recently a split key asymmetric cryptographic system was developed which overcomes these vulnerabilities to dictionary attack as well as the other problems of proposed split private key systems.

Various features and aspects of the above described invention may be used individually or jointly. Further, although the invention has been described in the context of its implementation in a particular environment and for particular purposes, e.g. in providing security for network communications, those skilled in the art will recognize that its usefulness is not limited thereto and that the present invention can be beneficially utilized in any number of environments and implementations. Accordingly, the claims set forth below should be construed in view of the full breath and spirit of the invention as disclosed herein. While no zero footprint solution can provide true protection against phishers launching MITM attacks, the above described augmented single factor split private key asymmetric cryptography provides much enhanced protection against MITM attacks, as compared to previously proposed zero footprint solutions. Additionally, by optionally adding the above described rolling key security and augmented user authentication, the system is even more difficult for an attacker to defeat via an MITM attack. In summary, the above described augmented single factor split private key asymmetric cryptography provides true, zero footprint protection against phishers using impostor websites. , as applicable.
