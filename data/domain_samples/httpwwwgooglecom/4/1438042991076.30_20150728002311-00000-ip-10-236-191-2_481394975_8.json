    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing detailed description of the preferred embodiment has been given for clearness of understanding only and no unnecessary limitations should be understood therefrom. Such modifications will be obvious to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims. Although the device 100 of the present invention has been described as being separate from the battery, it will be understood that the device 100 may be integrally constructed within the battery without deviation from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The ability of the integrated circuit 150 to adjust the voltage trigger level at which the battery is disconnected from the accessories 108 allows the battery to be disconnected at a lower voltage under heavy load conditions and at a higher voltage due to parasitic conditions that exist over an extended period of time. Similarly, a signal on line 140 will disable the integrated circuit 150 to prevent disconnection of the battery from the accessories during operation of the engine. Conversely, if the SOC is less than level (X), step 236 branches to step 238 where the solenoid switch bank (X) is opened. The variable \"X\" is then incremented at step 240 and the program then branches to step 232 where the above steps are repeated. At step 236, the microprocessor 150 compares the SOC with",
