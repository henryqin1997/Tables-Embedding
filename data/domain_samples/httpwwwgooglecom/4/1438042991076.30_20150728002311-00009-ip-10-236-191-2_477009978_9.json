    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The bandage as described in the preferred embodiments is shown in use in a hospital setting. Although, as already pointed out, the bandage may be used in other settings both medical, and non-medical for holding articles to objects or for securing and sealing objects. For example, one such contemplated setting is in the electronics industry where transparent sealing devices may be used to secure wires within, around or between equipment. Another application is in shipping for holding labels to boxes, in dentistry for securing tubes to a patient's mouth or in packaging for containing spoilable goods in a breathable package. The bandages shown in the various embodiments of the present invention also have the advantages of maintaining an effective barrier to allow for the insertion of various medications and salves, without spillage. Such materials can be contained close to the wound while the bandage and its foam frame enables a patient to shower or even submerge the dressing without affecting such medications. The slit 410 is incorporated into the frame 408 in order to prevent contaminants from entering the wound site. This is accomplished by using the slit 410 as the channel through which a tube 69 is inserted into the bandage as shown in FIG. 9b. When the tube 69 is placed in the slit, the slit closes along the sides of the tube, sealing the area around the tube 69 from contaminant/ moisture seepage",
