No. 08/351,637, filed Dec. 7, 1994. That application describes in detail how serial interrupt peripherals 41, 42 and 43 are capable of implementing a serial interrupt protocol for signaling interrupts through the serial interrupt controller 40 through integration of a primary serial interrupt bus 44 and a secondary serial interrupt bus 45. Further described therein is the use of serial interrupt bridge 46 for coupling the primary and secondary buses 44 and 45, respectively.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations There has thus been described a method and apparatus for flexibly configuring interrupts for use in a computer system implementing a shared interrupt bus. Although the present invention has been described with respect to illustrated and preferred embodiments, these are by way of illustration only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention may also be implemented with various modifications and refinements. Accordingly, the present invention should be judged in terms of the claims which follow. The polarity setting for each INT signal tells the global router how to be configured for receiving level-sensitive INT signals from the platform devices incorporated in the computer system. Similarly, the sensitivity select setting tells the global router whether a given INT signal is a level-sensitive or edge-triggered interrupt. This provides for flexibility for devices which drive the interrupt lines over interrupt bus 55.
