The effluent from the tubular membrane has a cell concentration within the range of 102 to 1010 cells per milliliter or a mass fraction of from 0.005 to 0.15., 15548=In U.S. patent application Ser. No. 06/939,818, filed Dec. 9, 1986, now abandoned entitled \"Chemobiotic Tissue Culturing,? there is described a process (herein Folsome et al invention) for growing plants cells in a bioreactor. The plants cells are Grown under conditions that are independent of weather conditions, and therefore are not subject to the ravages of droughts, floods, frost, or wind. Soil and ground water pollution is eliminated because fertilizers and pesticides are not necessary. Depending upon the plant tissue cultures used as starting material, products produced by the Folsome et al invention may be made to exhibit the original color, taste, odor, and nutritional values of the plant from which the tissue culture is obtained. Products produced by the the Folsome et al invention can be manufactured the year round, maximizing existing packaging facilities. Production facilities employing the process of Folsome et al invention may be located anywhere in the world where water and energy are available.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above description discloses the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention. The invention is, however, susceptible to modifications, for example, in the preparation of plant cells, the chemicals used, in the sizes of the equipment used, and alternate process steps from those described in the examples and illustrated in the drawing. Consequently, it is not the intention to limit this invention to the particular embodiments disclosed. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications and alternates coming within the spirit and scope of the invention as generally expressed by the following claims. SCOPE OF THE INVENTION l) Four glass windows 226 eight inches in diameter allow a view of what is occurring inside the bioreactor. k) The working or exposed length of the dialysis tube 22 are 202 and 204 slightly Greater than the actual distance between the headers to allow the bioreactor B5 to be assembled. However, care must be taken not to make the tubes 22 so long that they rub against each other. j) The bioreactor B5 is designed to be taken apart easily so that its tubes 22 can be changed with minimum effort. When all the tubes have been installed, the top and bottom headers 202 and 204 are gasketed with seals 230 and bolted in place, and the bioreactor B5 is ready to be used. The bioreactor B5 is assembled in a special way",
