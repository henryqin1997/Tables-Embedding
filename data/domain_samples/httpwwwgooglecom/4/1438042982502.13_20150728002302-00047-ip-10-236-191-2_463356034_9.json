    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6568=FIG. 9 a illustrates a system 153 for detecting (or predicting) and out sorting suspect mail from a mail stream. The system 153 includes a feeder 10, singulator 12, transporter 16, optical character recognition (OCR) scanner 14, video scanner 15, control system 100, addressee database 22 for use with a sort plan and a suspect database 26 that includes criteria for determining whether a mailpiece is suspected of containing life harming substances. The suspect database is used in the method illustrated in FIG. 9 c for detecting suspect mailpieces in a mail stream and diverting such mailpieces from delivery. Downstream from the transporter 16 along the feed path F, the diverter module 24 is positioned to divert mailpieces into collection module 25. The diverter 24 diverts the suspect mailpieces to collection module 25 and is typically configured such that a finger or van (not shown) diverts mailpieces from the feed path F to an out sorting path O. Collection module 25 could be for example, a cart, a bucket, a biohazardous materials container, a stacker such as a horizontal or vertical stacker (the general components of a stacker for handling mixed sized mailpieces are described U.S. Pat. No. 6,161,830 titled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR STACKING MIXED MAIL issued to Yap on Dec. 19, 2000, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and herein incorporated by reference) or other suitable component such as a bin for containing biohazardous materials or an explosives container. Bin module 20 is positioned downstream from diverter 24 for collecting trusted mailpieces in appropriate bins 18 (shown in FIG. 9 b) as determined by the sort plan.}",

No. 6,328,300 issued Dec. 11, 2001 to Stefan et al. titled ALIGNER MECHANISM FOR A MAIL HANDLING SYSTEM and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein., 28432=Soon after the Sep. 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, someone and/or a group of people, has been adding harmful biological agents to the mail. The addition of harmful biological agents to the mail submitted to the USPS has caused the death of some people and necessitated the closure of some post offices and other government office buildings and has caused delays in the sortation and delivery of mail including the delivery of incoming mail to businesses. Individuals who receive and handle mail are encouraged to use safety precautions such as: washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling mailpieces; avoiding shaking mailpieces; avoiding bumping or sniffing mailpieces; and avoiding handling of mailpieces suspected of contamination. These measures can be impractical when the volume of mail such as the incoming mail at a business is large. Thus, there is an urgent need to exclude or detect life-harming materials that are included in the mail in such a way that the delivery of the mail is efficient, reliable and safe and thus does not to negatively impact the functioning of the business.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention provides a system and method for helping to deter delays in the mail delivery. Another additional advantage of the present invention is that the negative impact of delayed mail delivery is reduced. It further provides the ability to protect recipients receipt of life threatening mailpieces. While the present invention has been disclosed and described with reference to a single embodiment thereof, it will be apparent, as noted above that variations and modifications may be made therein. It is, thus, intended in the following claims to cover each variation and modification that falls within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. An additional feature of the present invention is recordation of addressee and sender information for suspect mailpieces and recordation of suspect criteria for which the mailpiece was determined to be suspect. A video image of the mailpiece can also be stored with the suspect information. Such information can be used by law enforcement personnel to attempt to determine the origin of the mailpieces. Additional information such as the time and date of sort or receipt, recipient information and sender information, cancellation zip code can also be stored. Such information could later be used as additional suspect criteria. Additionally, the system 153 could be connected to, for example, the USPS, a private investigator or law enforcement agencies so that information such as a video image of the suspect mailpiece 30",
