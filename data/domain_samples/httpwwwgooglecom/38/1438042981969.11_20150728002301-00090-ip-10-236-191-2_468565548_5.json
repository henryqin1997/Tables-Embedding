Numerous variations, whether explicitly provided for by the specification or implied by the specification, such as variations in structure, dimension, type of material and manufacturing process may be implemented by one of skill in the art in view of this disclosure. [0047] Subsequent to the completion of the punch singulation process, the chip package 100 assumes the final configuration shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. In the completed chip package 100, each of the contacts 20 defines an exposed distal end 20 f, with each of the tie bars 18 defining an exposed distal end 18 f. It will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that the singulation creases 56, 58 or single singulation crease described above, though being shown and described as being incorporated into a micro lead frame (MLF) chip package 100, may be used in alternative types of integrated circuit chip packages as well. [0046] The punch 64 preferably initially impacts the bottom surface 54 of the peripheral portion 50 and second surfaces 20 b, 18 b to minimize burring of the singulated copper of the contacts 20 and tie bars 18. If, on the other hand, only the single singulation crease is formed in the top surface",
