It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. In summary, the present invention provides improved error reporting and recovery as compared to that of the prior art. A central error/warning storage structure is used to reduce the number of error/warning messages presented to a user as the result of a single unexpected result. An error/warning reporting interface provides the user with a selectable amount of information as to error/warning recovery options. Thus, the user is provided with a more concise and more effective error/warning recovery options. A user of computer system 600 can use cursor control device 615 to request more or less information related to the error/warning summary or log displayed on display device 630. Thus, the user has a measure of control over the amount of information displayed regarding one or more errors/warnings that occurred during use of CAD application 660. Processor 610 continues execution of CAD application 640 as appropriate, which may be to continue execution or to report errors/warnings that have occurred. In reporting of errors/warnings, sequences of instructions in CAD application 660 cause processor 610 display an error/warning report interface on",
