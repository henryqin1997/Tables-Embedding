It will, however be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. In a third example, a session is established between a client computer in net 30 and an internet web site via the HTTP protocol. The proxy may allow commands from the client computer to read from the web site; however, the proxy may disallow posts (or writes) to the web site. In a second example, a session is established via a SMTP protocol. Within the SMTP protocol, an EXPN command allows access to mailing list information. The proxy may restrict the EXPN command from being transferred between the two networks based upon predetermined rules which are stored within the proxy. Alternatively, the proxy may interpret the SMTP stream of commands to disallow email from a particular sender to be accepted for a particular recipient. Some examples may help clarify possible uses of the invention. In a first example, a session is established originating from a client computer on net 30 via the proxy to a FTP site on the internet. FTP allows transfer in a text mode and in a binary",
