Following the cooling, apply between 0.010\"-0.015\" of clear vinyl plastisol (Formula 2) with a rigid knife coater. Finally fuse the clear layers and foam the foamable plastisol by exposure in a hot air oven at an average of 400\ufffd F. for 4 minutes. Upon cooling one will produce a product with the desired effects. Following cooling, print a 5 mil thickness of screen printing plastisol inks containing pearlescent colorations (Formula E) using a rotary screen printer. If multiple screens are used, gel the printed plastisol ink by exposure in a hot air oven at 350\ufffd F. for 30 seconds. Cool to room temperature before the next plastisol ink application. Using a rigid knife coater, apply between 0.010\"-0.015\" of clear layer plastisol (Formula 2). Gel the clear plastisol by exposure in a hot air oven at an equivalent of 350\ufffd F. for one minute. Cool to room temperature. To a web of asbestos flooring felt, 0.030\" thick apply a uniform layer of foamable plastisol (Formula 1), 0.015\" thick, using a rigid knife coater. Gel the coating by exposure in a hot air oven at an equivalent of 325\ufffd F. for one minute and cool to room temperature. Using a rotary screen",
