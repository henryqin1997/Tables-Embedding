The entire disclosures of all references, applications, patents, and publications cited above, are hereby incorporated by reference. Various configurations of the muscles of the invention may be used in medical applications involving incontinence. In these systems, a patient can activate the muscles by means of a push-button switch, or the like, to prevent leakage and control discharge by pressing tie switch, which is preferably battery operated. Incontinence Assist Devices EXAMPLE 20 Soft parts orientors or feeders for delicate handling of parts in a manufacturing assembly line can be made from flaps made out of the membrane of the invention. Parts Orientation/Feeding EXAMPLE 19 Snake-like locomotion can be accomplished by arranging proper segments of the membrane of the invention in series and controlling each segment's bending by applying sequential input power to each segment in a cascade mode. Slithering Device EXAMPLE 18 Linear actuators can be made to produce a variety of robotic manipulators including platform type or parallel platform actuators.
