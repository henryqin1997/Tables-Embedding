The output, D11-D0, of the up-counter 38 in binary notation is 0000, 0100, 1000. As stated before, only bits D7-D2 are fed into the exclusive OR gates. In this case, binary bits 010010 will be fed, respectively, to the inputs 41-1 through 44-6 of the exclusive OR gates. Since the two least significant bits of the output from the up-counter 38 have been excluded from the comparison, the output of the up-counter 38 will compare favorably to samples stored in the shift registers which are in the range between 72 and 75 beats per minute. This is due to the fact that the bits D7 through D2 for each of those numbers are the same as bits D7 through D2 for the number 72. A specific comparison range, obtained by excluding the two least significant bits, has been described. It is to be understood that the comparison range as well as the percentage difference between the numbers within the range may be increased by excluding a greater number of least significant bits. Further, the comparison range and the percentage difference may be narrowed by not excluding any least significant bits so that the percentage difference between samples is reduced to zero.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings, and it is contemplated that the subject invention may be implemented through the use of discrete components or an integrated circuit chip. It is further comtemplated that an integrated circuit chip having complimentary-metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) circuits may be used to configure the present invention, and that a remote sensor may be contained in a housing separate from that containing the remainder of the device. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise and as specifically described. The cardiotachometer of the subject invention being mounted in a wrist watch is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. In this embodiment the cardiotachometer circuitry is mounted in a watch housing 210 which is secured to the wrist of the user by straps 212. The sensor, which is a piezoelectric transducer 214, is secured to the back of the housing 210 and detects systoles through the wrist of the user. A push button switch 216 is provided to select the function (heart rate, time of day, or elapsed time) to be displayed on the display 76. With reference to FIG. 6, a hand-held version of the unified, self-contained cardiotachometer with digital readout is generally designated as 200. The device comprises a unitized housing 202 shaped for convenient placement within the palm of",
