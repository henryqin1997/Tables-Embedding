    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93335=The predetermined frequency of modulation of heating beam 19 is selected to be sufficiently small to cause a majority of the heat to transfer by diffusion from region ii. Under such diffusive heat transfer conditions, the temperature of traces 11A-11N is approximately equal to (e.g., within 90% of) the temperature of these same traces 11A-11N when heated by an unmodulated beam (i.e., a beam having constant power, equal to the instantaneous power of the modulated beam). For example, the modulation can be sinusoidal between 0 and 50 milliwatts, i.e., P=50 sin (2 \u03c0 ft), where f is the modulation frequency. In such an example, at the time when the modulated power has an instantaneous value of 25 mW, the temperature under heating beam 19 approximately equals (e.g., is no less than 90% of) the temperature obtained with a heating beam having constant power, e.g., 25 mW. In one example, heating beam 19 has a wavelength of 0.83 microns, has an average power of 10 milliwatts, a diameter of 2 microns and is modulated at 2000 Hertz., 89355=Instead of the just-described nonpolarized probe beam 12, a circularly or elliptically polarized probe beam can also be used as described herein for a nonpolarized beam (except that separate calibration is required for an elliptically polarized beam; specifically, in the case of elliptically polarized light, the intensities in the two directions are different: for example, if the ratio of intensity in the two directions is 2:1 (parallel:perpendicular), then the parallel signal will be twice as strong for the same reflectivity, and reflection in the parallel direction must be divided by 2 to compare to the reflection in the perpendicular direction)., 149709=Moreover, voids in a via chain may also be detected as discussed in the related U.S. patent application No. ______ , Attorney Docket No. M-12169 U.S., entitled \u201c1 IDENTIFYING DEFECTS IN VIAS OF A WAFER, BASED ON HEAT TRANSFER THERETHROUGH\u201d filed concurrently herewith, by Peter G.

The increased signal magnitude for these curves 1701-1703 suggests a smaller cross-sectional copper area, thus higher resistance. These curves 1701-1703 also indicate non-uniformity across the array, or variation in cross-sectional copper area from trench to trench. Cross-section FIB-SEMs 1711-1713 reveal voids and/or patterning defects in the areas measured on these samples, both of which account for higher and non-uniform line resistance., 55671=An article at the website http://www.micromagazine.com/archive/00/01/prods.html published in January 2000 describes a \u201cWafer Inspection System\u201d available from Schlumberger of San Jose, Calif., as follows \u201cThe Odyssey 3000 uses an E-beam-based voltage-contrast technology to identify yield-killing electrical defects that are difficult to detect using optical systems. Designed for use in sub-0.15-\u03bcm processes, the system detects electrical, submicron particle, and pattern defects. Metal stringers, poly gate shorts, and copper damascene voids are also detectable. Real-time off-line defect review with simultaneous inspection eliminates the need to buy off-line inspection tools. The system accommodates 300-mm wafers and features an advanced graphical user interface to simplify recipe setup. Die-to-die comparisons also enable users to carry out rapid defect review.\u201d}",
