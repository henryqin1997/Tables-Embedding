    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{88491=The read cache valid signals on line 904 are supplied to multiplexer 952. The multiplexer 952 is controlled by logical address bits 2:3 on line 953. Four bits of byte valid data are supplied on line 954 out of the multiplexer 952 into logic 955. Other inputs to logic 955 includes logical address bits 0:1 on line 956 and the LOPT (0:2) signal on line 957. The output of the logic 955 is the read cache valid signal on line 958. The read cache valid signal on line 958 and the read cache tag match on line 951 are supplied as inputs to AND gate 959. A read cache hit signal is supplied on line 960 if both signals are true. Logic 955 compares the byte validity with the access size and address (1:0) to determine if all the bytes actually being accessed are valid. For a 32 bit read, all 4 byte validity signals must be active. For 16 bits, the two upper or lower byte validity bits must be active. For a byte read only, the correct byte validity bit must be active., 88015=The RC tag module outputs, RC VALID (0:15) on line 904 and RC TAG (0:16) on line 903, are input to the RC TAG/VALID CHECK module of FIG. 12 for comparison against the location addressed by the current 29K cycle. The read cache tag on line 903 is supplied to a comparator 950. The second input to the comparator is the logical address bits 7:23 on line 910. If the tag matches the logical address, then a read cache tag match signal is asserted on line 951., 54017=Receive and transmit events are signalled to processor 15 by the network interface devices according to any one of a plurality of interrupt or event signalling techniques. In the preferred system, such technique is implemented as described in our co-pending U.S. patent application entitled A SYSTEM FOR SERVICING I/O EVENTS, invented by Isfeld, Ser. No. 07/982,876, filed Nov. 30, 1992, which was owned at the time of invention and is currently owned by the same Assignee as the present application, and which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The processor 15 accesses the core memory 14 only as necessary to retrieve control information from control fields in the packets of I/O data or from control structures in the memory 14 which are assigned to the given network interface device. Using the resources that are isolated from the core memory in the data memory 116 and instruction memory 118, the processor performs the internetworking routines, and updates the control fields or control structures in the core memory 14 as necessary to direct the flow of I/O data packets among the networks.}",

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the following claims and their equivalents. This architecture allows the processor to be optimized to make decisions based on a local database of information, without concerning itself with moving any data. All data movements are done by the core memory controller and network interface device interfaces. The main processor is kept busy, without interference with its operation by the I/O stream of data using the core memory which stores only data needed by the network interface devices. This way, the main processor need only use this memory when a packet has to be inspected. Local routing tables, other housekeeping data, driver software, and the like is kept in a memory within the processor subsystem isolated from the core memory. Further enhancements are provided to the processor to",
