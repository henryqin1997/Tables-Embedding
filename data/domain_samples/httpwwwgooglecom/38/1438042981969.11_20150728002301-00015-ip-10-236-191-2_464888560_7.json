No. 07/917,643 by Klassen, filed Jul. 23, 1992, reduces ink coverage in business graphics including heavily saturated regions of continuous tone images (see also, Klassen, \"Reducing Ink Coverage Levels in Binary CMYK Images\", Proc. Soc. Imaging Science and Technology, 46th Annual Conference (May, 1993), pp. 173-175), it leaves all but the boldest text and line art unchanged, except where they are on a colored background of sufficient density. Thus, areas of text with heavy ink coverage, for example the secondary colors formed by combining the primary colorants cyan, magenta yellow and black, which are commonly used to generate red, green or blue text, are observed to bloom significantly compared to black. Because these colors are the three most popular text colors after black, a method to reduce blooming in these colors in text areas is desirable.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment. Modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding this specification. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations are included insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or equivalents thereof. Other printing processes which are printed on a pixel by pixel basis also have problems with excessive marking material, and may benefit from the described method of reduced marking material use. Notably, electrophotographic and ionographic printing methods using a pixel by pixel printing process for forming a latent image for development with dry or liquid toner marking materials, can suffer from excessive marking material, evidenced by sheet cockling and curling caused by differential shrinkage of toner and paper in the printing process. While the present invention is demonstrated with the above embodiment, there is no doubt many others accomplish the invention. The important aspects of the invention are that highly saturated text printing which might cause bleeding into adjacent areas, can be identified, an ON/OFF ratio can be determined and applied to the pixels in the separations of the image to reduce ink coverage. Preferably, the determination is made in a manner that minimizes moire, and preferably, makes the determination of OFF or ON in any single separation with knowledge about the state of the corresponding pixels in other separations. The present description assumes a binary or",
