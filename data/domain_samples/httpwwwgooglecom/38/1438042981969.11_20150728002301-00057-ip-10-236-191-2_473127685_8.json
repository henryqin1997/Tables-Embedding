Of the various chemical fixatives available, glutaraldehyde has been the most widely used since the discovery of its antiimmunological and antidegenerative effects by Dr. Carpentier in 1968. See Carpentier, A., J. Thorac. Cardiovascular Surgery, 58: 467-69 (1969). In addition, glutaraldehyde is one of the most efficient sterilization agents. Glutaraldehyde is used as the fixative and the sterilant for many commercially available bioprosthetic products, such as porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (e.g., the Carpentier-Edwards\ufffd stented porcine Bioprosthesis), bovine pericardial heart valves (e.g., Carpentier-Edwards\ufffd Pericardial Bioprosthesis) and stentless porcine aortic valves (e.g., Edwards PRIMA Plus\ufffd Stentless Aortic Bioprosthesis), all manufactured and sold by Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, Calif.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various alternatives, modifications, and equivalents may be used. Moreover, it will be obvious that certain other modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. In some cases, glutaraldehyde that has been heat-treated in accordance with this invention may be used as the terminal solution and, in such cases, it may be possible to shorten or completely eliminate the previous step of immersing the tissue in previously heat-treated glutaraldehyde, opting instead to accomplish some or all of the treatment of the tissue by heat-treated glutaraldehyde until the last step of storage, i.e., concurrently with the terminal sterilization step. In another embodiment, the terminal heating is carried out before placing the tissue or bioprosthesis in the storage container. In order to avoid additional transfer and manipulation, the terminal heating is preferably carried out in the sealed storage container or package in which the bioprosthesis will be shipped and stored until the time of implantation. The tissue (or bioprosthesis) is aseptically deposited in the storage container that has been pre-filled with the 0.625% glutaraldehyde aqueous solution buffered to a pH of 7.4 with sodium hydroxide, such that the tissue (or bioprosthesis) is fully immersed in the buffered glutaraldehyde solution. Thereafter, the container is sealed and placed at room temperature for at least 7 days, or in an oven",
