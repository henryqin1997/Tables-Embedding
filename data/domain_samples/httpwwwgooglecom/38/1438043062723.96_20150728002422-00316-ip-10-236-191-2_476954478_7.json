The name is a token for identifying the cookie, e.g. \u201cCustomer\u201d, and the value is the value of that corresponding token, e.g. \u201cJane Doe\u201d., 32929=Additionally, a number of optional fields can be set, for example: a different domain for which the cookie is valid (Domain); a time to live (Max-Age); a version string (Version); etc. The phrases in parenthesis correspond to the RFC 2109 standard field names for the options., 44282=Next, at step 402, an IM user is selected from the caller's buddy list (as maintained on the voice portal 310 or on the IM server 308) or by direct entry of the username(s). According to some embodiments, the IM user name may be entered using a voice keyboard technique as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/655,277 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Voice Keyboard\u201d filed 5 Sep. 2000, and assigned to the assignee of the present application. The user may be able to query for a list of available users from the buddy list with a spoken command or the name of a buddy e.g. \u201cWho's online\u201d, \u201cBuddy1\u201d, etc., 38535=Additional information regarding voice portal 310 and various components interfacing with voice portal 310 are discussed in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/426,102, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Electronic Commerce Using a Telephone Interface\u201d, filed on 22 Oct. 1999, which is incorporated by reference herein., 32084=The term cookie, as used herein, refers to a structured data element formatted according to the general principles of IETF RFC 2109 and/or some other state management standard., 32532=Implicitly, each cookie is associated with a sending domain on the World Wide Web. According to RFC 2109, the implicitly set domain is the originating domain to which an HTTP request was sent. For example, if an HTTP GET request is sent to the request host \u201cwww.example.com\u201d, then the cookie set in response to that request would be implicitly associated with \u201cwww.example.com\u201d, 20364=Instant Messaging services such as the popular ICQ(\u2122) and AOL INSTANT MESSANGER(\u2122), also referred to as AIM, both operated by America Online, Inc., Dulles, Va. (AOL), have risen in popularity in the last few years and shown explosive growth. Older protocols and services such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), see RFC 1459, and the even older talk program (primarily found on UNIX(\u2122)-type computers) have quickly been eclipsed. Competitors to AOL such as Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., and Yahoo!, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., have introduced competing instant messenger products that operate in a similar overall fashion to AIM which shall be used as a reference herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of various embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and equivalent arrangements will be apparent. Some embodiments of the invention are included in an electromagnetic wave form. The electromagnetic waveform comprises information such as call manager programs, execution engine programs, data connectivity engine programs, evaluation engine programs, streaming subsystem programs, recognition server programs, text to speech programs and/or phone based IM functionality. The electromagnetic waveform may include the programs accessed over a network. In some embodiments, voice portal 310 can be hardware based, software based, or a combination of the two. In some embodiments, voice portal 310 and/or the IM functionality are comprised of one or more computer programs that are included in one or more computer usable media such as CD-ROMs, floppy disks, or other media. In some embodiments, call manager programs, execution engine programs, data connectivity engine programs, evaluation engine programs, streaming subsystem programs, recognition server programs, text to speech programs, and/or phone based IM functionality are included in one or more computer usable media. F. Conclusion In these configurations, it is possible that step 506 (for example) and other user input steps might also support receipt of the data as entered and submitted from the phone (e.g. if the phone supports data input).
