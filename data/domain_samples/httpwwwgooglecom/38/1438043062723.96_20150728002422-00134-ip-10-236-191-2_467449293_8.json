No. 09/503,858, entitled \u201cDodecahedron Neutron Spectrometer,\u201d which was filed on Feb. 14, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,349,124, by the inventors herein. This divisional application is being filed under 35 USC \ufffd120 and 37 CFR \ufffd 1.53, and priority from that application is hereby claimed., 32158=The data processing means 17 and its means for proton distribution provides a hitherto unavailable capability to determine a proton distribution pattern to construct a neutron spectrum indicating the spectrum of neutrons from an unknown source of neutrons 13. In operation, results of a spectral measurement are a set of pairs from the detector means 10 and the absorbing layer 11 that allows protons with energies and corresponding ranges greater than the absorbing layer 11's thickness to reach the detector means 10 and produce proton recoil counts. One data processing means 17 successfully employed by the present inventors is a 3-dimensional Monte Carlo Adjoint Transport code, NOVICE, which is described in Jordan, T., \u201cNovice, A Radiation Transport and Shielding Code\u201d, Experimental and Mathematical Physics Consultant, Report EMP. L 82.001, January 1982., 20964=There has been a long-standing need to characterize neutron spectra so that physicists and equipment designers can better predict aircraft upset rates and design systems to avoid catastrophic aircraft failures. The general operating principle for neutron spectrometers is that neutrons interact with certain atoms to produce recoil protons that travel in relatively straight lines, as described in Kronenberg, S. and H. Murphy, \u201cEnergy Spectrum of Protons Emitted From a Fast-Neutron-Irradiated Hydrogenous Material\u201d, Radiation Research 12, 728-735 1960., 21538=Several types of detectors that have been used in prior art neutron spectrometers of this type to measure the recoil protons. One of the earliest applications described in Kronenberg, S., \u201cFast Neutron Spectroscope for Measurements in a High Intensity Time Dependent Neutron Environment\u201d, International Symposium on Nuclear Electronics\u201d, Paris France, Comptes Rendus, May 1964. That device utilized a scintillation counter, consisting of cesium iodide and a photomultiplier and solid state devices. A variation of that approach employing a PMOS transistor was described in Kronenberg, S. and G. J. Brucker, \u201cThe Use of Hydrogenous Material for Sensitizing PMOS Dosimeters to Neutrons\u201d, IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., Vol. 42, No. 1, February 1995.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that details concerning materials, shapes and dimensions are merely illustrative, and that other combinations of materials, shapes and dimensions can also be advantageously employed and are considered to be within the contemplation of the present invention. We also wish it to be understood that we do not desire to be limited to the exact details of construction shown and described. It will be apparent that various structural modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. In the flat configuration, said chamber 71 is shown in a rectangular shape, and its walls 78, lid, not shown, and unit compartments 79 can be composed of tantalum. Each detector means 10 in the egg-crate-like structure is numbered 1\u2032-12\u2032, respectively, to correspond with readings shown in the FIG. 2 chart. Detector means 7\u2032 is depicted with representative dimensions of 2 cm in width and 2 cm in length. A gap 80 between detector means 11\u2032 and 12\u2032 is 0.471 cm. The thickness of each wall 78 is 1 cm and its height is about 3 cm. The chamber 71 is depicted as 15 cm in length and 5.41 cm in width. These dimensions are merely representative and numerous other choices of dimensions are possible, however, it is critical that each absorber layer is constructed with a different thickness according to the minimum and maximum",
