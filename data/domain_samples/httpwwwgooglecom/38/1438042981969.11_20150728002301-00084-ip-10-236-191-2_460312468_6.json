In tests under both cold weather and warm weather operating conditions a reduction in emissions was achieved. The most significant reduction in emissions was in relation to NOx. NOx was reduced by lowering the exhaust temperature. Hydrocarbon content, CO2, and CO were reduced by rapidly warming up the engine. Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, during testing it was determined that in some models of automobile the backpressure during operation was such that it was advisable to have a second valve member 324 downstream of valve member 124. Second valve member 324 served to further isolate heat exchange coil 118. Referring to FIG. 6, in the heat bypass mode valve member 124 and second valve member 324 are positioned so that all flow passes along bypass fluid flow passage 112. Second valve member 324 prevents any portion of the downstream flow from entering heat exchange passage 110. Referring to FIG. 7, in the heat exchange mode valve member 124 and second valve member 324 are positioned so that all flow passes along heat exchange passage 110. The use and operation of heat exchanger 100 will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3 through 5. Heat exchanger 100 is designed to",
