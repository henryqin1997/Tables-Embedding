    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{160872=FIG. 23 is a diagram of the client functions of the similarity search engine computer system in a networked client-server computer configuration. The client query, user administration, data base import and schema creation functions exist within the client. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 5, the client may exist on a single computer server or may be spread across multiple computer platforms. Likewise, the client may exist in a standalone configuration as shown in FIG. 6. The client contains a connection manager 290. The connection manager 290 manages the interface to the similarity search engine server. In the networked client-server computer configuration shown in FIG. 20, the connection manager 290 maintains a logical connection to the network or gateway 291. If the hierarchical database language XML is used, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 5, the connection manager sends XML request and receives XML responses, maintains the current user state information, maintains a connection with the network and authenticates all calls to the client. The data type manager 292 acts as a repository for data type information. It retrieves stored data types and saves data types to disk and maintains a list of all available data types. It allows the user to print data types. The schema manager 293 allows the user to build and save schemas and to load existing schemas stored on disk. The document manager 294 acts as a central point for saving and retrieving documents. It is connected to an import facility function 297 which allows the documents to be imported from an existing relational database 304 using an import map 303 and a scripting engine 302. The scripting engine 302 processes scripts that allow for the cleanup of the database by transforming the text and fields of the data. For example, the database may have the text entry November, and for ease of searching, it may be desirable to convert the month to its number designation 11. The scripting engine can process any type of script to cleanup database data. The query manager 295 acts as the central point for issuing queries to the similarity search engine server. It generates the commands necessary to issue a similarity and document compare query. The scoring method manager 299 allows the user to choose scoring methods, and build and save scoring methods when creating a schema. The score-summing manager 300 allows parent score computing (score summing) results to be saved within the client function. These results may also be saved in the similarity search engine server. The tokenizer manager 301 provides a central point of reference for tokenizers within the system that break the text down into their semantically relevant parts.}",
