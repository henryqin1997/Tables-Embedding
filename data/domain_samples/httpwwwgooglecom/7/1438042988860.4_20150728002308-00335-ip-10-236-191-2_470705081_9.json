    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75931=While it is possible to perform the anastomosis procedure using a commercially-available thoracoscope for video-based visualization, it is presently preferred to utilize a scope or cannula optically coupled to a surgical microscope to provide direct, stereoscopic visualization of the chest cavity. Such systems are described in copending applications Ser. No. 08/135,387, filed Oct. 8, 1993, and Ser. No. 08/227,366, filed Apr. 13, 1994, which have been incorporated herein by reference. As described in those applications, an endoscope or other optical cannula is positioned so that a distal end of the optical cannula is disposed percutaneously in the left anterior chest, usually in the third, fourth, or fifth intercostal space. A surgical microscope is then positioned over the optical cannula (and, in some embodiments, coupled to the optical cannula) so as to allow visualization of the chest cavity through the optical cannula and microscope. It has been found that the direct vision, high image quality, and depth perception provided by such systems offer significant advantages over video-based thoracoscopic vision in performing the highly-precise microsurgery entailed in performing coronary anastomosis. Direct visualization of the anastomosis site may also be accomplished by looking through an incision between the fibs retracted open using suitable instruments. A device such as that disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/6593/02888, filed Mar. 25, 1993, may also be used., 59217=While various types of endoscopic surgical instruments may be utilized to isolate, dissect, and clip the IMA, and to attach the IMA to a coronary artery, it is presently preferred to use instruments that are specifically adapted for the highly-precise, thoracoscopic microsurgery which the method of the invention requires. Such instruments must be dimensioned to pass through trocar sheaths positioned within intercostal spaces in the rib cage and to reach the IMA and the heart from outside the chest cavity. In addition, the instruments should have very precise actuators subject to easy and controllable actuation, and end-effectors specifically adapted for IMA isolation, dissection, clipping, and attachment of the IMA to a coronary artery. Thoracoscopic microsurgical instruments specifically designed for carrying out the method of the invention are described in copending application Ser. No. 08/194,946, filed Feb. 11, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,698, the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 69775=In a preferred embodiment, the cardioplegic fluid consists of an aqueous KCl solution mixed with oxygenated blood at a ratio of four parts blood to one part KCl solution. The aqueous KCl solution consists of crystalloid KCl mixed with saline to have a concentration in the range of 10-50 mEq K+ /liter, preferably 15-30 mEq K+ /liter. A cooler such as an ice bath (not shown) is used to cool the cardioplegic fluid to e.g. 3\ufffd C.-10\ufffd C., so as to maintain the heart at a low temperature and to minimize demand for oxygen. This is usually accomplished without applying external cooling to the heart as is generally applied in conventional open cardiac procedures. The cardioplegic fluid is infused into the ascending aorta through an opening at the distal end of occlusion catheter 50 to maintain a pressure in the aortic root distal to the occlusion balloon sufficient to induce flow of fluid into the coronary arteries through the coronary ostia. A pressure of about 60-80 mmHg as measured through a pressure lumen in catheter 50 is usually sufficient. Cardioplegic fluid is preferably delivered at a flowrate of about 250-350 ml/min. so as to deliver a total volume of 750-1000 ml in about 2-4 minutes, although this may vary depending upon patient anatomy, physiological changes such as coronary dilation, and other factors. In pumping the cardioplegic fluid through the lumen in catheter 50, the fluid should be subject to a pump pressure of no more than about 300 mmHg to minimize damage to the blood component of the mixture. Cardioplegic fluid may also be infused in a retrograde manner through the coronary sinus, by means of a catheter (not shown) positioned transluminally through the right internal jugular vein, as described above. Heart contractions will then cease, with circulation to the remainder of the patient's body maintained by the CPB system. Cardioplegic fluid flow to the patient's myocardium is maintained on a periodic basis, e.g., about every 10-20 minutes for 2-4 minutes, so long as the myocardium is to remain paralyzed. A comprehensive description of cardioplegic techniques suitable for use in the method of the invention is found in Buckberg, Strategies and logic of cardioplegic delivery to prevent, avoid, and reverse ischemic and reperfusion damage, J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1987;93:127-39., 66118=In some cases, the patient's vascular system may be partitioned using an external clamp located on the ascending aorta between the brachiocephalic artery and the coronary ostia. The external clamp would be similar to those employed in open surgical procedures, except that it would be suitable for placement through a trocar sheath under thoracoscopic guidance. Such a thoracoscopic cross-clamp is described in copending application Ser. No. 08/173,899, filed Dec. 27, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,705, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Use of an external clamp, however, is generally less preferred since it risks trauma to the aorta, release of emboli from the diseased aortic lumen, and the like., 79138=The internal mammary artery IMA can be joined to the extended incision 97 in the coronary artery LAD by a variety of conventional techniques, including suturing, laser welding, microstapling, and the like. It will be preferred to use conventional suturing techniques as illustrated in FIGS. 9-13. A length of suture 98 has needles 100 at either end, which are manipulated using forceps 102 to join the free upstream end 101 of the internal mammary artery IMA graft to the opening created by the incision 97 in the coronary artery LAD. The instrument designs presently preferred for performing the coronary anastomosis are described in copending application Ser. No. 08/194,946, filed Feb. 11, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,698, the disclosure of which has been incorporated herein by reference., 31734=Conventional thoracoscopic techniques are described in Landreneau et al. (1992) Ann. Thorac. Surg. 54: 800-807. Conventional open surgical procedures for performing coronary artery bypass grafting are described in Kirk/in and Barratt Boyes, Cardiac Surgery, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York, 1993 (2nd Ed.). Copending applications Ser. No. 07/730,559, filed Jul. 16, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,685, and Ser. No. 07/991,188, filed Dec. 15, 1992, which are assigned to the assignee of the present application, describe catheters that are insertable into a patient's arterial system and include a distal balloon which can be expanded to occlude the ascending aorta. The coronary ostia, the heart, and the proximal ascending aorta may thus be isolated from the remainder of the arterial system while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass. Such catheters are particularly intended to be used in heart valve replacement procedures., 57411=After the internal mammary artery IMA is freed from the thoracic wall, the electrosurgical tool 30 will be replaced with a clip applier 36, with the thoracoscope 34 being moved to trocar sheath 14 and the graspers 32 being moved to trocar sheath 10. The clip applier 36 (FIG. 4) is then used to place one clip 40 upstream and a second clip 42 downstream of a region of the internal mammary artery IMA to be transected, as illustrated in FIG. 5. Upstream clip 40 will be a temporary occlusion device (e.g., a Fogarty clip, Baxter Corp.) which is later removed from the internal mammary artery IMA to establish bypass flow. A removable clip and applicator particularly well-adapted for this procedure are described in copending application Ser. No. 08/265,477, filed Jun. 24, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,274 the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Downstream clip 42 will be permanently left in place. After the clips 40 and 42 are applied, a cutting tool 44 can be introduced through the same trocar sheath 12 which had received the clip applying tool, and the cutting tool used to cut the artery in a conventional manner. Note that it will be desirable to cut the artery along a diagonal transverse line in order to provide an oval-shaped distal end, as best seen in FIGS. 7 and 9. If necessary, the original cut can be further trimmed to provide a free upstream end suitable for connection to the narrowed coronary artery at a location distal to the narrowed segment. Usually, excess fat will be dissected from the distal 1-2 cm of the severed artery. The dissection can be carded out either within or outside of the thorax, with outside procedures performed by drawing the upstream free end of the artery out through a trocar sheath temporarily., 62310=The aortic occlusion catheter 50 is preferably endovascularly introduced over a conventional guidewire to the ascending aorta through the left femoral artery 66 which is entered either percutaneously or through an open cut down 67 of the groin. A proximal hub 68 is located on the proximal end of the occlusion catheter 50 and includes a balloon inflation means, such as syringe 70, and a main access port 72 to permit the introduction of instruments, irrigation fluid, and the like. Optionally, a third introduction port 74 may be provided to receive blood and other fluids vented from the aortic root through catheter 50 and deliver the withdrawn blood to the CPB system (after filtering). Alternatively, blood and other fluids may be vented through main access port 72, with third access port 74 communicating with a separate lumen in catheter 50 having an opening distal to the occlusion balloon for measuring pressure in the aortic root. The provision of access ports in the aortic occlusion catheter 50 is optional. It is necessary only that the catheter 50 be able to position a blocking element, such as the inflatable balloon, at the proper location within the ascending aorta. One or more access ports and lumens, however, may be an advantage in a variety of circumstances. For example, the catheter 50 with an access lumen would permit anterograde administration of cardioplegic fluid and would also permit anterograde venting of the left ventricle. Such a lumen could also provide access by acting as an anchored guiding catheter for a variety of other conventional diagnostic and interventional catheters, such as angiography, angioplasty, atherectomy, and similar vascular catheters. Suitable aortic occlusion catheters having such access ports and lumens are described in detail in copending application Ser. No. 07/991,188, filed on Dec. 15, 1992, application Ser. No. 08/123,411, filed Sep. 17, 1993, application Ser. No. 08/159,815, filed Nov. 30, 1993, application Ser. No. 08/162,742, filed Dec. 3, 1993, and copending application Ser. No. 08/282,192, filed Jul. 28, 1994, the full disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 49489=The methods of the present invention are suitable for performing a variety of surgical cardiac procedures where the heart will be stopped and the patient supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedures will be minimally invasive and be performed using surgical instruments introduced through a plurality of trocar sheaths placed through the patient's chest. A viewing scope, such as a thoracoscope, will be placed through at least one of the trocar sheaths, and selected surgical instruments will be placed through others of the trocar sheaths and their manipulation viewed by the treating physician using the viewing scope. The term \"viewing scope\" as used herein is intended to encompass conventional endoscopes, laparoscopes, thoracoscopes, and other video-based visualization devices, as well as other types of devices that facilitate direct or indirect visualization of a body cavity through a small percutaneous penetration. Microscope-based and other types of direct visualization systems which are particularly well-suited for use in the method of the present invention are disclosed in copending applications Ser. No. 08/135,387, filed Oct. 8, 1993, now abandoned, and Ser. No. 08/227,366, filed Apr. 13, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,588,949 the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 28213=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/023,778, filed Feb. 22, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,452,733, the complete disclosure of this related U.S. patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example, for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. To reverse cardioplegic arrest the body is rewarmed and the balloon 227 deflated. Aortic blood is thus allowed to perfuse the heart. Whilst the body remains supported by peripheral cardiopulmonary by-pass, the return of the heart rhythm is awaited. External defibrillation may be necessary. Weaning from by-pass is then completed in a routine fashion. The heart may then be operated on or examined by insertion of instrumentation 237 such as a cardioscope or a laser into the heart through the lumen 234 or through thoracic or atrial trocars. Alternatively, with the heart on by-pass as described above the heart can be approached by an open method by an incision other than median sternotomy. In use the catheter 212 is introduced percutaneously by puncture or cutdown as has been described and once blood flow through the by-pass is established (including systemic cooling) flows are reduced and the balloon 225 is inflated. Flows are then returned to the operating levels and a suitable cardioplegic agent is introduced into the aortic root. Once the full volume of cardioplegic agent has been given and cardiac arrest achieved, the lumen is then used to vent the heart. Venting of the",
