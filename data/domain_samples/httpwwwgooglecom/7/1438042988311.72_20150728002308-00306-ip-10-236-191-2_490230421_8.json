A National Research Council report reviews soil's role in the hydrologic cycle (National Research Council. 1993. Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for Agriculture. National Academy Press. Washington, D.C.). Rainfall in terrestrial ecosystems falls on the soil surface where it either infiltrates the soil or moves across the soil surface into streams or lakes. The condition of the soil surface determines whether rainfall infiltrates or runs off. If it infiltrates the soil, it may be stored and later taken up by plants, move into ground waters, or move laterally through the earth, appearing later in springs or seeps. This partitioning of rainfall between infiltration and run-off determines whether a storm results in a replenishing rain or a damaging flood. The movement of water through soils to streams, lakes, and ground water is an essential component of recharge and base flow in the hydrological cycle (Stephens, D.B. 1995. Vadose Zone Hydrology . Lewis Publications, Boca Raton, Fla. 347 pp.)., 48986=From a soil science perspective, grazing and cropping practices have often reduced soil water storage capacity and increased run-off. A common result has been lowering of local water tables with permanent stream reaches becoming intermittent. From a hydrological perspective (e.g., Menzel, B.W. 1983. Agricultural management practices and the integrity of instream biological habitat. pp. 305-329, in Agricultural Management and Water Quality, F. W. Schaller and G.W. Bailey, eds. Iowa State University Press. Ames, Iowa), these same agricultural practices lead to an exaggerated seasonal flow regime and increase the frequency, severity, and unpredictability of high-volume flows., 50386=Surface water have been diverted and infiltrated for thousands of years in various parts of the world (Bruins, J. J., M. Evenari, and U. Nessler. 1986. Rainwater-harvesting agriculture for food production in arid zones: the challenge of the African famine. Appl. Geography. 6:13-32). Wills (1988) summarizes much of the literature on prehistoric southwestern U.S. agriculture and water harvesting (Wills, W. H. 1988. Early prehistoric agriculture in the American southwest. 188 pp. School of American Research Press, Santa Fe, N.Mex.). The primary objective of water harvesting is short-term water storage in the soil profile for crop growth. In the southwest, Native American farmers place fields to optimize water and sediment trapping These relationships among soil, vegetation, and erosion/deposition are discussed by Jenny (Jenny, H. 1980. The Soil Resource. Springer-Verlag, New York). Soils derived from aeolian deposits, alluvium and colluvium are generally considered unsuitable for agriculture because of their high infiltration rates (Tabor, J. A. 1995. Improving crop yields in the Sahel by means of water-harvesting. J. of Arid Environments. 30:83-106)., 68865=TOUGH-2, a multiphase, multidimensional flow and transport code (Pruess, 1991. TOUGH-2: A general purpose numerical simulator for multiphase fluid and heat flow. LBL-29400, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, Calif.) was used to model trench infiltration across a range of soil types and hydraulic heads. Output from this model was used as input for a spreadsheet application to model the infiltration gallery/siphon system 10., 46467=Root systems can increase soil saturated hydraulic conductivity over an order of magnitude (Prieksat, M. A., T. C. Kaspar, and M. D. Ankeny. 1994. Positional and temporal changes in ponded infiltration in a corn field. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 58:181 -184). Increased root biomass results in more root channels as well as an associated increase in faunal activity creating wormholes and other channels. These preferential flow paths increase saturated hydraulic conductivity. In arid and semi-arid systems, plant growth is usually limited by water availability. Because plants maintain fairly constant root:shoot ratios, root mass and soil hydraulic conductivity are often directly correlated with water availability.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Regardless of the initially high permeability of alluvial fan material, the ultimate limitation in design performance will probably be reduced permeability of the system due to silt and clay accumulation (playa end member). A system that self-flushes both salt and sediment and has a designed-in silt aggregation technology is a good candidate for a low cost and low maintainence artificial recharge system. Vegetation over the infiltration galleries can be used to improve infiltration rates of this system. Plant root systems often increase soil saturated hydraulic conductivities one or two orders of magnitude. Reduced carbon released by roots results in soil aggregation. Soil aggregation processes maintain high infiltration rates in grasslands and can be used to combat the natural tendency of pressurized particulate-containing water to plug infiltration systems. In addition, maintenance activities are effectively redefined as farming activities and a profit can be turned off the unavoidable maintenance and evapotranspiration. When the siphon cycles, water velocity in the drainage pipe increases, silt in the overlying gravel is back flushed, and water in the drainage pipe reaches entrainment velocity for silt and clay deposited during the infiltration phase of the cycle. This process is analogous to well development. Thus, a siphon can take a linear input of water, sediment, and potential energy and turn it into a nonlinear system that retains a large fraction of the water and potential energy while discharging the sediment and part of the",
