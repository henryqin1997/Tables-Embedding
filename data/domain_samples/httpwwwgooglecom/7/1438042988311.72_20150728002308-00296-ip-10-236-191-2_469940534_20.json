See F. Modigliani and M. H. Miller, \u201cThe Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment\u201d, American Economic Review, 48:261-297 (June 1958), or R. A. Brealey and S. C. Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance, 5th Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996)., 32400=[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/414,735 filed Sep. 30, 2002., 266749=[0265] The STARZ strategy has two elements of dilution. The underlying CARZ dilutes by zero shares if not converted, by 12.3 shares (=$1111/[112.5%\ufffd$80]) if converted without intervening interest adjustment, and by 4.1 shares (=$1111/[3\ufffd112.5%\ufffd$80]) if converted after interest adjustment. The variable share repurchase contract reduces the dilution by up to 2.9 shares (=$l 111\ufffd2.6/$1000) when the share price in year 5 is greater than the conversion price on the CARZ., 241769=[0239] Underlying each $100 principal (of the underlying CARZ) are shares worth, in this example, $88.89 (=$100/(1+12.5% Conversion Premium)). For the most part, the investor receives dividends on these shares and also participates in the appreciation of these shares, just like common shares. However, some adjustments are necessary. For the first 5 years, for example, the investor receives no dividends and thereafter receives dividends only if the value of the shares exceeds a threshold. Also, the investor may have to deliver some shares (e.g., at year 5) because of the variable share repurchase contract. The value to the investor must be adjusted downward by, for example, $16.67 for these effects. This is compensated for by the investor's put option, or equivalently the interest adjustment, which is worth, in this example, $19.29. The investor is also short the issuer's call option. If the STARZ is called early, the investor loses the remaining benefits of the put option. However, when the tax rate is sufficiently high, the issuer is unlikely to exercise early. For the purposes of this discussion, the effective cost of the call option is estimated to be only $0.60, resulting in total value to the investor of $90.92 (=$88.89-16.67+19.29-1.52). The net theoretical value of $0.92 (=$90.92-90.00) is defined as the difference between the value of the STARZ and the price paid for it. For the investor, the net theoretical value is relatively insensitive to the issuer's tax rate. At low tax rates, the call option is more likely to be exercised very early, since the issuer would no longer be accruing valuable tax benefits. The cost of the call option increases slightly, and the value of the STARZ for the investor decreases, as the tax rate is decreased and the issuer has less incentive to keep the STARZ outstanding (see FIG. 11). In fact, at zero tax rates the net theoretical value to the investor falls to zero. Referring now to value to issuer, it is noted that if the STARZ has positive net value to the investor, it might seem that it should have negative net value to the issuer. Indeed it would, if the transaction were a zero-sum game, as it is when tax rates are zero. At zero tax rates, STARZ has zero net theoretical value to the issuer. Non-zero tax rates, however, introduce a third party, the government, that changes the economics for the issuer and the investor. The issuer receives tax credits from the government that increase with the tax rate. For example, at a 35% tax rate, the issuer receives a tax credit of $51.27, so that the net theoretical value of the STARZ issuance to the issuer is $50.35, equal to the proceeds of the issuance plus the tax credit minus the value of the liability (=$90.00+51.27-90.92)., 265704=[0262] The discussion will now turn to equity perspective and dilution. Addressing contingent structures next from the equity perspective, the discussion will focus on dilution. As noted above, in this example there is a very high probability that CARZ holders ultimately become shareholders, and will therefore own a share of the equity of the company, including any accumulated retained earnings. Due to the contingent coupon, CARZ holders also receive a share of any earnings distributed in the form of contingent coupons that are economically equivalent to dividends. Debt, equity and STARZ have significantly different dilution effects. Assuming the facts for Company XYZ, raising $1000 of each has the following dilution effect (To raise $1000 through the STARZ strategy, XYZ must issue a CARZ with $1111 (=$1000/90%) principal):, 132845=[0108] A recent ruling by the IRS changes the landscape for convertibles, creating an opportunity to significantly enhance the interest tax deductions on variants of convertibles known as contingent convertibles (see Revenue Ruling 2002-31; see also \ufffd 1.1275-4 of the Income Tax Regulations on contingent payment debt instruments). Contingent convertibles differ from ordinary convertibles by the addition of one or more features that make the periodic payments dependent (or contingent) upon another factor. For example, coupon payments on the convertible bond may be structured to include the dividend on the underlying shares. If the contingencies are neither remote nor incidental, then the issuer may take interest tax deductions based upon interest accrued at a much higher straight debt rate. The appropriate rate would correspond to the yield on non-convertible debt with essentially the same terms (maturity, payment dates, seniority) as the convertible bond. The enhanced tax deductibility of contingent convertible debt has the potential to expand the Capital Structure Efficient Frontier significantly (see FIG. 3)., 212021=[0217] Referring now to tax treatment, it is noted that interest on convertible bonds is generally tax deductible, but since the coupons are typically lower than on straight debt, the tax deduction has limited economic value. This discussion assumes that contingent convertibles will meet the requirements for contingent payment debt treatment, which allows the issuer to take tax deductions based upon interest accrued at the issuer's higher straight debt rate rather than at the lower stated coupon rate (see IRS Revenue Ruling 2002-31; See also \ufffd 1.1275-4 of the Income Tax Regulations regarding contingent payment debt instruments). This tax treatment greatly enhances the attractiveness of these structures as low cost alternatives to ordinary equity., 191237=[0172] EPS in line with 2002 I/B/E/S estimates of $1.65 per share, annual uncertainty going forward of $0.15 per share}",
