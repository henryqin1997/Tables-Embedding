For example, the root term \u201cdry cleaners\u201d may be searched with an explicit location term associated with 1) no location or country (location band 1); 2) a State location (location band 2); 3) large city or county (location band 3); 4) small city (location band 4); or 5) neighborhood, zip code, or smaller location (location band 5). The frequency that a location term is searched with the root term is measured and recorded in each location band that is associated with the location term.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{118644=In block 1012, the local intent value (LIV) may be calculated based on the search query data of the location bands associated with each root term. In one embodiment, the LIV is calculated by:, 144077=The quality scoring function may be used for scoring which relevant advertisements may appear first in response to a user query having local intent. Any quality scoring function may be used to rank the advertisements and to improve geo-relevancy of the relevant advertisements. In one example, the rank of an advertiser may determined based on the advertisement's eCPM value which may be defined as f(quality score)\ufffdg(bid) value. eCPM may represent effective clicks per thousand, which determines when a user clicks on an advertisement. The quality score may be a linear function of machine learning search algorithmic relevancy, which may include past click through data. The quality score may further relate to local intent and advertiser geo-relevancy factors, such that ads are ranked and served once eCPM values are calculated for each query. In one embodiment, advertisement services are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0282314 A1, published Dec. 14, 2006, entitled \u201cUNIVERSAL ADVERTISEMENT SERVICES ARCHITECTURE,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein., 149124=The computer system 1400 may include a memory 1404 that can communicate via a bus 1408. The memory 1404 may be a main memory, a static memory, or a dynamic memory. The memory 1404 may include, but is not limited to computer readable storage media such as various types of volatile and non-volatile storage media, including but not limited to random access memory, read-only memory, programmable read-only memory, electrically programmable read-only memory, electrically erasable read-only memory, flash memory, magnetic tape or disk, optical media and the like. In one embodiment, the memory 1404 includes a cache or random access memory for the processor 1402. In alternative embodiments, the memory 1404 is separate from the processor 1402, such as a cache memory of a processor, the system memory, or other memory. The memory 1404 may be an external storage device or database for storing data. Examples include a hard drive, compact disc (\u201cCD\u201d), digital video disc (\u201cDVD\u201d), memory card, memory stick, floppy disc, universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) memory device, or any other device operative to store data. The memory 1404 is operable to store instructions executable by the processor 1402. The functions, acts or tasks illustrated in the figures or described herein may be performed by the programmed processor 1402 executing the instructions stored in the memory 1404. The functions, acts or tasks are independent of the particular type of instructions set, storage media, processor or processing strategy and may be performed by software, hardware, integrated circuits, firm-ware, micro-code and the like, operating alone or in combination. Likewise, processing strategies may include multiprocessing, multitasking, parallel processing and the like., 116337=The larger geographic areas, such as the first location band 1110 have a lower LIV, whereas the smaller geographic areas, such as the fifth location band 1102 has a larger LIV. The localness (and the LIV) increases as the geographic area is narrowed. In one embodiment, for the fifth location band 1102 the LIV=5, for the fourth location band 1104 the LIV=4, for the third location band 1106 the LIV=3, for the second location band 1108 the LIV=2, and for the first location band 1110 the LIV=1., 126157=In block 1020, the root terms and corresponding LIV's may be stored in a table or list. In one embodiment, the list is stored in the user query database 326. The user query database 326 may include a list of all root terms from the search query data sources as well as associated location terms, associated location bands, frequency of the term in each location band, LIP and LIV. Alternatively, each root term may be stored with only the LIV., 133177=The location identifier may be a unique identification for any location. In one embodiment, each city, town, county, zip code, and state in the United States is associated with a unique location identifier. An example of assigning location identifiers is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0004797, published Jan. 5, 2006, entitled \u201cGEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION INDEXING,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference. That application describes zones that are represented by location identifiers that establish relationships and overlap with adjacent zones., 28587=The present application relates to applications entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ASSOCIATING A GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITH AN INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2007, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/729,365; \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ASSOCIATING A GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITH AN INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2007, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/729,364; \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ASSOCIATING A GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITH AN INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2007, new U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/729,377; \u201cSYSTEM FOR DETERMINING THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE OF LOCAL INTENT IN A SEARCH QUERY,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2007, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/729,104; \u201cSYSTEM FOR PROVIDING GEOGRAPHICALLY RELEVANT CONTENT TO A SEARCH QUERY WITH LOCAL INTENT,\u201d filed on Mar. 28, 2007, new U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/729,103; each of which is incorporated by reference., 151626=Additionally, the computer system 1400 may include an input device 1416 configured to allow a user to interact with any of the components of system 1400. The input device 1416 may be a number pad, a keyboard, or a cursor control device, such as a mouse, or a joystick, touch screen display, remote control or any other device operative to interact with the system 1400., 112982=The queries stored or recorded in the data sources may be analyzed to determine which queries include explicit locations. Queries with explicit locations or explicit local intent may also be referred to as geo-modified queries because they include a location term in addition to a root term. In block 1006, the root term and the location term are separated for each query that includes a location term., 124476=In one embodiment, a different LIV may be calculated for each of the data sources that are available. Accordingly, in block 1014, the LIV from each data source may be combined and/or averaged to get an overall LIV score. The formula described above may be expanded to account for multiple data sources. Accordingly, the LIV formula may be expanded to a probability distribution formula: LIV=\u03a3\u03a3Probability(term, location band i, source j)*Expected Value(term, location band i, source j)+Probability(term, no location)*Expected Value(term, no location band). The variable \u201ci\u201d refers to each location band, and \u201cj\u201d refers to the potential sources of frequency data. The summations are over variables \u201ci\u201d and \u201cj.\u201d Alternatively, the formula may be LIV=f(probability term, location band i, source j)+error, where the variable \u201ci\u201d refers to each location band, and \u201cj\u201d refers to each source of frequency data., 131088=In alternate embodiments, the identification of a location in block 1202 may be determined differently. In one embodiment, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0060430, published Mar. 17, 2005, entitled \u201cMETHOD OF DETERMINING A LIKELY GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein, determines the likely geographic location based on submitted criteria. In addition, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0108213, published May 19, 2005, entitled \u201cGEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION EXTRACTION,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein, infers a likely geographical location from one or more search terms. In one embodiment, the location may be determined based on the users IP address as in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0108244, published May 19, 2005, entitled \u201cMETHOD OF DETERMINING GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION FROM IP ADDRESS INFORMATION,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein. For a search performed on a mobile device, the geographic location may be determined as in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0003835, published Jan. 6, 2005, entitled \u201cMETHOD OF PROVIDING LOCATION BASED INFORMATION TO A MOBILE-TERMINAL WITHIN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein., 143576=In block 1218, the candidate set of geo-relevant listings may be ranked. The candidate set may be relevant advertisements or may be search results or other content. In one embodiment, a quality scoring function may rank the candidate set as in block 1220. The quality scoring function may weigh an advertisements relative bid for the advertisement, as well as a willingness to pay to the marketplace, click-thru-rate, and overall advertisement relevancy., 125419=A manually identified truth set may be developed for error analysis in block 1016. An editorial truth set may be established in which editors may manually identify the local intent of a large sample of terms. Using one of the tunable probability models with error functions as discussed above may allow for the tuning of model parameters to replicate or exceed the precision and recall of the editorially-controlled truth set. The truth set may minimize the error function. Accordingly, each additional data source that contributes to the calculation of the local intent probability of each term may be refined. In block 1018, the LIP function is tuned with the truth set to minimize errors., 152929=The present disclosure contemplates a computer-readable medium that includes instructions 1412 or receives and executes instructions 1412 responsive to a propagated signal, so that a device connected to a network 1420 can communicate voice, video, audio, images or any other data over the network 1420. Further, the instructions 1412 may be transmitted or received over the network 1420 via a communication port 1418. The communication port 1418 may be a part of the processor 1402 or may be a separate component. The communication port 1418 may be created in software or may be a physical connection in hardware. The communication port 1418 is configured to connect with a network 1420, external media, the display 1414, or any other components in system 1400, or combinations thereof. The connection with the network 1420 may be a physical connection, such as a wired Ethernet connection or may be established wirelessly as discussed below. Likewise, the additional connections with other components of the system 1400 may be physical connections or may be established wirelessly., 154156=The network 1420 may include wired networks, wireless networks, or combinations thereof. The wireless network may be a cellular telephone network, an 802.11, 802.16, 802.20, or WiMax network. Further, the network 1420 may be a public network, such as the Internet, a private network, such as an intranet, or combinations thereof, and may utilize a variety of networking protocols now available or later developed including, but not limited to TCP/IP based networking protocols., 146876=In a networked deployment, the computer system may operate in the capacity of a server or as a client user computer in a server-client user network environment, or as a peer computer system in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment. The computer system 1400 can also be implemented as or incorporated into various devices, such as a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile device, a palmtop computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a communications device, a wireless telephone, a land-line telephone, a control system, a camera, a scanner, a facsimile machine, a printer, a pager, a personal trusted device, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any other machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine. In a particular embodiment, the computer system 1400 can be implemented using electronic devices that provide voice, video or data communication. Further, while a single computer system 1400 is illustrated, the term \u201csystem\u201d shall also be taken to include any collection of systems or sub-systems that individually or jointly execute a set, or multiple sets, of instructions to perform one or more computer functions., 145187=The geographic relevancy may also be an input to the quality scoring function. In block 1222, geographic relevancy may be an input based on physical proximity and/or spatial proximity between a user's local intent and an advertisers' geo-targeting intent. Proximity measure may be multi-dimensional which may effectively encapsulate several factors such as business context (e.g. in/out service tendency), local shopping intent, inventory availability, willingness to drive/walk, and/or traffic/density conditions. Proximity may be calculated on these numerous factors for a given candidate advertisement and user search query., 141022=In block 1210, location identifiers are used for an expansion of the geographic area. In one embodiment, an expansion list of location identifiers is generated based on the exact location identifier. As discussed above, the geographic database 328 may include relationships between parent, child, and/or adjacent locations. Accordingly, an expansion may include all adjacent locations and/or the parent location. The expansion or contraction may be based on the available search results, content, and/or advertisements. For example, advertisements may only be available on the large city level. Accordingly, if the exact location is a small city, then expansion of that location may give a large city location that is associated with an advertisement. In one embodiment, the available advertisements may only be related to certain areas. For example, if the only advertisements that are associated with Illinois relate to Chicago, then if the exact location is Peoria, Ill., expansion into the parent location of Illinois may result in Chicago advertisements being displayed. Likewise, the expansion of Peoria, Ill. into adjacent locations may also result in Chicago advertisements being displayed., 135892=One example of a child location for a large city location 1308 is a small city location 1312. As shown, San Gabriel is a smaller city identified by location identifier 37. Adjacent smaller cities that are associated with location identifier 37 are Temple City, Alhambra, and Sierra Madre. In addition, the adjacent small city location 1314 of Pasadena is shown. San Gabriel is a child location of Los Angeles. Child locations of a small city location 1312 may include zip code locations 1316. In an alternative embodiment, the child locations of a small city location 1312 may include specific points of interest or neighborhoods as described above., 151007=As shown, the computer system 1400 may further include a display unit 1414, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a flat panel display, a solid state display, a cathode ray tube (CRT), a projector, a printer or other now known or later developed display device for outputting determined information. The display 1414 may act as an interface for the user to see the functioning of the processor 1402, or specifically as an interface with the software stored in the memory 1404 or in the drive unit 1406.}",
