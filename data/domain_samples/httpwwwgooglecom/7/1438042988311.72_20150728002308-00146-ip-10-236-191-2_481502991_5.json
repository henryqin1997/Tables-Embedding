FIG. 10 shows a flowchart for execution by the central processing unit 204. In the first block 2040 after starting, bus line 215 is checked to see if it is busy. If it is busy, the program loops to repeatedly effect checking at the block 2040 until the bus line 215 becomes available. When the bus line 215 is available, the display program in the program memory 210 is executed at a block 2042. By execution of the display program, transformed map data is transferred to the display memory 214 from the display memory 20 and the data are displayed on the display screen 30. The display on screen 30 and data transfer operation from the memory 20 to the memory 214 may be interleaved line by line updating the display memory 214 without producing visual interference with the screen display data., 23063=A display system for displaying the road map and the vehicle position on the display road can help the vehicle driver find his way. A pilot system for a ship is disclosed in the first publication of the Japanese Patent Application Sho 52-159895 (Tokkai Sho 54-89767, published July 17, 1979). In this publication, there is shown a method for displaying a sea chart with an indication of the ship position. The sea chart is moved on the display according to the travelling distance and travelling direction of the ship. In this system, coordinates of the displayed sea chart are modified with respect to the position and travelling direction of the ship. The sea chart is stored in a digital memory as plotted coordinates. A microcomputer is used for processing modifications of the sea chart coordinates and for calculation of the ship position based on a sensor, which measures travelling distance and detects the direction of the ship., 24020=On the other hand, in the automotive vehicle field, Tokkai Sho 52-141662, published on Nov. 26, 1977, shows a map display system for an automotive vehicle. In this system, microfilm is used to store the map. In this system, the indication of the vehicle position will move in accordance with the travelling distance and travelling direction of the vehicle., 48547=Returning to FIG. 10, after execution of the block 2042, the central processing unit 204 executes the vehicle position calculation program at a block 2044. The vehicle position processing program generally processes the travelling distance signal Sl and travelling direction signal S.sub.\u03b8 to obtain the coordinates Sv (xv, yv) of the foregoing vector sum equations. Thereafter, the program in FIG. 10 returns to the initial block 2040., 49047=The execution of the programs in the central processing unit 204 and the operation of the central processing unit 304 of the coordinate transforming unit 300 of FIG. 6 are most clearly illustrated by the timing chart of FIG. 12. The timing of the central processing unit operation of the coordinate transforming unit 300 is controlled by the timer 310. During the time period between T1 and T2 the CPU 304 calculates the coordinates of the display data (xa ', ya ') for each point (xa, ya) of the map and the calculated display data are transferred to the display memory 20. The coordinate transformation program is executed in the CPU 304 following which the CPU 204 proceeds to execute steps 2042 and 2044 (see FIG. 10) during the time interval between T2 and T3. Generally, the time interval between T2 and T3 is much shorter than the data transformation time T1 -T2, and thus it is shown expanded in FIG. 12. Although not shown, plural cycles of operation of the flowchart of FIG. 10 may be carried out between intervals T2 and T4. In order to prevent the program execution by CPU 204 of steps 2042 and 2044 during the data transformation program of line 215 is closed by being kept in a \"busy\" state, while the central processing unit 304 of the coordinate transforming unit 300 executes the coordinate transformation program. As long as the bus line 215 is thus closed, the central processing unit 204 loops in step 2040 to repeatedly check the bus line 215. The bus line 215 is made available by the CPU 304 upon completion of its current calculation and the data transfer to the display memory 20. In response to the opening of the bus line 215, the display program as set forth is executed in the central processing unit 204 during the interval between T2 and T3. At the time T4 the CPU 304 reads current input data (Sv, Sr, Sk) and transforms the map to display coordinate data transformations., 40918=FIG. 6 shows the map display system of the preferred embodiment in more detail for better understanding. The vehicle position sensor unit 100 comprises a travelling distance sensor 110 and a travelling direction sensor 120. The travelling distance sensor 110 is disposed opposite the vehicle axle (or a wheel of the vehicle) and generates a pulse for each fixed amount of rotation of the vehicle axle. The pulse signals are fed to a signal shaper 112 and subsequently to the display control unit 200. The signals from the shaper 112 are vector summed to provide an indication of the vehicle travel distance. On the other hand, the travelling direction sensor 120 can comprise any of a number of appropriate devices such as a terrestrial magnetic compass, gyrocompass, gyroscope or so forth. An example of the type of travelling direction sensor specifically suitable for automotive use is set forth in the SAE Paper SP-80/458/S02.50, published by Society of Automotive Engineering, as No. 800123, written by H. Ito et al or 3-Axis Rate Gyro Package Parts No. PG24-N1, illustrated in an Instruction Manual thereof of K. K. Hokushin Denki Seisakusho, February, 1979, both of which references are incorporated herein by reference. In the former reference, two coil sensors are used to generate vx and vy component direction signals. The y coil may be aligned with vehicle direction so that the angle \u03b8, given by the arctangent (vx /vy) is representative of the direction of the vehicle relative to magnetic north. An A/D converter 128 is used to digitize the signals vx and vy, which signals are collectively represented in FIG. 2 by S.sub.\u03b8.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A pulse generator 559 is actuated by the set output from the flip-flop 558, thereby generating a plurality of scanning pulses Sscan at a constant period, which are conducted to the display control unit 220 to activate the scanning beam of the display screen 32. A down-counter 560 decrements a value set by a pre-set value setting circuit 561 (when the display screen is \"m\" rows and \"n\" columns, the set value is \"m\ufffdn-1\") in accordance with the scanning pulse Sscan. When the counted value coincides with zero, a signal is sent to a delay circuit 562 which outputs a pulse which is delayed by a predetermined period to the flip-flop 558 so as to reset it and switch to the mode for displaying. The predetermined delay periods in the delay circuit 562 permits time for completion of the recording of the data in the display memory 22. Referring to FIG. 20, the reference numeral 557 denotes a timer which generates a pulse signal which switches at regular intervals between a mode for transforming and recording the data stored in the map memory 12 into the coordinates of the display memory 22, and another mode for displaying the data stored in the display memory 22 on the display screen 32. Thus, a flip-flop 558 is actuated by the output pulse from the timer 557, thereby switching between the transforming and recording modes. Alternatively, the flip-flop 558",
