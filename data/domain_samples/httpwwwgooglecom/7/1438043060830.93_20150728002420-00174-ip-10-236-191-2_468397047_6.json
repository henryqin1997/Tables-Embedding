Accordingly, it is intended that the invention to be secured by Letters Patent be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. From the foregoing specification it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiment described and illustrated and that numerous modifications and changes are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the circuit as described above arbitrates between seven devices, each having a unique three-bit octal formatted priority code assigned thereto. Systems for arbitrating between more or less devices or utilizing priority codes formatted in other than three-bit octal can be constructed. In addition, the system as described utilized active LOW signals to generate a set of acknowledge signals. A circuit making use of active HIGH signals could easily be designed by interchanging OR and AND functions. It can thus be seen that there has been provided by the present invention a simple and inexpensive means for arbitrating between two or more processors or other smart devices. The prioritizer outputs P0 through P7 are provided to gates OR80 through OR87, respectively, and in similar fashion to the OR gating associated with the outputs of decoders DEC09 through DEC14.",
