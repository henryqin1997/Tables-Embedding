The three iconic workspaces of FIG. 2 enable a real estate renter or buyer to specify example data elements, such as the example data elements depicted in the Real Estate column 80 of FIG. 3, and view results, as follows: In the first process step, the renter or buyer uses the Context Selection Workspace to specify their query 81 as \u201cFind housing near new job by August.\u201d The renter or buyer selects the user context \u201cRelocating Business Professional\u201d from among the available context icons 82. The renter or buyer may elect to go to the Detail Specification Workspace in the second interface in order to view the context attributes 83 associated with the \u201cRelocating Business Professional\u201d user context. Preferably, the default assigned context attribute value (\u201cSubcontract it all\u201d, for example) for any context attribute (\u201cMaintenance Style\u201d, for example) is visible on the context attribute icon (\u201cMaintenance Style\u201d, for example, whose name is shown highlighted in FIG. 3). In addition, the renter/buyer may click on the context attribute (\u201cmaintenance style, to stay with the example) to display a pull down menu to view the other values 84 (in either picture or word format) that could be assigned to this attribute. Upon renter or buyer double clicking on attribute value \u201cDo-It-YourSelf-er\u201d, for example, the list of Value Resource Parameters (include/exclude filters 85) for the attribute value \u201cDo-It-YourSelf-er\u201d is displayed. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, the renter or buyer may indicate that they want to include walls, paint and lawn mowing and exclude plumbing, electrical and landscaping when searching for relevant resources. The renter or buyer may additionally specify resource priorities 86 by selecting, sequencing and weighting and specifying minimum and maximum values for relevant criteria such as cost, time, quality and risk on the Resource Selection Criteria Definition graphical user interface element on the Detail Specification Workspace. The results of the renter or buyer's search are listed on the Results Display Workspace of the third interface 32 in which the renter or buyer may immediately select one or more of the listed real estate resources, request to see additional details on them, or request to see a response set graphic indicating the relative positioning of each resource along each of the axes (n-dimensions, relating to cost, time, quality and risk) specified earlier. If no acceptable housing resources were provided, the renter or buyer may return to the Context Selection Workspace to redefine their query or select a different user context such as \u201cEmpty Nester.\u201d The renter or buyer can also elect to return to the Detail Specification Workspace to change the default value of the context attribute \u201cMaintenance Style\u201d from Do-It-Yourself-er to Subcontract It All, for example, and add or remove Value Resource Parameters for the attribute value \u201cSubcontract It All\u201d or other context attribute values associated with context attributes such as \u201cMode of Commute to Work/School\u201d or \u201cMode of Housing.\u201d The real estate transactor may also change their selection criteria, the weighting of the selection criteria, and the minimum/maximum values for any selection criteria, in hopes of identifying additional relevant resources.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to illustrative and preformed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. While the prior art has made use of adaptive learning in information retrieval systems, the overall customer self service system for resource search and selection enables the use of a large, rich set of contextual attribute-value pairs, is focused on learning about the user/user groups rather than the resources/resource groups and is able to discover user group characteristics and apply them to individuals. Much of the prior art is focused on the discovery of database structure, the clustering of data within the resources, or discovering relevant taxonomy for resources but the current system discovers contexts and context attributes among users which can be used predictively. The customer selfservice system of the invention uses a highly specialized and optimized combination of supervised and unsupervised logic along with both automated and semi-automated entry of learned results and is able to deliver higher value because contexts are used in a closed loop self improvement system; front end (entry) middle (search and display) and back end (results and user feedback) are integrated. Other systems apply",
