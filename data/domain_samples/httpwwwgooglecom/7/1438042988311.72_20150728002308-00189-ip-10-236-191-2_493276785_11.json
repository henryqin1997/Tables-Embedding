    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that a wide range of changes and modifications to the embodiments described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are contemplated. It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of the invention. As can be seen from the foregoing, the present embodiments provide a system and method for delivering audible caller identification information when standard Caller ID information can not be provided and with a message tailored to called party requirements. The SCP detects the directory number to which a terminating attempt trigger is assigned and places this directory number in a parameter for transmission to the SSP using a forward_call message. The SCP determines the nature of the message that should be sent to the calling party to prompt the calling party to provide audible caller identification information. The message may be sent in a particular language or according to any other suitable requirements specified by the called party. When the called party is advised of the incoming call, the message may further be tailored in accordance with the customer's requirements. This message may be playing in a specified language or format, which may vary from the language or format of the message played to",
