Examples of these are E. coli, Salmonella, Bacillus, Clostridium, Listeria, Pseudomonas, and many others including those listed above, all of which are promptly detected by the present technology, which is suitable for the standardized testing of products samples to determine their suitability for administration to or use in humans or animals. A necessarily incomplete list of microorganisms commonly present in foodstuffs is listed by Hill W. E., in Critical Rev. Food Sci. and Nutrition 36 (1 & 2): 123 (1996), along with other universal and specific bacterial primers and PCR cycling temperature pairs, the relevant pages thereof being incorporated herein by reference, e.g. pp. 140-146, among others. Other universal and specific sequences of internal DNA segments plus DNA arms including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the beacon are also provided by Schofield et al., Appl. and Environ. Microbiol. 63(3): 1143 (1997), the relevant sections of which are incorporated herein by reference, e.g., Tables 1 and 2, and the section on Cultivation of Bacteria, among others., 238945=1. Tyagi, S. And Kramer, R. R., 1996. Molecular Beacons: Probes that Fluoresce upon Hybridization. Nature Biotechnology 14:303-308., 45070=This invention claims priority based on Ser. No. 60/086,025, filed May 18, 1998., 217955=The construction of the DNA beacon molecule, PCR reaction conditions, and sample preparation are detailed below. Briefly, generally known PCR reaction conditions are suitable. For example, a master pre-mix for a standard 50 \u03bcl reaction, although the volume may be reduced to as small as a 10 \u03bcl per reaction, may be as follows. 24 \u03bcl water free of nucleases, proteases, heavy metals and DNA/RNA may be mixed with 5 \u03bcl of a 2% PVPP aqueous solution (polyvinylpolypyrrolidone), 5 \u03bcl of 10\ufffdPCR buffer, e.g. 100 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl, 5 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 \u03bcl 50 ng/\u03bcl of each primer, 1 \u03bcl 10 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 \u03bcl of enzyme, e.g. AmpliTaq LD at a 1:5 dilution and 2 \u03bcl of DNA template preparation, as described below. The cycling parameters may be 30 sec. at 95 \ufffd C., 30 sec. at 58\ufffd C. and 60 sec. at 74\ufffd C. This routine may be repeated 30-50 times depending on the sensitivity needed, which is generally empirically determined by the type of sample and sample preparation without undue experimentation., 237398=A Waters instrument equipped with dual pumps, a solvent programmer (Waters 600E System Controller), Vydac C18 RP column, UV-Vis detector (Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector), A/D converter (PE Nelson 900 Series Interface), computer with associated chromatographic software (PE Nelson Turbochrom), and manual injector was used. The column flow rate used was 1.0 mL/min, and the detection wavelength was usually 260 (sometimes 490) mm. A linear solvent gradient changed solvent composition from 100% A to 100% B over a 40 min period. Solvent A was an 80:20 (v/v) mixture of 0. IM TEAA (pH=6.5) and acetonitrile; solvent B a 30:70 mixture of 0.1M TEAA and acetonitrile., 239192=3. Connolly, B. A. 1985. Chemical Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing a Free Sulfhydryl Group and Subsequent Attachment of Thiol Specific Probes. Nucleic Acids Research 13(12): 4485-4503., 213709=Species specific primers and nucleic acid target sequences for C. jejuni are provided in Table 4 below. See, Day et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol.: 1019 (March 1997)., 80987=The kit may further comprise PCR reagents. A most preferred embodiment of the kit, comprises a \u201cpre-mix\u201d of reagents, and instructions for DNA amplification and for conducting a PCR under specific cycling conditions. As already indicated, the kit of the invention may be a kit for generally assessing the presence or absence of microorganisms, e.g., bacteria, in a sample or may be custom tailored for the detection of specific organisms, such as any desired bacterium. An embodiment of the method and kit of the invention suitable for the determination of bacterial contamination in general may comprise a bacteria-specific nucleic acid sequence and its corresponding primers. The inventor has found that when a bacteria-specific sequence and its primers are subjected to PCR under certain conditions, the method of the invention provides high specificity for the bacterial genus. The universal microbial and/or viral nucleic acid sequence is preferably provided in the form of a stem-loop structure. However, the nucleic acid sequence need not be in this form. The nucleic acid target sequence may be in linear and/or circular form, as well. The polynucleotide (or fluorescent beacon), however, must generally conform to a stem-loop structure, and must comprise at least an DNA internal segment which is complementary to the target sequence. See, Tyagi and Kramer, Nature Biotech. 14:303 (1996). If the microbial and/or viral target sequence is not in the form of a stem-loop structure, the polynucleotide (or fluorescent beacon) must contain additional nucleotides at either, or both, end(s) of the complementary region to form a \u201cfalse stem-loop\u201d (arm segments). See, Schofield et al., App. & Environmental Microbiol. 63(3):1143 (1997)., 229134=To test for sterility of shelf stable commercially sterile pudding, for example, the pudding is diluted in ultrapure water 1:30 times, and boiled for 10 min before adding the pudding sample to a PCR pre-mix., 231252=The DNA oligomer is a lyophilized solid obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Lot 021098-175, 2008 nmoles). It was dissolved in 3.0 m/L 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH=8.5) and 500 \u03bcl used for the following dabcylation reaction., 239096=2. Tyagi, S., 1996. Preparation of Molecular Beacons. Private communication., 219002=The preparation of the sample is adapted empirically based on whether or not there are interfering substances in the sample, and what type of substances they are, as is known in the art. Once the proper sample preparation is attained, DNA extraction may be attained, for example, by simple boiling for 10 min prior to utilization of the sample as DNA template or target in the reaction. For example, to test for sterility of shelf stable commercially sterile pudding, the pudding may be diluted in ultrapure water 1:30 and boiled for 10 min before adding to the PCR pre-mix., 79135=Any fluorogen (or fluorogenic agent) known in the art may be utilized with the present technology. Particularly suitable are pico green, fluorescein, edans, and the like. However, others may also be utilized. Similarly, any quencher known in the art is suitable for use herein. By means of example, dabcyl is suitable for the present purpose, although others may be utilized. Both the fluorogenic agent and the quencher are linked to the DNA portion of the fluorogenic beacon by C6-thio or C7-amino linkers known in the art, and the linkage is conducted as is known in the art. See, for example, Columns 1-2, page 1143, Schofield et al., Appl. & Ennison. Microbiol. 63(3):1143 (1997); Tyagi & Kramer, Nature Biotech. 14:303 (1996), the text of which is incorporated herein by reference., 227788=24 \u03bcl ultra purified water free of nucleases, proteases, heavy metals and DNA/RNA are mixed with 5 \u03bcl of a 2% solution of PVPP (polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) in ultra purified water, 5 \u03bcl of 10\ufffdPCR buffer (100 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl in ultrapure water), 5 \u03bcl of MgCl2 (25 mM solution in ultrapure water), 1.25 \u03bcl of each primer (2 solutions at 50 ng/\u03bcl in ultrapure water), 1 \u03bcl of each dNTP (4 solutions at 10 mM in ultrapure water), 2.5 \u03bcl of enzyme (AmpliTaq LD at a 1:5 dilution in ultrapure water, Perkin-Elmer) and 2 \u03bcl of DNA template preparation as described below.}",
