No. 4,056,854 to Boretos, issued Nov. 8, 1977, describes a endovascularly inserted, catheter mounted, supra-annular valve in which the circular frame abuts the wall of the artery and attached flaps of flexible membrane extend distally in the vasculature. The flaps lie against the artery wall during forward flow, and close inward towards the central catheter to prevent regurgitation during reverse blood flow. The Boretos valve was designed to be positioned against the artery wall during forward flow, as compared to the mid-center position of the Moulopoulos valve, to reduce the stagnation of blood flow and consequent thrombus and embolic formation expected from a valve at mid-center position., 23969=U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,979 to Moulopoulos, issued Jun. 27, 1972, describes a endovascularly inserted conical shaped umbrella-like valve positioned and held in place by an elongated mounting catheter at a supra-annular site to the aortic valve in a nearby arterial vessel. The conical end points toward the malfunctioning aortic valve and the umbrella's distal ends open up against the aorta wall with reverse blood flow, thereby preventing regurgitation., 25170=Reviews relating to replacement valves include: Gibbon's Surgery of the Chest, 5th Ed., David C. Sabiston, Jr., M.D., Frank D. Spencer, M.D., 1990, Vol. II, Ch. 52, pp. 1566-1596, and Textbook of Interventional Cardiology, Eric J. Topol, 1990, Chs. 43-44, pp. 831-867., 43400=The tube of the valve introducer device, the introducer channel, comprises an elongated flexible cylinder. The introducer channel (50) is made of durable, flexible material, for example, teflon coated polyurethane or other materials which have the following characteristics: flexible, durable, and non-thrombogenic. The introducer channel has a generally cylindrical outside surface and a generally cylindrical inside surface. The proximal end of the introducer channel is attached circumferentially around the distal opening of the introducer capsule and the introducer channel's distal end exits through the vascular entry point (FIG. 9). For use in an adult human, the introducer channel preferably has an internal diameter of about 0.5-10 mm, making it capable of containing the pusher channel (55) of the pusher device. For use in a host other than an adult human, this internal diameter size range can be varied up or down depending on the size of the host and lumen. The introducer channel and pusher channel are also characterized as being capable of allowing suction or irrigation instruments within its lumen.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. All publications and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. The intraluminal procedure device, the procedure device capsule and the tissue cutter can be independently applied, or applied in conjunction with each other, to instrumentation at or removal of cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular, mesenteric, renal, or peripheral vessel valves or tissue, and would be especially important anywhere in the cardiac or vascular system where peripheral embolization is problematic or accurate positioning of instruments is essential. They can also be used in other body lumens, for example, the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, biliary, and respiratory tracts. In addition, the valve replacement system can be used to supplant as well as replace a host's valve or prosthesis. In that procedure the dysfunctional valve or prosthesis is not removed by the tissue cutter, and the prosthetic valve device is fixated at a vascular situs such that the device supplants the function of the dysfunctional valve or prosthesis. Also, the valve replacement system could be used in nonhuman species, for example, other mammals. Once the endovascular implantation of the prosthetic valve device is",
