For example, referring to FIG. 8, another embodiment of the invention may include first and second cores 70, 72, respectively, wherein the second core 72 fits within the annular space defined by the first cores 70 such that a small gap 74 is formed between the first and second core 70, 72, respectively. In this case, in one embodiment the windings would be wrapped around first core 70 only and differential flux would pass back and forth between the first and second cores while the common mode flux would simply circle within the first core 70. Referring now to FIG. 7, in addition to the inventive configuration or assembly described above, the present includes a method 100 for providing or configuring a common mode/differential mode inductor assembly. To this end, at process block 102 the method includes the step of providing a first torridial core 12 of magnetic material having at least first and second core segments (i.e., the left and right halves of core 12 in FIG. 1) where the first torridial core 12 forms",
