Thus, with a 1:4 switch 90, there will be 18 iterations of multiplexing switch 90, one for each of the 18 four-high module 10's populating memory expansion board 70(1). Thus, the system 80 shown in FIG. 9 presents a total of 288 memory devices. It should be noted that system 80 may be employed with ICs of any package type and need not be limited to DDR or DDRII or even CSP.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{72688=Thus, decode logic 86 may, on the appropriate signal from clock 84, generate a level select signal which, in a preferred embodiment, is a multi-bit signal that controls a multiplexing switch 90 associated with several data lines. Switch 90 is in a preferred embodiment, a high speed switch and a FET muliplexer would provide a preferred multiplexing switch 90 in the practice of a preferred mode of the invention. The fan out of multiplexing switch 90 may be any that provides a selection capability to a variety of device data lines from a DQ line from chipset 82. The DQ lines between chipset 82 and switches 90 are depicted by double-headed arrows 94(1), 94(2), 94(3) and 94(4). As with the depiction of stacked modules 10, only one multiplexing switch 90 is shown per memory expansion board 70, but those of skill will understand that multiple multiplexing switches 90 are employed in practice of the depicted preferred embodiment of the invention. The number of multiplexing switches 90 will depend upon the fan out ratios. For example, use of nine 8:32 multiplexing switches 90 would be preferred (if available) or 4:8 or 1:4 multiplexing switches 90 will also provide advantages as an example. It should be understood that there are merely examples and that a variety of multiplexing switches and ratios may be employed for multiplexing switches 90 although the type of switch and the ratios will affect the loading figures. Consequently, a FET mux is preferred for multiplexing switch 90 and a ratio of 1:4 is one of the preferred ratios to employ., 36820=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in a variety of specific forms and that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The described embodiments are only illustrative and not restrictive and the scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the following claims. In the system 80, the capacitive load presented to chipset 82 would be approximately the combination of the input capacitance of switching multiplexer 90 times the number of DIMM slots plus one DRAM device load plus one times the output capacitance of the multiplexing switch 90. In large systems, this will reduce capacitive loading by a notable amount, thus allowing more DIMM slots at higher speeds and/or more densely populated DIMMs. Memory access system 80 provides an opportunity to improve high speed memory performance and allows use of memory expansion configurations that might not otherwise be available due to capacitive loading in conventional DIMM systems. The data line of each level of the constituent CSPs of each module 10 is connected to one input 92 of a corresponding exemplar multiplexing switch 90. In response to the CS signal 88 from decode logic 86 on a DIMM expansion board 70, multiplexing switch 90 connects the appropriate one of the DQ signals",
