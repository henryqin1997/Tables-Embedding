    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although several embodiments have been illustrated, this was for the purpose of describing, but not limiting, the invention. Various modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art and are within the scope of this invention, which is defined more particularly by the attached claims. Since temperature sensors are continuously measuring the temperatures of cells Y and Z, and periodically sending sensor measurement signals to the particular cooling module 20, the assessment of the cooling requirement of cell Y is performed repeatedly. Further, the cooling level for the particular cooling module 20 is adjusted accordingly. At step 59, the local control logic 92 of a particular cooling module 20 receives a sensor measurement signal 36 indicative of the temperature Ty of the respective cell 14, hereinafter cell Y, as well as a sensor measurement signal indicative of the temperature Tz of another cell 14, hereinafter cell Z, located adjacent cell Y. At step 60, the temperature measurements Ty and Tz are extracted from the sensor measurement signals. At step 62, a temperature differential between cell Y and cell Z is computed as follows: Td=Tz\u2212Ty. If the value of Td is equal to or greater than zero at step 64, cell Y does not require additional cooling and the current cooling level of the particular cooling module 20, which may be at or above the minimum cooling level, is maintained at step 68.",
