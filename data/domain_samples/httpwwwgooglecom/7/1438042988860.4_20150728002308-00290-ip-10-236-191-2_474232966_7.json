Therefore, the preferred embodiments described herein are Illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims and all variations which come within the meaning of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. In short, the lead frame according to the present invention is preferable to the manufacturing process as shown in FIG. 15 and 16 and is particularly preferable to the thick-solder plating. Because of the provision of the connecting portion Y whose location is carefully selected, the plating process can be successfully performed to realize the uniform thickness of the plated layer formed on the lead. In the plating process, there is a tendency In which the solder is easily concentrated at the edge of the substance to be plated. In other words, the thickness of the solder plating at the auxiliary lead 22a may be greater than that of the solder plating at the leads 22. Since the auxiliary lead 22a will be finally cut out, the uniform thickness in the solder plating can be obtained on the leads 22. FIG. 17 is a plan view simply illustrating a main part of the lead frame according to the present invention, wherein the parts identical to those shown in FIG. 7 will be designated",
