Nos. 5,015,247 and 4,501,269 filled with an implant according to the invention. FIG. 2 illustrates an implant 2 according to the invention inserted in a hip-bone cavity S for fixing a hip-bone implant 3 in the hip-bone cavity, said hip-bone implant 3 consisting of a conventional plastic cup 4 coated with titanium 5 and resting on, with a press fit, a thin pouch 1 formed according to the hip-bone cavity and containing the above-described batch in which the grains/granules consist of titanium. The pouch 1 is also made of the described, exemplifying resorbable material in the form of a woven fabric. FIG. 1 is a schematic view of two annular-cylindrical pouches 1 having contents as described above and being inserted between two vertebrae K. The pouches 1 are well filled with the batch (the grains/granular material is made of titanium), which has been vibrated for adequate mixing and compacting so that the distance between the vertebrae can be kept correct. Bone forms rapidly and takes over the supporting function. The pouches are made of the above-described, exemplifying resorbable material. FIG. 1a is a sectional view a\u2014a. DRAWING DESCRIPTION The invention remedies this and suggests an implant of the type described above for stabilising the spinal column. In, for instance,",
