    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the foregoing description, it can be seen that the present invention a new and useful method and mechanism for applying multiple actions to a graph in a single traversal of such directed graph. In particular, the present comprises a method and mechanism for \u201cchaining\u201d the multiple actions such that of the multiple actions are applied in sequence to each node in the directed graph before moving on to the next one. By allowing an application to dynamically combine actions in a flexible manner in most any serial chain to perform a desired overall process, the cumulative effect achieved by such chaining of actions is also flexible. Thus actions with very specific effects can be combined in arbitrary ways, and an application can then mix and match actions to suit particular needs. It be appreciated that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the inventive concepts thereof. It should be understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The programming necessary to effectuate the processes performed in connection with the present invention is relatively straight-forward and should be apparent to the relevant programming public. Accordingly, such programming is attached hereto. Any particular programming, then, may be employed to effectuate the present invention without departing from",
