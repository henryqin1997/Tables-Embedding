Similarly, lighting levels received through LAN communications by the control module are converted to dimmer levels and when appropriate \"piled on\" to industry standard dimming control protocol control values and/or local control values.

Such modifications and substitutions are within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined in the following claims. The individual control modules may be manually selected for operation by the operator using the module selection button 82 as previously described, however, an automatic take control feature is provided for automatic switching of control modules upon failure. The control module which is in the off-line mode must receive a pulse signal from the on-line module at predetermined intervals through dedicated communications lines between the modules. If for any reason such as software failure, electronic or power failure, the required recognition pulse is not received by the off-line module, the off-line module will assume control of the rack. Individual dimmer control for loads controlled by the dimmer rack is accomplished through direct input by the hand held controller for the rack through command functions as previously described. Looks stored in the NVR for the rack are invoked through the hand held controller and upon loss of industry standard dimming control protocol or LAN dimmer level inputs to the control module a default look is invoked by the control module and communicated to the appropriate dimmer modules.
