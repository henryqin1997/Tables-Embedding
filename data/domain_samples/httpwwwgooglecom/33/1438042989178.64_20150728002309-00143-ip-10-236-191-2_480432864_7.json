The multiplexed signal transmitted via transmission line 200 is supplied to multiplexer 20 of the receiving station, which separates the multiplexed signal for each channel for emitting. The signal emitted by demultiplexer 20 is selected by switch 21 to be supplied to decoder 22 of subscriber 14 via subscriber line 300. At this time, the channel selective signal for switch 21 is supplied via line 2221 from the subscriber side, Decoder 22 decodes the mode signal and takes out the signal embedded within the mode signal during the coding which indicates whether the refresh was executed or not and, if the signal which was taken out indicates the execution of the refresh, then the decoding is carried out by using the intraframe correlation; otherwise, decoding is carried out by using the interframe correlation. The time-varying picture signal reproduced by decoder 22 is emitted via line 220. If, as in this embodiment, the channel is selected at the receiving office according to the request from subscriber 14 and the selected coding data is sent to subscriber 14, then the transmission rate (in this embodiment, 20 Mbps) between the station and the subscriber can be lower than that between the stations (in this embodiment, 40 Mbps), 26149=This is a continuation, of application Ser. No. 839,102, filed Feb. 19, 1992, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in greater detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the appended claims. Although, in the above description, the refresh is carried out once on a single frame, it is also possible to refresh per pixel or per single or any plurality of scanning lines according to the algorithm set to refresh control portion 5. FIG. 9 illustrates a case in which the refresh of each of channels A, B, C and D was carried out for each plurality of scanning lines. If, as described above, the refresh for a single frame is gradually executed for each plurality of scanning lines with a predetermined cycle over a plurality of frame time intervals, then the plurality of channels can be refreshed in a block because the amount of coded information for each frame can be prevented from abruptly increasing, compared with the case in which the refresh is carried out per unit of frame. In addition, although the foregoing described that the refresh is carried out with a predetermined cycle, as will be apparent from the principle of the present invention, if only the refresh of each channel is completed within a short period of time, then it does not matter whether its manner is cyclic or not; either case is effective.",
