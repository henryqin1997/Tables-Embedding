Thus, in Korea, study meetings on this topic have been organized, by private citizens, and a standard for protecting the body from the electromagnetic wave generated by the mobile phone and the like has been prepared. In USA, a standard for protecting the body from electromagnetic wave was prepared, and from 1999, the SAR of mobile phones with respect to the user's head portion (1.6 mW/g) is controlled tightly., 47318=[0001] This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 111(a) of International Application PCT/KR01/01454, with an international filing date of Aug. 29, 2001, now pending; which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 48188=[0005] Hereinafter, a \u201cmobile phone\u201d refers to, unless specified otherwise, various potable communicating equipments, which comprise the mobile phone and hand-set of wire phone used for mobile communications such as IMT2000, CDMA, PCS, TDMA, GSM, AMPS and the like.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0118] Therefore, since the present invention uses an antenna structure as described above and arranges the antenna inside of the mobile phone housing, and positions an electromagnetic wave absorber between the antenna and circuit board, the electromagnetic wave absorber can absorb the electromagnetic wave reflected form conductive plate constituting the circuit board. Thus, the present invention may eliminate or substantially lower the amount of the electromagnetic wave being absorbed by the body of users so that users may use the mobile phone without being exposed to hazardous electromagnetic wave. [0117] The present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments with particular applications. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope of the present invention. [0116] The mobile phone 480 according to the twenty-sixth embodiment has the same structure as the mobile phone 410 according to the nineteenth embodiment excepting for the positions of the electromagnetic wave absorber 486 and the antenna 487. In FIG. 32, reference numerals greater by 70 than used in FIG. 25 are used to designate the elements identical or corresponding to the elements of the 19th embodiment. Thus, explanation on the portions identical to the embodiment shown in FIG. 25 will be referred to the corresponding explanation relating to the 19th embodiment and omitted hereinafter.",
