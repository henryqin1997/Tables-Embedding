    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While only a single preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed herein for purposes of illustration, it is obvious that many variations and modifications could be made thereto. It is intended to cover all of these variations and modifications which fall within the scope of the present invention, as defined by the following claims: It will now be appreciated that the present invention relates to a balloon catheter with a distal end made entirely of soft, compliant material. A recess or pocket is formed between the catheter tube and the balloon that is adapted to receive the end of a rigid elongated introducer element. The distal end of the catheter and the end of the introducer element are then introduced and positioned within the bowel as a unit. After the distal end of the catheter is in position, the introducer element is detached from the catheter and withdrawn from the bowel. This leaves only soft, compliant parts within the body that cannot damage soft tissue even after extended time periods. While the catheter of the present invention is designed for use with an introducer element, as set forth above, it should be understood that instead of the introducer element, a finger could be used. In that instance, the fingertip is received within the recess between the tube and the balloon. The finger is used to insert and position the end of",
