It is therefore the task of the capacitor 48 to reduce the high self inductance and the accompanying high inductive resistance of capacitor 34. ______________________________________Standard Planar Magnetron Cathode:______________________________________Cathode length 750 mmCathode width 280 mmLH-power supply 30 kW______________________________________Dimensional arrangement of electrical components:______________________________________45 1 mH46 100 \u03a934 2 \u03bcF47 100 \u03a935 2 \u03bcF48 20 nF______________________________________ Embodiment according to FIG. 1 Finally, the task of capacitor 37 is to reduce or even completely eliminate the occurrence of random electrical flash-overs between target 32, 32' and the target surrounding, i.e. cathode base 31 and yoke 36. In order to obtain a long-term stable process, it is necessary to take measures which impede or even prevent a coating of anode 44 with an insulating layer. Capacitor 35 with its self-inductance and the capacitors and inductors of the supply lines 43, 41 also function as an oscillating circuit. This oscillating circuit is attenuated by resistor 47. When those surfaces of the anode 44 which are closest to the cathode are",
