Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof. It will be appreciated that the modular structure of the ball valve assemblies described enables a single design of ball valve to be used in a range of vehicles. The only requirement is that the internal shape of the end of the filler necks be substantially the same. The valve can also be used with filler necks made of any suitable material, including metals such as aluminum or other non-permeable materials such as plastics. FIG. 6 is a schematic depiction of a container 150 for a liquid, such as a fuel tank, having a ball valve closure 14 disposed in the upper end at the neck portion 10 of a fuel tank filler pipe 151. In order to assemble the closure into the neck 110 the restrictor 136 and nozzle seal 138 are inserted into the ball 118 which is then placed in the carrier 116 so that it is supported on the fixed trunnion 164. The annular trunnion member 168 and drive dog 176 are then inserted into the ball 118 through the aperture 170 in",
