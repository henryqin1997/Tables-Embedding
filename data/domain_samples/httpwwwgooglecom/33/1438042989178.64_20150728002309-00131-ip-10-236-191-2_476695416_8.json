The features of the subject matter of these documents disclosed in the preceding description, the patent claims and the drawing can be important individually as well as in any desired combination with one another for the realization of the various embodiments of the invention. a fixing of the sun gear 15 is provided, the bearings 20 for the motor shaft 13 have their type of construction designed such that in addition to the radial forces that are accommodated for the motor shaft mounting, axial forces are also absorbed and can be dissipated via the gearbox 14 into the axle housing. Disposed between the bearings 20 and the sun gear 15, on the motor shaft 13, are a bushing 30 as well as a spacer disk 31, which form an axial support for the sun gear 15 that adjoins the spacer disk 31; the sun gear 15 is fixed in position on the motor shaft 13 by a nut, as a fastening means 32, that is screwed onto",
