For instance, in 1992, ABB Power T & D Co., Inc. (ABB) designed its Alpha\u2122 meter which was the first commercially available wide voltage range solid state watthour meter. The Alpha\u2122 meter permitted the use of the same basic watthour meter for several different watthour meter applications. In particular, the Alpha\u2122 meter was capable of measuring the energy consumed by power systems having voltages varying from 120 Vrms to 480 Vrms.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will thus be seen the present invention provides a new and improved watthour meter system having a number of advantages and characteristics, including those pointed out herein and others which are inherent in the invention. Several preferred embodiments having been described by way of illustration, it is anticipated that modifications to the described forms of product will occur to those skilled in the art and that such modification and changes may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims. Outside of these modifications for this alternative embodiment of the present invention, the energy measuring system shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 is structurally and functionally similar to the energy measuring system shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. Referring again to FIGS. 2 and 4, the jumper 109a is shown having nodes that are electrically connected in an identical manner to that described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 3. The jumper 109a will typically be used in the electrical energy consumption measuring system 10a when that system is already connected to the secondary windings of voltage transformers external to meter box 12a rather than directly connected to the service voltage of the power lines, although those skilled in the art will appreciate that this need not be the case. On the other hand, the plug 106a and the plug 108a may be connected to each other",
