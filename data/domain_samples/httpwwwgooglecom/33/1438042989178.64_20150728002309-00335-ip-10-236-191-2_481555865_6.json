This can be by circuitry (not shown) which places a \"low\" BUSRFINH* signal on lead 174. This \"low\" signal immediately sets flip/flop 156 which, as described above, prevents the refresh cycle from occurring. The NMI input is normally held \"high\" by resistor 134 and positive voltage source 136. A \"low\" input to the NMI input of CPU 100 causes it to enter an interrupt processing cycle. In accordance with conventional interrupt processing procedure, CPU 100 fetches an interrupt vector which indicates an address at which the interrupt routine begins. In accordance with the invention, this interrupt vector is chosen to be in the bank of the memory which is not normally accessed so that the fetching of the interrupt vector causes a refresh operation to be performed after the forced memory access. Thus, a refresh operation is always performed before the critical refresh time of the memory bank is reached. The above sequence of operations describes the normal refresh cycle which is performed after a normal memory access cycle. However, when the inventive system is used with a memory having two or more memory banks it is possible that memory accesses may all be to one bank so that the critical refresh time limit can be exceeded in the other bank before a",
