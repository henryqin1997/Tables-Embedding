    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73349=The array elements were randomly amplified PCR (Bohlander, et al., 1992) products using physically mapped lambda clones of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA as templates (Riles, et al., 1993). The PCR was performed directly on the lambda phage lysates, resulting in an amplification of both the 35 kb lambda vector and the 5-15 kb yeast insert sequences in the form of a uniform distribution of PCR product between 250-1500 base pairs in length. The PCR product was purified using Sephadex G50 gel filtration (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) and concentrated by evaporation to dryness at room temperature overnight. Each of the 864 amplified lambda clones was rehydrated in 15 \u03bcl of 3\ufffdSSC in preparation for spotting onto the glass., 16829=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/261,388, filed Jun. 17, 1994, and now abandoned., 17485=Bohlander, et al., Genomics 13:1322-1324 (1992)., 17553=Drmanac, et al., Science 260:1649-1652 (1993)., 36559=A \"microarray\" is an array of regions having a density of discrete regions of at least about 100/cm2, and preferably at least about 1000/cm2. The regions in a microarray have typical dimensions, e.g., diameters, in the range of between about 10-250 \u03bcm, and are separated from other regions in the array by about the same distance., 18463=Southern, et al., Genomics 13:1008-1017 (1992)., 57616=The construction of substrate is shown cross-sectionally in FIG. 11, which is an enlarged sectional view taken along view line 124 in FIG. 9. The substrate includes a water-impermeable backing 126, such as a glass slide or rigid polymer sheet. Formed on the surface of the backing is a water-permeable film 128. The film is formed of a porous membrane material, such as nitrocellulose membrane, or a porous web material, such as a nylon, polypropylene, or PVDF porous polymer material. The thickness of the film is preferably between about 10 and 1000 \u03bcm. The film may be applied to the backing by spraying or coating uncured material on the backing, or by applying a preformed membrane to the backing. The backing and film may be obtained as a preformed unit from commercial source, e.g., a plastic-backed nitrocellulose film available from Schleicher and Schuell Corporation., 58513=With continued reference to FIG. 11, the film-covered surface in the substrate is partitioned into a desired array of cells by water-impermeable grid lines, such as lines 130, 132, which have infiltrated the film down to the level of the backing, and extend above the surface of the film as shown, typically a distance of 100 to 2000 \u03bcm above the film surface.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments and methods, it will be clear that various changes and modification may be made without departing from the invention. The oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescein, which was detected using an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase that precipitated an NBT/BCIP dye on the solid support (Amersham). Perfect matches between the labeled oligos and the M13 clones resulted in dark spots visible to the naked eye and detected using an optical scanner (HP ScanJet II) attached to a personal computer. The hybridization patterns are different in every quadrant indicating that each oligo found several unique M13 clones from among the 192 with a perfect sequence match. Note that the open capillary printing tip leaves detectable dimples on the nitrocellulose which can be used to automatically align and analyze the images. A sheet of plastic-backed nitrocellulose was gridded with barrier elements made from silicone rubber according to the description in Section IV-A. The sheet was soaked in 10\ufffdSSC and allowed to dry. As shown in FIG. 12, 192 M13 clones, each with a different yeast inserts were arrayed 400 microns apart in four quadrants of the solid support using the automated device described in Section III. The bottom left quadrant served as a negative control for hybridization, while each of the other three quadrants was hybridized simultaneously with a different oligonucleotide using the open-face hybridization technology described",
