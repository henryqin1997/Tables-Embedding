    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29862=As a motion compensated interframe prediction method for encoding moving pictures has been known a method in which prediction signals are generated by interpolating motion vectors at all pixel positions in a frame on the basis of motion vectors at plural predetermined representative points. Examples of this method are disclosed in \"Very Low Bitrate Video Coder using Warping Prediction\" by T. George Campbel, Eighth Image Coding Symposium (PCSJ93) of 1993, pp8-7 (document 1), in \"Motion Compensation for Video Compression using Control Grid Interpolation\" by Gray J. Sullivan and Richard L. Baker, The 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing: ICASSP91), M9.1 (document 2), and in \"A Basic Study on motion compensation with Triangles\" by Yuichiro Nakaya and Hiroshi Harashima, Technical Study Report of Image Engineering Research Group of Electronic Information Communication Engineering Society, IE90-106 (document 3). According to these methods, representative points are first set up in advance. After the motion vectors at these representative points are detected, an image is sectioned into triangular or quadrilateral cells (patches) by lines through which the representative points are linked to each other, and a motion vector at a pixel position in each cell (patch) is interpolated on the basis of the motion vectors detected at the corners (apexes) of the cell by a linear interpolation method. Finally, an interframe predicted value at each pixel is determined on the basis of the motion vectors thus obtained.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to the best mode embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions, and additions in the form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. As described above, according to the present invention, the frame is divided into plural areas, and the optimum prediction method can be adaptively selected on a divisional area basis. Therefore, the processing can be performed in accordance with the local image quality, and thus the prediction processing can be performed with high precision. Particularly when the frame partially contains a portion (image) which quickly moves (varies) or has a different motion from other portions, a motion vector prediction which is different from that of the other portions can be performed by selecting the optimum method from plural methods, so that the image reproduction can be performed accurately. In the means 402 for selecting the method of setting the prediction value for every noted area, on the basis of the prediction result of the means 108 and the means 401, it is adaptively judged for every area to select which one of the two methods should be used to set the prediction value, and an interframe prediction image is generated according to the selected method. Next, the means according",
