It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made in the form and details of the described embodiments resulting in equivalent embodiments that remain within the scope of the appended claims. A primary advantage of the embodiment as described in the present patent document over prior solutions lies in the fact that the system is scalable to systems comprising computers in excess of a few hundred. It collects complete information because it intercepts all calls relating to file operations but has minimal impact on system performance. Following the initialization phase, it does not have to scan each file because it is inserted into the normal flow of file operations from applications to the file system. The system has immediate information regarding any changes to files. Further, it can collect performance information on a per file basis. It is fast and scalable to many systems. The system and methods disclosed in the present patent document provide techniques for intercepting calls to the operating system that modify files. These calls are typically open, close, read, write, and file creation. Mechanisms exist on both Windows and Unix Operating Systems that allow applications to intercept such calls. The system records relevant information",
