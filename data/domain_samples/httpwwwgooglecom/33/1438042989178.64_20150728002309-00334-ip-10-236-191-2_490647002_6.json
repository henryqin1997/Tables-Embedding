The leading edge of the safety gate 10 and its pivot corner 10c are reinforced by means of a vertical angle 27 which is engaged against the inner sides of the main panel 10b and of the vertical side flange 10a, as can be seen in FIGS. 3 and 4. The leg portions 27a and 27b of the angle 27 are much heavier than the sheet metal gauge of the deep-drawn safety gate frame. The transverse leg portion 27b of the angle 27 is set back from the inner vertical edge of the safety gate side flange 10a, but reaches to the level of the pivot loop 17a of the actuating lever 17, thereby securing the latter on the pivot noses 28. The position of the actuating lever 17 is additionally secured by the fact that its inclined leg portion 17d reaches into contact, or near-contact, with the side flange 10a. The small angle \u03b1 with which the trigger edge 12e of the contact bar 12 attacks the inclined leg portion 17d of the actuating lever 17 assures a smooth and rebound-free driving engagement between the two parts. Additionally, the knee-shaped second",
