    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35992=The source/drain implant is preferably a zero degree tilt angle implant using a P-type dopant (for example, BF2) wherein the implantation dose is about 5\ufffd1014 -5\ufffd1015 ions/cm2 with an implantation energy of about 20-40 keV. In the above manner, the drain 70 and the source 72 are formed as heavily doped P+ regions. In the above manner, the partially completed transistor 50 of FIG. 5 is formed., 39744=The preferred concentration dose for the large tilt angle implant preferably depends upon the implant species used. The dose may preferably range between 10 to 30 percent of the amorphizing dose at room temperature for the respective species (therefore the large tilt angle is a sub-amorphous implant). For example, a silicon dose of 2\ufffd1014 -6\ufffd1014 ions/cm2 may be used when the silicon amorphizing dose is 2\ufffd1015 ions/cm2 at room temperature. The amorphizing doses at room temperature for germanium and indium are 4\ufffd1014 and 1\ufffd1014 ions/cm2, respectively. The dose range to be used for germanium may be 4 \ufffd1013 to 1.2\ufffd1014 ions/cm2 and for indium the dose range may be 1\ufffd1013 to 3\ufffd103 ions/cm2. Although the concentration doses highlighted above are preferred depending upon which implant species is utilized, it should be understood that a wide range of doses may be utilized and are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention. The energy and dose of the implant for the interstitial regions 62 is sub-amorphous to supply the interstitials at the desired location to enhance lateral diffusion (as will be discussed in greater detail infra).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain preferred embodiment or embodiments, it is obvious that equivalent alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the annexed drawings. In particular regard to the various functions performed by the above described components (assemblies, devices, circuits, etc.), the terms (including a reference to a \"means\") used to describe such components are intended to correspond, unless otherwise indicated, to any component which performs the specified function of the described component (i.e., that is functionally equivalent), even though not structurally equivalent to the disclosed structure which performs the function in the herein illustrated exemplary embodiments of the invention. In addition, while a particular feature of the invention may have been disclosed with respect to only one of several embodiments, such feature may be combined with one or more other features of the other embodiments as may be desired and advantageous for any given or particular application. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the step of performing the sub-amorphous large tilt angle implant may occur prior to the source/drain implant. One advantage of performing the large tilt angle implant first is that when the source/drain implant is subsequently performed, the drain 70 and the source 72 junctions may be more shallow since the sub-amorphous implant creates enough damage near the surface of",
