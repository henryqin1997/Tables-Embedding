In current systems, when a user requests a database asset from a database, a copy of the database asset is sent to the user's computer and can be cached on the user's hard disk drive. When the user accesses or modifies the database asset, he/she, in some applications, accesses the cached file on the hard drive and not the database asset stored on the database. Again, because the file is accessed from the hard disk drive and not over a relatively slow network connection, the file can be accessed and modified much more quickly. When the user has completed work on the cached file, the cached filed can be reconciled or synchronized with the file on the database. For example, in the manner described in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/033,242, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,062,515, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF A FILE IN A CACHE,\u201d filed Dec. 28, 2001, by inventors David Thomas and Scott Wells (the \u201cSynchronization Application\u201d), which is hereby fully incorporated by reference., 22704=The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.
