No. 60/031,926, entitled \u201cParallel Global Directory and File Navigation System\u201d and filed on Nov. 27, 1996 now abandoned., 113105=Similarly, the virtual directory system allows a user to store all of the files on the computer system in a single directory, if desired. This can be accomplished because the virtual directory system is only keeping track of file attribute information for particular files\u2014not the file data itself. Hence, with a database, the virtual directory system can easily keep track of the file attribute information for every file encountered in the computer system. Hence, the virtual directory system can provide a single directory where all of the user's files are \u201cvirtually\u201d stored and which can be easily searched rather than needing to search through the computer systems entire directory system. This benefit can easily be appreciated given the sheer volume of files with which a computer system comes into contact over its lifetime. For example, consider a computer system that has a floppy drive in which 100 floppies are used over its lifetime, a hard drive which stores three thousand files throughout 250 subdirectories, five ZIP disks used on a ZIP drive which each store 1000 files, a tape backup system which stores thousands more files, a CD ROM drive which uses 10 CD ROMs, each storing thousands of files, and an Internet connection which can access an Internet storage site where hundreds of thousands of files are stored. The search for a file that you know you encountered 5 years ago, but don't remember where, would be a Herculean task. Yet, with the virtual directory system, all of the file information for those thousands of files can appear in a single directory which can be easily searched., 169040=As another example, a hierarchical directory path might be expressed as \u201cc:\\document\\patentapp.doc\u201d. Within the native file system patentapp.doc is the entity that is accessed for the data. Imagine within the virtual directory system that it contains the path \u201cc:\\document\\patentapp.doc\u201d and it has a time and date associated with it of 11/1/96 12:01 p.m., just as it exists on the c: storage device. In this case, the virtual directory system may also have two other entries for this file because the user wished to ensure that there were multiple copies of this important document. The virtual directory system may also contain entries for \u201czipdisk1\\document\\patentapp.doc\u201d with a date associated with it of 10/31/96 09:00 a.m., and another instance of \u201czipdisk2\\document\\patentapp.doc\u201d with a date of 11/1/96 12:01 p.m. If the user wished to see all instances of .doc files the virtual directory system could then provide three unique paths to the file consisting of \u201c\\document\\patentapp.doc\\111/96 12:01 p.m.\\c:\u201d, \u201c\\document\\patentapp.doc\\11/1/96 12:01 p.m.\\zipdisk2\u201d and finally \u201cdocument\\patentapp.doc\\10/31/96 09:00 a.m.\\zipdisk1\u201d. Methods for converting time/date representations to suit the requirements for the native file systems path can, of course, also be tailored as needed. An important feature in this regard may be the virtual directory system's ability to dynamically resolve the uniqueness requirement of a hierarchical directory by altering the directory element attributes that are presented to the native file system during the find first, find next directory query sequence., 186830=Once the basic principles of the invention are understood, the actual implementation of it should be fairly straightforward to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The currently preferred implementation is as an ancillary capability to a standard operating system, such as the Windows\u2122 95 system. As such, by utilizing readily available source books for programming, operating systems, and database management (such as, the Win 32 DDK, the Win 32 SDK, and the references \u201cInside Windows\u2122 95\u201d by Adrian King as published by Microsoft\u2122 Press, Copyright 1994; \u201cSystems Programming for Windows\u2122 95\u201d by Walter Oney as published by Microsoft\u2122 Press, Copyright 1996; and Inside the Windows\u2122 95 File System by Stan Mitchell, Copyright 1997 which are hereby incorporated by reference) the software embodiments might be accomplished without undue experimentation.}",

The reader should be aware that the specific discussion may not explicitly describe all embodiments possible; many alternatives are implicit. Where the invention is described in method or result-oriented terminology, each function of the invention would be achieved by an apparatus element be it hardware or software-based. Apparatus claims may not only be included for the device described, but also method or process claims may be included to address the functions the invention and each element performs. Equivalent, broader, and more generic terms are implicit in the prior description of each element. Such terms can be substituted were desired to make explicit the implicitly broad coverage to which this invention is entitled. Further, it should be understood that a variety of changes may be made without departing from the essence of the invention. Such changes are also implicitly included in the description. They still fall within the scope of this invention. A broad disclosure encompassing both the explicit embodiment(s) shown, the great variety of implicit alternative embodiments, and the broad methods or processes and the like are encompassed by this disclosure. As should be readily apparent, the invention might be characterized in a variety of different and independent manners.
