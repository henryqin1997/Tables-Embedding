    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17771=What happens in any event is that when the beetle is placed on a vertical, or at least steeply inclined surface, two of the sticky material regions will come into contact with the surface. The sticky material regions temporarily adhere to the surface, in a similar manner known for example and described in UK patent No. 2222958, until the influence of gravity overcomes the stiction to release one or both the sticky regions from the surface. At this time the beetle moves down the surface. In accordance with embodiments of present invention, the actual movement of beetle is to some extent random although it depends on the orientation of the beetle. If the longitudinal axis of the body 10 of the beetle is vertical, the beetle will \"walk\" down the surface in a generally straight line. If the longitudinal axis of the body 10 is horizontal, the beetle will \"tumble\" down the surface, rolling around the longitudinal axis. For other orientations, especially where the longitudinal axis is about 45\ufffd to the vertical, the beetle may \"walk\" or may \"tumble\" providing a unique and interesting performance for the toy. It will be appreciated that because the configuration and the relative movement of its limbs is not precise and because the stiction and the imperfections in the surface cannot be wholly predicted, the beetle will not normally \"walk\" or \"tumble\" in a totally predictable way, even if it starts with its longitudinal axis vertical or horizontal. This means that the movement of the beetle down the surface tends to be generally unpredictable, combining a mixture of walking and tumbling which provides excitement and fascination during play., 12933=The invention relates more especially to so-called \"wall-walkers\" that move down an inclined plane, including a vertical surface, under the action of gravity. An example of such a toy is found in UK patent specification No. 2222958. The toys have sticky limbs that temporarily hold the ends of limbs against a supporting surface.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Whereas a beetle has been described various other insects, or any other figurines generally, can be provided in accordance with the invention and in which movement down a surface during play is usually a generally random combination of walking and tumbling. The sticky material is preferably Styrene Ethylene Butylene Styrerie Triblock Copolymer (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,369,284) or Hydrogenated Styrene Isoprene/Butadiene Block Copolymer. The sticky material can be moulded with or without a tackifier to increase its stickiness so as to achieve the desired performance, especially speed of movement, which is proportional to the weight of the toy and the adhesiveness of the vertical surface. Before the half axles or pieces are connected together, they are placed in identical moulds and the sticky material regions 21 and 22 or 23 and 24 are moulded onto the extremities of the limbs as required. In an alternative arrangement, the extremities are provided with eyelets 33, as shown in FIG. 12, and the sticky material separately formed as inserts 34 shown in FIG. 13. During assembly the inserts 34 are pressed through the eyelets 33 to become secured to extremities of the limbs as required. This can be done conveniently before the two half axles or pieces are connected together. Referring again to FIG. 4, it will be noted that each \"half\" axle 25 and 26 and integrally formed limbs 17 and 18, and 19 and 20 are configured",
