Equivalents Finally, the pixel and line replication process is repeated 566 for each line of scaled video data received by the DECspind application. When the DECspind application is done 564 reconstructing the entire scaled video frame, the reconstructed frame is made available for display 568 by the DECspind application. It should be noted that an analogous reconstruction technique that replicates pixels along a vertical column as just described for pixels along a horizontal line, and replicates and shifts vertical pixel columns as just described for horizontal lines, produces similar results. The DECspind application displays the reconstructed video frame in a DECspind application window synchronized to the audio data stream in a manner described above. Next, when an entire line of pixels has been reconstructed, that line is replicated 560, shifted 562 by one pixel and stored as the next adjacent vertical line in the reconstructed video frame. For example, as shown in FIG. 28(c), the reconstructed pixels from the first horizontal line (V=1) are replicated to the second horizontal line (V=2) and shifted by 1 pixel to the right. Thus, for example pixel (1,1)",
