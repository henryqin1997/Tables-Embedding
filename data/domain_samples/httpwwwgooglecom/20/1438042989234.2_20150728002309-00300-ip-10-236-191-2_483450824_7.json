Since the reactive groups can be determined titrimetrically, exactly adjusted stoichiometric mixture proportions can be obtained. Preferably the equivalent ratio of CH-azide to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated groups is 2:1 to 1:2, especially about 0.75:1 to 1.25:1. This usually results in an adequate density of cross-linking., 59780=An activator was prepared as per EP-A-0 310 011, Example A10. To this end, 2090.1 g of methane tricarboxylic acid triethyl ester, 709.7 g of butanediol-1,4 and 450.0 g of a polycaprolactone diol with a molecular weight of 400 g/mol were mixed and heated under nitrogen to 125\ufffd to 135\ufffd C. for 7 hours. A total of 697.5 g of ethanol were distilled off. The residue was 2552.3 g of a colourless viscous liquid having an equivalent weight of 300 g/mol and a weight average molecular weight (Mw; polystyrene standard) of 8300 g/mol., 29759=In these known prepolymers the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydrogen atoms reacting with NCO is 1.05 to 10:1, preferably 1.1 to 3:1, the hydrogen atoms preferably originating from hydroxyl groups., 23680=B) one or more (meth)acrylate copolymers, polyester resins and/or polyurethane resins suitable for Michael addition, comprising \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated groups bonded via the carbonyl carbon atom of carbonyl, ester and/or amide groups, with a C\u2550C equivalent weight of 85-1800 and a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 170-50000. In the coating agent, the equivalent ratio of component A) to component B) is 2:1 to 1:2. The coating agent, which is a subject of the invention, contains a solvent and/or water. It can contain conventional lacquer additives. Optionally it also contains one or more pigments., 38654=The activator component A2 used according to the invention, depending on the nature of the polyol or polycarboxylic acid component, can be a relatively viscous liquid or a solid which is substantially soluble at least in conventional lacquer solvents and preferably contains less than 5 wt. % more particularly less than 1 wt. % of cross-linked components. The CH equivalent weight, which measures the proportion of groups (I) or structural units (I')/(II\") in (A2), is usually between 100 and 5000, preferably 200 and 2000, and the average molecular weight Mw is usually between 1000 and 100000, preferably between 2000 and 50000 (determined by gel chromatography; polystyrene standard). Methods of preparing these compounds are described in detail in EP-A-0 310 011., 62162=A lacquer structure was then produced as follows: a metal sheet primed with KTL (20 \u03bcm) and pre-coated with a commercial filler (35 \u03bcm) was coated with conventional water-based lacquer (a dry layer thickness of 15 \u03bcm) and pre-dried at 60\ufffd C. in a circulating-air oven for 5 minutes. The aforementioned clear lacquer was then adjusted with 1:1 xylene/Solvesso 150 to a spray viscosity of 30 sec (DIN beaker 4, 20\ufffd C.) and applied in a dry layer thickness of 35 \u03bcm. After ventilation at room temperature for 7 minutes, the base lacquer and the clear lacquer were stored together at 130\ufffd C. (object temperature) for 20 minutes., 64073=Component A and component B were mixed while warm in the weight ratio of A:B=35:45. Next, 2.5 wt. % of a commercial emulsifier based on sorbitan fatty acid ester (ICI, G 1350) was added while warm and thoroughly homogenised. 60 parts of this mixture were slowly and vigorously agitated in 40 parts of completely demineralised water (40\ufffd C.). After thorough homogenisation, the resulting substance was cooled with agitation. The resulting dispersion had a solids content of about 50 wt. %., 17954=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/960,490 filed on Oct. 9, 1992, the text of which is hereby incorporated by reference and now abandoned., 24784=It is surprising that the coating agent according to the invention can harden without catalysts, since it is taken for granted by the skilled man that Michael addition processes occur only in the presence of basic catalysts (see e.g. \"Oranicum\", VEB DEUTSCHER VERLAG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN; BERLIN 1977, page 632)., 49821=The component (B) can also be a mixture of the aforementioned compounds. The C\u2550C equivalent weight of component (B) is preferably about 85 to 1800, preferably 180 to 1200, and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) is e.g. about 170 to 50000, preferably 500 to 30000. Preferably the component (B) has an OH number below 350, particularly preferably between 30 and 200., 61034=After distilling off 110 g of xylene in vacuo, 560 g butyl acetate was added. The resin solution had a solids content of 50%, C\u2550C equivalent weight: 1280 g/mol., 60544=A binder was prepared as per EP-A-0 310 011, Example B. To this end, 1000 parts of a glycidyl group-containing acrylate resin manufactured from styrene, glycidyl methacrylate and dimethyl maleinate (epoxy equivalent weight 510) were dissolved in 680 parts of xylene at 70\ufffd C., followed by addition of 127 parts of acrylic acid and 1 part of tetraethylammonium bromide. The mixture was then agitated in a stream of air at 80\ufffd C. until the acid number was less than unity.}",

An independent test was made as before, except that the water used was adjusted to a spray viscosity of 30 sec (DIN beaker 4, 20\ufffd C.). The resulting solution was applied by spraying. The dry layer thickness was 30 \u03bcm as before. After ventilation at room temperature for 5 minutes, the lacquer was stoved at 150\ufffd C. for 20 minutes. The result was a hard glossy surface. The clear lacquer adhered firmly to the substrate and gave a good result in the acid test. The binder dispersion, adjusted with water to a solids content of 40 wt. %, was applied with a doctor blade to a metal sheet pre-coated with KTL, filler and water-based lacquer as in Example 3. The dry layer thickness was 30 \u03bcm. After ventilation at room temperature for 10 minutes, the coated substrate was stoved at 150\ufffd C. for 20 minutes.
