The control unit 18 has a pair of steering knobs 20 and 22 for deflecting the endoscope tip in the upwards-downwards direction and in the left-right direction, respectively. An elongated flexible insertion tube 24 extends from the control unit and has at its tips a viewing head 26 that contains illuminating and video pick-up devices. Just to the proximal side of the viewing head 26 is a steering section 28 of the cable-actuated type of which an example is shown in FIG. 2. It is noted that many such steering mechanisms exist, as described in the patents identified earlier. Endoscopes of this general design are described e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re 31,289 and Re 31,290 each of June 28, 1983.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail with reference to a preferred embodiment, it should be recognized that the invention is not limited only to that embodiment, but that many modifications and variations thereof would be apparent to those of skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. With the preferred embodiment described above, steering slack or play is removed, whenever no steering forces exist in cables 34, 36, by motion of the slider plate 56 and shoes 68, 70 distally under the force of reset spring 66. A modification of this preferred embodiment contains stop 72 that is positioned on the rail 54 distally of the slider plate 56. The spring 66 is preloaded by the stop such that the spring force exceeds the usual or typical steering forces that would be encountered by the steering cables 34 and 36. With this modification, steering slack or play will exist, and the mechanism 50 would not be actuated until all this cable slack is used up, which would occur if the insertion tube 24 is tightly coiled, e.g., for storage or shipment. When the insertion tube is completely uncoiled, the steering behaves as through the mechanism 50 were not present. From this point, steering in the downward direction first reduces the force on the upper cable 34 and sheath 42. This relieves the",
