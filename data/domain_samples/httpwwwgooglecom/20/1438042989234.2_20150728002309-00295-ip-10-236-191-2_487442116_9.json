For example, administration of certain live probiotic bacteria can help restore optimal intestinal flora in animals such as cattle, especially after stressful situations such as transport to a feedlot. Gedek, B., \"Probiotics in Animal Feeding--Effects on Performance and Animal Health,\" Feed Magazine, Nov., 1987. With regular administration, probiotic bacteria also increase nutrient absorption efficiency and help control the proliferation of harmful microorganisms in the animals' digestive tracts that could otherwise cause disease conditions adversely affecting rates of animal development and weight gain. A bacterial species commonly administered to cattle for such purposes is Lactobacillus acidophilus, an anaerobic, lactic acid producer. Klaenhammer, T. R. (1982) \"Microbiological Considerations in Selection and Preparation of Lactobacillus Strains for Use as Dietary Adjuncts,\" J. Dairy Sci. 65: 1339-1349. An example of such a product is \"Cobactin,\" a lyophilized L. acidophilus formulation from Biotechniques Laboratories, Inc., Redmond, Wash., 21382=This application is a continuation of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having illustrated and described the principles of the invention in a principal and several alternative embodiments, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. I claim all modifications coming within the spirit and scope of the following claims. Both the system of FIG. 2 and that of FIG. 3 are capable of delivering small, accurate dosages of live bacteria in liquid suspension on a regular basis and on demand to large numbers of livestock, such as cattle in commerical feedlots, when the concentrated suspension is first diluted with an aqueous liquid carrier and then intermixed with the animals' feed rations. The concentration and volume of dilute bacterial suspension contained in mix tank 211 can be carefully tailored to ensure that the entire amount of feed to which the dilute bacterial suspension is added is uniformly coated wih bacteria without wasting excess liquid. Further, the concentration of bacteria in the dilute suspension contained in mix tank 211 can be carefully tailored to such variables as the total mass or volume of feed, average feed granule size, particle density, and surface area, and amount of feed normally consumed by each animal at a single feeding, to optimize the bacterial dosage each animal receives at a feeding. In either of the above first and second embodiments, the entire process, from dispensing concentrated",
