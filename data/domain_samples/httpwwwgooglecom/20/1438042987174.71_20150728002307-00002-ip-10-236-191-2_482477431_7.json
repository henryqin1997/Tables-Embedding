    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{97985=Using the combined signal waveforms 1204, 1205, 1207, 1208, 1211-1214 illustrated in FIG. 12, the present invention recognizes that four different signals can be applied simultaneously to four different rows of a CLC display, without any crosstalk. One, or more, rows can be initialized at the same time that another row is being addressed. Thus, the addressing stage for every row can immediately follow the initialization stage for that row. An advantage of the bi-polar multi-row initialization technique is that every pixel can have the same \"dynamic\" and \"static\" display times. The dynamic display time is defined as the time during which the pixel is being driven by an electrical field, and the static display time is defined as the time during which the pixel is not being driven; i.e. the pixel is in a stable cholesteric phase., 95084=The first row of FIG. 12 illustrates exemplary waveforms 1201, 1202 for column electrode addressing signals corresponding to \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states. The waveform 1203 illustrates an exemplary addressing pulse that is applied to the row electrode of a selected row of pixels. The waveform 1204 illustrates the combined pulse applied to a pixel in the selected row that is to be driven to the \"ON\" state; the waveform 1205 illustrates the combined pulse applied to a pixel that is to be maintained in the predominantly focal-conic (\"OFF\") state. In order to drive a pixel \"OFF\", or \"ON\", the addressing signal applied to a row electrode for a selected row must be in phase or out of phase, respectively, with the addressing signal applied to a pixel's column electrode. The \"waveform\" 1206 is a zero voltage applied to the row electrode of each non-selected row. The waveforms 1207, 1208 illustrate the combined pulses applied to each pixel in a non-selected row. Because the amplitude of the pulses 1207, 1208 are below the CLC threshold voltage Vt, the pulses will not affect the state of the pixels., 90444=The addressing method may preferably use the conventional practice of selectively applying \"data\" signals to column electrodes and \"scan\" signals to row electrodes; as used herein, both \"data\" signals and \"scan\" signals are components of \"addressing\" signals. A CLC display frame can be completely addressed by sequentially activating each row of pixels with a scan signal 1103 while selectively applying data signals 1101, 1102 for each pixel in a selected row to the column electrodes; the pixels in a row being driven by a combined bi-polar pulse 1105/1106 having an amplitude of Vr or Vs during addressing of the selected row. If the state of a pixel is to be changed, the data signal applied to the column containing the pixel has an amplitude of Vr ; otherwise, the data signal has an amplitude of Vs., 91942=The general approach to driving a passive-matrix CLC display using the frame initialization driving technique can be summarized as: frame initialization and row-to-row addressing. All pixels in a frame are simultaneously initialized to a predominantly focal-conic state by two pulse sequences as described with reference to FIGS. 8-10. During the initialization stage, all of the rows in a frame are selected, and each pixel is driven by a first sequence of pulses to change from a cholesteric phase to a field-induced nematic phase; a second sequence of pulses driving each pixel to a cholesteric-phase predominantly focal-conic state. To initialize a total frame may only require several milliseconds. In the addressing stage, an addressing signal 1103 (FIG. 11) having an amplitude Vr is applied to the row electrode for the selected row. Depending on the desired state of each pixel in the selected row, the signal applied to the column electrodes are either an \"ON\" waveform 1101 or \"OFF\" waveform 1102 as shown in FIG. 11. Each pixel in a selected row is driven by the combination of signals applied to the row and column electrodes. A non-selected row driving signal 1104 is applied to each row other than the row currently being addressed. The amplitude of the combined bi-polar pulses applied to each pixel in a non-selected row is always below the threshold voltage Vt, and thus there is no effect on the state of the pixels in a non-selected row. The stability of the CLC cholesteric phase maintains the image on the display until initialization of the next frame. In some applications, an idle period may be required between frame initializations to improve the contrast ratio of the display. The time between each frame initialization is the frame driving time; the reciprocal of the driving time is the frame rate., 98863=Referring again to FIG. 6, those skilled in the art will recognize that a CLC can be driven from a light-reflective planar to a light-scattering focal-conic state by applying a pulse having an appropriate amplitude, and vice versa. As noted supra, U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,863, issued to West, et al. on Sep. 26, 1995, discloses the use of signals of varying electrical magnitudes to transform the CLC from focal-conic to planar states, and vice versa; a continuum of signal magnitudes being used to drive the CLC to intermediate \"gray scale\" states. The portion of a typical CLC electro-optical response curve corresponding to the intermediate (i.e. gray scale) states has a steep slope; i.e. the portion of the curve corresponds to a narrow voltage range over which signals of varying electrical magnitudes can be used to drive a CLC to different intermediate states. Because the voltage range is typically narrow, a principal disadvantage of the method disclosed by West, et al. is that it is difficult to precisely drive the CLC to a preferred intermediate state. Furthermore, the electro-optical response curve of a CLC will shift to the left or right with variations in the cell gap (i.e. the thickness of the CLC). Because the portion of a typical CLC electro-optical response curve corresponding to the intermediate (i.e. gray scale) states has a steep slope, even a slight shift in the curve will cause a particular drive voltage to produce different intermediate states in pixels having slightly different cell gaps. The present invention recognizes that a gray scale CLC display can be realized by applying a single pulse, or sequence of pulses, having a fixed predetermined amplitude; each successive pulse causing a progressive change in the state of the CLC. Thus, the method disclosed herein for driving a CLC display does not rely on the use of signals of varying electrical magnitudes to realize a gray scale display, but employs pulses having a fixed predetermined amplitude whereby each gray scale level (i.e. intermediate state) is a function of a duration of the pulses., 103345=The gray scale state of each pixel is determined by the ratio of the duration T2 of the sequence of pulses 1301 to the predetermined addressing time T. The amplitude of the sequence of pulses (or single pulse) 1301 is equal to the phase change voltage Vr, for the specific CLC employed, that corresponds to a single addressing pulse having a pulse width of T; i.e. if a pulse of duration T and amplitude Vr is applied to the CLC, the CLC will transition to the nematic phase. The number of distinct gray scale states is determined by the frequency of the address pulses; e.g. if eight pulses can occur during time T, then an eight-level gray scale for each pixel can be realized., 91365=In order to maintain the states of all pixels in non-selected rows, the following formula should be satisfied to determine an appropriate driving pulse 1104 for non-selected rows: ##EQU1## From this requirement, it is clear that the voltage Vr is limited by: Vr <2 Vt +Vs. For an appropriate driving pulse 1104 having an amplitude Vn, the state of a pixel in a non-selected row will not be changed, regardless of whether column driving signal 1101 or 1102 is applied to the pixel's column electrode., 102415=FIG. 13 illustrate an exemplary addressing waveform pulse sequence for a gray-scale CLC driving apparatus and method according to the principles of the present invention. The duration of the two pulse sequences 1301, 1302 is equal to a predetermined addressing time T, which is equal to or greater than the time necessary to drive a pixel from a predominantly focal-conic state to a predominantly planar state; if the desired pixel state is intermediate these states, a sequence of pulses 1302 having an amplitude which has no effect on the pixel's state is applied ahead of the sequence of pulses 1301 having an amplitude sufficient to cause a change in state. T1 is the duration of the lower-voltage pulse sequence and T2 is the duration of the higher-voltage pulse sequence; those skilled in the art will recognize that the order of applying pulse sequences 1301, 1302 may be reversed., 57884=U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,863, issued to West, et al. on Sep. 26, 1995, discloses the use of signals of varying electrical magnitudes to transform the CLC from focal-conic to planar states, and vice versa; a continuum of signal magnitudes being used to drive the CLC to intermediate \"gray scale\" states. As hereinafter described, the portion of a typical CLC electro-optical response curve corresponding to the intermediate (i.e. gray scale) states has a steep slope; i.e. the portion of the curve corresponds to a narrow voltage range over which signals of varying electrical magnitudes can be used to drive a CLC to different intermediate states. Because the voltage range is typically narrow, a principal disadvantage of the method disclosed by West, et al. is that it is difficult to precisely drive the CLC to a preferred intermediate state. Furthermore, the electro-optical response curve of a CLC will shift to the left or right with variations in the cell gap (i.e. the thickness of the CLC). Because the portion of a typical CLC electro-optical response curve corresponding to the intermediate (i.e. gray scale) states has a steep slope, even a slight shift in the curve will cause a particular drive voltage to produce different intermediate states in pixels having slightly different cell gaps., 97677=where N is a positive integer. The signals illustrated in FIG. 12 are for the case where N is equal to 1. When N=1, the phase difference between the initialization signals 1209, 1210 applied to the row electrodes and the signals 1201, 1202 applied to the column electrodes must equal 90\ufffd., 96284=In accordance with the principles of the present invention, each pixel must be initialized prior to being addressed. The waveforms 1209, 1210 in FIG. 12 illustrate a first and second sequence of signals (described supra), respectively, that are applied to the row electrodes of each row of pixels that is to be initialized. The waveforms 1211, 1212 and 1213, 1214 illustrate the combined signals applied to each pixel during the first and second sequence of initialization signals, respectively. The voltages V and V1 for the row initialization signals 1209, 1210 are selected such that the amplitudes of the first and second sequence of combined initialization signals drive each pixel to a nematic phase and, subsequently, to a predominantly focal-conic state, as described supra., 97097=The frequency of the signals 1201, 1202 applied to the column electrodes preferably have the same frequency as the addressing signals 1203, 1206 that are applied to the row electrodes. The frequency of the signals 1209, 1210 for the initialization stage, denoted as fi, and the frequency of the addressing signals 1203, 1206, denoted as fa , however, can be different, provided the following relationship is satisfied:, 105182=Turning now to FIG. 15, illustrated is an exemplary apparatus for employing the above-described method for driving a CLC display according to the principles of the present invention. FIG. 15 illustrates a driving apparatus 1510 coupled to a CLC panel 1540. In one embodiment, the CLC panel 1540 includes a plurality of controllable display elements 1545-1, 1545-2, 1545-3, 1545-n (e.g. pixels) defined by a matrix of row and column electrodes (not shown). The driving apparatus includes a data circuit 1520 that is coupled to the column electrodes and a scan circuit 1530 that is coupled to the row electrodes of CLC panel 1540. The data circuit 1520 and scan circuit 1530 selectively apply the initialization and addressing signals disclosed hereinabove to the CLC panel 1540, the signals applied to the column electrodes cooperating with the signals applied to the row electrodes to selectively drive each controllable display element 1545 from a predominantly focal-conic state to a predominantly planar state, and intermediate states therebetween. The principles of the present invention are not limited to a particular embodiment of the driving apparatus 1510, except to the extent that data circuit 1520 and scan circuit 1530 must be suitably operative to generate initialization and addressing signals in accordance with the principles of the present invention., 57297=Two approaches may be taken to increase the frame rate of conventional CLC displays. One approach, disclosed by Bao-Gang Wu, et al. in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/445,181, filed on May 19, 1995 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,533 (commonly assigned with the present application), incorporated herein by reference, is to improve the state transition characteristics of the CLC material by modifying the texture of the material. A second approach is to improve the method by which electrical drive signals are used to control the state transitions of the CLC.}",

Turning now to FIG. 16-A, illustrated is the effect of temperature on the phase change voltage Vr of an exemplary CLC, for a driving time of 5 ms. As can be seen, the phase change voltage Vr increases with decreasing temperature. Referring to FIG. 16-B, which illustrates the effect of temperature on the required driving time for an applied voltage of 40 volts, it can be seen that the driving time rises exponentially with decreasing temperature. Thus, in order to realize full-motion video frame rates at low temperatures, employing the driving methods disclosed hereinabove, the effects of temperature on display driving time can be compensated for by increasing the driving voltage. A feedback mechanism, which senses the temperature of the CLC display, can be employed to provide a temperature compensation signal to the driving apparatus, which can appropriately increase, or decrease, the amplitude of the initialization and addressing signals; alternatively, although less desirable for most applications, the driving apparatus can appropriately increase, or decrease, the duration of the driving signals to compensate for variations in display temperature.
