(Cl. 128215) This invention relates to an anesthetic device, and, more particularly, to a catheter useful in the practice of cervical anesthesia., 11086=In the illustration given and with particular reference to FIG. 1, the numeral designates generally a hypodermic syringe equipped with the usual barrel 11 terminating in a pointed cannula 12 and also equipped with Patented Mar. 14, 1967 a plunger 13 and finger-supporting portions 14. Arranged in ensleeved relation over the cannula 12 is the catheter-like conduit generally designated 15 and which can be seen in larger scale in FIG. 2 and exploded view in FIG. 5. The distal end of the conduit 15 is tapered as at 16 (see also FIG. 4). The conduit 15 is itself ensleeved by a penetration-limiting cannula 17, each of the cannulae being equipped with adapters as at 12a and 17a, respectively Additionally, the cannula 17 has a penetration-limiting hub 17b.}",
