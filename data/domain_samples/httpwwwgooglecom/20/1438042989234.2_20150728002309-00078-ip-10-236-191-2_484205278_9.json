These investigators reported that the increased glomerular basement membrane thickness, a major structural abnormality characteristic of end-stage diabetic renal disease, was prevented with aminoguanidine., 22583=More recently, other advanced glycosylation products have been identified, such as Farmar et al., U.S. Ser. No. 097,856, filed Sep. 17, 1987; pyrraline (Hayase et al., \"Aging of Proteins: Immunological Detection of a Glucose-derived Pyrrole Formed during Maillard Reaction in Vivo\", J. Biol. Chem., 263, pp. 3758-3764 (1989)), pentosidine (Sell, D. and Monnier V. \"Structure Elucidation of a Senescence Cross-link from Human Extracellular Matrix\" J. Biol. Chem., 264, pp. 21597-21602 (1989)). Formation of these advanced glycosylation products would be inhibited by the methods and agents of the present invention. The present invention is not restricted to any of these advanced glycosylation endproducts specifically, but to the general process of their formation as a result of the reaction of proteins with sugars., 15486=The Applicants are co-authors of the following articles directed to the subject matter of the present invention: \"COVALENT ATTACHMENT OF SOLUBLE PROTEINS BY NONENZYMATICALLY GLYCOSYLATED COLLAGEN; ROLE IN THE IN SITU FORMATION OF IMMUNE COMPLEXES, Brownlee, M., Pongor, S., Cerami, A., J. Exp. Med., 158, pp. 1739-1744 (1983); \"AGING OF PROTEINS: ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF A FLUORESCENT CHROMOPHORE FROM THE REACTION OF POLYPEPTIDES WITH GLUCOSE\", Pongor, S., Ulrich, P., Bencsath, A.

USA, 81, pp. 2682-2688 (1984); and \"ADVANCED GLYCOSYLATION END PRODUCTS IN TISSUE AND THE BIOCHEMICAL BASIS OF DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS\", Brownlee, M., Cerami, A., and Vlassara, H., The New England Journal of Medicine, 318, pp. 1315-1321 (1988). All of the above publications are incorporated herein by reference., 35781=The experiments of Eble et al. do not suggest the reactive cleavage product mechanism or any other mechanism in the in vivo formation of advanced glycosylation endproducts in which glucose is always present. In fact, other investigators support this mechanism to explain the formation of advanced glycosylated endproducts in vivo (see for example Hayase et al, 1989, supra; Sell and Monnier, 1989, supra: Oimomi et al., AGRIC. BIOL. CHEM., 53(6):1727-1728 (1989); and Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 6:311-313 (1989). The use of lysine as an inhibitor in the Eble et al. model system has no bearing upon the utility of the compounds of the present invention in the inhibition of advanced glycosylated endproducts formation in the presence of glucose in vivo and the amelioration of complications of diabetes and aging., 14909=This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/481,869, filed Feb. 20, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,360 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 220,504, filed Jul. 18, 1988, now abandoned, which is a Division of U.S. Ser.

Applicants claim the benefits of these Applications under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120., 17921=The reaction between reducing sugars and food proteins discussed above was found in recent years to have its parallel in vivo. Thus, the nonenzymatic reaction between glucose and the free amino groups on proteins to form a stable amino, 1-deoxy ketosyl adduct, known as the Amadori product, has been shown to occur with hemoglobin, wherein a rearrangement of the amino terminal of the \u03b2-chain of hemoglobin by reaction with glucose, forms the adduct known as hemoglobin A1c. The reaction has also been found to occur with a variety of other body proteins, such as lens crystallins, collagen and nerve proteins. See Bunn, H. F., Haney, D. N., Gabbay, K. H. and Gallop, P. H., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 67. pp. 103-109 (1975); Koenig, R. J., Blobstein, S. H. and Cerami, A., J. Biol. Chem., 252, pp. 2992-2997 (1975); Monnier, V. M. and Cerami, A. in Maillard Reaction in Food and Nutrition, ed. Waller, G. A., American Chemical Society, 215, pp. 431-448 (1983); and Monnier, V. M. and Cerami, A., Clinics in Endocrinology and Metabolism, 11, pp. 431-452 (1982)., 44272=Protein crosslinking through advanced glycosylation product formation can decrease solubility of structural proteins such as collagen in vessel walls (see Brownlee et al., Science, 232, pp. 1629-1632, (1986)), and as well as trap serum proteins, such as lipoproteins to the collagen. Also, this may result in covalent trapping of extravasated plasma proteins in subendothelial matrix, and reduction in susceptibility of both plasma and matrix proteins to physiologic degradation by enzymes. (See Brownlee et al., Diabetes, 35, Suppl. 1, p. 42A (1986).) For these reasons, the progressive occlusion of diabetic vessels induced by chronic hyperglycemia has been hypothesized to result from excessive formation of glucose-derived crosslinks. Such diabetic macrovascular changes and microvascular occlusion can be effectively prevented by chemical inhibition of advanced glycosylation product formation utilizing a composition and the methods of the present invention., 16764=The reaction between glucose and proteins has been known for some time. Its earliest manifestation was in the appearance of brown pigments during the cooking of food, which was identified by Maillard in 1912, who observed that glucose or other reducing sugars react with amino acids to form adducts that undergo a series of dehydrations and rearrangements to form stable brown pigments, Maillard, L. D. C.R. Acad. Sci., 154, pp. 66-68 (1912)., 45256=Other studies indicate that the development of chronic diabetic damage in target organs is primarily linked to hyperglycemia so that tight metabolic control would delay or even prevent end-organ damage. See Nicholls et al., Lab. Invest., 60(4), p. 486 (1989), which discusses the effects of islet isografting and aminoguanidine in murine diabetic nephropathy. These studies further evidence that aminoguanidine, an agent of the present invention, diminishes kidney glomerular basement membrane protein crosslinking in diabetic rats and extends the earlier studies of Brownlee et al., Science, 232, pp. 1629-1632 (1986) to this additional target organ of complication of diabetes. An additional study showed the reduction of immunoglobulin trapping in the kidney by aminoguanidine (Brownlee et al., Diabetes, 35, Suppl. 1, p. 42A (1986))., 39472=The compound aminoguanidine is known to have low toxicity in animals. According to the 1978 Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, aminoguanidine base has a LD50 when administered subcutaneously of 1258 mg/kg in rats and 963 mg/kg in mice. The hydrochloride derivative had a LD50 in rats of 2984 mg/kg when given subcutaneously. The latter compound exhibits very low toxicity., 61201=To prepare glomerular basement membranes, tissue was cut into slices and passed through a series of sieves (170, 100 and 270) to separate glomeruli from tubules and other undesired tissue elements as described (Beisswenger, P. J., Spiro, R. G., Diabetes, 22:180-193, 1973). Glomerular purity was found to be 80-90%. The final material was collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for fifteen minutes to pellet the glomeruli, which were frozen at -70\ufffd C., 32792=The chemical nature of the early glycosylation products with which the compounds of the present invention is believed to react are speculative. Early glycosylation products with carbonyl moieties which are involved in the formation of advanced glycosylation products, and which may be blocked by reaction with the compounds of the present invention, have been postulated. In one case, the reactive carbonyl moieties of Amadori products or their further dehydration and/or rearrangement products, may condense to form advanced glycosylation endproducts. Another proposed mechanism is the formation of reactive carbonyl compounds, containing one or more carbonyl moieties (such as glycoaldehyde or 3-deoxyglucosone) from the cleavage of Amadori or other early glycosylation products (see, for example, Gottschalk, A. (1972) in The Glycoproteins (Gottschalk, A., ed) Part A, pp. 141-157, Elsevier Publishing Co., New York; Reynolds, T. M. (1965) Adv. Food Res., 14, pp. 167-283), and by subsequent reactions with an amine or Amadori product to form carbonyl containing advanced glycosylation products such as the alkylformylglycosylpyrroles described by Farmar et al, supra., 62223=An enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the amount of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) that became bound to the glomerular basement membranes of the normal and diabetic animals after treatment with and without the agent. To measure IgG, 6 mg samples of lyophilized glomerular basement membrane tissue was suspended in 0.5 mM of 0.05M carbonate buffer, pH 7.6, and 0.5 mM of a 1:5,000 dilution of rat anti-IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphates (Dynatech Corp.) was added. The mixture was incubated overnight in polystyrene tubes which were preblocked by incubation for two hours in 3% goat serum plus 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by two rinses in PBS plus Tween., 31541=The rationale of the invention is to use agents which block the post-glycosylation step, i.e., the formation of fluorescent chromophores such as that identified in Pongor, et al., supra and Farmar et al., supra, among others, whose presence is associated with, and leads to, the adverse sequelae of diabetes and aging. An ideal agent would prevent the formation of a chromophore and its associate cross-links of proteins to proteins and trapping of proteins on the other proteins, such as that which occurs in arteries and in the kidney., 19016=Moreover, brown pigments with spectral and fluorescent properties similar to those of late-stage Maillard products have also been observed in vivo in association with several long-lived proteins, such as lens proteins and collagen from aged individuals. An age-related linear increase in pigment was observed in human dura collagen between the ages of 20 to 90 years. See Monnier, V. M. and Cerami, A., Science, 211, pp. 491-493 (1981); Monnier, V. M. and Cerami, A., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 760, pp. 97-103 (1983); and Monnier, V. M., Kohn, R. R. and Cerami, A., \"Accelerated Age-Related Browning of Human Collagen in Diabetes Mellitus\", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 81, pp. 583-587 (1984). Interestingly, the aging of collagen can be mimicked in vitro by the crosslinking induced by glucose; and the capture of other proteins and the formation of adducts by collagen, also noted, is theorized to occur by a crosslinking reaction, and is believed to account for the observed accumulation of albumin and antibodies in kidney basement membrane. See Brownlee, M., Pongor, S. and Cerami, A., J. Exp. Med.. 158, pp. 1739-1744 (1983); and Kohn, R. R., Cerami, A. and Monnier, V. M., Diabetes, 33(1), pp. 57-59 (1984)., 47170=Increased cross-linking of collagen in diabetic rats has shown to be prevented by aminoguanidine. Oxlund and Andreassen, \"The increase in biochemical and biomechanical stability of collagen in diabetic rats is prevented by aminoguanidine treatment\", European Association for the Study of Diabetes, Twenty-fifth Annual Meeting, p. 525A, Abstract No. 371, 1989 showed the effect when thermal stability of tendon fibers was assessed by breaking time in a urea bath, as well as mechanical strength. Soulis et al., \"Aminoguanidine reduces tissue fluorescence but not albuminuria in diabetic rats\". NIH Conference on the Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition, Bethesda, Md., Sep. 22-23, 1988, page 30) showed the same effect on collagen in the aorta, measured by fluorescence and solubility.}",

The present disclosure is therefor to be considered as in all respects illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended Claims, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency are intended to be embraced therein. These data show that the solubility of tail tendon collagen was reduced from 81% to 65% with diabetes of 6 months' duration but prevented significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, by both aminoguanidine treatments. Diabetic BB/Worcester rat collagen showed less decrease in solubility over the 6 month period than streptozotocin-diabetic rats presumably because of the lower degree of hyperglycemia and lower concentration of glucose to which collagen was exposed chronically.
