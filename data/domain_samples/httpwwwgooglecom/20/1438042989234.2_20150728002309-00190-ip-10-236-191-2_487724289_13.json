The Internet 10 includes a plurality of interconnected computers and routers designated by 12A-12B. The manner of communicating over the Internet is known through RFC documents obtained by FTP at NIC.DDN.MIL or at FTP NISC.SRI.COM. TCP/IP related communication is described for example in the book \u201cTCP/IP Illustrated,\u201d Vol. 1, The Protocols, by Stevens, from Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1994. As the Internet is a network accessible by many people and organizations, it is not considered to be secure. Therefore, messages transmitted over the Internet should be encrypted to keep the messages confidential. Encryption mechanisms are known and commercially available which may be used with the present invention. For example, a C library function, crypt( ), is available from Sun Microcomputers for use with the Unix operating system, and other encryption and decryption routines are known and commercially available.}",

No. 07/549,278, filed Jul. 6, 1990, now abandoned, the disclosure of each is incorporated herein by reference., 55031=An important feature of the present invention is the use of a connectionless-mode of communication or transmission between a machine and a computer for diagnosing and controlling the machine. The IBM Dictionary of Computing by George McDaniel, 1994, defines a connectionless-mode transmission to be the transmission of a single unit of data from a source service access point to one or more destination service access points without establishing a connection. The IBM Dictionary also defines a connection-mode transmission to be the transmission of units of data from a source service access point to one or more destination service access points via a connection. The connection is established prior to data transfer and released following data transfer. Additional information about the connection-mode and the connectionless-mode of operation is described in the Handbook of Computer-Communications Standards, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition, by William Stallings, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference. In order to transfer data from one DTE (data terminal equipment) to another DTE, there is a unique identifier or address for each DTE. This unique identifier or address is usable in both connectionless-modes and connectionless-modes of communication., 136588=The connectionless-mode messages utilized with the present invention are preferably Internet electronic mail messages, although any other type of connectionless messages may be utilized. A current accepted standard in Internet electronic mail communications is the Simple Mail Transport Protocol, referred to as SMTP. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol is defined in the Request for Comments (RFC) 821. The Request for Comments 822 specifies further information of the format of Internet electronic mail messages and has been updated by RFC 1327. Each of the above Request for Comments is available on the Internet and is incorporated herein by reference. SMTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) packets to transport data from the sending machine to the receiving machine. An SMTP conversation is carried on by two pieces of software running on machines connected to the Internet, called Mail Transport Agents (MTAs). The details of implementing Internet electronic mail communication are well known.}",
