The median iLGD value for investment grade and high yield issuers are 0.5614 and 0.9782, respectively.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{76114=The bonds in the group with the largest iLGD values may be considered the most undervalued. Conversely, the bonds in the group with the lowest iLGD values may be considered the least undervalued (or most over-valued). Bonds in the group with the highest iLGD values are bought and added to the portfolio. This is indicated at step 1040. Bonds included the portfolio and in the lowest group of iLGD values are sold and, thus, removed from the portfolio, as indicated at step 1050. Before the purchase or sale of bonds identified by the groupings, additional steps may be performed. Some additional research or evaluation may be desired to gauge if there is a particular reason for the extreme value, such as news reports or rumors of imminent corporate financial failure, of government action or inaction (such as an SEC investigation, adverse judicial ruling, FDA approval, etc.), or news reports or rumors concerning competitors, customers, or suppliers. In addition, or in the alternative, a portfolio manager may compare the iLGD values of the bonds to predictive LGD values. Such additional evaluation may narrow down the number of bonds targeted for purchase or sale., 77901=At step 1060, the methodology is repeated periodically (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and/or upon the occurrence of an event. For example, the portfolio may be rebalanced monthly with bonds bought and sold according to their iLGD values. For example, bonds with iLGD values entering in the highest iLGD group may be added to the portfolio. Bonds with iLGD values leaving the highest iLGD group may be sold. According to the quartile example provided above, bonds having iLGD values that transition between quartile groups are bought and sold accordingly. As above, if a bond has an iLGD value transitioning from the third quartile to the fourth quartile, then the bond is sold from the third quartile bond portfolio and bought into the fourth quartile bond portfolio.}",
