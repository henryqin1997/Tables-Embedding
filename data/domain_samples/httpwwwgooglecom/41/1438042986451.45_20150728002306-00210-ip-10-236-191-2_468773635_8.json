No. 866,854 filed May 23, 1986, now abandoned., 43794=Moreover, the above data show that for a composition of a given processability (i.e., viscosity), the compositions of this invention --which are comprised of low and high molecular weight polymers --upon curing exhibit unexpectedly higher tensile strength than do prior art oil extended compositions composed of high molecular weight polymer alone. Specifically, a comparison of Example 2 with Comparative Experiment A indicates that although these compositions have a similar viscosity (68 vs 69 respectively) the tensile strength of the cured composition of this invention is unexpectedly higher (2860 psi vs 2520 psi after being cured for 30 minutes at 165\ufffd C.: 2750 psi vs 2660 psi after being cured for 30 minutes at 165\ufffd C. plus 30 minutes at 204\ufffd C. hot air post cured).}",
