The label 82 is normally placed on top of the article so that it can be viewed by a purchaser and the U.P.C. label 87 may be placed on the bottom or on the top of the article. The U.P.C. label could also be placed over an area of the human readable label 82. If desired, the U.P.C. labels 87 could be attached to the human readable labels 82 within the printer 87 or prior to the time that the labels 82 are loaded in the printer 81. Also provided is a U.P.C. reader 91 which is located to scan the U.P.C. labels 87 on the articles 76. The symbol read by the reader 91 is transmitted to a store computer 92 which is also connected by lines 93 to receive the commodity data from the entry unit 79 and the weight and total cost information from the scale 78. The computer 92 includes a memory bank which stores the data associated with the U.P.C. symbol on each article, similar to the operation of the computer 43 shown in FIG. 1. The store may also include a checkout station 93 connected to the store computer 92, the checkout station 93 including a reader or scanner for the U.P.C. labels 87 on the articles. As",
