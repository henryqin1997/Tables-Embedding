    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21687=In the present invention, water-containing manganese dioxide is continuously calcined in a calcination temperature range of 440\ufffd C. to 480\ufffd C., more preferably of 450\ufffd C. to 470\ufffd C. using a continuous rotary furnace with external heating in which air flow amount in the furnace (hereinafter referred to as \"air ratio\") is set to 20 to 2000 Nl per manganese dioxide of 1 kg (hereinafter referred to as \"20 to 2000 Nl/kg\"), whereby a decomposition reaction of the water-containing manganese dioxide can be suppressed and reduction in the specific surface area can be suppressed at the same time. The reason for this effect is not clearly understood, however, it is guessed as follows., 17421=In order to attain the above object, a calcination treatment of water-containing manganese dioxide containing water is conducted using a continuous rotary furnace with external heating in a high temperature range of 440\ufffd C. to 480\ufffd C., preferably of 450\ufffd C. to 470\ufffd C., which has been impossible in the prior art, while the amount of air flowing from the outside of the furnace into the furnace is adjusted to a fixed range. The air flow amount supplied into the continuous rotary furnace with external heating is controlled to be in the range of 20 to 2000 Nl per 1 kg water-containing manganese dioxide, preferably in the range of 100 to 1000 Nl., 37128=However, when the calcination temperature was increased to 490\ufffd C. or more, it was difficult to perfectly suppress the thermal decomposition even if the air ratio is increased to 1000 Nl/kg or more. If the air ratio is increased to more than 2000 Nl/kg, dispersion of manganese dioxide would occur frequently and this is not realistic. Therefore, Example 1 eliminates the experiment under this condition. On the other hand, if the air ratio is decreased to less than 20 Nl/kg, the thermal decomposition is promoted even at 480\ufffd C., 46880=No problem occurs if the air ratio is increased to more than 2000 Nl/kg, however, it has no industrial merit because of dispersion loss of manganese dioxide and increase of thermal loss during the calcination process., 36712=As is apparent from Table 1, even in the case where the calcination temperature was increased to 440\ufffd to 480\ufffd C., the thermal decomposition of manganese dioxide could be suppressed when the air ratio was increased to 20 Nl/kg or more. The thermal decomposition could be perfectly suppressed in the calcination temperature range of 450\ufffd to 470\ufffd C. and in the air ration range of 100 to 1000 Nl/kg., 39049=As is apparent from Table 3, the content of the bound water was reduced as the calcination temperature increased. In addition, as the air ratio was increased, the content of the bound water was reduced. The reason for this is considered as follows. That is, increase of the air ratio reduces the moisture partial pressure in the furnace, so that elimination of the bound water from the calcined manganese dioxide in an equilibrium state is accelerated. However, the reduction effect of the bound water content is hardly varied even if the air ratio is increased to 1000 Nl/kg or more., 46346=On the other hand, in Example 1, there is the calcination condition under which the indispensable three items (1) to (3) as described above are satisfied at the same time. That is, the calcination temperature is from 440\ufffd C. to 480\ufffd C. and the air ratio is from 20 to 2000 Nl/kg. In order to obtain calcined manganese dioxide having more preferable characteristics, the following calcination is more preferable: the calcination temperature range of 450\ufffd C. to 470\ufffd C. and the air ratio range of 100\ufffd to 1000 Nl/kg., 37948=As is apparent from Table 2, as the calcination temperature increased, the specific surface area of the calcined manganese dioxide was more reduced as compared with that of the electrolytic manganese dioxide before calcined. However, the larger the air ratio was, the smaller the reduction rate of the specific surface area was, so that the calcined manganese dioxide having a large specific surface area could be obtained. The effect could not be more improved even if the air ratio is increased to 1000 Nl/kg or more.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations No problem occurs if the air ratio is increased to more than 2000 Nl/kg, however, it has no industrial merit because of dispersion loss of manganese dioxide and increase of thermal loss during the calcination process. On the other hand, in Example 1, there is the calcination condition under which the indispensable three items (1) to (3) as described above are satisfied at the same time. That is, the calcination temperature is from 440\ufffd C. to 480\ufffd C. and the air ratio is from 20 to 2000 Nl/kg. In order to obtain calcined manganese dioxide having more preferable characteristics, the following calcination is more preferable: the calcination temperature range of 450\ufffd C. to 470\ufffd C. and the air ratio range of 100\ufffd to 1000 Nl/kg. The reason for this may be considered as follows. Since the temperature increasing time is long and the furnace is of standing type, gas located in the water-containing manganese dioxide layer rarely moves, so that the water-containing manganese dioxide at portions other than the surface portion is exposed to a high moisture partial pressure and a relatively low oxygen partial pressure during the calcination. It is apparent that the calcined manganese dioxide having the preferable characteristics as described above cannot be obtained in the comparative example 2 using the conventional method at the calcination temperature of 440\ufffd C. or more. (3) Content of bound water: below 0.45%, preferably below 0.30%. (2)",
