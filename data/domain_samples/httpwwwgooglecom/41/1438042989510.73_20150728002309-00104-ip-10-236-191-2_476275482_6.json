Accordingly, all expedient modifications readily attainable by one of ordinary skill in the art from the disclosure set forth herein, or by routine experimentation therefrom, are deemed to be within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. After the teeth have been imaged, the dental professional can prepare the teeth to receive the necessary restorations. After the tooth or teeth have been prepared to receive the restoration(s), an image of the prepared teeth can be taken and forwarded to the technician for use in connection with the formulation of the proper size and color of a ceramic buildup or other suitable material. The technician can also take into consideration the color of the prepared tooth when preparing the restoration. The inclusion of the shade of the prepared tooth can be incorporated into the final color calculations so that the closest match can be made. Another use of the image is to compare the image to shade and color standard guides, such as VITA\u2122, BIOFORM\u2122, or CHROMASCOP\u2122 to determine the patient's tooth shade. The digital processor could then relay this information to a lab technician, where the tooth shade may be matched to the shade of the tooth to be replaced, or to the patient's adjacent or contra-lateral teeth.",
