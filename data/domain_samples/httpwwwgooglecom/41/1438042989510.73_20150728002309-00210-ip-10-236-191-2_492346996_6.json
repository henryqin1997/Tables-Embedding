S. Pat. No. 3,489,997, granted to Harold B. Morris on Jan. I3, 2970, relates to an accelerometer comprising a rigid case, a fluid filling the case, and two sets of opposed dished crystals mounted within the case and surrounded by the fluid. The crystals are of the type that produce an electrical output in response to mechanical strain, i.e., piezoelectric crystals, and are electrically interconnected in such a way that outputs from the crystals caused by changes in pressure within the case are cancelled. The electrical connections between the crystals also cause a reinforced output in response to vibrations of the case, particularly vibrations of the type encountered in seismic exploration, etc.}",
