Nos. 5,724,965 and 6,119,694, incorporated by reference in their entirety. Each describes a nasal cushion that engages with the tip of the nose or that portion of the nose in the horizontal plane just above the upper lip of the patient. In PCT/US00/11329 (WO 00/69521), incorporated by reference in its entirety, a triangular-shaped nasal cushion includes a tapered profile that narrows towards the face of the patient. Some of these prior art masks/cushions has experienced significant challenges from the perspective of patient comfort, potential nasal vent occlusion, stability and/or sealing (especially at the nasal bridge and cheek regions)., 71345=Apparatus to deliver nasal CPAP and NPPV therapy typically comprises a blower, an air delivery conduit and a patient interface. The blower may be programmed to deliver a range of different forms of therapy. In one form, a constant pressure of air or breathable gas is provided to the patient. It is also known for the level of treatment pressure to vary from breath to breath in accordance with patient need, that form of treatment being known as automatically adjusting nasal CPAP treatment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,995 (Sullivan and Lynch), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. NPPV is another form of treatment for breathing disorders. In its most basic form, a relatively higher pressure of gas may be provided in the patient mask during the inspiratory phase of respiration and a relatively lower pressure or atmospheric pressure being provided in the patient mask during the expiratory phase of respiration. In other modes, the pressure can be made to vary in a complex manner throughout the respiratory cycle. For example, the pressure at the mask during inspiration or expiration can be varied through the period of treatment. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,704,345 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO98/12965 and WO99/61088, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In this specification, the term NPPV therapy will be used to describe all these forms of NPPV and nasal CPAP therapy.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is intended that the components, elements and features of the various above-described embodiments can be used together in any desired combination or permutation to create new mask embodiments. For example, while the invention has been described in relation to a nasal mask, the teachings are also applicable to oro-nasal and full-face masks as well. . Further details of oxygen or pressure ports in a frame are included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/504,234, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Appendix A also includes instructional information for the mask system. Appendix B of incorporated U.S. Provisional Application of Moore et al., Ser. No. 60/402,509, includes pictures of two prior art masks discussed in the present invention. Appendix C of incorporated U.S. Provisional Application of Moore et al., Ser. No. 60/402,509, includes pictures of two testing models (A+B) with widely varying nose and facial features, and the mask assembly of the present invention as well as one prior art mask connected to each model. Appendix C also includes a series of pictures comparing one embodiment of the present invention to a prior art cushion used for the MIRAGE\ufffd mask. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,112,746 to Kwok et al., incorporated herein by reference. Generally speaking, the mask assembly of the present invention generally conformed to both nose models even though the sizes and shapes were vastly different. The mask cushion 40 also",
