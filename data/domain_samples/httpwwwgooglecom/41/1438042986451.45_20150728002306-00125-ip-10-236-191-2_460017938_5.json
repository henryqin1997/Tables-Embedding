The client machines 14, 22 may include any known operating system, such as IBM OS/2, Windows 9x, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows CE, Palm OS, Macintosh OSX, Unix, or Linux. The client machines 14, 22 typically include a suite of Internet applications or tools, such as a web browser and mail client. The mail client is sometimes referred to as a mail user agent (MUA). Common web browser applications include Netscape's Navigator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and Apple's Safari, all of which include support for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and various plug-ins or helper applications. Common mail clients include Microsoft's Outlook, Outlook Express and Entourage, Lotus Notes, and Eudora.

Servers 16, 24 further include a mail server application, such as sendmail or Microsoft Exchange., 85819=The mail client 14 sends a registration message containing the user's account, master code, and temporary code to the registry server (block 406). The registration message is preferably encrypted using a public key cryptographic algorithm to prevent eavesdropping. The registration message may contain a count value that that specifies the number of times that the temporary code may be used, or a time value that specifies how long the temporary code can be used. The time value may be a absolute time (3:00 PM the following Friday), or a relative time, (three days from the date of the registration message). The registry server 28 receives and validates the registration message (block 408, 410). If the user's account and master code are valid, the registry stores the temporary code in the verified mail registry (block 412). The registry server sends a verification response to the sender to indicating the results of the validation process (block 414). The mail client 14 then places the temporary code in a special registry header field and the user's account in a second registry header field (block 418) and sends the mail message (block 420)., 44399=This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) from the following U.S. provisional application: Application Ser.

The users computer 50 includes a web browsing application that is programmed to generate temporary codes and register the temporary codes with a web registry 54 as previously described. The temporary code may be valid for only a limited number of requests, or valid for the session, or for a limited time period to prevent the temporary code from being useful to a spammer. The user's web browsing application inserts the temporary code into a request (block 504) and sends the request to a web server (block 506). The request is received by the web server 52 (block 508). The web server 52 checks for a temporary code in the request (block 510). If a temporary code is present, the web server 52 sends a verification request to the web registry 54 (block 512).
