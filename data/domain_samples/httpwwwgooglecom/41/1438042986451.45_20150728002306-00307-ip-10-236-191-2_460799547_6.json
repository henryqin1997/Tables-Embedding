Other structures or arrangements such as direct communication between control unit 1 and operating units 17 are possible. Signals are transmitted between transmitter/receiver 26 and transceiver relays 18b, 20d and 22c via electromagnetic waves or another wireless medium. Radio or infrared wavelengths may be particularly advantageous. The use of a remote control unit in accordance with the present invention enables a retrofit, i.e., an accommodation of the control unit to include further operating devices or to omit other devices. The adaptability of the remote control unit is based in part on the programmable nature of control component 11. A hard-wired remote unit would result in redundancy and non-utilized channels. In such a hard-wired control device, expansion, i.e., an attempt to accomodate further operating units, generally interferes with the completed structure because insufficient free function keys are provided. A structured hierarchical grouping of the various operating units is advantageous but not necessary. Accordingly, the operating units 17 can be called up in a single sequence. Display 2 identifies the operating unit called up by the actuation of keys 3 and 4 (see FIG. 1) and also indicates the operating state of the addressed device. If, for example, a",
