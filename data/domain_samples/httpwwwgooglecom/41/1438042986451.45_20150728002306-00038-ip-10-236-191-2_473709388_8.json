The record sent to each client is counted and maintained by the Send subsystem, on the disk. The generalized statistics engine (GSE) receives specific call records from the APs. The LSE receives alarms from the alarm server. All MOSRs, full feed BDRs, unmatched aged BDRs, unmatched aged E/P/EP/OSRs, and NERs are sent to the ISN host. The T2000 traffic processor receives CRs from the APs and retransmission rejects. NERs of the T2000 are sent to an input of the T2000. Record counts for the T2000, calculated by the Send subsystem, are sent to the supervisor. The Send process sends a connection registration message to the supervisor. This message is used to determine the connections that the Send subsystem is servicing., 110585=When retransmission of adjunct processor data is needed, the T2000 (being the client) issues a retransmission request to the retransmit subsystem. If invalid, an alarm message is generated and sent to the alarm server and also back to the T2000. Otherwise, the retransmit subsystem tries to establish a connection to the appropriate adjunct processor. FIG. 26 indicates the appropriate decisional step following the main module., 107399=FIG. 14 illustrates a data flow diagram for the retransmitted subsystem. The Retransmit subsystem is responsible for requesting retransmission of Adjunct Processor data per T2000's request. The Retransmit subsystem will have a dual personality--it will be both a client and a server. It will act as a server when communicating with T2000 and as a client when communicating with an Adjunct Processor. When acting as a server, T2000 will be responsible for initiating the connection--the Retransmit Subsystem will be in a continuous loop waiting for its request. When acting as a client, the Retransmit Subsystem will be responsible for initiating the connection--an Adjunct Processor will be in a continuous loop waiting for its request. The Retransmit subsystem process will be started and stopped by the Supervisor subsystem. If the Supervisor subsystem requests a shutdown/connection termination, the ports will be shutdown., 91738=The main module will call necessary modules to handle the initialization, signals, and its input queues. The main module will call the Accept Connection module to accept the connection from the clients (T2000, GSE or ISN) and to send a registration response to a valid registration request message. Once the connection is established, the main module will call the Register with Supervisor module to notify the Supervisor subsystem of the connection success status. After the registration with the Supervisor, the main module will loop forever to handle both the incoming data from the Information Distribution Controller process and the count timer. The Read Input Queue module will be called to handle the incoming data and the Create Count Report module will be called to handle the count timer., 111470=The retransmission subsystem acts as a \"mediator\" between the T2000 and the APs. It forwards requests, as a result of the forward request module, from the T2000 to the AP and it forwards responses back from the AP to the T2000. If a successful connection was established, the retransmit subsystem forwards the original retransmission request from the T2000 to the appropriate AP., 90814=FIG. 22 illustrates the Information Distributor processes are started and terminated by the Information Distribution Controller process. The Information Distributor process handling the T2000 connection will transmit all data received from the APs, T2000 NERs, and the retransmission rejects to the T2000. The Information Distributor process handling the GSE connection will transmit a subset of Call Records received from the APs to the GSE. Both connections to T2000 and to the GSE will be established and maintained by the client. The Information Distributor process handling the ISN connection will transmit the MOSRs, full feed BDRs, unmatched aged E/P/EP/OSRs, unmatched aged BDRs, and the ISN NERs to the ISN Host. The connections between the NIC and the clients (T2000, GSE and ISN Host) will be initiated and maintained by the clients. The following discussion highlights the modules of FIG. 22., 111879=After a retransmission request is forwarded to an AP, the retransmit subsystem will wait and listen for a predetermined time in order to receive a response back from the AP. If no response is received in the predefined time from the AP, an alarm will be generated and sent to the alarm server and also back to the T2000. Otherwise, the received response will be sent back to the T2000. If a response was received by the retransmit subsystem, the forward response module forwards the message back to the T2000., 39441=FIG. 1 is a generalized prior art elementary telecommunications network showing the path between a call originating point, for example, origination phone 6, and the network such as the MCI network, which will be the assumed network for this disclosure. Typically, a call from an origination phone 6 is handled by a local exchange carrier LEC 8. If, for example, an 800 toll-free number is dialed by the origination phone 6, the LEC 8 recognizes that MCI is the carrier for this particular 800 number. Consequently, the call is routed via line 9 to the MCI origination switch 10. This is the entry point of the call into the MCI network, and further routing may be necessary. However, in order to simplify the discussion of the present invention, simply routing through the switch 10 is presumed. Typically, switches of the type discussed are well-known in the art and identified, by way of example, as a DEX 600E switch, manufactured by Digital Switch Corporation, or alternatively a DMS 250 manufactured by Northern Telecom Corporation. International switches are provided by Erikson Limited. The switch 10 has an adjunct processor (AP) 14 associated with it. The purpose of the adjunct processor is to receive call detail records (CDR) from the switch and collect them in buffers. Adjunct processors are of the type manufactured by IBM, and identified as a System 88 processor. Alternatively, a Stratus XA 2000 may be used. Each switch in the network, such as switch 11, has an adjunct processor associated with it., 93557=The create count report module is called by the main module whenever a count timer expires. This timer indicates a count reporting event. The total number of records sent to the clients are calculated and either sent to the Supervisor or are created into a count report. The counts recorded for the T2000 may be sent to the Supervisor in a T2000 NER format., 92839=The accept connection module will be called by the main module to accept a connection request from a client (T2000, GSE or ISN). Once the connection registration request message is verified, this module will send a registration response to the client to complete the connection. An invalid registration request will invoke \"Log Alarm\" with a fatal condition set., 101285=Formatted NER for transmission to the T2000 traffic processor or the ISN host are generated from subsystem count information. When NER count information is received from a subsystem, it will be formatted, prepended with the NIC API header, which will indicate the destination client. Alarms generated by the supervisor subsystem in the various operations discussed above are transmitted to the alarm server., 73158=If the data type indicates that the message contains BDR data and the message type was not retransmission, then the pre-filter will ensure that the data block is sent to all clients that want a full feed of BDR data. The match/merge and send (for ISN) subsystems are the only clients for BDRs in a simplified version of the system. Otherwise, if the data type indicated that the message contained CR data and the message type was not retransmission, then the pre-filter will ensure that the data block is sent to all clients that want a full feed of CR data. The send subsystem (for transmission to the T2000 64) is the only client for a full feed of CR data in a simplified version of the system. Also, if the data type had indicated that the message contained CR data and the message type was not retransmission, the pre-filter will call the filter to compile filtered feeds from the data block. The match/merge and send (for GSE) subsystems are the only clients for filtered CR data in a simplified version of the system. If the data type was not recognized, then the data will be written to an appropriate file and an alarm will be constructed and sent to the alarm server., 76474=The Router module is called by other modules in the distributor subsystem. The calls to router must pass a destination and a data block. The pre-filter may send full feeds to match/merge, ISN, and T2000 64 (FIG. 5) by passing the data block to the router, and designating match/merge, ISN, or T2000 64 as the destination. Filter may send filtered records to match/merge and GSE by passing the partial data blocks to router and designating match/merge or GSE as the destination. The router will populate API fields appropriately before sending the data. This may require traversing through a data block to get a record count. If the router encounters a problem, it may compile its own alarm message and send it to the Alarm Server., 38729=The present application relates to co-pending application Ser. No. 08/438,831, filed May 10, 1995, entitled \"Network Information Architecture Having Centralizing Storage and Verification Element\"., 47790=FIG. 2 illustrates the network information architecture which constitutes an improvement of the previously discussed prior art. However, as in the case of the prior art, an originating point, for example phone 6, communicates via a local exchange carrier LEC 8 to the network. As in the prior art, if an 800 toll-free number is dialed by the origination phone 6, the LEC 8 recognizes the network to handle the call, for example, MCI. As a result, the call is routed to an MCI origination switch 10. This is the entry point of the call into the MCI system, and further routing is normally required. As in the case of the prior art, a data access point 32 provides this function. In fact, a number of switches and other network elements feed data to a corresponding adjunct processor 14 which stores and distributes the data to the network information concentrator (NIC), as discussed hereinafter. Other types of network elements may include an enhanced voice services platform or an intelligent services network platform. The latter subject is discussed in an article by Richard Robrock entitled \"The Intelligent Network--Changing the Face of Communications\" published in the Proceedings of the I.E.E.E., Vol. 79, No. 1, January 1991., 72494=If the timer has not elapsed, then the pre-filter will attempt to read a message from the disInputQ queue. This queue is the main data feed from the receiver subsystem to the distributor subsystem. If there is no message in disInputQ queue, then the message type and data type fields in the API will be examined. If the message type indicated retransmitted data, then the pre-filter will ensure that the retransmitted data block is sent to all of the clients who want a full feed of all retransmitted data. In a simplified version of the system, the T2000 host 64 (FIG. 5) will be the only requestor/receiver of retransmitted data from the NIC., 111033=If the T2000 retransmission request was successful, the retransmit subsystem (now being the client) next needs to initiate a connection to the appropriate adjunct processor. This is indicated by the initiate AP connection module. If a connection cannot be established, an alarm message is generated and sent to the alarm server and also back to the T2000. Otherwise, the retransmission request is forwarded to the AP., 110262=The main module indicated in FIG. 26 is responsible for performing the administrative and initialization functions of the retransmit subsystem by reading the rules file, initializing itself as a server, checking for the T2000 retransmission requests, and checking for commands from the supervisor queue., 109077=The outputs for the retransmit subsystem include one which sends a reply message back to the T2000 if an invalid connection request or invalid retransmission request occurs. In the event of a T2000 retransmission request, the retransmit subsystem establishes a connection with the appropriate adjunct processor and then forwards that retransmission request. The retransmit subsystem generates its own alarms and sends them to the alarm server. Alarms occur for the following conditions: bad connection request, invalid retransmission request, shutdown request, OS level failure, and unexpected disconnect, etc., 108345=The following discussion will explain the basic inputs to the retransmit subsystem, as shown in FIG. 14. The traffic processor (T2000) is the initiator of a retransmit request. The adjunct processor will send a response back to the retransmit subsystem in the event of an invalid connection request and all forwarded T2000 retransmission requests. The supervisor subsystem sends shutdown requests to the retransmit subsystem. A hard disk 126 stores retransmit rules for operation, initial configuration data, thresholding information and subsystem control information. The rules, as in the case of the rules of other subsystems, are tables loaded into memory from a corresponding rules file at subsystem startup.}",
