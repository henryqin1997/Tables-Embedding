    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other implementations are within the scope of the claims. Various aspects of the system may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. Circuitry, including dedicated or general purpose machines, such as computer systems and processors, may be adapted to execute machine-readable instructions to implement the techniques described above. Computer-executable instructions for implementing the techniques can be stored, for example, as encoded information on a computer-readable medium such as a magnetic floppy disk, magnetic tape, or compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). In the foregoing examples, if an artist leaves the fund prematurely, he may lose potential future pension payments. In various implementations, vesting conditions different from those discussed above may be imposed. Furthermore, amounts that are not distributed to a particular artist, for example, as a result of the artist's leaving the fund prematurely, may be divided according to a predetermined formula between the fund and the artists remaining in the program. The foregoing example illustrates how the business model may operate to provide retirement funds for participating artists, conditioned on the artists completing their obligation under the program. In some implementations, the fund's management may decide to offer a capital guarantee or other benefits (e.g., health or disability insurance) to encourage artists to join a particular fund. A specified amount (e.g., percentage) of the fund's revenues may be set aside for distribution to the participating artists",
