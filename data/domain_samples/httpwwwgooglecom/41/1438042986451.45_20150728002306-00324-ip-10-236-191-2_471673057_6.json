    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39031=FIG. 9 is a block diagram of the picture data read unit 21 in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 shows the example in which 25 number of blocks each having m\ufffdn pixels are read out, that is to say, when the location of the present input block is (i,j), the blocks at the location (i-2, j-2)-(i+2, j+2) are read out. Although a block does not overlap with an adjacent block in the present example, it is of course possible that a block overlaps with adjacent blocks. In FIG. 9, the numeral 210 is a pixel address generator which provides a pixel address in a block according to a block number, 211 is a timing controller for switching blocks in order, and 212 and 213 are switches. 2101 through 2110 are adders, and 2111 and 2112 are multipliers. The adders 2101 through 2108 provide a pair of block numbers (i-2, j-2)-(i+2, j+2) according to the location number (i,j) of the present input block. For each block number, the timing controller 211 controls the switches 212 and 213 to read pixel data of each block. When a block number is applied through the switch 212, the adders 2109 and 2110, and the multipliers 2111 and 2112 converts said block number to the address of the center pixel of the block, and the converted address is sent to the pixel address generator 210. The structure of the pixel address generator 210 is the same as the circuit 16 in FIG. 7. A picture data read out of the picture memory 1 is sent to the block difference calculators 22 through 24, through the switch 213., 41236=The circuit 25 in FIG. 8 is now described. The detection of the minimum block difference is accomplished by comparing a present input block with one of 25 blocks having the numbers (i-2, j-2)-(i+2, j+2) to find a smaller block difference. The numeral 251 is the decision circuit for the above comparison. The numeral 2510 is an adder, 2511 is a decision circuit, 2512 is a switch, and 2513 and 2514 are terminals. The adder 2510 provides the block difference between two input blocks, and the decision circuit 2511 determines if the output of the adder 2510 is positive or negative. If it is positive, the switch 2512 is coupled with the terminal 2513, and if it is negative that switch is coupled with the terminal 2514. By repeating the above operation by using the comparators 251, 252, 253 et al. the minimum block difference and the related block number iM, jM are obtained. The rest of the circuit 25 functions to provide a motion vector. The numerals 2520 through 2523, 2530, and 2531 are adders, and the numerals 2525 through 2528 are multipliers. The adders 2522 and 2523 receive the block number of the present input block, and said numbers are converted to the horizontal pixel address x0 and the vertical pixel address y0 through the multipliers 2527 and 2528. Simultaneously, the block number iM, jM which gives the minimum block difference is converted to the horizontal pixel address xM and the vertical pixel address yM through the adders 2520 and 2521, and the multipliers 2525 and 2526. For x0, y0 and xM, yM, the adders 2530 and 2531 provide their differences. The outputs of the adders 2530 and 2531 are the horizontal component and the vertical component of the motion vector which is wanted, and are applied to the terminals 2544 and 2545, respectively. The minimum block difference is applied to the terminal 2543.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, it will now be apparent that a new and improved moving object detection system has been found. It should be understood of course that the embodiments disclosed are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Reference should be made to the appended claims, therefore, rather than the specification as indicating the scope of the invention. As mentioned above, according to the present invention, the motion vector which is obtained by a conventional manner is modified by using motion vector information of the adjacent blocks of the current input block, and the error of the detected motion vector is decreased. As a result, a motion vector between frames to indicate a movement of a moving object is detected correctly, and therefore, the performance of a motion picture processing and/or a coding system by using a motion vector is improved. In particular, a picture quality of a picture which is obtained by interpolating a scanning line by using a motion vector in an image signal coding system in for instance a television standard conversion system, and/or a general detection of a moving object is improved. The motion vector correction circuit 45 functions to implement the adjustment or correction operation as shown in the table 1. The decision circuit 450 tests whether the output of the coincidence circuit 44 is 1(=yes) or not. When the result is \"yes\", the value",
