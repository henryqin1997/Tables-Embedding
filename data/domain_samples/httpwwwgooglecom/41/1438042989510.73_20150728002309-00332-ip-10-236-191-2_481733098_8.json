The state now corresponds to the illustration of FIG. 9. The position of the test prosthesis is stored in the mounting apparatus 1 and the test prosthesis can now be removed after the release of the clamping screw E. In FIG. 13 the sliding carriage A is cautiously moved downwardly in order that the floating disc D orients itself in accordance with the inclination of the lower side of the head, and the inclination is fixed by tightening of the screw G. In FIG. 12 the test prosthesis has been loosely placed on the floating disc D. The sliding carriage A is first moved downwardly in order to insert a sleeve B, 15 fitting with the stem 7 in the first reception apparatus and to secure it with a screw C. Then the sliding carriage A is moved upwardly and the stem 7 is positioned in the sleeve B, 15 and secured with the screw E.
