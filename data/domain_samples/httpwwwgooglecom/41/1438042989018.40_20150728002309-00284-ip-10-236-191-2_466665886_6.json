According to another aspect of the present invention, a part of switching operation of the input signal can be simplified. As described above, according to one aspect of the present invention, the generation number generating means in the data packet forming means generates a multidimensional generation number, and includes the same in destination information of a data packet. It is possible to manage data to be subjected to processing in a data driven information processor multidimensionally. ROUTn+1 =RINn \ufffdRINn+1 ... (3) In this embodiment, the present invention is applied to a circuit for detecting an active low control signal. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, but can be applied to a circuit in which the polarity of the signal is opposite. More specifically, the present invention can be applied similarly to a circuit for holding a logical expression as shown in the expression (3). Signal processing circuit 120 can be applied to input data packet forming unit 11 shown in FIG. 9, for example. More specifically, signal processing circuit 120 can be incorporated in first control",
