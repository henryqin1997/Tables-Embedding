Content Guard is a provider of Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies through XrML, extensible Rights Markup Language. XrML is a language to specify rights. XrML is an XML based usage grammar for specifying rights and conditions to control the access to digital content and services. Using XrML, the owners and distributors of digital resources (including content, services or software) can identify the parties allowed to use those resources, the rights available to those parties, and the terms and conditions under which rights may be exercised. Other uses of XrML and its application to development of business models for distributing digital content and services over a network or Internet are discussed in Content Guards's White Paper, \u201cThe Need for a Rights Language\u201d, 2001 (also available on the web at: http://www.xrml.org/reference.asp).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various alterations, modifications and adaptations can be made to this invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In another embodiment of the invention the masked version of an information product, obtained by superposing a masking effect, is rendered the default version of the information product. The information product persists in its masked state until a mask-removal procedure is carried out on the information product. The mask-removal procedure may require authentication or approval by the distributor prior to the recreation of the information product in its original and intended form. Once an authentication or mask-removal procedure has been successfully carried out the user can read, watch or listen to the information product but cannot store the information product in its original and intended form; thereafter the information product reverts to its default masked state and re-access to the information product again requires an authentication or approval by the distributor. Masking effects can be in the form of micro signatures that are added to the content to keep track of transmission history and record the transmission and distribution process and that gets updated every time a document is transferred, retrieved and transmitted from one computer system to another. Masking effects or masks can be considered as mini-information objects superposed over the information product and containing electronic content in",
