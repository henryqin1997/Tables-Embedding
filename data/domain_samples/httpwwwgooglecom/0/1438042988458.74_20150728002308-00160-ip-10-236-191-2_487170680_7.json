    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27612=Semiconductor laser technology has matured to produce devices which are suitable for applications requiring long term, reliable laser operation. Strategies for maintaining laser stability and prolonging laser life include control of the laser operating environment. In particular, the temperature, humidity and atmosphere in which the laser operates are controlled. The preferred atmosphere taught in the prior art is relatively inert with respect to the semiconductor laser materials. In particular, the art teaches that an atmosphere free of oxygen extends laser life. Also a dry atmosphere is preferred to prevent reaction with the laser materials and to preserve the integrity of the miniature electric circuitry associated with the laser operation. For a further discussion of appropriate microcircuit packaging see, \"Considerations in the Hermetic Packaging of Hybrid Microcircuits\", Byrnes et al., Solid State Technology, 1984. For example, an atmosphere of dry nitrogen with a helium tracer provides a favorable laser operating environment. The term dry, as used in this document, in general refers to a gaseous medium having a water content less than about 5000 ppm. However, as semiconductor laser facet power has increased to 50 mW and higher, these generally accepted strategies for stable, long term laser operation have proved inadequate. For a laser having a facet size of about 2 microns by 1 micron, a power output of 50 mW translates into an average power density at the facet of the order of 1 megawatt/cm2. Laser end facets, which essentially delimit the lasing cavity, can change in reflectivity and can even be destroyed when a high power laser is operated in a dry helium/nitrogen atmosphere. Materials which can contaminate the container include solder flux, oils, epoxies and cleaning agents used in the process. The term process is descriptive of the steps of producing a high powered semiconductor laser device. Their presence can result in particulate and gaseous contamination reaching the surface of the facet coatings, 9 or 5 in FIG. 1, and producing impurity deposits thereon. Such deposits can change the facet reflectivity, reducing transmitted power, and increasing absorptivity at the facet which causes facet heating and eventual laser failure. Therefore, new strategies are needed to meet those laser applications which require high power together with assurance of laser stability and longevity., 27039=This is a continuation of application(s) Ser. No. 08/481,009 filed on Jun. 7, 1995, which is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/168,125 filed Dec. 17, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,198 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/091,657, filed Jul. 14, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,392,305., 43170=As discussed above, the atmosphere used to fill the laser enclosure preferably contains at least 100 ppm oxygen and less than about 1000 ppm of water. Commercially available \"reconstituted air\" is a suitable source for the atmosphere. For example, air product number 00.1 sold by Airco Gas Inc. of Portland, Oreg., can be used in the packaging of lasers in accordance with the invention. As reported by the manufacturer, this product has the following composition: \u02dc20% O2 (typical value); \u02dc80% N2 (typical value); 0.2 ppm CO (typical value); <0.1 ppm CO2 (typical value); <0.1 ppm NOx (typical value); <0.1 ppm total hydrocarbons (guaranteed value); and <3 ppm H2 O (guaranteed value)., 36310=FIG. 1 illustrates the structure of a semiconductor laser, familiar to those skilled in the art. The front and back facets, 10 and 12 respectively, of laser body 3 are cleaved surfaces substantially parallel to one another. These facets are protected by passivation layers 5 which may be a layer of silicon. The passivation layer serves to protect the laser facet from contamination and erosion. The passivation layer also protects the laser facet from oxidation. The front facet mirror 9 is a coating of thickness approximately one quarter of the laser wavelength. The back facet mirror 7 is comprised of successive layers of reflective material, wherein adjacent layers are generally of different materials. The number, composition and thickness of the layers forming mirror 7 are chosen to give a target ratio of front facet to back facet transmitted power. A typical front to back facet power ratio is about 40:1., 31912=Another aspect of the invention is a method for hermetically sealing a high power semiconductor laser in a container filled with a gaseous medium. The laser is mounted on an optical platform. The optical platform is sealed in a hermetic container filled with a gaseous medium comprising components relatively inert with respect to the semiconductor laser materials and in addition containing an amount of oxygen effective to prevent impurity deposition on the laser facet structure. That is, the oxygen acts to prevent impurity induced laser structure damage. The water content of the gaseous medium is less than 5000 ppm. A preferred water content is 1000 ppm., 30778=One aspect of the invention is a packaged high power semiconductor laser comprising the laser surrounded by a hermetically sealed container filled with a gaseous medium containing at least 100 ppm oxygen. One embodiment of the invention utilizes a package containing air having less than 5000 ppm water as the gaseous medium. However, other embodiments are contemplated which have a gaseous medium comprising components relatively inert with respect to the semiconductor laser materials, and an amount of oxygen effective to prevent impurity depositions on the facet structure. The oxygen may act to substantially remove deposits from the laser facet structure or to react with impurities prior to deposition on the facet structure and so prevent deposits from forming thereon. Either the prevention of deposition on the laser facet structure or the removal of deposits on the laser facet structure may be generally termed the prevention of impurity induced damage to the laser facet structure. Because of the deleterious effects of water on microcircuits, very low water content, less than 1000 ppm, is preferred., 49613=A 980 nm InGaAs semiconductor laser was obtained from the IBM research facility in Zurich, Switzerland, with a structure substantially as shown in FIG. 1. The laser mirrors were configured to deliver 90% of total power through the front facet and 10% through the back facet. The laser was operated at a drive current of 195 mA which produced a front facet power of 150 mW. The laser was enclosed in a hermetically sealed container filled with a mixture of He/N in the ratio 1:9. Prior to sealing, the container was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and with OPTICLEAR. Water content of the atmosphere surrounding the laser was <1000 ppm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although specific embodiments of the invention have hereinbefore been disclosed and described, it will be understood that the scope of the invention is nevertheless to be defined by the following claims. The semiconductor laser is found to operate successfully over an extended period of time, i.e., for over 5000 hours, with minimal free water in the package, i.e., a water concentration in the package atmosphere of less than 5000 ppm at the end of the test period. The packaged high power semiconductor laser is thus suitable for use in providing power to an amplifier fiber in a telecommunications system. The semiconductor laser and other components are mounted in the body section of the container. That section along with the cover section with its attached getter are then vacuum baked for 12 hours at 100\ufffd C. Finally, the two sections are sealed together in an atmosphere of the 00.1 air product referred to above. The sealing is performed by fluxless, electro-resistance heating. The VYCOR getter is baked at 650\ufffd C. for at least 0.5 hours to activate the material and to remove previously adsorbed or absorbed organics. A section of the material having a weight of approximately 0.75 grams is attached to the previously baked cover using through-holes formed in the getter as described above. The container for the laser is fabricated from Kovar plated with gold and nickel in two sections--a body section for holding the",
