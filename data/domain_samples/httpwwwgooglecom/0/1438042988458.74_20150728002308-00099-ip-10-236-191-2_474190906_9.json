These devices have gone from being an electronic gadget to being a heavily relied upon device for determining position as well as direction and distance to a destination. Likewise, the reliance on these devices have also increased. Currently, there are a number of GPS systems. For example, Garmin International produces hand held GPS units which may be used by small boaters and even hikers. An example of such a unit is described in the GPS 38 \u201cPersonal Navigator\u201d\u2122 Owner's Manual published in 1996.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been fully described in conjunction with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications may be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims, unless they depart therefrom. This process is repeated until there is a negative result from decision diamond 44. In that event, the backtracking may be accomplished by using the points in stack S as conventional way-points for system 10. If D is less than or equal to T, all data points strictly between B and E may be discarded without adversely affecting the backtrack route. This situation is illustrated in FIG. 4 by the point L. In this event, the logic will flow to block 42. This block 42 is illustrative of the following steps. First, since the point L is not needed for accurate backtracking, it will not be stored in stack S. To prevent L from being stored, counter C decremented by one. Next, the variable B is set to the current value of E. This is illustrated in FIG. 5 as B\u2032. Finally, the value of E is set to the location stored in stack S(c\u22121). This is illustrated in FIG. 5 as E. After this, the logic flow is",
