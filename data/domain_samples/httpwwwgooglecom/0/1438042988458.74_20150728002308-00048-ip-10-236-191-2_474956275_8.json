    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As has been discussed above in detail, in the method of the present invention, electrical connections between the conductive layer of the upper-most layer and the inner conductive layers, between the inner conductive layers and between the lower-most conductive layer and the inner conductive layers can be achieved through the use of photoviaholes and a conductive paste. Therefore, it is not necessary to form through-holes for the electrical connection therebetween. Thus, the present invention makes it possible to increase the degree of freedom in designing the arrangement of the circuit patterns for the inner conductive layers and accordingly multilayer printed wiring boards can be substantially improved in the degree of lamination and wiring density as compared with the conventional multilayer printed wiring boards. (3) Multilayered boards 14 and 15 are assembled through a prepeg layer 52, firmly adhered to one another through application of heat and pressure and the upper-most and lower-most layers are electrically connected to complete a multilayer printed wiring board of the second embodiment. (2) Another multilayered board 14 is separately prepared in the similar manner used in the above (1). (1) Photoviaholes 42 are formed on lands 6 of via holes 41 in the similar manner used in the first embodiment to give a multilayered board 15. Then a conductive paste 5 is applied onto positions corresponding to photoviaholes 42. A second embodiment of the present invention will now be explained in",
