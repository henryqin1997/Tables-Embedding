[0029] Referring now to FIG. 3, there is shown a front view of right leg 101 in full extension comprising femur 105, artificial femoral component 100, prosthetic meniscal component 102, prosthetic tibial component 104, and tibia 107. There is further shown line 109 representing the mechanical axis of leg 101. As leg 101 flexes, it is necessary for femoral component 100 to rotate medially about mechanical axis 109. The condylar height differential of femoral component 100 in the present invention allows sufficient rotation to accommodate high flexion. In addition, the medial aspect of lateral condyle 145 is truncated such that the distance between the lateral and medial sides of lateral condyle 135 is less than the distance between the lateral and medial sides of medial condyle 145 to further enhance the ability of femoral component 100 to achieve high flexion in a range from about 130\ufffd to 170\ufffd, or at least above about 150\ufffd without interfering with adjacent soft tissues. [0028] Referring again to FIG. 1, there is shown line 101 tangent to distal articulating",
