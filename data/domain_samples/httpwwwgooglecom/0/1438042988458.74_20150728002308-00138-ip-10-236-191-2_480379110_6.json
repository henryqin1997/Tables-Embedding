    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40351=A possible configuration of a window portion of a polishing pad useable with the apparatus of FIG. 2 is depicted in FIG. 3. The polishing pad 40 comprises a bottom layer 42 and a top layer 44. The bottom layer 42 may be made of a felted polyurethane, such as SUBA-IV manufactured by Rodel. The top layer 44 may comprise a blown polyurethane pad, i.e., a pad filled with microspheres, such as the Rodel IC 1000 material. A thin layer of pressure sensitive adhesive 46 holds the top layer 44 and the bottom layer 42 together., 29094=In the process of fabricating modem semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs), it is necessary to form various material layers and structures over previously formed layers and structures. However, the prior formations often leave the top surface topography of an in process wafer highly irregular, with bumps, areas of unequal elevation, troughs, trenches, and/or other surface irregularities. These irregularities cause problems when forming the next layer. For example, when printing a photolithographic pattern having small geometries over previously formed layers, a very shallow depth of focus is required. Accordingly, it becomes essential to have a flat and planar surface, otherwise, some parts of the pattern will be in focus and other parts will not. In fact, surface variations on the order of less than 1000 \u212b over a 25\ufffd25 mm die would be preferable. In addition, if the irregularities are not leveled at each major processing step, the surface topography of the wafer can become even more irregular, causing further problems as the layers stack up during further processing. Depending on the die type and the size of the geometries involved, the surface irregularities can lead to poor yield and device performance. Consequently, it is desirable to effect some type of planarization, or leveling, of the IC structures. In fact, most high density IC fabrication techniques make use of some method to form a planarized wafer surface at critical points in the manufacturing process., 45347=As shown in FIG. 6, a top layer 66, comprising a blown polyurethane pad, such as Rodel IC 1000, is pressed on the adhesive on the transparent sheet 64. The top layer 66 already includes an aperture 67 formed prior to the pressing on of the top layer 66 onto the transparent sheet 64. Therefore, once the layers 60, 64, 66 are pressed together, apertures are not cut into any of the layers. This allows the transparent sheet 64 to remain intact over the aperture 62 and the bottom layer 60., 28470=This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/153,665, filed on Sep. 14, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference. This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/153,668.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. The present invention provides an effective solution to the prevention of leakage in a polishing pad that is used in a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus that employs a laser interferometer to detect the conditions of the surface of a semiconductor wafer on a polishing pad. The arrangement is relatively inexpensive and improves the performance of the laser interferometric or measuring process by reducing the amount of slurry that may diffract and attenuate the laser light. FIG. 8c depicts the top view of the polishing pad after the top layer 66 has been positioned and pressed against the adhesive on the transparent sheet 64. Top layer 66 has also had its aperture 67 cut out prior to the top layer 66 being pressed against the transparent sheet 64. The top layer 66 also includes registration notches 82 or other registration marks that are aligned with the registration marks 80 of the bottom layer 60. During assembly, the registration marks 80, 82 of the layers 60, 66 are aligned prior to the pressing down of the top layer 66 against the transparent sheet 64.",
