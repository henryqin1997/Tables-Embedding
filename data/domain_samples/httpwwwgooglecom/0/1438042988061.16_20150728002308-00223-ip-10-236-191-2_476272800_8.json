The spirit and scope of the present invention are to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims. Within the scope of the invention, the IC 100 according to FIG. 14 may also be implemented together with another arbitrary circuit function 83, on a single semiconductor substrate 90. To this extent both in each case have a monolithic construction. Such filter elements increase the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the response sensitivity of the IC 100 to high-frequency interference, including those high-frequency interfering signals which affect the useful (emergency) signal, in the event of single-wire operation by way of the ground GND in the path of the ground contact, due to a bus fault. In the simplest case, these may be analog RC low pass filters whose elements in the IC 100 are distributed circuit-topologically. They may also be quasi-digital filters, for example, those with a predetermined response time on the order of several bus bit lengths. On the other hand, such filter elements 80, 81 and 82 may also be implemented in different ways, and may have different characteristics, so as to take into account, for example, different interference possibilities in the SLEEP and NORMAL operating modes, with",
