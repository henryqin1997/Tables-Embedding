As discussed, the controller 300 includes the hardware and software for managing communications and control of the BD 100. In this embodiment, the controller 300 includes an IDT 32334 RISC microprocessor 320 for running the embedded application software and also includes flash memory 325 for storing the boot code, device data and configuration information (serial number, MAC addresses, subnet mask, and other information), the application software, routing table, and the statistical and measured data. This memory includes the program code stored therein for operating the processor 320 to perform the routing functions described herein.}",

No. 10/319,317 filed Dec. 13, 2002, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/436,778 filed May 13, 2003, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 182981=Depending on the distribution transformer, the allowable radiation limits, the configuration of the repeater, placement of repeater, and other factors, the repeater may permit communications to be transmitted through a distribution transformer for reception by a PLID and/or user device coupled to the LV power lines of the transformer and reception therefrom. Other embodiments of the repeater may include only one MV interface and therefore, may only be able to receive or transmit at any one point in time. Another embodiment of a repeater that provides isolation of networks is described in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/434,024, entitled \u201cA Power Line Communication Device and Method of Using the Same,\u201d filed May 8, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 71429=In addition to HV transmission lines, power distribution systems include MV power lines and LV power lines. As discussed, MV typically ranges from about 1000 V to about 100 kV and LV typically ranges from about 100 V to about 240 V. Transformers are used to convert between the respective voltage portions, e.g., between the HV section and the MV section and between the MV section and the LV section. Transformers have a primary side for connection to a first voltage (e.g., the MV section) and a secondary side for outputting another (usually lower) voltage (e.g., the LV section). Such transformers are often referred to as distribution transformers or a step down transformers, because they \u201cstep down\u201d the voltage to some lower voltage. Transformers, therefore, provide voltage conversion for the power distribution system. Thus, power is carried from substation transformer to a distribution transformer over one or more MV power lines. Power is carried from the distribution transformer to the customer premises via one or more LV power lines.}",

Words used herein are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitation. In addition, the advantages and objectives described herein may not be realized by each and every embodiment practicing the present invention. Further, although the invention has been described herein with reference to particular structure, materials and/or embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the particulars disclosed herein. Rather, the invention extends to all functionally equivalent structures, methods and uses, such as are within the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art, having the benefit of the teachings of this specification, may affect numerous modifications thereto and changes may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Finally, the type of data signal coupled by the coupling device may be any suitable type of data signal. The type of signal modulation used can be any suitable signal modulation used in communications (Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiplex (FDM), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM), and the like). OFDM may be used one or both of the LV and MV power lines. A modulation scheme producing a wideband signal such as CDMA that is",
