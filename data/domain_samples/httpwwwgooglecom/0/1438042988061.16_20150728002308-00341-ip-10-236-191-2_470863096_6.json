No. 10/027,431 filed on Dec. 20, 2001 (now allowed); which itself is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/520,653 filed on Mar. 07, 2000 (which is now U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,066); which is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/038,054 filed on Mar. 11, 1998 (which is now U.S. Pat. No. 6,045,588); which claims the benefit of the filing date of provisional application No. 60/045,072, filed Apr. 19, 1997; all disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference to the extent permissible by law., 34093=[0009] A further non-aqueous solvent based washing method employs liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide solvent as a washing liquid. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,467,492, highly pressurized vessels are required to perform this washing method. In accordance with these methods, pressures of about 500 to 1000 psi are required. Pressures of up to about 30 psi are approved for use in the home. The high pressure conditions employed in the carbon dioxide create safety hazards that make them unsuitable for residential use., 62214=[0057] Another method of practicing the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 8 which again begins with the loading of the machine at step 60. In the method illustrated in FIG. 8, the washing chamber is pressurized to about 20 psi at step 107. A mist of IWF solvent is sprayed onto the fabric in the washing chamber at step 108 while the fabric is being tumbled during the rotation of the washing chamber. The purpose of adding the IWF in a mist form is to provide a greater surface area coverage with less IWF volume. The increase in pressure minimizes the amount of vaporization of the IWF. The fabric is then subjected to a series of spray jets which spray IWF onto the fabric at a rate of about 10 ml/s at step 109. The application of the IWF under pressure through the jets at step 109 helps to dislodge particulates and other insoluble material from the fabric. Co-solvents are added in a ratio of approximately 1:1 at step 110 before the combination of the fabric, IWF and co-solvents are tumbled at step 111 for a time period ranging from about two (2) minutes to about five (5) minutes. The pressure is decreased at step 112 and the IWF solvents and contaminants are drained off and captured at step 113. The temperature of the mixture is increased at step 114 to the lowest boiling point, either the IWF or co-solvent, and a fractional distillation is carried out at step 115. The co-solvent is filtered and stored at step 116 while the IWF is filtered at step 117 and stored at step 118. The contaminants are disposed of at step 119. Air is introduced into the washing chamber at step 120 at about 25 CFM for a time period ranging from about three (3) minutes to about five (5) minutes for drying purposes.}",

While only certain embodiments have been set forth, alternative embodiments and various modifications will be apparent from the above description to those skilled in the art. These and other alternatives are considered equivalents and within the spirit and scope of the present invention. [0079] The cabinet 201 includes an upper assembly 206 which can include a means for shaking or vibrating the garments 203 (see step 152 in FIG. 11) as well as adding ozone/UV or applying a mist to the garments 203 (see steps 153, 154 in FIG. 11). The cabinet 201 also includes a lower housing assembly 207 which can support a moisture or misting generator 208 and a heater 209 for increasing the temperature inside the cabinet 201. The condenser, distillation apparatus, filter, storage tank and disposal means (see steps 156-160 in FIG. 11) may be attached to the cabinet 201 and housed in a manner similar to the IWF storage unit shown at 12 in FIGS. 2 and 3. [0078] An apparatus that can be used to carry out the method set forth in FIG. 11 is further illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14. Specifically, the apparatus 200 includes a main housing or cabinet 201. The cabinet 201 forms an interior region 202 for hanging garments",
