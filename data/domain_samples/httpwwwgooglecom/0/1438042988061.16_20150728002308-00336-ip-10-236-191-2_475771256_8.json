No. 60/027,204 entitled \"Incline Press Apparatus for Excercising Regions of the Upper Body\", filed Sep. 30, 1996 by Giannelli et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 58013=In the present embodiment, the selectable weight plates 24 preferably have a total mass of 400 lbs, which is twice the conventional mass (200lbs) utilized with a incline press machine. Also in the present embodiment, the selected weight plates 24 travel at approximately half the speed of a selected weight plate of a conventional incline press machine, therefore, the selected weight also is subjected to approximately half the acceleration over approximately half the distance of a conventional selected weight plate utilized with an incline press machine. The distance \"W\" (FIG. 2) that the selected weight plates travel is approximately 22.5% of the distance \"DC\" (FIG. 2) traveled by a user's hand, in the present embodiment, as measured by the distance between the vertical positions of handles 16a and 16b at the start and stop of the exercise. The distance \"DC\" is a function of the length of the user's arm. The distance a user's hand travels from the beginning to the end of one repetition of the exercise defines a complete range of motion. Although the mass is doubled, the total load the user feels during the performance of an exercise routine is the same as with a conventional incline press machine. This effect is achieved by changing the mechanical advantage to increase the leverage the user has over the selected weight plates from 1.8:1 (force exerted by user:weight) in a conventional system, to a 0.9:1 ratio in the present embodiment. The ratio is changed by attaching cable, 58 at an appropriate attachment point along primary lever arms 36a and 36b, in the present embodiment, as determined by conventional engineering techniques.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiment disclosed herein. For example, all lengths and angles given are approximate and may be varied by one of skill in the art, the machine may be utilized with, or without a high-mass, short-travel weight stack, the machine may be utilized with or without a seat, the primary lever arms may be parallel without substantially effecting the biomechanical alignment of the user's joints. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of a preferred embodiment. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope spirit of the invention. The handles 16a and 16b move along the same path of travel, but in the downward direction, until the handles are returned to the starting position. As the user allows the handles to move toward the starting position, the four-bar linkages travel through the tilted planes once again, this time in the inward direction with respect to the user. While the user is allowing the handles 16a and 16b to return to the starting position, the selected weights are moving in a vertical, downward direction, within the housing 22. Once the user reaches the starting point of the exercise, one repetition has been completed through the range of motion of the user. As the user continues to move handles 16a and 16b in the outward direction, due",
