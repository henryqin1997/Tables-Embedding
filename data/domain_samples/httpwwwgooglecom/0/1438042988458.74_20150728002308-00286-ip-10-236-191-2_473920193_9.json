    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with primary emphasis on the preferred embodiments, it should be understood that various modifications can be made in the design and operation of the embodiments described without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the first electrode 46 should be placed from about 10 cm to about 16 cm from the end electrode 50 and the spacing of electrodes 46 and 48 should be about 1 to 10 mm. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the following claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore to be embraced therein. For uses with acute instrumentation systems, however, the electrode sizes could be in 1 mm2 range, provided the acute interwire impedances of the filament were high, relative to the surrounding conducting medium in which a reference electrode is placed. In the embodiment of FIGS. 7A and 7B, if the filament diameter D2 is in the range of 2 mm, an electrode width D1 of about 1.27 and a dimension D5 in the hemicyclical dimension of about 3.14 mm linear length around the filament provides the minimum acceptable electrode surface area of 4 mm2 for pacemaker applications. An even more optimal design may",
