It should also be noted that although the light source 10 is disclosed as a portable unit, it may also be provided as a stationary unit dedicated to a particular mold and may be provided as part of an automated operation. Further, it should also be understood that the vapor provided above the mold surface for forming the barrier layer may be provided by other means than the conduit disclosed, such as in a vapor chamber or by other means for providing vapor to the surface. Alternatively, the barrier layer 30 may be defined by a gas layer formed adjacent to the surface 26. For example an inert gas, such as dry nitrogen or other gas which does not contain oxygen, may be dispensed as the gaseous vapor from conduit 22, as illustrated in FIG. 2. As the gas forms a layer at the surface 26, it purges the oxygen from the entire area impinged by the laser light 32, thereby preventing oxidation from occurring. It should be noted that although water",
