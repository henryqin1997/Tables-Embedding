Top and side-views of an example embodiment of a disk-shaped element 1200 that may be used for this purpose are shown in FIGS. 12A-B, respectively. An example of one such disk-shaped element is part number CD11BB, manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. In the example shown in FIGS. 12A-B, the disk-shaped element 1200 includes a flat, disk-shaped metal support 1202, and a flat, disk-shaped section of piezoceramic material 1210 concentrically arranged on a top surface 1204 of the support disk 1202. As shown, conductors 1206 a-b may be connected, respectively, to a top surface 1208 of the piezoceramic disk 1210 and to a portion 1212 of the conductive support disk 1202., 112420=FIG. 11 illustrates how the embodiments of FIGS. 8-10 may be modified by disposing a masse of damping foam 1102, or the like, on the distal end 812 of the circuit board section 710. In the embodiment shown, an opening 1104 in the damping foam 1102 surrounds the distal end 812 and the weight 806 such that inner surfaces 1106 and 1108 of the damping foam 1102 exert compression forces on the weight 806 and the distal end 812 to hold the damping foam 1102 in place on the distal end 812 of the circuit board section 710. The damping foam 1102 may, for example, be placed near or in contact with a casing (not shown) in which the circuit board 802 is disposed. In such an embodiment, the damping foam 1102 may contact the casing when the distal end 812 of the circuit board section 710 moves, and thereby dampen the motion of the distal end 812. The use of the damping foam 1102, or the like, in this manner may, for example, reduce the ringing in the signal output by the transducer 404., 118172=In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 14, the amplifier 1402 is coupled to the element 1406 to receive and amplify a signal generated thereby. The controller 1404 in the embodiment shown may, for example, include a microprocessor which includes an on-board analog-to-digital converter. The controller 1404 in such an embodiment may, for example, convert the output of the amplifier 1402 into a digital signal and analyze the digital signal to monitor the acceleration of an object. The purpose and function of each of the other components will be readily understood to one skilled in the art, and therefore will not be discussed further., 118865=When the circuit 1400 is disposed on a circuit board (e.g., the circuit board 802 of FIGS. 8, 10, and 11) such that the element 1406 generates a signal responsive to flexing of the circuit board (or a portion thereof), the element 1406 and circuit board together function as an accelerometer. Therefore, any circuit board may conceivably be modified to sense acceleration of an object to which it is attached simply by properly placing a transducer on the circuit board so as to generate a signal responsive to the flexing of the circuit board., 88924=Therefore, as illustrated in FIGS. 4A-C: (1) when the beam 302 is unflexed (FIG. 4A), the lower portion 416 of the transducer 404 has a length D3; (2) when the beam 302 is flexed downward (FIG. 4B), the lower portion 416 of the transducer 404 has a length D3\u2032 (which is longer than the length D3); and (3) when the beam 302 is flexed upward (FIG. 4C), the lower portion 416 of the transducer 404 has a length D3\u2033 (which is shorter than the length D3). The transducer 404 in the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-C therefore generates a signal responsive to such changes in the length D3 of its lower portion 416., 87533=As shown in FIGS. 4A-C: (1) when the beam 302 is unflexed (FIG. 4A), there is a distance D2 between the locations 406 a and 406 b; (2) when the beam 302 is flexed downward (FIG. 4B), there is a distance D2\u2032 (which is longer than the distance D2) between the locations 406 a and 406 b; and (3) when the beam 302 is flexed upward (FIG. 4C), there is a distance D2\u2033 (which is shorter than the distance D2) between the locations 406 a and 406 b. In the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-C, supports 408 a and 408 b (e.g., metal or plastic members used to support the transducer 404 on the beam 302) are disposed on opposite ends of the transducer 404 and are fixedly secured to the locations 406 a and 406 b, respectively, so that the changes in the dimension D2 that occur when the beam 302 flexes also cause the length D3 of a lower portion 416 of the transducer 404 to change accordingly. It should be appreciated that the supports 408 a and 408 b, when used, can take on any of numerous forms, and that the invention is not limited to any particular type of supports., 114705=FIG. 13 illustrates an example of how the disk-shaped element 1200 of FIG. 12 may be supported by a base 1302 (i.e., an object whose acceleration is to be monitored) so that a signal generated between the conductors 1206 a-b of the element 1200 is indicative of the acceleration of the base 1302 (the object). In the example shown, an outer portion 1310 of the support disk 1202 is secured to (e.g., using an epoxy or other substance or technique) a circular shelf 1306 of the base 1302. As shown, a cylindrical ledge 1312 drops off from the circular shelf 1306 to form a cavity 1308 within the base 1302. When the base 1302 (the object) is accelerated, the support disk 1202 is caused to flex such that a center portion 1304 of the support disk 1202 is caused to move up and down within the cavity 1308 of the base, 1302 (as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 13). Because the piezoceramic disk 1210 generates a signal in response to the flexing of the support disk 1202, the signal generated between the conductors 1206 a-b when the base 1302 (the object) is accelerated is indicative of the acceleration of the base 1302. A controller (not shown) may be coupled to the conductors 1206 to receive the output signal therefrom, and may monitor the signal to monitor the acceleration of the base 1302., 91896=FIGS. 5A-C show another example of how a transducer 404, e.g., a piezoceramic element, a piezoresistive element, or the like, may be supported by a flexible structure, e.g., the beam 302 or another suitable structure, so as to generate a signal responsive to changes in one or more characteristic of the structure that occur when the structure flexes. Therefore, when the beam 302 of the embodiment of FIGS. 5A-C is attached to an object (not shown) so that the beam. 302 is caused to flex in response to acceleration of the object, the output of the transducer 404 is indicative of the acceleration of the object. As discussed above, a controller (not shown) may be coupled to the transducer 404 to receive the output signal therefrom, and may monitor the signal to monitor the acceleration of the object. In the embodiment of FIGS. 5A-C, the transducer 404 primarily monitors changes in a surface dimension of the beam 302, i.e., a distance between the locations 406 a and 406 b on the top surface 410 of the beam 302., 96902=FIGS. 6A-C illustrate an example of how a flexible structure (e.g., the beam 302) and one or more transducers 404 a-b may be configured and arranged such that mounting of each transducer 404 on the beam 302 does not substantially affect the position of a neutral axis 418 which passes through a unit 600 (including both the beam 302 and the transducer(s) 404) when the unit 600 is flexed. As shown in FIGS. 6A-C, the neutral axis 418 of the unit 600 is the axis that (when the unit 600 is flexed) separates the portion 602 of the unit 600 that is subjected to tension forces from the portion 604 of the unit 600 that is subjected to compression forces. The location of the neutral axis 418 may be affected, for example, by the relative sizes, positions, and flexibilities of the beam 302 and the transducer(s) 404, and/or the manner in which such elements are interconnected., 116919=FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram showing an illustrative embodiment of an electronic circuit 1400 in which an element 1406 used as a transducer to monitor the flexing or other characteristics of a structure in response to acceleration of an object to which the structure is attached may be included. The element 1406 may correspond, for example, to the transducer 404 of FIGS. 4-6 and 7-11, to the capacitor 708 of FIG. 7, or the disk-shaped element 1200 of FIGS. 12 and 13. The components in the circuit 1400 (other than the element 1406) may, for example, be included in the additional circuitry 804 shown in FIGS. 8, 10, and 11. In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 14, the element 1406 has a well-defined capacitance associated therewith (e.g., it may be a capacitor having a piezoceramic or another piezoelectric dielectric), and is therefore used as a capacitor C1 in the circuit 1400, in addition to being used as a transducer. In the example shown, the circuit 1400 additionally includes an amplifier 1402, a controller 1404, capacitors C2-C5, and resistors R1-R5., 116225=In some embodiments, the characteristics of the piezoceramic disk 1210 and the support disk 1202, and the physical relationships therebetween, may be similar to the characteristics of, and the physical relationships between, the beams 302 or other surfaces and the transducers 404 used therewith discussed above in connection with FIGS. 4-6. For example, in some embodiments, the relative flexibilities of the support disk 1202 and the piezoceramic disk 1210 may be such that the neutral axis of the combination passes through the support disk 1202 regardless of whether the piezoceramic disk 1210 is attached thereto., 89692=Additionally, in the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-C, the supports 408 a and 408 b and/or the transducer 404 are constructed and arranged so that a bottom surface 412 of the transducer 404 is held in direct contact with the top surface 410 of the beam 302 when the beam 302 flexes. In one embodiment, the supports 408 a and 408 b are rigid enough and are secured to the top surface 410 in such a manner that the physical relationship between each of the supports 408 a and 408 b and the top surface 410 of the beam 302 is not altered when the beam 302 flexes. This configuration forces the curvature of the bottom surface 412 of the transducer 404 to mimic the curvature of the top surface 410 of the beam 302. In this manner, as shown in FIGS. 4A-C, an upper portion 414 of the transducer 404 elongates from a length D4 (FIG. 4A) to a length D4\u2032 (FIG. 4B) when the beam 302 is flexed downward, and shortens from the length D4 (FIG. 4A) to a length D4\u2033 (FIG. 4C) when the beam 302 is flexed upward. Therefore, in the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-C, the signal generated by the transducer 404 also is responsive to changes in the length D4 of its upper portion 414 that occur as a result of the curvature of the bottom surface 412 of the transducer 404 mimicking the curvature of the top surface 410 of the beam 302., 97937=In the illustrative embodiment of FIGS. 6A-C, the position of the neutral axis 418 of the unit 600 is located at substantially the same location: (a) when both of the transducers 404 a and 404 b are attached to the beam 302 (FIG. 6A); (b) when only the transducer 404 b is attached to the beam 302 (FIG. 6B); and (c) when neither of the traducers 404 a and 404 b is attached to the beam 302 (FIG. 6C). Therefore, the attachment or removal of either (FIG. 6B) or both (FIG. 6C) of the transducers 404 a and 404 b to or from the beam 302 does not substantially affect the position of the neutral axis 418 that passes through the unit 600. In the particular embodiment shown, the neutral axis 418 passes only through the beam 302, and does not pass trough either of the transducers 404 a and 404 b, regardless of whether either or both of the traducers 404 a and 404 b are attached to the beam 302. It should be understood that the other embodiments of the invention described herein may also incorporate this aspect of the invention. For example, in each of FIGS. 4B-C and 5B-C, the transducer 404 and the beam 302 (or another structure) may be constructed and arranged such that the position of the neutral axis 418 passes only through the beam 302, regardless of whether the transducer 404 is mounted thereto., 111056=FIG. 10 shows how the embodiment of FIGS. 8 and 9 may be modified by disposing a shear damper 1002 on a top surface of the circuit board section 710. The shear damper 1002 may, for example, be made of a material (e.g., plastic, metal, glass, fiberglass, or the like) that is substantially more rigid than the circuit board section 710. The use of such a shear damper may, for example, reduce the vibration of the circuit board section 710, and/or cause the circuit board section 710 to flex primarily at the location 810 when the section 816 of the circuit board 802 (or an object to which the section 816 is attached) is accelerated. While a shear damper 1002 of a particular shape (i.e., the same shape as the circuit board section 710) is used in the FIG. 10 embodiment, it should be appreciated that devices of other shapes which also are capable of dampening the shear of the circuit board section 710 may alternatively be employed, and that the invention is not limited to the particular shape of shear damper shown. It should also be appreciated that additional shear dampers may also be disposed on the circuit board section 710, e.g., one on each side, and that the invention is not limited to the use of a single shear dampening device., 99560=Referring back to the device 200 of FIG. 2, it should be appreciated that, although a neutral axis of the unit including the circular conductor 212 and both of the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b may pass through the circular conductor 212 (when the unit flexes), because of the structure, size, and position of the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b, the removal of either of the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b would substantially affect the location of the unit's neutral axis. In fact, it appears that the removal of only one of the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b from the circular conductor 212 would cause the neutral axis of the unit including the circular conductor 212 and the remaining piezoceramnic element 204 to pass exclusively through the remaining piezoceramic element 204. Therefore, in contrast to the example of FIGS. 6A-C, the presence of each of the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b in the FIG. 2 device has a substantial effect on the flexibility of the unit including the circular conductor 212 and the piezoceramic elements 204 a and 204 b., 87104=In the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-C, the transducer 404 is supported by the beam 302 so as to monitor changes in a surface dimension of the beam 302 (i.e., a distance between locations 406 a and 406 b on a top surface 410 of the beam 302), as well as changes in the curvature of the top surface 410, that occur when the beam 302 flexes., 93034=As shown in FIGS. 5A-C, the transducer 404 may be secured to the locations 406 a and 406 b on the top surface 410 of the beam 302 using the supports 408 a and 408 b, respectively, so that a gap 502 is formed between the bottom surface 412 of the transducer 404 and the top surface 410 of the beam 302. In the illustrative embodiment of FIGS. 5A-C, the supports 408 a and 408 b are made of a material that is flexible enough that the supports 408 a and 408 b are allowed to deform slightly when the beam 302 flexes. In this manner, when the beam 302 flexes, the curvature of the transducer 404 is not altered significantly, but the transducer 404 is elongated or shortened in the directions indicated by the arrows in FIGS. 5B and 5C.}",
