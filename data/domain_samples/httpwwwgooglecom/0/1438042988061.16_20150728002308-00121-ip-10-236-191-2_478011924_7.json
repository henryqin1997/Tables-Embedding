    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, a method and apparatus for reclaiming existing fields in an address translation data structure have been described. It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It should be noted that the existing fields within the active address translation data structures can be interpreted and used in a variety of ways other than those described above without loss of generality. The functionalities described above with reference to the \u201cG/H\u201d bit, the independently settable \u201cR\u201d, \u201cW\u201d and \u201cX\u201d bits and the combination of the \u201cU/S\u201d bit with one AVAIL bit can be achieved simultaneously by redefining the meanings of the 3 existing \u201cP\u201d, \u201cR/W\u201d and \u201cU/S\u201d bits and combining them with the 3 reclaimed AVAIL bits. Specifically, three of the resulting six bits may be used as independently settable \u201cR\u201d, \u201cW\u201d and \u201cX\u201d bits, two of the remaining three bits may be used to indicate the highest ring at which the code has access rights, and the last bit can be used as a \u201cG/H\u201d bit. For this interpretation of the bits, the page may be considered",
