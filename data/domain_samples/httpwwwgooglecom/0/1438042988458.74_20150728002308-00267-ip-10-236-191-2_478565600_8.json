Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the claims included below. The present invention also comprises a hybrid system that uses the set of candidates with associated probabilities from one or more recognition systems and that resolves the ambiguity in that set by using certain known characteristics of the language. The resolution of the ambiguity from the handwriting/speech recognition improves the recognition rate of the system to improve the user friendliness. One embodiment of the invention, the simultaneous use of one linguistic back end for multiple input modalities, e.g. speech recognition, handwriting recognition, keyboard input on hard keys or touch screen is provided. In another embodiment of the invention, a linguistic back end is used for disambiguating the word candidates. After a back end component combines the input candidates from the front end to determine word candidates and their likelihood of matching, a linguistic back end is used for ranking the word candidates according to linguistic characteristics. For example, the linguistic back end further combines uses the frequencies of words, e.g. in the language, used by the user, in an article being composed by the user, in a context the",
