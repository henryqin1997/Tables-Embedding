An economical method of destroying the organic contaminants by incineration has been described in my U.S. Pat. No. 3,455,089 issued July 15, 1970 entitled \"Process For Removing Organic Contaminants From Air\". Also, an economical method of recovering these contaminants has been described in my U.S. Pat. No. 3,534,529 issued Oct. 20, 1970 entitled \"Process For Recovering Organic Vapors From Air Streams\". The two processes described in these patents involve cyclic operations and therefore could not provide the economy and flexibility of the continuous process described in my U.S. Pat. No. 4,231,764 issued Nov. 4, 1980 entitled \"System For Removing Organic Contaminants From Air\". The process of this patent utilizes a multi-stage fluid bed adsorption system; one stage for countercurrent adsorption, two or more stages for regeneration and one stage for cooling. While this process offered many advantages over previous processes, it also presented disadvantages which limited its acceptance in industry. These diadvantages included the high energy cost to maintain fluidization of the adsorbent, gradual attrition of the fluidized adsorbent, inability to process varying flow streams and the limiting vapor velocity required to avoid entrainment of the adsorbent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the invention. (4) ability to obtain a 50 to 100 fold increase in vapor concentration with a corresponding reduction in volumetric gas flow. (3) a novel regenerating system which assures more complete regeneration of the adsorbent and thereby permits a higher removal efficiency; (2) a novel system for removing organic vapors in a safe and continuous manner; (1) an efficient and economical system for recovering organic vapors from gas streams and concentrating them to a much higher level; The present invention provides the following advantageous features: The flow sheets described in FIGS. 4 and 5 can be modified so as to provide both solvent recovery and incineration. A portion of the product stream would then be incinerated to provide the heat and inert gas required for the regeneration and cooling systems. The working load on the adsorbent is conservatively estimated to be 10 lbs. of solvent to 100 lbs. of adsorbent. The regeneration and hot sweep gas temperature should be at approximately 300\ufffd F. Sufficient cooled regenerating gas is recycled to the organic vapor-laden air feed stream so as to increase the solvent concentration from about 200 ppm to about 500 ppm. Based on standard isotherms",
