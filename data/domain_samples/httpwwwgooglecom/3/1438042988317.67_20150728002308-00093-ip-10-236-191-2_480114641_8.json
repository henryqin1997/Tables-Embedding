Thus, while only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will be apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. [0066] It should be appreciated that a faster random memory access could be achieved by increasing the number of sub-entries in a VWB entry. However, increasing the number of sub-entries will consume more space in VWB table 510. For instance, if each of sub-entries 515 points to an incremental 1 KB offset in VWB entry 515-1, six sub-entries (e.g. 515-5A through 515-F) are required. On the other, if each of sub-entries 515 points to an incremental 6 KB offset in VWB entry 515-1, only a single sub-entry (e.g. 515-5A) is required. [0065] As shown in FIG. 5B, a VWB entry 515-1 is allocated to VWB table 510 in NC 120. The size of the private buffer represented by VWB entry 515-1 is 16 KB that is mapped into host memory 115. At this point, no actual physical address of local memory 125 is associated with VWB entry 515-1. VWB 515-1 is made up of eight sub-entries 515-1A through 515-1H. Each of sub-entries 515 points to an incremental 2 KB offset in",
