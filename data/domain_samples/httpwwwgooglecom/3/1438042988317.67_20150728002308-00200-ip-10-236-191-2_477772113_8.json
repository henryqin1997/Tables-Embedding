    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31235=FIGS. 3 and 4 show an asymmetrical distribution of the heating power between the two heating resistances R1, R2 in the ratios of 3:1 and 1:3, respectively. If the two switches S1, S2 are alternately closed for unequal periods of time, an asymmetrical distribution of the heating power is established within the total system, while at the same time the total current input remains constant. This asymmetrical distribution makes it possible in an advantageous manner to toast pieces of bread or other substances with toastable surfaces that differ from one another, so that adjustments can be made for taking into account their dissimilarities. In the case of a baking oven, this makes it possible to distribute heat between the upper and lower zones of the oven while at the same time the power input remains constant., 14769=Since, in the case of phase-angle power control the first portion of each half-wave is cutoff, the application of this control technique requires as a matter of principle special measures to minimize effects that result in interference being fed back into the power supply system. Since the loads connected to the power supply system are not connected to one another, and since, therefore, the individual current-pause periods will have a statistically random distribution, these current-phase periods must, in the case of many loads, overlap each other in such a way that they cease to be apparent at the electricity generating plant. For this reason, in cases involving relatively high power levels, the current-pause or multicycle-burst control techniques have generally favorable effects on the power supply system. For controlling the power input to high-rating loads, especially those with a certain lag characteristic, such as heating resistances, repetitive cycling by means of the generally preferably multicycle-burst control technique is nevertheless subject to very rigorous restrictions because of the presence of so-called flicker standards (e.g. EN 60555, Part 3). Because of the fact that, for a given supply-system line impedance, the switching of a load will always give rise to fluctuations in the supply-system line voltage, which, in turn, will give rise to noticeable fluctuations in the intensity of the light produced by any illuminating devices connected at the time, narrow limits are set with respect to repetitive cycling of loads because of the existence of flicker standards, i.e., standards that specify permissible cycling rates. In practice, this results in very low permissible cycling rates in cases involving the repetitive cycling of high heating power, as required particularly in household appliances, such as toasters and stoves. For example, in the case of a 1500 W heating system on a 230 V public power supply system, the permissible cycling rate is limited to approximately 11 switching operations per minute (calculated from the percentage voltage drop as the prescribed standard supply-system line impedance of 0.4+0.25i ohm and read from the permissible flicker curve). This low permissible cycling rate is only of little practical value, especially in cases involving open toaster-type heating elements with very small heating time constants because switching-off results in a rapidly following loss of the shorter-wave length infrared radiation that is significant with respect to the toasting process., 30793=If both switches S1, S2 are alternately closed for equal periods of time, i.e., if only one switch S1 , S2 is closed at any given time, the heat output of the total system corresponds to the single output of an individual heating element R1, R2. This corresponds to a symmetrical distribution of the heating power in the ratio 1:1 as illustrated in FIG. 5., 29649=FIGS. 3-5 are diagrams showing examples of asymmetrical and symmetrical heating power distributions in the ratios 3:1, 1:3 and 1:1, respectively.}",

FIG. 2 of the drawing shows an I2 (t) diagram for the first heating resistance R1, an I2 (t) diagram for the second heating resistance R2, and a I(t) diagram for showing the current input to the total system as a function of time, wherein the diagrams represent the conditions which are established when the switches S1, S2 are activated in accordance with the invention. FIGS. 3 and 4 show an asymmetrical distribution of the heating power between the two heating resistances R1, R2 in the ratios of 3:1 and 1:3, respectively.
