The rules/constraints menu 3501 provides a plurality of options 3502 that enable the user to prescribe optimization rules and constraints according to product classes as well as across store rules and group-to-group rules. Such rules, being at levels much lower that those specified according to the at-large rules template 1400 of FIG. 14, are more readily prescribed by selecting a configured scenario and then enabling the rules/constraints menu 3501.}",

This application is related to the following co-pending U.S. patent applications, all of which have a common assignee and common inventors., 160707=In addition to these general rules, the at-large rules template 1400 provides the user with an individual product max decline/min increase field 1408 and an individual product min decline/max increase field 1409. The individual product fields 1408, 1409 allow the user to enter limits for the swing of individual product prices determined by the optimization. The at-large rules template 1400 also has a demand group max decline/min increase field 1410 and a demand group min decline/max increase field 1412. The demand group fields allow the user to constrain price swings in the optimization over an entire demand group. A next button 1412 allows the user to proceed to the next template in the new scenario configuration wizard.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiments as a basis for designing or modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention, and that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, the present invention has been presented in terms of several merchandising levers, and specifically in terms of a price lever, whereby prices are optimized to maximize a user-selected figure of merit. Price is a well understood lever, but scope of the present invention is not constrained to price. Any well understood merchandising lever, the manipulation of whose attributes can be quantified and estimated with respect to consumer demand and whose associated costs can be determined via an activity based cost model are contemplated by the present invention. Such levers include space, assortment, logistics, and promotion. In addition, the present invention has been particularly characterized in terms of servers, controllers, and management logic for optimization of various merchandising parameters. These elements of the present invention can also be embodied as application program modules that are executed on a Windows NT\ufffd- or Unix\ufffd-based operating system. Although the present invention and its objects, features, and advantages have been described in detail, other embodiments are encompassed by the invention as well.",
