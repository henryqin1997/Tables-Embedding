    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{102107=The phage libraries contain between 108-109 distinct phage particles. At the outset, there are approximately 100-1000 copies of each phage particle. Therefore, there are a total of approximately 1010-1011 phage particles in the first screen. The goal of enrichment is to select only those phage particles that bind specifically and with high affinity to the target antibody. Typically, between 105-106 binding phage are recovered during the first round of screening. Many of the phage often represent redundant particles., 34756=Quality control is an important aspect of any clinical assay. To assure that clinical test results are accurate, controls should be run with all in vitro diagnostic tests. Quality control in the clinical laboratory is mandated by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA '88). This act outlines the regulatory requirements that a clinical laboratory must meet in order to obtain accreditation; controls and proficiency testing comprise a significant portion of the act. Many tests in the hematology and chemistry sections of the laboratory include controls that are provided by the manufacturer. In contrast, most histology laboratories generate their own controls from excess tissue specimens. With laboratories generating their own control tissues, there is little inter-laboratory standardization. The need for better quality control of immunoreagents was recognized in the late 1980's and led to workshops convened by the Biological Stain Commission to address the issue., 84300=From general experience with peptide mapping, only approximately 5-10% of monoclonal antibodies bind to linear epitopes. The remaining epitopes are conformational (discontinuous). Therefore, an alternative method of identifying antibody-binding peptides is required. To identify discontinuous epitopes, the preferred method of peptide identification is known as phage display. Phage display, the display of genetically encoded diversity on the surface of M13 filamentous bacteriophage, allows the production and screening of tens of millions of proteins and peptides in a few weeks (Ladner, R. and S. Guterman, in W090/02809 (1990), the teachings of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.; Ladner, R., et al., Directed Evolution of Novel Binding Proteins, (1993) U.S.; Wells, J. and H. Lowman, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., (1992) 3(4): p.355-362) (McLafferty, M., et al., Gene, (1993)) 128:p.29-36; Clackson, T. and J. Wells, TIBTECH, (1994) 12: p. 173-184), the teachings of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. The organisms containing those peptides that have the desired binding characteristics can be replicated, allowing repeated screening with increased stringency and amplification of the ligands. After a few rounds of screening and amplification, the peptides that remain are the higher affinity binders to the target molecule. Phage display is recognized as an efficient method of producing proteins and peptides that bind to targets of interest. (Ladner, R. and S. Guterman, in International patent application W090/02809 (1990); Ladner, R., et al., Directed Evolution of Novel Binding, Proteins, (1993) U.S.; Roberts, B., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sei.

Binding is allowed to occur at 25\ufffd C. for 1 hour, while rotating on a nutating agitator.}",
