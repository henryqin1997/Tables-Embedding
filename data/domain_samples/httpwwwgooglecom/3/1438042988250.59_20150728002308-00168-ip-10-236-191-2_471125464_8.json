    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It may be appreciated from the description above that a dynamic re-programmable logic array has been described in detail. Thus, while the invention has been particularly shown and described in detail with reference to only one embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the present invention only be limited by the appended claims. The operation of this circuit is similar to that described above with reference to the element 18-1 (FIG. 1). Assume the flip-flop 70 is set and flip-flops 71 and 72 are reset. Thus, if the LOAD signal is at a high level, bit line BLa is at a high level while bit lines BLb and BLc are at a low level. If a high-level signal is supplied on the word line WLx at this time, the transistor Q56 will turn on and a charge will be placed on the capacitor C51. Hence, the transistor Q53 will be on and the transistors Q54 and Q55 will be off (bit lines BLb and BLc were at a low level). Therefore, the output signal appearing on Ox will be transferred through Q53 to the output OUT. If the flip-flop 71 is set and 70 and 72 are reset, the output appearing on Ox will",
