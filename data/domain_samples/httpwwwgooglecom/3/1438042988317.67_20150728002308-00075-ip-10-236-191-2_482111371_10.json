    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{112275=If the modification of the URL to the absolute URL could cause the last TCP segment of the GET request to overflow to another segment, a new TCP segment would need to be constructed and injected by the proxy redirector. The proxy redirector would then need to have the capability to retransmit this segment if it was lost. Thus, the proxy redirector would need to have some TCP layer functionalities. In order to avoid adding higher level functionality to the proxy redirector, segment sizes are limited to less than what the proxy cache is actually capable of receiving. When the complete URL is transformed to an extended URL, the maximum increase in size is 22 bytes, equal to the maximum length of an IP address of 15 bytes plus 7 bytes from the prefix: http://. The client is deceived to send segments whose maximum size is 22 bytes less than what the protocol allows it to send. The TCP segment size sent by the client is determined by what the proxy cache, in its handshake with the client, indicates as the maximum segment size it can receive. This is indicates by the proxy cache through the maximum segment size (MSS) field in the ACK SYN packet. Accordingly, the proxy redirector 104 intercepts the ACK SYN packets and decreases the specified MSS amount by 22. For example, if the MSS specified by the proxy cache is 1460, it is modified to 1438 by the proxy redirector before being sent to the client. When the client next sends a GET request, the TCP segments are limited to 1438 bytes. In the worst case, when the client sends a GET request, 22 bytes will be added to the xth TCP segment that carries this request. The length of this xth TCP segment will still then be within the maximum length specified by the proxy cache. If the event that the proxy cache does not stipulate a maximum MSS in the ACK SYN packet, the default used by the client is 536 bytes. An MSS option is then added by the proxy redirector to inform the client that the maximum MSS expected by the other end of the TCP connection is 514 bytes., 80142=In the preferred embodiment described herein, proxy redirector 104 includes a programmable network element of the type described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/190,355, filed Nov. 12, 1998, which application is incorporated herein by reference. As described in that application, that programmable network element in the preferred embodiment runs on a Linux machine. As shown in FIG. 2, the programmable network element 200 includes a dispatcher process 202 with which plural different gateway programs (204, 205 and 206) register and request access to IP packets that fit specific descriptions. Such programs are loaded through an admission daemon 210 via a local program injector 211 or a remote program injector 212. A gateway program, for example, can request access to incoming packets to network interface 208 that match certain source and destination IP address ranges and port numbers. The dispatcher process 202 uses a packet filter 203 in the Linux kernel 201 to obtain packets requested by the gateway programs and uses a raw IP socket 215 to send packets that have been manipulated in accordance with the gateway program back to the kernel for output back to the network through filter 203 through network interfaces 208. Library functions are provided in the programmable network element that enable a gateway program to communicate with the dispatcher process 202 to register rules that specify the type of IP packets that a gateway program wants diverted to it. A gateway program can request either a complete IP packet or only the IP and TCP header of a packet and can change both the header and payload of a packet., 97365=on a GET packet that arrives at proxy redirector 104 from a client 101-1. The packet is destined to an origin server at a destination IP address (daddr) 204.71.200.244 (www.yahoo.com) at a destination port (dport) 80, requesting object /a/ya/yahoomail/promo1.gif. As can be noted in the modified packet, the packet is redirected to a proxy cache 110-1 at IP address 135.104.25.31 port 7000 by changing the daddr and dport header information. Also, the complete URL of the object in the GET request is modified in the translated packet by prefixing it with http://204.71.200.244 to form the absolute URL, where that prefix is obtained from the daddr header in the arriving packet. This transformation increases the length of the packet by 21 bytes so that the pkt_len field in the header is modified from 346 to 367 bytes. Further, the source port is modified to a bogus port number by changing sport to 5000.}",
