    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although various embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the present invention are covered by the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention. For example, although particular network architectures were used to illustrate the present invention, it can be appreciated that other architectures can be used instead. Similarly, although particular types of database commands have been illustrated, other types of commands will also fall within the scope of the invention. Finally, although software or hardware are described to control certain functions, such functions can be performed using either software, hardware or a combination of software and hardware, as is well known in the art. As is also known, software may be stored on a medium, such as, for example, a hard or floppy disk or a Compact Disk Read Only Memory (CD-ROM), in the form of instructions adapted to be executed by a processor. The instructions may be stored on the medium in a compressed and/or encrypted format. As used herein, the phrase \u201cadapted to be executed by a processor\u201d is meant to encompass instructions stored in a compressed and/or encrypted format, as well as instructions that have to be compiled or installed by an installer before being executed by the processor. Several optimizations are possible to the AVA3 protocol described here. For",
