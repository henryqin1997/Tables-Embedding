    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the Patent Statutes and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use such specialized components as are required. However, it is to be understood that the invention can be carried out by specifically different equipment and devices, and that various modifications, both as to the equipment details and operating procedures, can be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself. In operation the discrete anode array provides a level of resolution that may be designed to meet predefined objectives. The number of discrete anodes may be varied to provide a predetermined resolution. Other anode configurations are also possible because the microchannel plate preserves the spatial distribution of the radiation pattern. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the electronics may be embodied in surface mounted electronics within a spatial sensor. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the comparator 58 serves to reject low amplitude noise pulses originating in the detector. It also acts as a one-bit analog to digital converter to prepare the incoming pulses for digital counting. The eight-bit counter 60 integrates all pulses during a sample period. The latch 64 stores the resulting total count. The counter 60 is then free to reset and begin accumulating the next frame of data.",
