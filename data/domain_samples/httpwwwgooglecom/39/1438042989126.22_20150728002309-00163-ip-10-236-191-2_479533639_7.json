    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the above description of the invention, those skilled in the art will perceive improvements, changes and modifications. Such improvements, changes and modifications within the skill of the art are intended to be covered by the appended claims. It is contemplated that the cannula 10 described herein could be the centerpiece of a endoscopic surgical kit which would include an assortment of surgical instruments designed and/or selected for use with the cannula. The expandable second tubular portion 40 of the cannula 10 provides a significantly larger working area for the surgeon inside the body 130 within the confines of the cannula. As a result, the simultaneous use of a number of endoscopic surgical instruments, including but not limited to steerable instruments, shavers, dissectors, scissors, forceps, retractors, dilators, and video cameras, is made possible by the expandable cannula 10. ) can be received through the cannula 10 and inserted into a patient's body 130. FIG. 5 Next, the expansion tool 112 is inserted into the passage 16 in the cannula 10 until the frustoconical end section 114 is located at the second end 62 of the second tubular portion 40. The legs 114 of the expansion tool 112 are manually separated, causing the frustoconical halves 118 to separate also. As the halves 118 separate, a radially outward directed force is exerted on the inner surface 70 of the second tubular portion",
