B. Raper and D. I. Fennell, 1965. The Genus Aspergillus, Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore) based on the black colony colors, biseriate and radiate conidial heads; globose vesicles; and globose, echinulate conidia. A. niger is separated from the other species in this group on conidial characteristics., 19857=Colonies growing slowly; attaining a diameter of 30-32 nun on Czapek's agar; 34-36 mm on malt-extract agar in 5 days at 27\ufffd C. On Czapek's agar, mycelium is loose, hyaline, submerged, bearing abundant erect conidiophores, black to dark brown black, Blackish Brown, Chaetura Black, Plumbeous Black, (capitalized colors names are from Ridgway, R. 1912. Color Standards and Nomenclature. Published by the author, Washington, D.C., 1912) reverse colorless. Conidial heads at first globose, conidial columns soon splitting to appear radiate, biseriate with conidiogeneous cells borne on metulae. Conidiophores arising from a foot cell, either from submerged hyphae in the agar or from aerial mycelium, 1000-1500 \u03bcm\ufffd13-15 \u03bcn, smooth, colorless or pale brown, terminating in vesicles. Vesicles globose to subglobose, 47-55 \u03bcn in diameter. Conidiogenous cells, enteroblastic, phialidic, cylindrical with truncate or slightly tapered apices, 5.7-7.6\ufffd3-3.4 \u03bcn. Metulae short cylindrical, 11.4-19\ufffd4.5-5.5 \u03bcn. Conida subglobose to globose, brown, 3.4-3.8 \u03bcn in diameter, echinulate. Sclerotia, cleistothecia and Hulls cells absent., 19173=The Aspergillus niger microorganisms are currently on deposit with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive in Rockville, Maryland as indicated by the herein described ATCC Nos., and in the Merck Culture Collection at Rahway, New Jersey as indicated by the respective MF Nos., 16197=U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,992 to Ayerst discloses the macrolide compound rapamycin and its antibiotic and antifungal properties. Recent publications, (see J. of Immunology Vol. 144, p. 251-258 (No. 1>, Jan. 1990 by F. J. Dumont et. al.,) disclose the use of the compound additionally as an immunosuppressant., 15163=In 1983, the US FDA approved cyclosporin A, (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,117,118 to Sandoz) an effective anti-rejection drug that revolutionized the field of organ transplant surgery. The drug acts by inhibiting the body's immune system from mobilizing its vast arsenal of natural protecting agents to reject the transplant's foreign protein., 18885=To further distinguish specifically between FK-506 and rapamycin type activity, recourse can be had to the methods utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants as described in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Vol. 11, No. 9, Sept. 1991, p. 4616-4626 by L. Brizuela et al.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Combinations of the above assays can be used to test for the presence of both FK-506/Rapamycin and CsA types of activity concurrently. Other assays and combinations of the above will be obvious to one skilled-in-the-art from this disclosure and are deemed to be covered by this application. Further, the combination of ATCC No. 74087/6275 is used to distinguish between low and high FK-506 producing microorganisms by comparing their product outputs from equivalent amounts of microorganism and then determining that both exhibit no Z0I with the FK-506 resistant microorganism. Additionally, the doubly resistant strain ATCC No. 74086, is used as a counterscreen of a new immunosuppressant active found against A. niger No. 6275 to eliminate compounds of both the structural classes of FK-506/-rapamycin and cyclosporin classes simultaneously, indicating a new chemical class of immunosuppressants. Further, utilizing, the above procedure, the CsA-Resistant strain, in conjunction with the A. niger No. 6275, or with the FK-506-R ATCC No. 74087 strain, or both, is used to detect and validate the presence of the cyclosporin class of compounds. Utilizing the above procedure, the FK-506/Rapamycin Resistant isolate, ATCC No. 74087 in conjunction with the sensitive parent, A. niger ATCC No. 6275, or with the CsA-Resistant strain, ATCC No. 74085, or both is used to detect and validate the presence in broths or any other medium of the FK-506 or rapamycin class of compounds.
