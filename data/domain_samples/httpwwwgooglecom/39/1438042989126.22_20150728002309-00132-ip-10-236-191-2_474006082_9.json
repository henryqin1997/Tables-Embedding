    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24251=A superlattice is a multilayer thin film structure consisting of multiple alternating layers of high and low bandgap material. Superlattices have been studied since as early as 1970 in an article entitled \"Superlattice and Negative Differential Conductivity in Semiconductors\" by L. Esaki and R. Tsu (IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 14, page 61, January, 1970). Resonant tunneling in multibarrier structures has been studied since 1973 in an article entitled \"Tunneling in a Finite Superlattice\" by R. Tsu and L. Esaki (Applied Physics Letters Vol. 22 No. II, June 1, 1973). Superlattice structures are presently being used or under investigation for lasers, optical modulators, radiation hardened devices and other applications. Both quantum wells and superlattices rely on the phenomena of tunneling, in which electrons are trapped in a narrow, deep well which results from the thin layer being sandwiched between two barrier layers., 45800=Alternative methods of forming polycrystalline silicon passivated with silicon dioxide would involve a thermally grown polycrystalline silicon which may be grown by pyrolizing silane at 600\ufffd C. at a pressure of10 Pa or less. Alternatively, a plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition of polycystalline silicon may be formed by plasma decomposition of dilutedSiH2 gas in H2. Ion implantation may be also be employed by firstproviding a layer of polycrystalline silicon and then implanting oxygen ions using an energy of 2-5 KeV and a dose of 1014 cm-2 followedby a 1000\ufffd C. anneal in argon or hydrogen for 10 sec., 21393=In polycrystalline material, the basic periodicity of the crystal is found within any single crystal region. The single crystal regions, typically on the order of 1000 \u212b in size, are referred to as grains, and are separated from one another by grain boundaries. The grain boundaries are composed of disordered atoms, and contain large numbers of defects due to incomplete bonding, often referred to as \"dangling bonds\". Intergranular spaces, devoid of any material may also be present. Thus, while the material inside the grains behaves similarly to crystalline material, the defects and departures from periodicity at the grain boundaries substantially alter the behavior of the poly material., 52316=Silicon does not have a direct energy gap, unlike GaAs which has a direct energy gap. Silicon therefore does not lend itself to applications involving interaction with light. For applications requiring interaction with light it is necessary to grow pc-GaAs on silicon. The resulting GaAs will be passivated by the amorphous agents stated above. For Example, in order to deposit a layer of pc-GaAs 1000 \u212b thick on a silicon wafer, having well passivated grain boundaries as seen in FIGS. 1H and 1I, the following steps may be performed:, 23369=One class of microelectronic devices in which polycrystalline material has not heretofore been used is the class of ultra-thin multilayer devices including quantum well devices and superlattices. A quantum well device is a double barrier structure having a thin (on the order of tens of \u212bngstroms) well usually formed of low bandgap material, sandwiched between barrier layers usually formed of high bandgap material, to create a band-edge offset therebetween. Resonant tunneling in quantum well devices was observed as early as 1974 by L. L. Chang, L. Esaki and R. Tsu, in an article entitled \"Resonant Tunneling in Semiconductor Double Barriers\" (Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 24, No. 12, June 15, 1974). Quantum well devices have been extensively used for base and emitter regions of bipolar transistors and for field effect transistor gate regions., 48109=As an alternative to Step III, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process instead of plasma deposition may be used. For a CVD process, the substratetemperature should be increased to thermally break down PH3, for example at a temperature of 600\ufffd C. Alternatively, ion implantationof P may be used, at an ion dosage of approximately 1014 cm-2 to 1015 cm-2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims. Step IV: Deposition of 30 \u212b polycrystalline AlAs at 500\ufffd C. as asecond barrier. Amorphous selenium serves to passivate the polycrystalline GaAs, sandwiched between 30 \u212b of amorphous SiO2 and 30 \u212b of polycrystalline AlAs, as well as the barrier layer consisting of polycrystalline AlAs. Step III: Annealing at 500\ufffd C. in vacuum. Step II: Deposition of 5 \u212b amorphous selenium at 200\ufffd C. Step I: Deposition by vapor evaporation of (50 \u212b) GaAs on 30 \u212b amorphous SiO2 thermally grown on a silicon wafer. When the polycrystalline GaAs is to be a quantum well, a second barrier material needs to be deposited on the polycrystalline GaAs layer. Such a barrier material may be for example, AlAs. In this case, the following steps are involved: Step III: Annealing is done at 500\ufffd C. in vacuum to incorporate the amorphous selenium into the grain boundaries. If a thicker layer is desired, this process may be repeated. Self-annealing is effected during the second deposition of the polycrystalline. This example of using selenium may be replaced by tellurium using the same steps. Step II: Amorphous selenium 5 \u212b thick is",
