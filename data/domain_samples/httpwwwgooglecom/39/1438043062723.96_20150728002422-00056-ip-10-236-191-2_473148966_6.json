    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above exemplary embodiments should be taken as non-limiting examples intended to demonstrate many of the capabilities, but not necessarily the boundaries, of what applicants consider the invention. Alterations, modifications and additions may be made to the examples and the claimed invention by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. It should be noted that exemplary embodiments of the present invention could be automated or semi-automated with the addition of appropriate circuitry including proximity and fluid level sensors, power supply, motor and controller. For example, the proximity sensor could sense when a user's hand is near the outlet, activating a motor integrated into the coupler which repositions the container, lowering the height of the outlet to below the sensed level of the fluid. After fluid has been dispensed, the motor can be reversed until the outlet is just above the sensed new surface level of the fluid and then deactivated. This arrangement results in a completely hands-free dispensing operation. c shows a strap marked with indicia and making the strap broader serves the double purpose of increasing advertising space as well as increasing stability of the installed coupler's position. FIG. 4 Exceptional advertising value is provided by the fluid containers of the exemplary embodiments, by",
