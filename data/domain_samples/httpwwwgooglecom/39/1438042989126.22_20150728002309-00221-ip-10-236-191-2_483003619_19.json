The plasmid carrying DNA encoding BSL2-4616811 (pINCY:BSL2-461811) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1993, on Jun. 6, 2000., 61937=[0022]FIG. 1A shows the nucleotide sequence of BSL1 (SEQ ID NO:1) determined from the full-length clone isolated from a cDNA library prepared from human microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF-alpha; nucleotides 1-92 contain the 5\u2032-untranslated region; nucleotides 93-95 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); nucleotides 93-962 contain the protein coding region; nucleotides 963-965 contain the translation termination signal (TAA); nucleotides 963-1576 contain the 3\u2032-untranslated region; and nucleotides 1577-1605 contain the poly(A)+ RNA tail., 439100=[0555] Following centrifugation, the supernatant from the ficoll underlay tubes was aspirated to leave behind approximately 5 ml of the interface layer. The interface layer was then carefully removed to a new tube, without disturbing the red cell pellet in each tube. The interface layers of two 50 ml tubes was combined and transferred to a new 50 ml tube, resulting in a total of six 50 ml tubes. Elutriation buffer was added to each tube to bring the final volume to 50 ml per tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The peripheral blood monocytes from each donor were combined and divided between two tubes, and resuspended in 40 ml elutriation buffer per tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml elutriation buffer per tube., 470247=[0588] The plasmid carrying DNA encoding BSL1-Ig (pD19:BSL1Ig) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1992, on Jun. 6, 2000. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of BSL1-Ig is shown in FIGS. 2A-2B., 438552=[0554] Sheep's red blood cells (SRBC) were prepared by the following procedure. Twelve milliliters of Sheep Blood Alsever's (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, Colo.; Cat. # CS1112) was resuspended, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min.

After the second wash, the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml elutriation buffer and refrigerated., 68262=[0040]FIG. 4C shows the nucleotide sequence of the BSL2-L165-35b-Ig clone (SEQ ID NO:132); nucleotides 1-3 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); nucleotides 1-84 encode the predicted signal peptide sequence; nucleotides 85-738 encode the mature ECD; nucleotides 739-744 contain a restriction site introduced by PCR to facilitate construction of the fusion; and nucleotides 745-1440 encode the human Ig portion of the fusion construct., 411067=[0441] An isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 850-978 of SEQ ID NO:131; b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1081-1221 of SEQ ID NO:131; c) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 970-1098 of SEQ ID NO:6; and d) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1201-1341 of SEQ ID NO:6., 330743=[0355] In one application of the present invention, microarrays containing arrays of B7-related polynucleotide sequences can be used to measure the expression levels of B7-related factors in an individual. In particular, to diagnose an individual with a condition or disease correlated with altered BSL1, BSL2, and/or BSL3 expression levels, a sample from a human or animal (containing, e.g., mRNA) can be used as a probe on a biochip containing an array of BSL1, BSL2, and/or BSL3 polynucleotides (e.g., DNA) in decreasing concentrations (e.g., 1 ng, 0.1 ng, 0.01 ng, etc.). The test sample can be compared to samples from diseased and normal samples. Biochips can also be used to identify BSL1, BSL2, and BSL3 mutations or polymorphisms in a population, including but not limited to, deletions, insertions, and mismatches. For example, mutations can be identified by: (i) placing B7-related polynucleotides of this invention onto a biochip; (ii) taking a test sample (containing, e.g., mRNA) and adding the sample to the biochip; (iii) determining if the test samples hybridize to the B7-related polynucleotides attached to the chip under various hybridization conditions (see, e.g., V. R. Chechetkin et al. (2000) J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 18(1):83-101). Alternatively microarray sequencing can be performed (see, e.g., E. P. Diamandis (2000) Clin. Chem. 46(10):1523-5)., 378002=[0396] As an alternative approach, antibodies that specifically react with B7-related polypeptides or peptides can be used to block the activity of immune or inflammatory response cells (e.g., T-cells). Antibodies or related antibody fragments that bind to peptides or polypeptides comprising the BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15) sequences can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered alone or in combination to a subject. Such antibodies can then inhibit the interaction of the B7-related polypeptides with CD28 and/or CD28-related ligands, and thereby prevent T-cell activation. Treatments utilizing antibodies directed against B7-related factors may be modeled on animal experiments, which use antibodies against CD28, B7-1, or B7-2 (D. J. Lenshow et al. (1995) Transplantation 60:1171-1178; Y. Seko et al. (1998) Circ. Res. 83:463-469; A. Haczku et al. (1999) Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 159:1638-1643). One skilled in the art may adapt such methods for use in humans, and for use with various conditions involving inflammation or transplantation. It is noted that antibody-based therapeutics produced from non-human sources can cause an undesired immune response in human subjects. To minimize this problem, chimeric antibody derivatives can be produced. Chimeric antibodies combine a non-human animal variable region with a human constant region. Chimeric antibodies can be constructed according to methods known in the art (see Morrison et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851; Takeda et al. (1985) Nature 314:452; U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 of Cabilly et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397 of Boss et al.; European Patent Publication EP 171496; EP 0173494; United Kingdom Patent GB 2177096B). In addition, antibodies can be further \u201chumanized\u201d by any of the techniques known in the art, (e.g., Teng et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:7308-7312; Kozbor et al. (1983) Immunology Today 4: 7279; Olsson et al. (1982) Meth. Enzymol. 92:3-16; International Patent Application No. WO 92/06193; EP 0239400). Humanized antibodies can be also be obtained from commercial sources (e.g., Scotgen Limited, Middlesex, Great Britain). Immunotherapy with a humanized antibody may result in increased long-term effectiveness for the treatment of chronic disease situations or situations requiring repeated antibody treatments., 224560=[0243] By phase-contrast microscopy, transformed cells appear large, clear and \u201chairy\u201d; they tend to aggregate in tight clusters of cells. Initially, EBV lines are generally polyclonal. However, over prolonged periods of cell culture, EBV lines can become monoclonal as a result of the selective outgrowth of particular B cell clones. Alternatively, polyclonal EBV transformed lines can be subcloned (e.g., by limiting dilution) or fused with a suitable fusion partner and plated at limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal B cell lines. Suitable fusion partners for EBV transformed cell lines include mouse myeloma cell lines (e.g., SP2/0, X63-Ag8.653), heteromyeloma cell lines (human\ufffdmouse; e.g., SPAM-8, SBC-H20,.and CB-F7), and human cell lines (e.g., GM 1500, SKO-007, RPMI 8226, and KR-4). Thus, the present invention also includes a method of generating polyclonal or monoclonal human antibodies against polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof, comprising EBV-transformation of human B cells., 436648=[0548] An isolated BSL2v1c2 nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. ______, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 425588=[0495] A host cell comprising the BSL2vcvc nucleic acid molecule corresponding to ATCC No. PTA-1993, deposited on Jun. 6, 2000., 426104=[0498] An anti-BSL2vcvc antibody produced by the hybridoma cell corresponding to ATCC No. ______ deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 425033=[0492] An isolated BSL2vcvc-Ig nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. ______, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 412988=[0449] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1-1394 of SEQ ID NO:8; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1396-2094 of SEQ ID NO:8., 442621=[0562] The isolated peripheral blood monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and IL-4 (75 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (15 ng/ml) cytokines (each from GibcoBRL). The cell suspension (5\ufffd105 cells/ml) was transferred to tissue culture flasks and incubated in chambers containing 5% CO2 at 37\ufffd C. for 7 days. Following the incubation period, the cell cultures were pipetted vigorously to remove cells from the flask. The human monocytic cell line THP1 was grown at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 to a final concentration of 5\ufffd105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine., 410324=[0438] An isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising nucleotides 121-1722 of SEQ ID NO:6., 382391=[0399] In addition, modulation of B7-related factor function may be useful in the induction of tumor immunity. For example, tumor cells (e.g., sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, or carcinoma cells) can be genetically engineered to carry a nucleic acid encoding at least a fragment of at least one B7-related factor, such as BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15), and then administered to a subject to traverse tumor-specific tolerance in the subject. Notably, ectopic expression of B7-1 in B7 negative murine tumor cells has been shown to induce T-cell mediated specific immunity accompanied by tumor rejection and prolonged protection to tumor challenge in mice (L. Chen et al., supra; S. Townsend et al., supra; S. Baskar et al., supra). Tumor or cancer cell gene therapy treatments utilizing B7-related factors may be modeled on animal experiments (see K. Dunussi-Joannopoulos et al. (1997) J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 19:356-340; K. Hiroishi et al. (1999) Gene Ther. 6:1988-1994; B. K. Martin et al. (1999) J. Immunol. 162:6663-6670; M. Kuiper et al. (2000) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 465:381-390), or human phase I trial experiments (H. L. Kaufman et al. (2000) Hum. Gene Ther. 11:1065-1082), which use B7-1 or B7-2 for gene transfer therapy. It will be understood that such methods may be adapted for use with various tumor or cancer cells. Additionally, tumor immunity may be achieved by administration of a B7-related fusion protein that directly stimulates the immune cells (see e.g., International Patent Application No. WO 01/21796 to V. Ling et al.)., 241051=[0261] This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with the generation of the first \u201cXenoMouseT\u201d strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. (1994) Nature Genetics, 7:13-21. The XenoMouse strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACS) containing 245-kb and 10,190-kb-sized germine configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus, respectively, which contained core variable and constant region sequences. Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B-cell development, to produce an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and to generate antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes, additional regulatory elements, and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization. The work of Green et al. was recently extended to the introduction of greater than approximately 80% of the human antibody repertoire through the use of megabase-sized, germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci, respectively, to produce XenoMouse mice. See Mendez et al. (1997) Nature Genetics, 15:146-156; Green and Jakobovits (1998) J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495; and Green (1999) J. Immunol.

No. 09/875,338, filed Jun. 6, 2001, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 60/272,107, filed Feb. 28, 2001, and U.S. Application Serial No. 60/209,811, filed Jun. 6, 2000, which are all hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 413237=[0450] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 4-1394 of SEQ ID NO:8; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1396-2094 of SEQ ID NO:8., 157354=[0175] Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a BSL2-L165-21-Ig (BSL2v2c2-Ig) polypeptide that includes amino acids 1 through 480 of SEQ ID NO:135. The invention also encompasses a BSL2-L165-21-Ig (BSL2v2c2-Ig) polypeptide that lacks the initiating methionine, but includes amino acids 2 through 480 of SEQ ID NO:135. The invention further encompasses a polypeptide that lacks the signal sequence, but includes the remaining sequence of BSL2-L165-21-Ig (BSL2v2c2-Ig) polypeptide, i.e., the mature sequence of BSL2-L165-21-Ig. Specifically, the invention encompasses a BSL2-L165-21-Ig (BSL2v2c2-Ig) polypeptide comprising amino acids 29 through 480 of SEQ ID NO:135. The invention also encompasses BSL2-L165-21-Ig (BSL2v2c2-Ig) polynucleotides comprising nucleotides 1 through 1440, nucleotides 4 through 1440, or nucleotides 85 through 1440 of SEQ ID NO:134. Also encompassed are recombinant vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 410761=[0440] An isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 85-1602 of SEQ ID NO:131; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 205-1722 of SEQ ID NO:6., 354346=[0376] Although viral vectors are preferred for gene transfer therapies, cells can be genetically engineered to contain nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired gene product(s) by various methods known in the art. For example, cells can be genetically engineered by fusion, transfection, lipofection mediated by the use of liposomes, electroporation, precipitation with DEAE-Dextran or calcium phosphate, particle bombardment (biolistics) with nucleic acid-coated particles (e.g., gold particles), microinjection, or genetically engineered microorganisms (K. Yazawa et al. (2000) Cancer Gene Ther. 7:269-274). Vectors for introducing heterologous (i.e., foreign) nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) into muscle cells for the expression of active bioactive products are well known in the art. Such vectors possess a promoter sequence, preferably a promoter that is cell-specific and placed upstream of the sequence to be expressed. The vectors may also contain, optionally, one or more expressible marker genes for expression as an indication of successful transfection and expression of the nucleic acid sequences contained in the vector. In addition, vectors can be optimized to minimize undesired immunogenicity and maximize long-term expression of the desired gene product(s) (see Nabel (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:324-326). Moreover, vectors can be chosen based on cell-type that is targeted for treatment. For example, vectors for the treatment of tumor or cancer cells have been described (P. L. Hallenbeck et al. (1999) Hum. Gene Ther. 10:1721-1733; T. Shibata et al. (2000) Gene Ther. 7:493-498; M. Puhlmann et al. (2000) Cancer Gene Ther. 7:66-73; N. Krauzewicz et al. (2000) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 465:73-82)., 588772=[0701] Anti-BSL3 monoclonal antibodies were used to measure BSL3 polypeptide levels on human peripheral blood monocytes with or without GM-CSF IL-4 or PHA stimulation. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) were purified as follows. Blood samples were aliquotted equally among twelve 50 ml conical tubes. One volume of elutriation buffer (at room temperature) was added to each of the samples. Samples were underlayed with 10 ml LSM (lymphocyte separation mixture) ficoll solution, and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 25 min. The upper layer of reddish material was removed, and the LSM layer was transferred to a new tube (6 tubes per donor). Most of the PBMC were observed on top of the LSM layer. Elutriation buffer (50 ml) was added to each tube, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 8 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the PBMC were resuspended in 15 ml elutriation buffer. The mixture was transferred into 2 new 50 ml conical tubes. (45 ml total volume per tube), and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 8 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and this process was repeated two more times., 172917=[0192] Epitope bearing peptides of the invention may also be synthesized as multiple antigen peptides (MAPs), first described by J. P. Tam et al. (1995) Biomed. Pept, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, 199, 1(3):123-32; and Calvo, et al. (1993) J. Immunol., 150(4):1403-12), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. MAPs contain multiple copies of a specific peptide attached to a non-immunogenic lysine core. MAP peptides usually contain four or eight copies of the peptide, which are often referred to as MAP4 or MAP8 peptides. By way of non-limiting example, MAPs can be synthesized onto a lysine core matrix attached to a polyethylene glycol-polystyrene (PEG-PS) support. The peptide of interest is synthesized onto the lysine residues using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. For example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) offers commercially available MAP resins, such as, for example, the Fmoc Resin 4 Branch and the Fmoc Resin 8 Branch, which can be used to synthesize MAPs. Cleavage of MAPs from the resin is performed with standard trifloroacetic acid (TFA)-based cocktails known in the art. Purification of MAPs, except for desalting, is not generally necessary. MAP peptides can be used in immunizing vaccines which elicit antibodies that recognize both the MAP and the native protein from which the peptide was derived., 329477=[0354] In another embodiment of the present invention, oligonucleotides, or longer fragments derived from at least one B7-related polynucleotide sequence described herein may be used as targets in a microarray (e.g., biochip) system. The microarray can be used to monitor the expression level of large numbers of genes simultaneously (to produce a transcript image), and to identify genetic variants, mutations, and polymorphisms. This information may be used to determine gene function, to understand the genetic basis of a disease, to diagnose disease, and to develop and monitor the activities of therapeutic or prophylactic agents. Preparation and use of microarrays have been described in WO 95/11995 to Chee et al.; D. J. Lockhart et al. (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14:1675-1680; M. Schena et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.

Psychiatry 48(12):1147-56., 428231=[0508] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising at least 270 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:10; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:134., 494746=[0613] PCR was initially conducted with BSL2-4616811 plasmid to confirm the specificity of the BSL2-9 primer. PCR was performed using 2 \u03bcl of 10 ng/\u03bcl BSL2-4616811 plasmid DNA, 5 \u03bcl PCR buffer (GibcoBRL), 1.5 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2 (GibcoBRL), 1 \u03bcl of 10 mM dNTPs (GibcoBRL), 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 pMol/\u03bcl BSL2-9 primer (5\u2032 TGGTGCACAGCTTTGCT 3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:59), 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 pMol/\u03bcl BSL2-11 primer (5\u2032 TCTGGGGGGAATGTCAT 3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:60), 0.5 \u03bcl of 5 U/\u03bcl GibcoBRL platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Cat. # 10966-018), and 35 \u03bcl dH2O. PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems 9700 using the following cycling conditions: 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec; followed by 35 cycles of 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 61\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 72\ufffd C. for 60 sec; followed by 72\ufffd C. for 10 min. Following this, 40 \u03bcl of the PCR reaction was run on a 1.2% agarose gel next to Lambda BstEII DNA ladder (New England Biolabs Beverly, Mass.; Cat. # 301-4S). The 1150-bp band was predominant, indicating that the BSL2-9 PCR primer was specific for the BSL2-4616811 sequence (FIG. 8E)., 442049=[0560] Fifty milliliter fractions were collected at 11 (2 fractions), 14, 16, and 36 (2 fractions) ml/min pump speeds, and then placed on ice. In accordance with previous observations, the monocytes were predicted to be in the 36 ml/min fraction. The monocyte fraction was centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 8 min, and the cells were resuspended in 10 ml 25% fetal bovine serum/RPMI with 1 \u03bcg/ml polymyxin B. The cells were counted and stored on ice until use., 413488=[0451] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 85-1394 of SEQ ID NO:8; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1396-2094 of SEQ ID NO:8., 523264=[0643] Following electroporation, cells were allowed to recover one day in non-selective media (PF CHO with 10 \u03bcg/ml recombinant insulin, 4 mM L-glutamine, 4 \u03bcg/ml hypoxantine, and 0.72 \u03bcg/ml thymidine). Cells were then seeded in 96-well plates at 250 or 1000 cells/well in selective media. Selective media was PF CHO with 10 \u03bcg/ml recombulin (recombinant insulin; GibcoBRL, Cat. # 28150-019), 4 mM L-glutamine, and 50 or 100 nM MTX (methotrexate). The plates were screened two weeks post-electroporation by ELISA for the selection of masterwells producing the highest level of BSL2-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig or BSL2v1c2-Ig) fusion protein. As used herein, a \u201cmasterwell\u201d is a well containing transfected cells that have not been clonally isolated., 567860=[0683] Hybridoma cell lines were constructed using the following reagents: Iscoves Modified Dulbecco's Medium (GibcoBRL; Cat. #12440-053); fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Cat. # A-1115L, Lot # 11152564) heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\ufffd C.; L-glutamine-200 mm, 100\ufffd (GibcoBRL; Cat. # 25030-081); penicillin/streptomycin (GibcoBRL; Cat. # 15140-122); ORIGEN Hybridoma Cloning Factor (Igen International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.; Cat. # IG50-0615, Lot #8077); HT Supplement 100\ufffd (GibcoBRL; Cat. # 11067-030); HAT Supplement 100\ufffd (GibcoBRL; Cat. # 31062-037); PEG 1500, (Boehringer Mannheim; Cat. # 783641); Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer from Lab Services (Cat. # 3KL-449); Trypan Blue; 70% ethanol; and myeloma cells (P3\ufffd) from ATCC., 268955=[0289] Polypeptides and/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) can be fused to either the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the heterologous protein (e.g., immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide). Antibodies of the invention can also be fused to albumin (including, but not limited to, recombinant human serum albumin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, issued Mar. 2,1999; EP Patent 0 413 622; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883, issued Jun. 16, 1998, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, polypeptides and/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) are fused with the mature form of human serum albumin (i.e., amino acids 1-585 of human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of EP Patent 0 322 094, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another preferred embodiment, polypeptides and/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues 1-z of human serum albumin, where z is an integer from 369 to 419, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 576495=[0690] For ELISA, plates were coated with 75 \u03bci/well (1 \u03bcg/ml) BSL3-Ig in carbonate/bicarbonate overnight at 4\ufffd C. Plates were washed with PBS Tween\ufffd20 (using Skatron), and blocked with 300 \u03bcl block buffer for 45 min at room temperature. Plates were flicked dry and incubated with 75 \u03bcl/well sera diluted in blocking buffer (sera was diluted 1:50 for highest concentration and then serially diluted by factors of three) for 45 min at room temperature, and washed as before. Plates were then incubated with 75 \u03bcl/well anti-mouse IgG in blocking buffer (1:10000 dilution; HRP-labeled; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.) for 45 min at room temperature, and washed as before. Following this, plates were incubated with 100 \u03bcl/well chromogen mixture, and incubated up to 15 min at room temperature. The signal was quenched with 100 \u03bcl 1N sulfuric acid, and samples were read at 450/630 nm. Using ELISA, supernatants from hybridomas were initially screened against BSL3-Ig fusion protein, and then screened against Ig protein alone. Hybridomas that produced antibodies that bound to BSL3-Ig, but not Ig, were designated as positive clones., 396532=[0416] As used herein, the term \u201corthologue\u201d denotes a gene or polypeptide obtained from one species that has homology to an analogous gene or polypeptide from a different species. For example, the human BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15) and mouse AF142780 polypeptides are orthologues., 561387=[0672] Following this, 38 \u03bcl of the PCR product was digested with KpnI/EcoRI and run on a 1.2% agarose/0.5\ufffd TBE gel. A band of about 650-bp was excised and purified with QIAGEN gel extraction kit. Ten microliters of the purified fragment was run on an agarose gel next to a size standard. Ten nanograms of fragment (L232) was ligated to 20 ng of KpnI/EcoRI digested L200-1 (described herein). Five microliters of the ligation mixture was used for transformation into GibcoBRL MAX Efficiency DH5-alpha competent bacteria, and transformants were plated onto LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. Colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and grown for 18 hr at 37\ufffd C. DNA was purified using QIAGEN spin miniprep kit and digested with Pmel. The digested samples were run on an agarose gel and plasmids that contained fragments of about 1500-bp were sequenced. L232-6 was determined to have wild-type BSL3 sequence. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of BSL3-Ig (L232-6) is shown in FIGS. 6A-6B., 262430=[0282] In addition, anti-metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:357; and O'Hare et al. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan and Berg (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G418 (Clinical Pharmacy, 12:488-505; Wu and Wu (1991) Biotherapy, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev (1993) Ann. Rev. Pharmacol.

Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology can be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone; such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al., eds., (1990) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler (1990) Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY; in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al., eds., (1994) Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Colberre-Garapin et al.

The ability of such proteins to block the normal costimulatory signal and induce a state of anergy can be determined using subsequent attempts at stimulation of the T-cells with antigen presenting cells that express cell surface B cell activation antigen B7 and present antigen. If the T-cells are unresponsive to the activation attempts, as determined by IL-2 synthesis and T-cell proliferation, a state of anergy has been induced and can be determined by methods known in the art (see R. H. Schwartz (1990) Science 248:1349-1356)., 437691=[0553] Human monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by elutriation. The elutriation buffer contained 1 L RPMI (GibcoBRL/Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md.; Cat. #11875-085) with 2.5 mM EDTA and 10 \u03bcg/ml polymyxin B. The buffer was prepared 1 day prior to the elutriation procedure, and stored at room temperature. For the elutriation procedure, 225 ml EDTA whole blood/donor was obtained and prepared. Twenty milliliters of elutriation buffer was added to twelve 50 ml centrifuge tubes, and the 225 ml of blood was divided equally among the tubes. Twelve milliliters of ficoll solution (lymphocyte separation medium) was used to underlay the mixture in each tube (AccuPrep Lymphocytes, Accurate Scientific Co.; Cat. # 1053980). The tubes were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 25 min (minutes)., 494233=[0612] Notably, the BSL2-4616811 transcript contained both the BSL2-9 v1-binding site in v1 and the homologous site in v2. The BSL2-L165-35b transcript contained only the BSL2-9 v1 binding site. The BSL2-L165-21 transcript contained only the v2 site. Accordingly, PCR performed with primers BSL2-9 and BSL2-11 was expected to produce: 1) a PCR product of approximately 1150-bp, representing BSL2-4616811; or 2) a PCR product of about 550-bp, representing BSL2-L165-35b., 506863=[0629] Following this, the PCR product was cloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen; Cat. # K2000-01 and K2000-40) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The ligation reaction included 5 \u03bcl H2O; 1 \u03bcl 10\ufffd buffer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany); 2 \u03bcl vector pCR2.1; 1 \u03bcl PCR product (unpurified); and 1 \u03bcl T4 Ligase (Roche). One-half of the ligation mixture was used for transformation into max efficiency DH5\u03b1 competent cells (Invitrogen) and plated as described, above. White colonies were isolated and grown in culture, and minipreps were performed (QIAGEN). The miniprep DNA and vector L200-1 (described herein) were digested with KpnI and EcoRI in SuRE/Cut Buffer A (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). The digestion mixture included 14 \u03bcl miniprep DNA or L200-1 vector; 2 \u03bcl KpnI; 2 \u03bcl EcoRI; 2 \u03bcl 10\ufffd Buffer A; and 10 \u03bcl dH2O. The digestion mixture was electrophoresed on a 1% SeaPlaque Low Melt agarose gel (FMC, Rockland, Me.). Bands of approximately 750-bp from the miniprep DNA and approximately 6200-bp from the L200-1 vector were excised and melted at 65\ufffd C., 236527=[0256] Intrabodies are antibodies, often scFvs, that are expressed from a recombinant nucleic acid molecule and are engineered to be retained intracellularly (e.g., retained in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, or periplasm of the host cells). Intrabodies can be used, for example, to ablate the function of a protein to which the intrabody binds. The expression of intrabodies can also be regulated through the use of inducible promoters in the nucleic acid expression vector comprising nucleic acid encoding the intrabody. Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art, such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al. (1994) Hum. Gene Ther. 5:595-601; W. A.

(1999) J. Immunol. Methods, 231:207-222., 447379=[0570] To generate the full-length clone, JNF155RACE5.1, JNF154RACE3.2, and pCR2.1 were ligated together. JNF155RACE5.1 was doubly digested with Xhol and HindIII. JNF154RACE3.2 was doubly digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) was digested with Xhol and EcoRI. Each fragment was purified using the QIAGEN gel extraction kit and resuspended in water. One microliter of each digested fragment was ligated together in the same reaction using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was used for transformation into TOP10F\u2032 E. coli ultracompetent cells. Transformants were plated onto LB plates containing 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin, 40 mg/ml X-gal, and 100 mM IPTG. Colonies were isolated from the plates, and grown in LB broth containing 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37\ufffd C. Plasmids containing full-length BSL1 were purified using the QIAGEN miniprep spin kit (QIAGEN), and sequenced (ABI cycle sequencer; PE Applied Biosystems). The plasmid carrying DNA encoding the full-length BSL1 sequence (pTADV:BSL1) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1989, on Jun. 6, 2000., 100096=[0119] \u201cIdentity,\u201d as known in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences.

The invention further encompasses a polypeptide that lacks the signal sequence, but includes the remaining sequence of BSL2-L165-35b-Ig (BSL2v1c2-Ig) polypeptide, i.e., the mature sequence of BSL2-L165-35b-Ig. Specifically, the invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising amino acids 29 through 480 of SEQ ID NO:133. The invention also encompasses BSL2-L165-35b-Ig (BSL2v1c2-Ig) polynucleotides comprising nucleotides 1 through 1440, nucleotides 4 through 1440, or nucleotides 85 through 1440 of SEQ ID NO:132. Also encompassed are recombinant vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 270326=[0290] BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:4), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:132, or SEQ ID NO:134), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:16) polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins, and antibodies to these fusion proteins, are also encompassed by the invention. Such fusion proteins may, for example, facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93/21232; EP 439, 095; Naramura et al. (1994) Immunol. Lett. 39:91-99; U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Antibodies to BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:5), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:133, or SEQ ID NO:135), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:17) fusion proteins can be used in any of the antibody-based methods for polypeptide identification, purification, and for antibody-format assays for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring known in the art and/or disclosed herein., 70247=[0045]FIG. 5A shows the nucleotide sequence of BSL3 (SEQ ID NO:14): nucleotides 1-326 contain 5\u2032 untranslated region; nucleotides 327-329 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); nucleotides 981-1055 encode a predicted transmembrane domain; nucleotides 1146-1148 contain the translation termination signal (TGA), 227862=[0246] As described in the above references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described in detail below. For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92/22324; Mullinax et al.

Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al. (1991) Methods Enzymol., 203:46-88; Shu et al. (1993) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7995-7999; and Skerra et al. (1988) Science, 240:1038-1040. For some uses, including the in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, e.g., Morrison (1985) Science, 229:1202; Oi et al. (1986) BioTechniques, 4:214; Gillies et al. (1989) J. Immunol. Methods, 125:191-202; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety)., 401852=[0421] Several methods can be used to select homologously recombined murine ES cells. One method employs PCR to screen pools of transformant cells for homologous insertion, followed by screening individual clones (Kim et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:8887-8903; Kim et al. (1991) Gene 103:227-233). Another method employs a marker gene is constructed which will only be active if homologous insertion occurs, allowing these recombinants to be selected directly (Sedivy et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:227-231). For example, the positive-negative selection (PNS) method can be used as described above (see, e.g., Mansour et al. (1988) Nature 336:348-352; Capecchi (1989) Science 244:1288-1292; Capecchi, (1989) Trends in Genet. 5:70-76). In particular, the PNS method is useful for targeting genes that are expressed at low levels., 501469=[0621] To rule out the presence of PCR artifacts, the PCR product from HUVEC activated with TNF\u03b1 for 24 hr was cloned using the Invitrogen Original TA Cloning Kit (Cat. # K2000-01) according to the manufacturer's directions. The construct was used for transformation into bacterial cells, and 25 white colonies were isolated and grown in LB with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. DNA preps were made and sequencing was performed. Of the 25 clones, 10 clones did not contain insert, 3 clones did not produce readable sequence, 3 clones contained BSL2-related sequences with extensive deletions, and the remaining 9 clones produced sequence consistent with BSL2-4616811., 424877=[0491] An isolated BSL2vcvc nucleic acid molecule corresponding to ATCC No. PTA-1993, deposited on Jun. 6, 2000., 513824=[0633] BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) fusion construct: To construct the BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) plasmid, the BSL2-4616811 extracellular domain was PCR amplified from first strand cDNA (GibcoBRL Cat. # 11904-018). cDNA was prepared from RNA purified from THP1 cells stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 2 hr. RNA was purified using Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 (Cat. # K1593-02). The PCR reaction included 1 \u03bcl cDNA; 5 \u03bcl GibcoBRL 10\ufffd PCR buffer; 1.5 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2; 1 \u03bcl of 10 mM dNTPs (Boehringer-Mannheim); 2.5 \u03bcl BSL2-L165-21-Ig-1 primer (10 pM/\u03bcl); 2.5 \u03bcl BSL2-L165-21-Ig-2 primer (10 pM/\u03bcl); 1 \u03bcl CLONTECH Advantage polymerase (Cat. # 8417-1); and 35.5 \u03bcl milliQ H2O. The primers contained the following sequences: BSL2-L165-21-Ig-1: 5\u2032 gg ggt acc ATG CTG CGT CGG CG 3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:63); and BSL2-L165-21-Ig-2: 5\u2032 cg gaa ttc TGG GGG GAA TGT CAT AG 3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:64). PCR samples were incubated at 94\ufffd C. for 1 min; followed by 35 cycles of incubation at 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 59\ufffd C. for 30 sec, and 72\ufffd C. for 45 sec; followed by incubation at 72\ufffd C. for 10 min., 390268=[0408] To identify genes that predict drug response, several pharmacogenetic methods can be used. One pharmacogenomics approach, \u201cgenome-wide association\u201d, relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome. This high-resolution map shows previously identified gene-related markers (e.g., a \u201cbi-alielic\u201d gene marker map which consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome, each of which has two variants). A high-resolution genetic map can then be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase II/III drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, a high-resolution map can be generated from a combination of some 10 million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a \u201cSNP\u201d is a common alteration that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process, however, the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In this way, treatment regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that may be common among such genetically similar individuals. See, e.g., D. R. Pfost et al. (2000) Trends Biotechnol. 18(8):334-8., 525388=[0647] The BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) fusion protein was purified by affinity purification following expression in COS cells as described for BSL3-Ig, below. It is noted that the BSL2-4616811-Ig fusion protein used in the experiments that follow was isolated from COS cells, unless indicated otherwise. The purified BSL2-4616811-Ig fusion protein was used to immunize mice using the protocol described for BSL3-Ig, except that a fourth boost was used. Following this, hybridoma cell lines were constructed and anti-BSL2 MAbs were isolated as described for BSL3, below. Hybridoma cells producing anti-BSL2-1 F7G2 MAb, anti-BLS2-3E6D3 MAb, anti-BSL2-4C2C6 MAb, or anti-BLS2-5D7E2 MAb were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. ______, ______, ______, and ______, respectively, on Feb. 8, 2002., 410456=[0439] An isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 4-1602 of SEQ ID NO:131; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 124-1722 of SEQ ID NO:6., 300675=[0319] Related, in vivo, methods such as the three-hybrid (Licitra et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:12817-12821), and reverse two-hybrid (Vidal et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:10315-10320) systems may serve as alternative approaches. Commercially available two-hybrid systems such as the CLONTECH Matchmaker\u2122 systems and protocols (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, Calif.) may be also be used. (See also, A. R. Mendelsohn et al. (1994) Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:482; E. M. Phizicky et al. (1995) Microbiological Rev. 59:94; M. Yang et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:1152; S. Fields et al. (1994) Trends Genet. 10:286; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,283,173 and 5,468,614)., 539829=[0657] In addition, the BSL3 C-terminal amino acid sequence shared less than 98% identity to the amino acid sequence encoded by GenBank Accession No. AK001872, over a stretch of 174 amino acids. Amino acid sequence alignments using the GCG Gap program indicated that the longest stretch of identical residues shared by BSL3 and AK001872 was 99 contiguous amino acids in length. Nucleotide sequence alignments using GCG Gap indicated that the longest stretch of identical bases shared by BSL3 and AK001872 was 239 contiguous nucleotides in length. Notably, a mouse orthologue of BSL3 was identified from the GenBank Database (Accession No. AF142780). The BSL3 N-terminal amino acid sequence shared approximately 70% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence corresponding to mouse AF142780, over a stretch of 250 amino acids. In addition, it was noted that BSL3 has also been identified as PD-L2, an apparent inhibitor of T-cell proliferation (Y. Latchman et al. (2001) Nature Immunology 2:261-268)., 563370=[0674] Following this, 2 \u03bcl of the PCR reaction was ligated (L262) into pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Five microliters of the ligation was used for transformation into MAX Efficiency DH5-alpha competent cells (GibcoBRL), and transformants were plated onto LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 800 \u03bcg of X-Gal. Plates were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. White colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. Plasmid DNA was purified using QIAGEN spin miniprep kit. Plasmid DNA was digested with BamHI/XbaI and analyzed on an agarose gel. Plasmids that contained an approximately 1300-bp fragment were sequenced. L262-2 was determined to contain the wild-type BSL3 sequence., 43897=[0003] The primary response of T-cells, involving T-cell activation, expansion, and differentiation is essential for the initiation of an immune response to a foreign antigen. The activation of T-cells by antigen presenting cells (APCs) requires at least two separate signals (K. E. Hellstrom et al. (1996) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 38:S40-1; N. K. Damle et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:1985-92; J. M. Green et al. (1994) Eur. J. Immunol. 24:265-72; E. C. Guinan et al. (1994) Blood 84:3261-82; J. W. Hodge et al. (1995) Cancer Res. 55:3598-603). The first signal causes T-cell entry into the cell cycle, and is mediated by foreign antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The second signal, termed costimulation, causes cytokine production and T-cell proliferation, but is neither antigen-specific, nor MHC restricted (R. H. Schwartz (1990) Science 248:1349-1356)., 104409=[0124] General methods for splice site prediction can be found in Nakata (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13:5327-5340. In addition, splice sites can be predicted using, for example, the GRAIL\u2122 (E. C. Uberbacher and R. J. Mural (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:11261-11265; E. C. Uberbacher (1995) Trends Biotech., 13:497-500; GenView (L. Milanesi et al. (1993) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Bioinformatics, Supercomputing, and Complex Genome Analysis, H.

(See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:910-914; and Bittle et al. (1985) J. Gen. Virol., 66:2347-2354). Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these immunogenic epitopes., 96737=[0113] In another embodiment, the present invention embraces a polynucleotide lacking the initiating start codon, but including the remaining coding sequence of BSL2-4616811 (BSL2vcvc). Specifically, the invention embraces a polynucleotide comprising nucleotides 4 through 1602 of SEQ ID NO:131. In addition, the invention embraces a polynucleotide comprising nucleotides 124 through 1722 of SEQ ID NO:6, and the polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 2 through 534 of SEQ ID NO:7. Also embraced are vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 433439=[0533] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 85-738 of SEQ ID NO:132; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:132., 495823=[0614] RAJI, RAMOS, PM-LCL, PL-LCL, and CE-LCL B-like cell lines; HL-60 and Thp1 monocytic like cell lines; and CEM and Hut78 T-like cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1% GibcoBRL penicillin/streptomycin to a concentration of 5\ufffd105 cells/mi. The cultures were split and one-half of the B-like and T-like cell cultures were stimulated with 30 ng/ml PMA and 1 \u03bcM ionomycin for 24 hr. Monocytic cell lines were stimulated with 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS for 24 hr. Early passage HUVEC were grown to 90% confluence, and one-half of the culture was stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1, and harvested at 6 or 24 hr. Unstimulated HUVEC were harvested at 24 hr., 437014=[0550] A host cell comprising the BSL2v1c2 nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. ______, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 179215=[0198] Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner, such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96/22024 and WO 99/04813). IgG fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than are monomeric polypeptides, or fragments thereof, alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al. (1995) J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964)., 301431=[0320] Ligand sequence(s) obtained from ligand-binding assay(s) can be compared with subject sequences in available databases such as, without limitation, GenPept, SWISS-PROT, and Incyte Genomics databases (Incyte Genomics). These databases, which contain previously identified and annotated sequences, may be searched for the full-length polypeptide and gene sequence using, for example, BLAST analysis (see above). In cases where the full-length sequences of the ligands are not available, extended or overlapping partial clones may be obtained by techniques conventionally known and practiced in the art. Non-limiting examples of such techniques include hybridization to plasmid or phage libraries of genomic DNA or cDNA; PCR from the same libraries using B7-related factor primer pairs; or hybridization or PCR directly to genomic DNA or cDNA. These clones may then be sequenced and assembled into full-length genes using the fragment sequence alignment program (PHRAP; Nickerson et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:2745-2751)., 184365=[0203] The chains of an immunoglobulin molecule exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs of the heavy and the light chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, thus enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both the light and heavy chains comprise the domains FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)); Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; or Chothia et al.

A band of about 1300-bp was excised from a 1.2% agarose/0.5\ufffd TBE gel and ligated into the L200-1 Fc construct digested with KpnI/EcoRI. Five microliters of the ligation reaction was used for transformation into MAX Efficiency DH5-alpha cells and plated onto LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were grown, and plasmid DNA was purified as above. Plasmid DNA was digested with KpnI/XbaI and separated on an agarose gel as above. Plasmids containing a band of about 2-kb were sequenced as above. BSL2-4616811-Ig was determined to contain the wild-type BSL2-4616811 and wild-type human IgG1 sequences. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) is shown in FIGS. 4A-4B. Plasmids comprising BSL2vcvc-Ig, BSL2v1c2-Ig, or BSL2v2c2-Ig sequences were deposited as a mixture with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. ______, on Feb. 8, 2002., 271586=[0291] The present invention further includes compositions comprising the B7-related polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable region domain. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region, or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention can comprise the constant region, hinge region, CH1 domain, CH2 domain, CH3 domain, or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides can also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example, Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

USA, 89:11337-11341, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties)., 164244=[0184] Non-limiting examples of BSL2-4616811 (BSL2vcvc) sequences which may be used as epitopes include sequences comprising amino acids 68 through 109; amino acids 148 through 186; amino acids 284 through 326; or amino acids 361 through 407 of SEQ ID NO:7. This invention also encompasses polynucleotides encoding these epitopes, and vectors and host cells comprising these polynucleotides. For example, such polynucleotides may comprise nucleotides 202 through 327; nucleotides 442 through 558; nucleotides 850 through 978; or nucleotides 1081 through 1221 of SEQ ID NO:131. Similarly, these polynucleotides may comprise nucleotides 322 through 447; nucleotides 562 through 678; nucleotides 970 through 1098; or nucleotides 1201 through 1341 of SEQ ID NO:6., 265274=[0285] Vectors that express glutamine synthase as the selectable marker include, but are not limited to, the pEE6 expression vector (described in Stephens and Cockett (1989) Nucl Acids. Res. 17:7110). A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: W087/04462; W086/05807; W089/01036; W089/10404; and W091/06657, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In addition, glutamine synthase expression vectors that can be used in accordance with the present invention are commercially available from suppliers, including, for example, Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Portsmouth, N.H.). The expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells has been described (Bebbington et al. (1992) BioTechnology, 10:169 and in Biblia and Robinson (1995) Biotechnol. Prog. 11:1, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties)., 425202=[0493] An isolated BSL2vcvc polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecule corresponding to ATCC No. PTA-1993, deposited on Jun. 6, 2000., 46220=[0005] B7 has been shown to bind to two counter-receptors (ligands) expressed on T-cells, termed CD28 and CTLA-4. B7 binding to CD28 induces T-cells to proliferate and secrete IL-2 (P. S. Linsley et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 173, 721-730; C. D. Gimmi et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:6575-6579; C. B. Thompson et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1333-1337; C. H. June et al. (1990) Immunol. Today 11:211-6; F. A. Harding et al. (1992) Nature 356:607-609), allowing full T-cell activation. Conversely, B7 binding to CTLA-4 mediates T-cell down-regulation. The importance of the B7:CD28/CTLA-4 costimulatory pathway has been demonstrated in vitro and in several in vivo model systems. Blockade of this pathway results in the development of antigen specific tolerance in murine and humans systems (F. A. Harding et al. (1992) Nature 356:607-609; D. J. Lenschow et al. (1992) Science 257:789-792; L. A. Turka et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11102-11105; C. D. Gimmi et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6586-6590). Conversely, the ectopic expression of B7 in B7-negative murine tumor cells induces T-cell mediated specific immunity accompanied by tumor rejection and long lasting protection to tumor challenge (L. Chen et al. (1992) Cell 71:1093-1102; S. E. Townsend et al. (1993) Science 259:368-370; S. Baskar et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5687-5690). Therefore, manipulation of the B7:CD28/CTLA-4 pathway offers great potential to stimulate or suppress immune responses in humans., 440010=[0556] Following this step, 3 ml of washed SRBC was added to each tube, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was incubated on ice for at least 1 hr (hour), and each pellet was gently resuspended by inverting the tubes. Twelve milliliters of ficoll was used to underlay the mixture in each tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 20 min, and the interface layers were removed to new tubes as previously described. The interface layers were then resuspended in 10 ml elutriation buffer and stored on ice until the start of the elutriation procedure. It is noted the purification of T-cells using their affinity to SRBCs is termed E-rosetting., 90232=[0105] Any method known in the art can be used to align and compare the previously identified B7 factor sequence with the sequences present in the protein sequence databases. Preferably, the BLAST program is used (S. F. Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; S. Karlin et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-68; S. Karlin et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-7). BLAST identifies local alignments between the sequence of the previously identified protein and the protein sequences in the database, and predicts the probability of the local alignment occurring by chance. Although the original BLAST programs utilized ungapped local alignments, more recently developed BLAST programs such as WU-BLAST2/BLAST v2.0 (S. F. Altschul et al. (1996) Methods Enzymol. 266, 460-480) have been modified to incorporate gapped local alignments similar to SSEARCH (T. F. Smith et al. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 147:195-197) and FASTA programs (W. R. Pearson (1990) Methods Enzymol. 183:63-98). In addition, position-specific-iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) programs have been developed to identify weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities (S. F. Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). Furthermore, pattern-hit-initiated BLAST (PHI-BLAST) programs have been designed to identify specific patterns or sequence motifs shared by distantly-related proteins (Z. Zhang et al. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26:3986-3990). Specialized BLAST programs are also available for performing searches of human, microbial, and malaria genome sequences, as well as searches for vector, immunoglobulin, and predicted human consensus sequences (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, Md.)., 470624=[0589] BSL1 monoclonal antibodies: The BSL1 -Ig fusion protein was purified by affinity purification as described for BSL3-Ig, below. The purified fusion protein was then used to immunize mice using the protocol described for BSL3-Ig. Following this, hybridoma cell lines were constructed and BSL1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were isolated as described for BSL3, below. In addition, BSL1 MAbs were screened for specificity by whole-cell ELISA. For whole cell ELISA, COS cells were transiently transfected with full length BSL1 (L156-3). Cells were lifted with versene on day 4 following transfection. Cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in PBS with 10% FBS at a concentration of 5.0\ufffd106 cells/ml. Then, 50 \u03bcl of cells were added to each well of a Falcon 3911 96-well plate and incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, 50 \u03bcl supernatant from the putative BSL1 hybridomas was added per well and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham; Cat. # NA9310) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 125 \u03bcl PBS. Following this, cells were transferred to a fresh plate. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 25 \u03bcl PBS. Next, 125 \u03bcl Peroxidase solution B (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.; Cat. #50-65-00) with TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL; Cat. # 50-76-01) was added. Color was allowed to develop. Cells were pelleted, and 100 \u03bcl supernatant was transferred to an Immulon 2 plate. The signal was quenched with 100 \u03bcl 1 N sulfuric acid, and the plates were read at OD450/OD630., 433693=[0534] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising at least 410 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:12; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:132., 503107=[0624] BSL2-L165-35b-Ig (BSL2v1c2-Ig) was constructed as follows. The extracellular domain of BSL2-L165-35b was amplified by PCR from an L165-35b DNA preparation. The PCR reaction included 1 \u03bcl of a 1/1000 dilution of the L165-35b template, PCR buffer, dNTP, and MgCl2 from Gibco (described herein), 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM primer BSL2-L165-21-Ig-1, 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM primer BSL2-L165-21-Ig-2 (both primers were described for the BSL2-4616811-Ig construction, below), and 1 \u03bcl CLONTECH AdvanTaq Plus (Palo Alto, Calif.; Cat. # 8431-1) in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. PCR conditions included incubation at 94\ufffd C. for 1 min; followed by 20 cycles of incubation at 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 59\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 72\ufffd C. for 45 sec; followed by incubation at 72\ufffd C. for 10 min. PCR was performed on a PE Applied Biosystems (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler., 586733=[0697] Cells were grown to about 5\ufffd105 cells/ml. Cells were washed twice in serum free RPMI 1640 and resuspended to give a final concentration of 2.5\ufffd106 cells/ml. Anti-BSL3 MAb 1A4A1 antibodies or isotype control MAb 15E10A3 antibodies (also called MAb 15E10M3, MAb 3-15E10A3, and MAb 3\u201415) were added to 5 \u03bcg/ml and incubated at 4\ufffd C. for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in serum free RPMI 1640 and resuspended in serum free RPMI 1640 plus 2% goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to FITC (BioSource, Camarillo, Calif.; Cat. # AMI4408). Cells were incubated 30 min at 4\ufffd C. Cells were washed twice in serum free RPMI 1640 and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). BSL3 polypeptide was expressed on A549 (lung epithelium), H292 (lung epithelium), PM LCL (B lineage), PL LCL (B lineage), CE LCL (B lineage), and HUT78 (T lineage) cells (FIG. 9C)., 279361=[0297] Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art.

For FASTA analysis, all the parameters were set to the default designations (W. R. Pearson et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-2448). The sequence database searches identified two Incyte Genomics \u2018templates\u2019: 252899.6 and the potential splice variant 252899.8. It is noted that Incyte Genomics templates are consensus EST sequences that are considered to represent mRNA transcripts., 155338=[0173] Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention encompasses a BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) polypeptide that includes amino acids 1 through 698 of SEQ ID NO:9. The invention also encompasses a BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) polypeptide that lacks the initiating methionine, but includes amino acids 2 through 698 of SEQ ID NO:9. The invention further encompasses a polypeptide that lacks the signal sequence, but includes the remaining sequence of BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) polypeptide, i.e., the mature sequence of BSL2-4616811-Ig. Specifically, the invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising amino acids 29 through 698 of SEQ ID NO:9. The invention also encompasses BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) polynucleotides comprising nucleotides 1 through 2094, nucleotides 4 through 2094, or nucleotides 85 through 2094 of SEQ ID NO:8. Also encompassed are recombinant vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 137737=[0159] Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention encompasses a polypeptide that lacks the signal sequence, but includes the remaining sequence of BSL2-4616811 (BSL2vcvc) polypeptide (i.e., the mature sequence of BSL2-4616811). Specifically, the invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising amino acids 29 through 534 of SEQ ID NO:7. The invention also encompasses a polynucleotide comprising nucleotides 85 through 1602 of SEQ ID NO:131, as well as a polypeptide comprising nucleotides 205 through 1722 of SEQ ID NO:6. Also encompassed are recombinant vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 94260=[0109] One aspect of the present invention pertains to isolated nucleic acids having a nucleotide sequence such as BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1 or 3), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:6, 10,12, or 131), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:14), or fragments thereof. The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be DNA or RNA. A preferred nucleic acid is a DNA encoding the human BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15), or fragments or functional equivalents thereof. Such nucleic acids can comprise at least 15, 20, 25, 50, 60, 100, 200, 240, 255, 270, 300, 305, 310, 410, 500, 619, 630, 700, or 1000 contiguous nucleotides., 427724=[0506] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 4-738 of SEQ ID NO:134; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:134., 185213=[0204] A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods, including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab\u2032 fragments. (See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann (1990) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321; Kostelny et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:1547 1553). In addition, bispecific antibodies can be formed as \u201cdiabodies\u201d (See, Holliger et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448), or \u201cJanusins\u201d (See, Traunecker et al. (1991)EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 and Traunecker et al. (1992) Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 7:51-52)., 526545=[0649] BSL3 was identified by BLAST and FASTA analysis of the Incyte Genomics sequence databases utilizing the B7-1 or B7-2 proteins as query sequences, and the parameters described for the BSL2 searches. The sequence database searches identified Incyte Genomics \u2018gene\u2019 117327. It is noted that an Incyte Genomics gene is an EST sequence that is grouped with similar sequences, and considered to represent the product of a single genomic locus. The Incyte Genomics gene 17327 has since been renamed as Incyte Genomics gene 899898. In a secondary screen, the BLAST and FASTA programs were used to search the Incyte Genomics sequence databases for sequences related to the mouse AF142780 gene (potential orthologue of the 117327 gene), using the previously described search parameters. These searches identified Incyte Genomics gene 143522., 594999=[0710] 1. For the first set of experiments, 100 \u03bcl of the indicated concentration (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.13, or 0 \u03bcg/ml) of anti-CD3 MAb G19.4 (described herein) was added in triplicate to a Costar plate (Corning Inc., Corning N.Y.; Cat. # 3595) in Gibco DPBS (Invitrogen Corp., Grand Island, N.Y.). The plate was incubated at 4\ufffd C. for 16 hr. The plate was washed two times in DPBS. Following this, 100 \u03bcl of 30 \u03bcg/ml BSL2-4616811-Ig (BSL2vcvc-Ig) or 10 \u03bcg/ml ChiL6 fusion protein was added per well in triplicate and incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 4 hr. The plate was washed two times in DPBS. Then, 50,000 E-rosetted peripheral blood T-cells in 200 \u03bcl Gibco RPMI 1640 (Cat. # 11875-085) plus 1/100 volume Gibco penicillin-streptomycin (Cat. # 15140-122) plus 10% human serum (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; Cat. # H4522) were added per well. The plate was incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 2 days., 564173=[0675] L262-2 was digested with BamHI/XbaI and run on a 1.2% agarose/0.5\ufffd TBE gel. An approximately 1300-bp fragment was purified using QIAGEN gel extraction kit. Ten nanograms of the purified fragment was ligated into 30 ng of BamHI/XbaI digested pD18 (related to pD16 and pD17 plasmids, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,228). Five microliters of the ligation was used for transformation into GibcoBRL MAX Efficiency DH5-alpha competent bacteria. Transformants were plated onto LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. Colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. Plasmid DNA was purified using QIAGEN spin miniprep kit. Plasmid DNA was digested with BamHI plus XbaI or HindIII, and the digested samples were analyzed on an agarose gel. As determined by restriction mapping, L275-1 through L275-9 contained the correct construction., 589909=[0702] PBMC were resuspended in flasks containing RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS, and incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 1 hr. Flasks were rocked once every 20 min. Flasks were washed gently (twice) with media to remove T-cells and B cells. Flasks were then washed vigorously with RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to obtain monocytes. PBMC were washed twice in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PBMC were resuspended to 5\ufffd106 cells/ml, and transferred to flasks. PBMC were incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 without stimulation for 4 days. In parallel experiments, PBMC were incubated with GM-CSF (15 ng/ml) and IL-4 (75 ng/ml) for 4 days, or PBMC were incubated with PHA (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 4 days. Flasks were washed vigorously with RPMI 1640 to remove the monocytes. PBMC were washed twice in RPMI 1640 examined by flow cytometry as described for the various cell lines, above. The results indicated that BSL3 polypeptide levels increased on GM-CSF IL4 or PHA stimulated cells (FIGS. 9E-9F). This increase was not observed in unstimulated cells (FIGS. 9E-9F)., 47878=[0006] In addition to the previously characterized B7 molecule (referred to hereafter as B7-1) B7-1-like molecules have been identified (see, e.g., M.

Med. 192:1027-1034; Y. Latchman et al., (2001) Nature Immunology 2:261-268), whereas B7-H1, B7-H3, and B7-DC have been described as co-stimulators of T-cell proliferation (H. Dong et al. (1999) Nature Medicine 5:1365-1369; A. I. Chapoval (2001) Nature Immunology 2:269-274; Tseng et al. (2001) J. Exp. Med. 193(7):839-45)., 432935=[0531] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1-738 of SEQ ID NO:132; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:132., 464334=[0581] Peripheral blood T-cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 10% human serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 48 hr. Peripheral blood T-cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% human serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 24-72 hr in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (MAb G19.4; P. S. Linsley et al. (1993) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 11:191-212) and 1 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (MAb 9.3; Linsley et al., supra). Peripheral blood T-cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 10% human serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 48 hr in the presence of 30 ng/ml PMA with 1 \u03bcM ionomycin. Peripheral blood T-cells stimulated with PHA were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 10% human serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 48 hr in the presence of 3 \u03bcg/ml PHA. THP1 cells obtained from an immortal human monocytic cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 with or without 100 ng/ml LPS for 2 hr. Peripheral blood monocytes were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 25% fetal bovine serum in teflon plates at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 with or without 1 \u03bcg/ml PHA or 15 ng/ml GM-CSF with 75 ng/ml IL-4 for 7 days. RAJI and RAMOS cells obtained from immortal human B cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2. HMVEC were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 with or without 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha for 1-24 hr. H292 cells obtained from an immortal human lung epithelial cell line were grown in RPM11640 (Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2, and then grown in serum free medium for 16 hr prior to harvest., 87359=[0102] The cDNA library can be used to clone B7-related factors utilizing expression cloning techniques (see B. Seed et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3365-3369; A. Aruffo et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:8573-8577). In one embodiment, plasmid DNA is introduced into a cell line by known methods of transfection (e.g., DEAE-Dextran) and allowed to replicate and express the cDNA inserts. B7-1 antigen is depleted from the transfected cells using an anti-B7-1 monoclonal antibody (e.g., 133 and B.1.1) and anti-murine IgG and IgM coated immunomagnetic beads. Transfectants expressing B7-related factors are positively selected by incubation with CTLA-4-Ig and CD28-Ig followed by panning with anti-human Ig immunoglobulin. After panning, episomal DNA is recovered from the panned cells and transfected into a competent bacterial host, preferably Escherichia coli (E. coli). Plasmid DNA is subsequently reintroduced into the cell line and the cycle of expression and panning repeated at least two times. Following the final panning cycle, plasmid DNA is prepared from individual colonies, transfected into the cell line and analyzed for expression of the B7-related polypeptides by indirect immunofluorescence with CTLA-4-Ig and CD28-Ig. After cloning, plasmids are prepared from the clones strongly reactive with the CTLA-4-Ig, and then sequenced using conventional sequencing techniques (reviewed in G. W. Slater et al. (1998) Electrophoresis 19:1525-41)., 436814=[0549] An isolated BSL2v1c2 fusion polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. ______, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 540883=[0658] The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of BSL3 are shown in FIGS. 5A-5B. The plasmid carrying DNA encoding BSL3 (pCR2.1:BSL3) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1986, on Jun. 6, 2000. It is noted that all ATCC deposits described herein were made in accordance with the Budapest Treaty., 462191=[0575] It is noted that the BSL1 coding sequence and predicted amino acid sequence have also been identified as B7-H1 and PD-L1 (H. Dong et al. (1999) Nature Med. 5:1365-9; GenPept Accession No. NP\u2014054862; G. J. Freeman et al. (2000)J. Exp. Med. 192:1027-1034). In addition, a murine homologue of B7-H1 has been identified (H. Tamura et al. (2001)Blood 97:1809-1816). Notably, the mouse and human B7-H1 factors have been described as costimulatory molecules (H. Dong et al. (1999) Nature Med. 5:1365-9; H. Tamura et al. (2001) Blood 97:1809-1816), whereas PD-L1 has been described as an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation (G. J. Freeman et al. (2000) J. Exp. Med. 192:1027-1034)., 427977=[0507] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 85-738 of SEQ ID NO:134; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:134., 578736=[0694] A549, a lung epithelium cell line was cultured in RPM11640 (GibcoBRL Cat. # 11875-005) plus 10% FBS (Summit, Ft Collins, Colo.; Cat. # S-100-05) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GibcoBRL Cat. # 15140-122) at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 to 90% confluence in a T75 flask (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.; Cat. # 353111). Cells were lifted with Versene (GibcoBRL Cat. # 15040-066) and washed twice in RPMI 1640. Cells were added to a 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson Cat. # 353077; 2.5\ufffd105 cells per well), and centrifuged at 2000 RPM in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge. Next, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 or RPMI1640 with 1 \u03bcg negative control antibody (MAb 15E10 AA3; also called MAb 15E10A3, MAb 3-13E10A3, or MAb 3\u201415) or hybridoma supernatant, and incubated on ice for 30 min. It is noted that MAb 15E10AA3 does not recognize the BSL2 or BSL3 polypeptides, but is the identical isotype as the anti-BSL2 antibodies. Cells were then washed twice in RPMI 1640, and resuspended in goat anti-mouse anti-Fc FITC conjugated antibodies (BioSource, Camarillo, Calif.; Cat. # AMI4408) diluted 1:50 in RPMI 1640. Following this, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, washed twice in RPMI 1640, resuspended in RPMI 1640, and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Results of FACS analysis are shown for anti-BSL1 MAb 32F9A7 (FIG. 9A) and anti-BSL2-4616811 MAbs (FIG. 9B). It is noted that all MAbs bound to the A549 cells. It is also noted that anti-BSL2 MAb 1 F7G2, anti-BSL2 MAb 2B10D7, anti-BSL2 MAb 3E6D3, anti-BSL2 MAb 4C2C6, and anti-BSL2 MAb 5D7E2 are also termed anti-BSL2-1 MAb, anti-BSL2-2 MAb, anti-BSL2-3 MAb, anti-BLS2-4 MAb, and anti-BSL2-5 MAb, respectively, as described herein., 315680=[0337] Modulators that bind to BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 polypeptides, polynucleotides, functional equivalents, or fragments thereof, can be identified using real-time Bimolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA; Sjolander et al. (1991) Anal. Chem. 63:2338-2345; Szabo et al. (1995) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699-705; e.g., BIAcore\u2122; LKB Pharmacia, Sweden). Modulators can also be identified by scintillation proximity assays (SPA, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,649). Binding assays using mitochondrial targeting signals (Hurt et al. (1985) EMBO J. 4:2061-2068; Eilers and Schatz, (1986) Nature 322:228-231) a plurality of defined polymers synthesized on a solid substrate (Fodor et al. (1991) Science 251:767-773) may also be employed., 490230=[0605] The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the BSL2-L165-21 splice variant are shown in FIGS. 3C-3D, while the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of BSL2-L165-35b are shown in FIGS. 3E-3F. The plasmid carrying DNA encoding BSL2-L165-21 (pCR2.1:BSL2-L165-21) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1987, on Jun. 6, 2000. In addition, the plasmid carrying DNA encoding BSL2-L165-35b (pCR2.1:BSL2-L165-35b) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA), under ATCC Designation No. PTA-1988, on Jun. 6, 2000., 235442=[0255] Further, antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotypic antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d B7-related polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, e.g., Greenspan and Bona (1989) FASEB J. 7(5):437-444 and Nissinoff (1991) J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438). For example, antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and/or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d one or more of the BSL-1, BSL2, or BSL2 polypeptide domains and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize the polypeptide and/or its binding partner, e.g., in therapeutic regimens. Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used to neutralize polypeptide activity. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and/or to bind its, and thereby activate or block its biological activity., 150969=[0168] Preferred polypeptide embodiments further include an isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence sharing at least 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, 99.5 or 100% identity with an amino acid sequence of BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15). This polypeptide sequence may be identical to the sequence of BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15), or may include up to a certain integer number of amino acid alterations as compared to the reference sequence Percent sequence identity can be calculated using computer programs or direct sequence comparison. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, FASTA, BLASTP, and TBLASTN (see, e.g., D. W. Mount, 2001, Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). The BLASTP and TBLASTN programs are publicly available from NCBI and other sources. The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity., 497613=[0616] Total RNA was prepared using the Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) SNAP total RNA isolation kit (Cat. # K1950-01) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was produced using the GibcoBRL Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Cat. # 11904-018) according to the manufacturer's instructions for oligo dT priming. PCR was performed using 2 \u03bcl first strand cDNA, 5 \u03bcl PCR buffer (GibcoBRL), 1.5 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2 (GibcoBRL), 1 \u03bcl of 10 mM dNTPs (GibcoBRL), 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 pMol/\u03bcl BSL2-9 primer (5\u2032 TGGTGCACAGCTTTGCT 3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:61), 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 pMol/\u03bcl BSL2-11 primer (5\u2032 TCTGGGGGGAATGTCAT 3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:62), 0.5 \u03bcl of 5 U/\u03bcl GibcoBRL platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Cat. # 10966-018), and 35 \u03bcl dH2O. PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems 9700 using the following cycling conditions: 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec; followed by 35 cycles of 94\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 61\ufffd C. for 30 sec, 72\ufffd C. for 60 sec; followed by 72\ufffd C. for 10 min. Following this, 40 \u03bcl of the PCR reaction mixture was run on a 1.2% agarose gel., 403537=[0423] Several approaches can be used to produce transgenic mice. In one approach, a targeting vector is integrated into ES cell by homologous recombination, an intrachromosomal recombination event is used to eliminate the selectable markers, and only the transgene is left behind (A. L. Joyner et al. (1989) Nature 338(6211):153-6; P. Hasty et al. (1991) Nature 350(6315):243-6; V. Valancius and 0. Smithies, (1991) Mol. Cell Biol. 11(3):1402-8; S. Fiering et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90(18):8469-73). In an alternative approach, two or more strains are created; one strain contains the gene knocked-out by homologous recombination, while one or more strains contain transgenes. The knockout strain is crossed with the transgenic strain to produce new line of animals in which the original wild-type allele has been replaced (although not at the same site) with a transgene. Notably, knockout and transgenic animals can be produced by commercial facilities (e.g., The Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio; B&K Universal, Inc., Fremont, Calif.; DNX Transgenic Sciences, Cranbury, N.J.; Incyte Genomics, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.)., 66504=[0035]FIG. 3G shows the coding sequence of BSL2-4616811 (BSL2vcvc; SEQ ID NO:131). The sequence encoding the mature form of the BSL2-4616811 polypeptide begins at nucleotide 85; nucleotides 1-3 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); and nucleotides 1396-1467 encode the predicted transmembrane domain., 573419=[0686] Mice were given a final boost 3-4 days prior to fusion in PBS intravenously or intraperitoneal. Myeloma cells were kept in exponential growth (log phase). The mice were euthanized, and the spleen from each mouse was aseptically harvested. The spleen was placed in a petri dish containing warm Iscoves solution without FBS. A spleen cell suspension was prepared and transferred to a centrifuge tube. HAT-sensitive myeloma cells were placed in a separate 50 ml centrifuge tube. Spleen cells and myeloma cells were centrifuged at 400\ufffd g for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The red blood cells from the spleen were lysed with 5 ml RBC Lysing Buffer for 1 min, and the tube was filled with SF media (hybridoma serum-free media; GibcoBRL; Cat. # 12045-076). Splenocytes were washed with 50 ml SF media, and spleen cells and myeloma cells were centrifuged in separate centrifuge tubes at 400\ufffd g for 5 min. Spleen cells and myeloma cells were counted and resuspended in 25 ml with SF media. Myeloma cells were added to spleen cells to give a 1:4 ratio. The mixture was centrifuged at 400\ufffd g for 10 min to form a tight pellet, and all media solution was removed by aspiration., 64184=[0029]FIG. 3A shows the nucleotide sequence of the BSL2-4616811 clone (SEQ ID NO:6); nucleotides 1-12 include vector sequence; nucleotides 121-123 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); between nucleotides 204-205 is the predicted signal peptide cleavage site; nucleotides 1516-1587 encode the predicted transmembrane domain; nucleotides 1723-1725 contain the translation termination signal (TGA). It is noted that BSL2-4616811 is also called BSL2vcvc for the purposes of this invention., 427473=[0505] An isolated nucleic acid fusion molecule comprising a) nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 1-738 of SEQ ID NO:134; and b) a nucleotide sequence comprising nucleotides 745-1440 of SEQ ID NO:134., 425385=[0494] An isolated BSL2vcvc-Ig fusion polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. ______, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 174342=[0193] Epitope-bearing peptides of the invention can also be incorporated into a coat protein of a virus, which can then be used as an immunogen or a vaccine with which to immunize animals, including humans, in order stimulate the production of anti-epitope antibodies. For example, the V3 loop of the gp120 glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been engineered to be expressed on the surface of rhinovirus. Immunization with rhinovirus displaying the V3 loop peptide yielded apparently effective mimics of the HIV-1 immunogens (as measured by their ability to be neutralized by anti-HIV-1 antibodies as well as by their ability to elicit the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in cell culture). This techniques of using engineered viral particles as immunogens is described in more detail in Smith et al. (1997) Behring Inst Mitt Feb, 98:229-39; Smith et al. (1998) J. Virol. 72:651-659; and Zhang et al. (1999) Biol.

Commercially available two-hybrid systems such as the CLONTECH Matchmaker198 systems and protocols (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) are also useful (see also, A. R. Mendelsohn et al. (1994) Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:482; E. M. Phizicky et al. (1995) Microbiological Rev. 59:94; M. Yang et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:1152; S. Fields et al. (1994) Trends Genet. 10:286; and U.S. Pat.

All cell types were pelleted and frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221270\ufffd C. until use., 69149=[0042]FIG. 4E shows the nucleotide sequence of the BSL2-L165-21-Ig clone (SEQ ID NO:134); nucleotides 1-3 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); nucleotides 1-84 encode the predicted signal peptide sequence; nucleotides 85-738 encode the predicted mature ECD; nucleotides 739-744 contain an EcoRI site introduced by PCR to facilitate construction of the fusion; nucleotides 745-1440 encode the human Ig portion of the fusion construct., 188684=[0207] The antibodies of the present invention can be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific, or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies can be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide of the present invention, or can be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention, and a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. (See, e.g., PCT publications WO 93/17715; WO 92/08802; WO 91/00360; WO 92/05793; Tuft et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:60-69; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; and Kostelny et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553)., 515564=[0635] White colonies were inoculated into 5 ml LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin, and grown at 37\ufffd C. for 18 hr. Plasmid DNA was purified with QIAGEN spin miniprep kit (Cat. # 27106). Plasmid DNA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI. Plasmids containing inserts of about 1300-bp were sequenced using Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers (ABI 3700 capillary array sequencers). L254-7 was determined to contain wild-type BSL2-4616811 sequence., 67476=[0038]FIG. 4A shows the nucleotide sequence of the BSL2-4616811-Ig clone (SEQ ID NO:8); nucleotides 1-3 contain the translation initiation signal (ATG); nucleotides 1-1394 encode the BSL2-4616811 ECD; nucleotide 1395 is a silent mutation introduced to facilitate construction of the fusion protein; nucleotides 1396-2094 encode the Fc portion of human IgG1; nucleotides 2095-2097 contain the translation termination signal (TGA)., 397983=[0418] In one aspect of the invention, BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 knockout mice can be produced in accordance with well-known methods (see, e.g., M. R. Capecchi, (1989) Science, 244:1288-1292; P. Li et al. (1995) Cell 80:401-411; L. A. Galli-Taliadoros et al. (1995) J. Immunol. Methods 181(1):1-15; C. H. Westphal et al. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7(7):530-3; S. S. Cheah et al. (2000) Methods Mol. Biol. 136:455-63). The human BSL1, BSL2, and BSL3 clones can be used isolate murine homologues. Murine homologues can then be used to prepare a murine BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 targeting construct that can disrupt BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 in the mouse by homologous recombination at the corresponding chromosomal locus. The targeting construct can comprise a disrupted or deleted murine BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 sequence that inserts in place of the functioning fragment of the native mouse gene. For example, the construct can contain an insertion in the murine BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 protein-coding region., 96120=[0112] In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses a polynucleotide comprising the start codon and the remaining coding sequence of BSL2-4616811 (BSL2vcvc). Specifically, the invention encompasses a polynucleotide comprising nucleotides 1 through 1602 of SEQ ID NO:131. The invention also encompasses a polynucleotide comprising nucleotides 121 through 1722 of SEQ ID NO:6, and the corresponding polypeptide comprising amino acids 1 through 534 of SEQ ID NO:7. Also encompassed are vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors., 400483=[0420] The targeting construct can be employed, for example, in embryonal stem cell (ES). ES cells may be obtained from pre-implantation embryos cultured in vitro (M. J. Evans et al. (1981) Nature 292:154-156; M. O. Bradley et al. (1984) Nature 309:255-258; Gossler et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9065-9069; Robertson et al. (1986) Nature 322:445-448; S. A. Wood et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:4582-4584). Targeting constructs can be efficiently introduced into the ES cells by standard techniques such as DNA transfection or by retrovirus-mediated transduction. Following this, the transformed ES cells can be combined with blastocysts from a non-human animal. The introduced ES cells colonize the embryo and contribute to the germ line of the resulting chimeric animal (R. Jaenisch, (1988) Science 240:1468-1474). The use of gene-targeted ES cells in the generation of gene-targeted transgenic mice has been previously described (Thomas et al. (1987) Cell 51:503-512) and is reviewed elsewhere (Frohman et al. (1989) Cell 56:145-147; Capecchi (1989) Trends in Genet. 5:70-76; Baribault et al. (1989) Mol. Biol. Med. 6:481-492; Wagner, (1990) EMBO J. 9:3025-3032; Bradley et al. (1992) Bio/Technology 10: 534-539)., 431351=[0523] An isolated BSL2v2c2 fusion polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid fusion molecule corresponding to ATCC Deposit No. _____, deposited Feb. 8, 2002., 514954=[0634] Following this, 30 \u03bcl of the PCR reaction was run on a 1.2% agarose/0.5\ufffd TBE gel. A band of approximately 1100-bp was excised and purified using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit (Cat. # 28704). One microliter of the purified PCR product (L254) was ligated into pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen; Cat. # K2050-01). Five microliters of the ligation mixture was used for transformation into MAX Efficiency DH5-alpha competent bacteria (GibcoBRL; Cat. # 18258-012), and transformants were plated onto LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 800 \u03bcg X-Gal.}",
