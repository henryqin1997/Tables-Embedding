The conductive layer is preferably a metal such as copper, nickel, palladium, platinum, gold, or alloys thereof that is capable of being easily wetted by solder and alloys thereof., 45558=Referring to drawing FIG. 2h, a solder ball 1032 is formed in the sloped-wall via 1026 in contact with the conductive repattern trace 1016., 45957=It will also be understood that a solid preform comprising a \u201cblank\u201d of substrate material (such as Si) may be employed over the exposed trace ends of the wafer to define vias anisotropically wet-etched and plated with metal to define the UBM. For purposes of this invention, a preform Si blank may also be considered as a passivation layer. Techniques for such via and UBM formation are disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/612,159, filed Mar. 7, 1996 and assignee of the present invention, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference. The anisotropic wet etch of the silicon blank may be effected by a KOH:H2O mixture, resulting in a preferred 54\ufffd via wall angle to the horizontal for formation of a solder ball therein., 36995=U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,787, issued on Nov. 28, 1995, to Greer relates to a substantially cylindrical layered solder bump wherein the bump comprises a lower tin layer adjacent to the UBM pad, a thick lead layer, and an upper tin layer to provide an optimized, localized eutectic formation at the top of the bump during solder reflow., 44593=An appropriate acid, such as a 1:2 ratio mix of ammonium fluoride and acetic acid, or a 100:1 ratio mix of H2O and HF acid for etching an SiO film, or hot (150-180\ufffd C.) phosphoric acid in the case of an Si3N4 film, is then applied to the surface of the wafer. Other suitable etchants, as known in the art, may be employed in the case of polymer-based films, such as polyamides. After a short period of time of etching, a concave recess begins to form on the passivation film. The process continues until the etching forms the sloped via having somewhat arcuate or curved sloped edges and which exposes the face surface of the conductive electrode. Resist is then stripped. An etch, performed as described above, forms a wall angle of the via with respect to the horizontal which is desirable for solder ball formation by increasing surface area exposed to shear forces. Thus, as shown, a UBM structure is formed., 40821=Still referring to drawing FIG. 2b, a photoresist 1005 is applied, masked and exposed (broken lines). The polyamide passivation film layer 1006 is then etched, using well known etching techniques, to form a bond pad via 1008 through the polyamide passivation film layer 1006 to the bond pad 1002, as shown., 42486=Referring to drawing FIG. 2g, a faceted or sloped-wall via 1026 is shown as etched according to the following preferred processes. A sputter etching process for forming sloped-wall vias 1026 begins with providing a semiconductor wafer assembly comprising a semiconductor wafer with a plurality of semiconductor elements (dice) including integrated circuitry formed on the face (active) surface and with the plurality of conductive traces and bond pads also formed on the semiconductor wafer face surface positioned to contact respective semiconductor element circuitry. A passivation film is disposed over the semiconductor wafer face surface, as well as the conductive traces and pads. A first layer of etch resist film, such as a photoresist, is applied to the face surface of the passivation film, then masked, exposed, and stripped to form desired openings in the first etch resist film. After a short period of time being subjected to sputter etching, sloped edges begin to form on the etch resist film as the wafer is sputtered and both resist film and passivation film are etched. The sputtering process continues and sloped edges or walls begin to form in the passivation film after the resist is penetrated., 36653=U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,845,issued Aug. 11, 1992, to Lochon et al. pertains to a method of forming solder bumps and UBM pads of a desired size on semiconductor chips based on an involved photolithographic technique such that the dimensions of the solder bumps can be reduced in order to increase the number of bumps on a chip., 27539=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/908,613, filed Aug. 7, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,147,413, issued Nov. 14, 2000, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/767,162, filed Dec. 16, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,911, issued Dec. 22, 1998, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/612,059, filed Mar. 7, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,236, issued Jun. 6, 2000, and application Ser. No. 08/682,141, filed Jul. 17, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,456, issued Apr. 7, 1998., 42165=Referring to drawing FIG. 2f, a suitable etch resistant layer 1020 (photoresist) is applied over an upper surface 1022 of the second passivation film layer 1018, masked, and etched to form a resist via 1024 at the alternative, repattemed bond pad location, as shown., 39102=Referring to drawing FIGS. 2a-2 h, the method of the present invention for repatterning the circuits on a flip chip is illustrated. Specifically, referring to drawing FIG. 2a, a semiconductor substrate or wafer 1004 includes a bond pad 1002 connected to a circuit 100. As shown in FIG. 2b, a first layer of passivation film 1006 is applied over a face surface or active surface 1010 of the semiconductor wafer 1004. The first passivation film layer 1006 is preferably a suitable polyamide layer. The polyamide passivation film layer 1006 is typically formed by spin coating a mixture of diamine and dianhydride monomers in a solvent, usually N-methyl-pyrrolidine 2 (NMP). Depending upon the predetermined formulation of the polyamide, the thickness of the polyamide coating is directly related to the speed of rotation of the wafer. The monomers combine at low temperature to form polyamic acid, which is soluble in NMP. The passivation film is subsequently dried at approximately 100\ufffd C. to initially remove most of the solvent and further dried at 250-400\ufffd C. to ensure complete solvent removal and the conversion to polyamide. If the pyromellitic dianhydride-oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA) family of polyamides is used, such polyamides are isotropic in behavior, while long polymer chain biphenyldiaminine-phenyldiamine (BPDA-PDA) polyamides tend to be anisotropic in mechanical and electrical properties. Either type of polyamide can be used for the passivation layer. In this manner the polyamide is capable of absorbing the thin film stresses imparted from the deposition of the interconnection by the solder., 36244=Numerous techniques have been devised to improve the UBM and formation of solder bumps for flip chips. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,360,142, issued Nov. 23, 1982, to Carpenter et al. relates to forming multiple layer UBM pads between a semiconductor device and a supporting substrate particularly suited to high stress use conditions that generate thermal gradients in the interconnection., 41590=Referring to drawing FIG. 2d, the conductive layer 1012, shown in FIG. 2c, is photoresist-coated, masked, exposed, and etched, using well known techniques, to form at least one conductive repattern trace 1016 extending to a substitute or alternative bond pad location, as shown in FIG. 2d.}",
