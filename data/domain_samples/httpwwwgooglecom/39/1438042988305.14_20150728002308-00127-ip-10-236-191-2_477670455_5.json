The oxygen containing gas is supplied at a flow rate between 0 sccm and about 500 sccm, such as between about 0 sccm and about 200 sccm, for example between about 0 sccm and about 100 sccm, such as between about 0 sscm and about 10 sccm. RF power is applied to the target 242 and/or the substrate support pedestal 252. In one embodiment, the RF power supplied to the target is a DC power. In one embodiment, the RF power may be supplied to the target 242 between about 10,000 Watts and about 38,000 Watts and the RF power may be supplied to the substrate support pedestal 252 between about 0 Watts and about 1000 Watts., 20197=This is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/041,804, filed Mar. 4, 2008, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,618,893, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 50129=In a particular embodiment wherein the barrier layer 404 is desired to be a metal nitride layer, a nitrogen containing gas is provided in the gas mixture to serve as a reactive gas. The nitrogen containing gas reacts with the sputtered material from the target 242, thereby forming the metal nitride as the barrier layer 404 on the substrate 100. In the embodiment wherein the barrier layer 404 is desired to be formed as a metal oxynitride layer, at least a nitrogen containing gas and at least an oxygen containing gas is supplied into the processing chamber 200 to serve as the reactive gas. The nitrogen and oxygen containing gas react with the sputtered material from the target 242, forming metal oxynitride as the barrier layer 404 on the substrate. Suitable examples of the nitrogen containing gas include N2, N2O, NO2, NH3 and the like. Suitable examples of the oxygen containing gas include O2, O3, H2O, N2O, NO2 and the like. The nitrogen and the oxygen containing reactive gases may be either in-situ ionized by a plasma generated within the processing chamber 200, or ex-situ ionized from a remote plasma source generated away from the interior of the processing chamber 200 and further delivered into the processing chamber 200. The active oxygen species, generated either in-situ in the processing chamber or ex-situ from the processing chamber, reacts with the nitrogen species and the sputtered material from the target 242, thereby incorporating oxygen element while forming the barrier layer 404 on the substrate 100. In one embodiment, the flow rate of the oxygen containing gas supplied into the processing chamber to form the metal oxynitride film is less than the flow rate of nitrogen containing gas supplied to the processing chamber. In an exemplary embodiment wherein the oxygen containing gas is O2 gas and the nitrogen containing gas is N2, the flow rate ratio of the O2 gas and the nitrogen containing gas is N2 is between about 1:2 to about 1:10, such as between about 1:2 to about 1:5., 60838=During the post treatment process, several process parameters may be regulated. In one embodiment, a pressure of post treatment process in the annealing/treatment process chamber is regulated between about 0 mTorr and about 1000 mTorr, such as between about 500 mTorr and about 1000 mTorr. The substrate temperature may be maintained between about 20 degrees Celsius and about 400 degrees Celsius, such as between about 200 degrees Celsius and about 300 degrees Celsius. The processing time may be set to a predetermined processing period or terminated after a desired amount of oxygen atoms has been treated into the barrier layer 404. In one embodiment, the process time may be processed at between about 0 seconds and about 120 seconds, for example between about 10 seconds and about 80 seconds, such as between about 30 seconds to about 40 seconds.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. Thus, methods of forming a barrier layer for an interconnection structure are provided. The improved barrier layer advantageously provides a high density and good barrier film properties while maintaining resistance of the barrier layer at a desired range. Additionally, the methods also reduce overall manufacture cost and increase throughput, thereby efficiently improving the product cycle time and production efficiency. by supplying a gas mixture including a nitrogen containing gas into the sputter chamber to react with the source material sputtered from the target disposed within the sputter chamber. A post treatment process is performed to treat the upper surface of the barrier layer 404, incorporating oxygen atoms into the barrier layer 404, thereby densifying the barrier layer 404, and converting the barrier layer 404 into a metal oxynitride layer, such as a titanium oxynitride layer (TiON) and/or a tantalum oxynitride (TaON) layer. The post treatment process may be performed at a precleaning chamber or other suitable plasma chamber having a remote plasma source. The post treatment process may be performed as described at block 306. After the post treatment process performed on the barrier layer 404, an upper barrier layer 406 is formed on",
