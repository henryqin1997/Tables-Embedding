    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{209118=Another method for removing the glass from a window is illustrated in FIG. 11C that is a fragmented cross section view of a window release mechanism where the window is completely ejected from the vehicle when the pressure in the vehicle exceeds a predetermined design value. This value is selected such that the window can only be ejected if more than two airbags are deployed. In this case, pressure on the glass surface 1215 creates a force along edges 1216 of the glass which is normally positioned within a mounting structure and retained therein by a gasket 1217. When that force exceeds the retaining force of the mounting gasket 1217, the window is released and is ejected by the gas pressure within the vehicle., 278046=The discussion above has centered on notifying the vehicle operator of a pending problem with a vehicle component. Today, there is great competition in the automobile marketplace and the manufacturers and dealers who are most responsive to customers are likely to benefit by increased sales both from repeat purchasers and new customers. The diagnostic module disclosed herein benefits the dealer by making him instantly aware, through the cellular telephone system coupled to the diagnostic module or system in accordance with the invention, when a component is likely to fail. As envisioned, on some automobiles, when the diagnostic module 2075 detects a potential failure it not only notifies the driver through a display 2100, but also automatically notifies the dealer through a vehicle cellular phone 2200. The dealer can thus phone the vehicle owner and schedule an appointment to undertake the necessary repair at each party's mutual convenience. The customer is pleased since a potential vehicle breakdown has been avoided and the dealer is pleased since he is likely to perform the repair work. The vehicle manufacturer also benefits by early and accurate statistics on the failure rate of vehicle components. This early warning system can reduce the cost of a potential recall for components having design defects. The vehicle manufacturer will thus be guided toward producing higher quality vehicles thus improving his competitiveness. Finally, experience with this system will actually lead to a reduction in the number of sensors on the vehicle since only those sensors that are successful in predicting failures will be necessary., 201400=A perspective view of a vehicle having several deployed airbags for both front and side protection is shown in FIG. 10. The vehicle includes frontal protection airbags 1110,1112,1120,1122 and side/head protection airbags 1130,1132, each of which is coupled to an airbag module (not shown) whereby each module may include one or more airbags as well as gas generation means for inflating the airbag(s), attachment means for attaching the airbag to and in fluid communication with the gas generator means and initiation means for initiating the gas generator means in response to a crash of the vehicle. A rear window 1170 of the vehicle has been broken or ejected for the reasons and in the manner described below. The driver side frontal airbag 1110 has been deployed as well as the ceiling mounted side head protection airbag 1130. In this case, the sensing system for controlling the deployment of the airbags, not shown but which is coupled to all of the airbag modules, detected that the crash had an angular component which might have resulted in head injuries to the occupant from impacts with an A-pillar 1140 or a side window 1150 of the vehicle, so the sensing system determined that deployment of the side head protection airbags 1130 and 1132 was warranted, along with deployment of the frontal protection airbags 1110, 1120 and 1122. The front passenger seat was unoccupied, which was detected by the occupant position sensor, not shown, and therefore the corresponding frontal protection airbag 1112 and left side protection airbags (not shown) were not deployed. Since both rear seats were occupied, the appropriate rear seat protection airbags 1132, 1120 and 1122 were deployed. It is thus possible to selectively control or determine which airbags of a plurality of airbags, e.g., side/head protection airbags, frontal protection airbags, in a passenger compartment of a vehicle should be deployed depending on the crash conditions to thereby avoid unnecessary airbag deployment. Although the sensing system which determines which airbags require deployment is not shown, this system may include or be connected to occupant sensing means for sensing which seats are occupied., 82797=U.S. Pat. No. 3,909,037 to Stewart provides a good example of the application of the Coanda effect to airbag aspirating inflators. Stewart, nevertheless, still discards most of the energy in the propellant which is absorbed as heat in the inflator mechanism. Most propellants considered for airbag applications burn at pressures in excess of about 1000 psig. Stewart discloses that the maximum efficiency corresponding to a 5:1 pumping ratio occurs at inflator gas pressures of about 5 to about 45 psig. In order to reduce the pressure, Stewart utilizes a complicated filtering system similar to that used in conventional inflators. Stewart requires the use of valves to close off the aspiration ports when the system is not aspirating. Through the use of the Coanda effect, Stewart alludes to a substantial reduction in the size of the aspiration system, compared to Hass for example. Also, Stewart shows only a simple converging nozzle through which the burning propellant is passed., 89047=U.S. Pat. No. 5,129,674 to Levosinski describes a converging-diverging nozzle design which provides for more efficient aspiration than some of the above discussed patents. Nevertheless, the airbag system disclosed is quite large and limited in length such that the flow passageways are quite large which requires a long nozzle design for efficient operation. Since there is insufficient space for a long nozzle, it can be estimated that this system has a pumping ratio less than 1:1 and probably less than 0.2:1. Once again a sodium azide based propellant is used., 291315=FIG. 22 illustrates the placement of a variety of sensors, primarily accelerometers and/or gyroscopes, which can be used to diagnose the state of the vehicle itself. Sensor 2201 can measure the acceleration of the firewall or instrument panel and is located thereon generally midway between the two sides of the vehicle. Sensor 2202 can be located in the headliner or attached to the vehicle roof above the side door. Typically, there will be two such sensors one on either side of the vehicle. Sensor 2203 is shown in a typical mounting location midway between the sides of the vehicle attached to or near the vehicle roof above the rear window. Sensor 2206 is shown in a typical mounting location in the vehicle trunk adjacent the rear of the vehicle. One, two or three such sensors can be used depending on the application. If three such sensors are use one would be adjacent each side of vehicle and one in the center. Sensor 2204 is shown in a typical mounting location in the vehicle door and sensor 2205 is shown in a typical mounting location on the sill or floor below the door. Finally, sensor 2207, which can be also multiple sensors, is shown in a typical mounting location forward in the crush zone of the vehicle. If three such sensors are used, one would be adjacent each vehicle side and one in the center., 157522=In accordance with the invention, the length of the gas generator 120 is measured in a horizontal or longitudinal direction perpendicular to the direction of the flow of the gas and is the longest dimension of the device. The length of the nozzle 117,118,119, on the other hand, is measured in the direction of the gas flow and perpendicular to the length of the gas generator 120. A distinctive feature of the inflator module of this invention is that its length is much longer that its width or thickness and the length of the mixing chamber is much longer than the minimum thickness of the high pressure jet. It is this ratio which governs the completeness of the mixing of the gases generated by the propellant 127 and the gases from the passenger compartment 195 which in turn governs the pumping ratio and thereby permits the large pumping ratios achieved here in contrast to the constructions disclosed in the prior art patents discussed above. This is achieved by using a very long and thin jet of high pressure gas which is achieved by the elongate airbag module 100 disclosed herein. It is known in the art that the volume of gas flowing from a gas generator is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the jet times its length, but the ability of the jet to mix rapidly with the aspirating air is determined by the surface area of the jet. By using the thin linear geometry disclosed herein, the ratio of surface area to cross section area is maximized which in turn maximizes the amount of air which can be pumped and thus the pumping ratio. Other geometries can achieve high pumping ratios only by increasing the mixing length. In most implementations, however, this is not practical since there is insufficient space in the vehicle. This is the main reason that current inflators are limited to pumping ratios of substantially less than 1:1. In the case described above, the ratio of the mixing length to the minimum jet diameter is greater than 200:1. In most cases, in the implementation of this invention this ratio will exceed 100:1 and in all cases 50:1. Similarly, the ratio of the length of the gas generator 120 to the minimum thickness of the gas jet in the case described in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 2A-2F is greater than 4000:1. In most cases, this ratio will be greater than 1000:1 and preferably it will be greater than 100:1., 220771=This is illustrated in FIG. 15 which is a perspective view of a ceiling mounted airbag system having exit ports at the ceiling level for gas to flow out of the airbag. In FIG. 15, a long thin airbag module 1600 is positioned in the vehicle ceiling as described herein. When the occupant presses against an airbag 1610 during the crash, pressure builds within the airbag 1610 causing the gas within the airbag to flow back through the module opening 1640 and into the passenger compartment 1650 at the ceiling level. Since the exiting gas is hot, it flows out of the rear window, not shown, which has been broken or removed, and thus out of the passenger compartment and into the atmosphere. By using the aspirating nozzle as an exit orifice, it is unnecessary to place vent holes within the airbag itself This is particularly an advantage when film airbags are used., 86938=U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,991 to Thorn describes an aspirating inflator assembly including aspiration valves which are generally needed in all high pumping ratio aspiration systems. Sodium azide is the propellant used. Pumping ratios of 1:1 to 1.5:1 are mentioned in this patent which by analysis is possible. It is noteworthy that the preamble of this patent discloses that the state of the art of aspirating inflators yields pumping ratios of 0.1:1 to 0.5:1, far below those specified in several of the above referenced earlier patents. Once again, little attempt has been made to optimize the nozzle design., 65432=This application also is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/356,314, filed Jul. 16, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,704 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/947,661 filed Oct. 9, 1997, now abandoned, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/137,918 filed Aug. 20, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,787, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/476,077 filed Jun. 7, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,437, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 223421=In rare cases, the ventilation provided by breaking a window even with the addition of a hole in the lower part of the passenger compartment is insufficient to remove the toxic gas in time to prevent any danger of injury to the occupants. When this occurs, a small electrically or pyrotechnically driven fan can be mounted in an opening 1690 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 15B. This fan shown at 1692 in FIG. 15B which is a partial perspective view of the fan assembly of FIG. 15. In the event of an accident which requires deployment of more than one airbag, a fan 1692 powered by the vehicle's electrical system through wires 1694 is turned on for a period of time to pull gas from the lower part of the vehicle forcing it to flow through doors 1696. Alternately, the fan can be powered by its own power supply comprising a battery or capacitor, or even by pyrotechnic means., 90727=U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,054 to Cuevas describes an aspirating/venting motor vehicle passenger airbag module in which the principal of operation is similar to the '264 patent discussed above. Once again the aspiration pumping ratio of this device is 0.15:1 to 0.2:1 which is in line with conventional aspirated inflators. It is interesting to note that this pioneer in the field does not avail himself of designs purporting to yield higher pumping ratios. Again the nozzle design has not been optimized., 65017=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/073,403 filed May 6, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,179,326, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/571,247 filed Dec. 12, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,238 and which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/550,217 filed Oct. 30, 1995, now abandoned., 87562=U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,586 to Hayashi et al. describes a sodium azide driver side inflator in which the aspirating air flows through a series of annular slots on the circumference of the circular inflator in contrast to the earlier Hayashi et al. patent where the flow was on the axis. Similar pumping ratios of about 4:1 are claimed however, which by analysis is unlikely. Once again, aspiration valves are not shown and the reason that they can be neglected is not discussed. An inefficient nozzle design is again illustrated. The lack of commercial success of these two Hayashi patents is probably due to the fact that such high pumping ratios as claimed are not in fact achievable in the geometries illustrated., 205378=The airbag systems shown in FIG. 10 provide protection of the occupant against impacts with various vehicle structural members such as the A-pillar, B-pillar and C-pillar (see the definitions above). Federal law now requires protection from impacts with these pillars, which is difficult to achieve due to the limited space available for padding, and therefore the law is weak and thus not very effective. A side impact airbag such as 1130 coming down from the ceiling can offer excellent protection from impacts with these pillars. For this reason, it will be desirable in many cases to deploy the side bags when the frontal impact airbag is deployed since a significant number of occupants are still being injured in frontal impacts, even though the airbag deployed, by impacts with the A-pillar and the B-pillar., 82332=U.S. Pat. No. 3,632,133 to Hass provides a good example of a nozzle in a circular module with a high pumping ratio in an early construction of an airbag. Although analysis indicates that pumping ratios of 4:1 or 5:1 would be difficult to achieve with this design as illustrated, nevertheless, this reference illustrates the size and rough shape of an aspirating system which is required to obtain high pumping ratios using the prior art designs., 203758=As described above and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,485, a desirable inflator for use in this airbag system is of the non-sodium azide highly aspirated type and the most desirable airbags are made from plastic films. It is contemplated that the inflators of the '485 patent may be used in accordance with the invention and the entire description of the inflators of the '485 patent are incorporated herein by reference. By using such inflators, the pressure rise in the passenger compartment resulting from deployment of the airbag is kept to a minimum. If the pressure rise is still excessive, it is easily vented by the removal of the glass from the rear window 1170 by suitable means as described below. In this case, even though multiple toxic inflators are used, the concentration of toxic gas in the vehicle is quickly reduced as a result of the absence of the window 1170 and the fact that the inflator gases are hotter than the ambient temperature and thus rise to the ceiling and then flow out of the broken window 1170., 294477=One particular implementation will now be described. In this case, each of the sensors 2201-2207 is a single or dual axis accelerometer. They are made using silicon micromachined technology such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,121,180 and 5,894,090. These are only representative patents of these devices and there exist more than 100 other relevant U.S. patents describing this technology. Commercially available MEMS gyroscopes such as from Systron Doner have accuracies of approximately one degree per second. In contrast, optical gyroscopes typically have accuracies of approximately one degree per hour. Unfortunately, the optical gyroscopes are prohibitively expensive for automotive applications. On the other hand, typical MEMS gyroscopes are not sufficiently accurate for many control applications., 237946=It should be understood that although only two airbag modules 1910,1950 are shown, it is envisioned that an automotive safety network may be designed with several and/or different types of occupant protection devices. Such an automotive network would comprises one or more occupant protection devices connected to the bus, each comprising a housing and a component deployable to provide protection for the occupant, at least one sensor system for providing an output signal relevant to deployment of the deployable component(s) (such as the occupant sensing circuitry), deployment determining means for generating a signal indicating for which of the deployable components deployment is desired (such as a crash sensor) and an electronic controller arranged in, proximate or adjacent each housing and coupled to the sensor system(s) and the deployment determining means. The electrical bus electrically couples the sensor system(s), the deployment determining means and the controllers so that the signals from one or more of the sensor systems and the deployment determining means are sent over the bus to the controllers. Each controller controls deployment of the deployable component of the respective occupant protection device in consideration of the signals from the sensor system(s) and the deployment determining means. The crash sensor(s) may be arranged separate and at a location apart from the housings and generate a coded signal when deployment of any one of the deployable components is desired. Thus, the coded signal varies depending on which of deployment components are to be deployed. If the deployable component is an airbag associated with the housing, the occupant protection device would comprise an inflator assembly arranged in the housing for inflating the airbag., 89631=U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,450 to Pack, Jr. et al. describes an aspirated air cushion restraint system in which no attempt was made to optimize the nozzle design for this sodium azide driver side airbag. Also, aspiration valves are used although it is suggested that the exhaust from the airbag can be made through the aspirating holes thereby eliminating the need for the flapper valves. No analysis, however, is provided to prove that the area of the aspiration holes is comparable to the area of the exhaust holes normally provided in the airbag. Although no mention is made of the pumping ratio of this design, the device as illustrated appears to be approximately the same size as a conventional driver side inflator. This, coupled with an analysis of the geometry, indicates a pumping ratio of less than 1:1 and probably less than 0.2:1. The statement that the aspiration valves are not needed also indicates that the aspiration ratio must be small. Large inlet ports which are needed for large aspiration ratios are generally much larger than the typical airbag exhaust ports., 216011=FIG. 14 shows an airbag module 1510 having one airbag 1500 connected therewith, although it is of course possible to have a plurality of airbags connected to a single module, and the module is connected to sensor and diagnostic circuitry, shown schematically at 1580, which sends current or a signal to all of the airbag modules connected thereto which are to be deployed in a particular crash. As shown in FIG. 14, module 1500 comprises the airbag 1510 and an inflator assembly 1520 coupled thereto. The inflator assembly 1520 comprises a chamber housing a propellant 1530, an initiator 1535 coupled through passages in the inflator assembly to the propellant 1530 and a squib assembly 1540 engaging with the initiator 1535. The squib assembly 1540 is connected to the sensor and diagnostic circuitry 1580 which will determine activation of the squib assembly 1540 and thus ignition of the propellant 1530 to generate gas for inflating the airbag 1500. The squib assembly 1540 is shown in an expanded view in FIG. 14A taken within the circle labeled 14A in FIG. 14. The squib assembly 1540 comprises a bum-wire electrically initiated squib 1541 and a pyrotechnic delay element 1542 adjacent thereto. The squib 1541 is spaced and isolated from the initiator 1535 by the delay element 1542 thereby avoiding premature initiation. The delay element 1542 is capable of providing any desired delay from fractions of a millisecond to several milliseconds and is sometimes made from a coiled tube containing a propellant or other pyrotechnic material. Such delay devices are well known to those skilled in the art of designing pyrotechnic delays primarily for military uses., 206615=FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C illustrate various methods by which the glass in a window can be removed, in order to provide for a reduction in the pressure generated in the passenger compartment by the deployment of airbags as well to enable the exhaust of toxic gases therefrom. In FIG. 11A, a fragmented partially schematic cross section view of a pyrotechnic window breaking mechanism is illustrated generally at 1200. It comprises a wire 1212 leading from a vehicle crash sensor system shown schematically at 1214 and an electric squib, primer or detonator 1210 which is housed in a housing and is positioned against a portion of window glass 1215. When the sensor system 1214 determines that the vehicle is experiencing a crash, for which deployment of an airbag is warranted, it sends a signal to the airbag module, not shown, and a separate circuit also carries a current or other electronic signal to the window breaking squib 1210 through wire 1212. When the squib 1210 is ignited a small but strong shock impulse is transmitted to the glass surface which is sufficient to shatter the window 1215. As noted above, the squib represents the entire class of electrically initiated pyrotechnic devices capable of releasing sufficient energy to cause a vehicle window to break. Some such devices, for example, use a heated bridge wire while others use a semiconductor bridge or a laser initiation system., 178027=As discussed above, in some situations with conventional inflators, but not with the inflator of this invention, the occupant may be so out-of-position as to be already leaning against the airbag module when the sensor and diagnostic module signals that the airbag should be deployed. This is a particularly serious situation since deceleration of the vehicle may cause the occupant to exert a significant force against the airbag cover preventing it from opening. The inflator module will begin producing gas and if the flow out of the inflator module is resisted, the pressure in the inflator module will increase even exceeding about 1000 psi if necessary until the resistance is overcome and the cover opens. This can result in very large forces against the head or chest of the occupant and result in serious injury or even death., 123839=2. The number and complexity of connectors will be substantially reduced. There are currently typically about 1000 pin connections in a vehicle. When disconnection is not required, a sealed permanent connector will be used to join wires in, for example, a T connection. On the other hand, when disconnection is required, a single or dual conductor connector is all that is required and the same connector can be used throughout the vehicle. Thus, there will be only one or two universal connector designs on the vehicle., 85249=U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,264 to Cuevas describes an aspirating/venting airbag module assembly which includes a circular gas generator and contemplates the use of conventional sodium azide propellants or equivalent. The aspiration or pumping ratio of this inflator is approximately 0.2:1, substantially below that of Hayashi et al., but more in line with aspiration systems in common use today. This design also does not require use of aspiration valves which is more reasonable for this case, but still unlikely, since the aspiration port area is much smaller. Again, no attempt has been made to optimize the nozzle design as is evident by the short nozzle length and the low pumping ratio., 232511=A partial implementation of the system as just described is depicted schematically in FIG. 16 which shows a view of the combination of an occupant position sensor and airbag module designed to prevent the deployment of the airbag for a seat which is unoccupied or if the occupant is too close to the airbag and therefore in danger of deployment induced injury. The module, shown generally at 1700, includes a housing which comprises an airbag 1710, an inflator assembly 1720 for the airbag 1710, an occupant position sensor comprising an ultrasonic transmitter 1722 and an ultrasonic receiver 1724. Other occupant position sensors can also be used instead of the ultrasonic transmitter/receiver pair to determine the position of the occupant to be protected by the airbag 1710, and also the occupant position sensor may be located outside of the housing of the module 1700. The housing of the module 1700 also contains an electronic module or package 1730 coupled to each of the inflator assembly 1720, the transmitter 1722 and the receiver 1724 and which performs the functions of sending the ultrasonic signal to the transmitter 1722 and processing the data from the occupant position sensor receiver 1724. Electronics module 1730 may be arranged within the housing of the module 1700 as shown or adjacent or proximate the housing of the module 1700. Module 1700 also contains a power supply (not shown) for supplying power upon command by the electronics module 1730 to the inflator assembly 1720 to cause inflation of the airbag 1710. Thus, electronics module 1730 controls the inflation or deployment of the airbag 1710 and may sometimes herein be referred to as a controller or control unit. In addition, the electronic module 1730 monitors the power supply voltage, to assure that sufficient energy is stored to initiate the inflator assembly 1720 when required, and power the other processes, and reports periodically over the vehicle bus 1740 to the central diagnostic module, shown schematically at 1760, to indicate that the module is ready, i.e., there is sufficient power of inflate or deploy the airbag 1710 and operate the occupant position sensor transmitter/receiver pair, or sends a fault code if a failure in any component being monitored has been detected. A CrushSwitch sensor is also shown schematically at 1880, which is the only discriminating sensor in the system. Sensor 1880 is coupled to the vehicle bus 1740 and transmits a coded signal over the bus to the electronics module 1730 to cause the electronics module 1730 to initiate deployment of the airbag 1710 via the inflator assembly 1720. The vehicle bus 1740 connects the electronic package 1730, the central sensor and diagnostic module 1760 and the CrushSwitch sensor 1880. Bus 1740 may be the single bus system, i.e., consists of a pair of wires, on which power and information are transmitted around the vehicle as noted immediately above. Instead of CrushSwitch sensor 1880, other crash sensors may be used., 208120=In FIG. 11B, an electromechanical window breaking mechanism is illustrated generally at 1220 and comprises a housing abutting against a portion of window glass 1215. In this embodiment, a current or other signal from the vehicle crash sensor system 1214 releases a spring loaded impacting plunger 1222 arranged in the housing and having a hardened sharp tip 1224 similar to a machinist's center punch. When the tip 1224 travels through a release aperture in the housing and impacts the glass 1215, it causes the glass 1215 to shatter. An alternative to the electrical release of the plunger 1222 would be to use a mechanical sensor which responds to the crash itself. It is well known that a spring loaded center punch if impinged onto a window of an automobile will shatter the glass. Their use by vandals and thieves for this purpose is why their sale to the general public is not permitted in at least one state., 213389=An example of a knee airbag is illustrated in FIG. 13 which is a perspective view of a knee restraint airbag illustrating the support of the driver's knees and also for a sleeping occupant lying on the passenger seat of the vehicle (not shown). The knee support airbag shown generally at 1400 comprises a film airbag 1410 which is composed of several smaller airbags 1411, 1412, 1413, and 1414 as disclosed above. Alternately, the knee airbag can be made from a single film airbag as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,464 referenced above. The knee support airbag can be much larger than airbags previously used for this purpose and, as a result, offers some protection for an occupant, not shown, who is lying asleep on the vehicle seat prior to the accident., 66029=This invention also claims domestic priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/028,046 filed Oct. 9, 1996 through U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/947,661 filed Oct. 9, 1997., 293729=Each of the sensors 2201-2207 may be single axis, double axis or triaxial accelerometers and/or gyroscopes typically of the MEMS type. These sensors 2201-2207 can either be wired to the central control module or processor directly wherein they would receive power and transmit information, or they could be connected onto the vehicle bus or, in some cases, using RFID technology, the sensors can be wireless and would receive their power through RF from one or more interrogators located in the vehicle. In this case, the interrogators can be connected either to the vehicle bus or directly to control module. Alternately, an inductive or capacitive power and information transfer system can be used., 122328=In the preferred system then, the power line or distribution network in the vehicle is used to simultaneously carry both power and data to all switches, sensors, lights, motors, actuators and all other electrical and electronic devices (hereinafter called devices) within the vehicle and especially all devices related to deployable restraints. Naturally, the same system will also work for vehicles having different voltages such as 48 volts. Also a subset of all vehicle devices can be on a net. Initially, for example, an automotive manufacturer may elect to use the system of this invention for the automobile safety system and later expand it to include other devices. The data, in digital form, is carried on a carrier frequency, or as pulse data as in the Ethernet protocol, and is separated at each device using either a microprocessor, \u201chigh-side driver\u201d or other similar electronic circuit. Each device will have a unique, individualized address and be capable of responding to a message sent with its address. A standard protocol will be implemented such as SAE J1850 where applicable. The return can be through vehicle ground comprising the vehicle sheet metal and chassis or through a wire., 204822=Obviously, although the rear window 1170 was chosen for removal, any of the side windows could also have been chosen or even a sunroof if one is present, and even though a single window was chosen, multiple windows could also be removed or forcibly broken. In some cases described below, the glass in the window will be broken and in others it will be ejected. If the window is made from tempered glass, it will break into small harmless pieces that will be ejected from the vehicle due to the higher pressure within the vehicle., 248964=In FIG. 19, a generalized component 2000 emitting several signals which are transmitted along a variety of paths, sensed by a variety of sensors and analyzed by the diagnostic device in accordance with the invention is illustrated schematically. Component 2000 is mounted to a vehicle 2005 and during operation it emits a variety of signals such as acoustic 2010, electromagnetic radiation 2015, thermal radiation 2020, current and voltage fluctuations in conductor 2025 and mechanical vibrations 2030. Various sensors are mounted in the vehicle to detect the signals emitted by the component 2000. These include a vibration sensor (accelerometer) 2035 also mounted to the vehicle, acoustic sensor 2040, electromagnetic radiation sensor 2045, heat radiation sensor 2050, and voltage or current sensor 2080. In addition, various other sensors 2055, 2060, 2065, and 2070 measure other parameters of other components that in some manner provide information directly or indirectly on the operation of component 2000. All of the sensors illustrated on FIG. 19 are connected to a data bus 2085. A diagnostic module 2075, in accordance with the invention, is also attached to the vehicle data bus 2085 and receives the signals generated by the various sensors., 250391=As shown in FIG. 19, the diagnostic module 2075 has access to the output data of each of the sensors that have information relative to the component 2000. This data appears as a series of numerical values each corresponding to a measured value at a specific point in time. The cumulative data from a particular sensor is called a time series of individual data points. The diagnostic module 2075 compares the patterns of data received from each sensor individually, or in combination with data from other sensors, with patterns for which the diagnostic module has been trained to determine whether the component is functioning normally or abnormally. Note that although a general vehicle component diagnostic system is being described, the state of some vehicle components can provide information to the vehicle safety system. A tire failure, for example, can lead to a vehicle rollover., 236305=Another implementation of the invention incorporating the electronic components into and adjacent to the airbag module as illustrated in FIG. 17 which shows the interior front of the passenger compartment generally at 1900. Driver airbag module 1910 is partially cutaway to show an electronic module 1920 incorporated within the airbag module 1910. Electronic module 1920 may be comparable to electronic module 1730 in the embodiment of FIG. 16 in that it can control the deployment of the airbag in airbag module 1910. Electronic airbag module 1910 is connected to an electronic sensor illustrated generally as 1960 by wire 1930. The electronic sensor 1960 is, e.g., an electronic single point crash sensor that initiates the deployment of the airbag when it senses a crash. Passenger airbag module 1950 is illustrated with its associated electronic module 1970 outside of but adjacent or proximate to the airbag module. Electronic module 1970 may be comparable to electronic module 1730 in the embodiment of FIG. 16 in that it can control the deployment of the airbag in airbag module 1950. Electronic module 1970 is connected by a wire 1940, which could also be part of a bus, to the electronic sensor 1960. One or both of the electronic modules 1920 and 1970 can contain diagnostic circuitry, power storage capability (either a battery or a capacitor), occupant sensing circuitry, as well as communication electronic circuitry for either wired or wireless communication., 265265=In the example above, only a single component failure was discussed using only a single sensor since the data from the single sensor contains a pattern which the neural network was trained to recognize as either normal operation of the component or abnormal operation of the component. The diagnostic module 1700 contains preprocessing and neural network algorithms for a number of component failures. The neural network algorithms are generally relatively simple, requiring only a few dozen or a few hundred lines of computer code. A single general neural network program can be used for multiple pattern recognition cases by specifying different coefficients for the various terms, one set for each application. Thus, adding different diagnostic checks has only a small affect on the cost of the system. Also, the system has available to it all of the information available on the data bus. During the training process, the pattern recognition program sorts out from the available vehicle data on the data bus, those patterns that predict failure of a particular component., 171250=As should now be evident, the aspirated inflator of the present invention has significant advantages over other aspirated inflators currently used in conventional airbag systems. In particular, large openings are provided in the form of the inlet ports 135 on either side of the aspirating nozzles. These ports 135 permit the flow of gas from the passenger compartment 195 into the aspirating nozzle through ports 135 with a short, low flow resistance, flow path. Once the cover 150 is removed from the airbag system and initial airbag deployment has begun, the module pops open and the inlet ports 135 are open to allow the entrance of the passenger compartment gas. The outlet passage from the inflator passes through a converging-diverging nozzle as described above which causes a smooth developed supersonic flow pattern in the emerging gas. The gas leaves the nozzle 117,118,119 at exit 132 and enters the mixing chamber 130 at a position near the throat of the aspirating nozzle 115 defined by walls 160 and shields 155 after which the aspirating nozzle 115 diverges, see FIGS. 2C and 2D, to create the minimum pressure at the throat to aid in drawing in the maximum amount of gas from the passenger compartment 195 through inlet ports 135. Using this design, total pumping ratios of up to 10:1 of passenger compartment to generated gas result and instantaneous ratios of up to 20:1 have been proven feasible., 254980=Once the data has been collected, it is processed by a neural network generating program, for example, if a neural network pattern recognition system is to be used. Such programs are available commercially, e.g., from NeuralWare of Pittsburgh, Pa. The program proceeds in a trial and error manner until it successfully associates the various patterns representative of abnormal behavior, an unbalanced tire, with that condition. The resulting neural network can be tested to determine if some of the input data from some of the sensors, for example, can be eliminated. In this way, the engineer can determine what sensor data is relevant to a particular diagnostic problem. The program then generates an algorithm that is programmed onto a microprocessor, microcontroller, neural processor, or DSP (herein collectively referred to as a microprocessor or processor). Such a microprocessor appears inside the diagnostic module 2075 in FIG. 19. Once trained, the neural network, as represented by the algorithm, will now recognize an unbalanced tire on a vehicle when this event occurs. At that time, when the tire is unbalanced, the diagnostic module 2075 will output a message to the driver indicating that the tire should be now be balanced as described in more detail below. The message to the driver is provided by output means coupled to or incorporated within the module 2075 and may be, e.g., a light on the dashboard, a vocal tone or any other recognizable indication apparatus. Messages can also be transmitter to others outside of the vehicle such as other vehicles or to a vehicle dealer. In some cases, control of the vehicle may be taken over by a vehicle system in response to a message. In some cases, the vehicle component failure portends an oncoming accident and one or more parts of the restraint system can be deployed, 222613=As shown in FIG. 15, and in more detail in FIG. 15A, a hole 1680 has been pyrotechnically opened in a location below the seat by shattering a frangible seal in cover 1682 by means of a squib 1684. The squib 1684 is connected to and initiated by the same sensor and diagnostic circuitry which is used as discussed above for breaking the glass in a window. Naturally, many other techniques exist for creating an air passage low in the vehicle. In some cases, for example, it might even be desirable to blow open a vehicle door perhaps 10 seconds after the accident, which may be achieved by appropriate door opening mechanisms (represented schematically in FIG. 15 as 1686). This has the added advantage of helping to provide egress for injured occupants., 376813=If the gas temperature in the inflator is relatively low, say less than 2000 F., then equations similar to Eqs. (6) may be used for the inflator nozzle in the preliminary analysis, without introducing errors that cannot be adjusted for later. Sufficient aspiration can be achieved so that the airbag temperature is not excessive. When the inflator temperature is much higher, though, then the inflator gas must be cooled. The inflator gas exit nozzle is, as will be seen, quite thin (small b), and as a result the heat transfer, and, to a lesser extent, the wall fluid friction is significant unless the nozzle is very short. Thus the nozzle is a natural place to cool the hot gases from the inflator., 299818=For this embodiment, sensor 2208 represents one or more strain gage weight sensors mounted on the seat or in connection with the seat or its support structure. Suitable mounting locations and forms of weight sensors are discussed in the current assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/193,209 and contemplated for use in this invention as well. The mass or weight of the occupying item of the seat can thus be measured based on the dynamic measurement of the strain gages with optional consideration of the measurements of accelerometers on the vehicle, which are represented by any of sensors 2201-2207., 83802=U.S. Pat. No. 4,833,996 to Hayashi et al. describes a gas generating apparatus for inflating an airbag which is circular and allegedly provides an instantaneous pumping ratio of up to 7:1 although analysis shows that this is unlikely in the illustrated geometry. The average pumping ratio is specified to be up to 4:1. This invention is designed for the driver side of the vehicle where unrestricted access to the aspirating port might be difficult to achieve when mounted on a steering wheel. The propellant of choice in Hayashi et al. is sodium azide which requires extensive filtering to remove particulates. No attempt has been made in this design to optimize the nozzle geometry to make use of a converging-diverging nozzle design, for example. Also, the inflator has a roughly conventional driver side shape. It is also interesting to note that no mention is made of valves to close off or restrict flow through the aspiration port during deflation. Since most aspiration designs having even substantially smaller pumping ratios provide for such valves, the elimination of these valves would be a significant advance in the art. Analysis shows, however, that the opening needed for the claimed aspiration ratios would in general be far too large for it also to be used for exhausting the airbag during a crash. Since this is not discussed, it should be assumed that valves are required but not illustrated in the figures., 85954=U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,549 to Poole et al. describes a process for inflating an airbag with an aspiration system but does not discuss the aspiration design or mechanism and merely asserts that a ratio as high as 4:1 is possible but assumes that 2.5:1 is available. This patent is significant in that it discloses the idea that if such high pumping ratios are obtainable (i.e., 2.5:1 compared with 0.2:1 for inflators in use), then certain propellants, which would otherwise be unacceptable due to their production of toxic chemicals, can be used. For example, the patent discloses the use of tetrazol compounds. It is interesting to note that there as yet is no commercialization of the Poole et al. invention which raises the question as to whether such high aspiration ratios are in fact achievable with any of the prior art designs. Analysis has shown that this is the case, that is, that such large aspiration ratios are not achievable with the prior art designs., 235820=It should be understood that airbag module 1700 is a schematic representation only and thus, may represent any of the airbag modules described above in any of the mounting locations. For example, airbag module 1700 may be arranged in connection with the seat 525 as module 510 is in FIG. 8. As such, the bus, which is connected to the airbag module 1700, would inherently extend at least partially into and within the seat., 212324=An alternate method of eliminating the buildup of toxic gas in the passenger compartment is to exhaust one or more of the airbags out of the vehicle as shown in one example in FIG. 12. In this embodiment, the gas in ceiling-mounted airbag 1310 is exhausted into a vent 1330 located in a ceiling 1340 of the vehicle. Vent 1330 leads outside of the vehicle and thus as the airbag 1310 deflates the gas does not enter the vehicle passenger compartment where it would be breathed by the occupants. Naturally, this technique could be used by other airbags which are mounted in the door or instrument panel. There has been a reluctance to use this technique for the front passenger frontal impact protection airbag since this would require that a hole be placed in the firewall partially defeating the very purpose of the firewall which is to prevent fumes or even flames from the engine compartment from entering the passenger compartment. This would not be a problem for the ceiling or door mounted airbags., 292706=In general, sensors 2201-2207 measure a physical property of the location at which they are mounted. For example, the physical property would be the acceleration of the mounting location if the sensor is an accelerometer and would be angular inclination if the sensor is a gyroscope. Another way of looking at would be to consider that sensors 2201-2207 provide a measurement of the state of the sensor, such as its velocity, acceleration, angular orientation or temperature, or a state of the location at which the sensor is mounted. Thus, measurements related to the state of the sensor would include measurements of the acceleration of the sensor, measurements of the temperature of the mounting location as well as changes in the state of the sensor and rates of changes of the state of the sensor. However, any described use or function of the sensors 2201-2207 above is merely exemplary and is not intended to limit the form of the sensor or its function., 251319=Central to the diagnostic teachings of this invention is the manner in which the diagnostic module 2075 determines a normal pattern from an abnormal pattern and the manner in which it decides what data to use from the vast amount of data available. This is accomplished using pattern recognition technologies, such as artificial neural networks, and training. The theory of neural networks including many examples can be found in several books on the subject including: Techniques And Application Of Neural Networks, edited by Taylor, M. and Lisboa, P., Ellis Horwood, West Sussex, England, 1993, Naturally Intelligent Systems, by Caudill, M. and Butler, C., MIT Press, Cambridge Mass., 1990; J. M. Zaruda, Introduction to Artificial Neural Systems, West Publishing Co., N.Y., 1992 and, Digital Neural Networks, by Kung, S. Y., PTR Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1993, Eberhart, R., Simpson, P. and Dobbins, R., Computational Intelligence PC Tools, Academic Press, Inc., 1996, Orlando, Fl., all of which are included herein by reference. The neural network pattern recognition technology is one of the most developed of pattern recognition technologies. Newer and more efficient systems are now being developed such as the neural network system which is being developed by Motorola and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,390,136 and 5,517,667. The neural network will be used here to illustrate one example of a pattern recognition technology but it is emphasized that this invention is not limited to neural networks. Rather, the invention may apply any known pattern recognition technology. A brief description of the neural network pattern recognition technology is set forth below., 66243=This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/247,763 entitled \u201cFilm Airbags\u201d filed May 23, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,485 and U.S. patent application Ser.

One embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 14B which shows a delay producing device where the electric squib assembly 1540 causes the ignition of a bum-wire electrically initiated squib 1541 which upon ignition releases a firing pin 1546. The firing pin 1546 is then propelled by a spring 1547 through a passage in the squib assembly 1540 into a stab primer 1548 which initiates deployment of the airbag, by means of the activation of the initiator 1535. The length of travel and the mass of the firing pin can be adjusted to provide the required delay. In the normal position, the squib 1541 retains the firing pin 1546 against the expansion force of the spring 1547.}",
