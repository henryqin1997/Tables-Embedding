    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. While the examples described here are listed using encapsulated electrophoretic displays, there are other particle-based display media which should also work as well, including encapsulated suspended particles and rotating ball displays. In another implementation, it is possible to form transistors on a silicon wafer, dice the transistors, and place them in a large area array to form a large, TFT-addressed display medium. One example of this concept is to form mechanical impressions in the receiving substrate, and then cover the substrate with a slurry or other form of the transistors. With agitation, the transistors will fall into the impressions, where they can be bonded and incorporated into the device circuitry. The receiving substrate could be glass, plastic, or other nonconductive material. In this way, the economy of creating transistors using standard processing methods can be used to create large-area displays without the need for large area silicon processing equipment. In another implementation, the addressing electronic backplane could incorporate diodes as the nonlinear element, rather than transistors. As in liquid crystal displays, external logic or drive circuitry can be built",
