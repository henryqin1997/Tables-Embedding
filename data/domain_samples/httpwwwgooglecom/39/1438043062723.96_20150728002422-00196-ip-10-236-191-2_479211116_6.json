A system that provides this capability through wireless transmission technology is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,728, Remotely Activated Automobile Disabling System, to Pagiliaroli (Jan. 4, 1994), which is hereto incorporated by reference. However, Pagiliaroli's system does not provide any indication about the location of a stolen vehicle after it has been disabled., 22091=This application is a continuation-in-part of the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/927,992, Method for Detecting, Computing and Disseminating Location Information Associated with Emergency 911 Wireless Transmissions, filed on Aug. 10, 2001, applicants being Lawrence A. Gould and John A. Stangle), which is incorporated herein by reference, and also a continuation-in-part of the U.S. patent application Ser.

This application also claims priority to the U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/276,120, Method for Determining, Computing and Disseminating Location Information Associated with Emergency 911 Wireless Transmissions, filed on Mar. 16, 2001 now abandoned, and the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/276,123, Method for Employing Location Information Associated with Emergency 911 Wireless Transmissions for Supplementary and Complementary Purposes, filed on Mar. 16, 2001. All referenced provisional applications are herein incorporated by reference., 41703=A RDF device installed on a wireless transmission antenna 12 can provide information about the angle of arrival of a radio signal. The present invention employs a commercially available RDF device, which functionality is explained by the U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,597, Nondisruptive ADF System, to Bentley (Apr. 21, 1981) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,317,120, Sector Scan ADF System, to Bentley (Feb. 23, 1982). Both aforementioned patents are hereto incorporated by reference. An example of such RDF device is a LF/HF/VHF/UHF/MW Direction Finder from TechComm., 39887=The database servers are interconnected through a data network 26. The network 26 may be, or may include as a segment, any one or more of, for instance, the Internet, an intranet, a LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network) or MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), a frame relay connection, Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) connection, a synchronous optical network (SONET) connection, a digital T1, T3, or E1 line, Digital Data Service (DDS) connection, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) connection, an Ethernet connection, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) line, a dial-up port such as a V.90, V.34 or V.34bis analog modem connection, a cable modem, an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) connection, FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Networks) or CDDI (Cooper Distributed Data Interface) connections, WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) radio frequency links, RS-232 serial connections, EEE-1394 (Firewire) connections, USB (Universal Serial Bus) connections or other wired or wireless, digital or analog interfaces or connections.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and their practical application to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention and various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented only for the purpose of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. In yet another alternate embodiment, the location processor may also calculate the location of the origin of a wireless call using information other than the angle of arrival. The location processor may use time difference of arrival (TDOA) information or GPS based information. In an alternate embodiment for a medical emergency application, where a system according to the present invention is used to locate and to provide assistance to people in need of medical assistance, the database server 28 may store medical information, which can retrieved and sent to a medical emergency center along with the location information of the person in need of medical assistance. In this embodiment, a person carries a medical emergency device that is capable of placing a wireless telephone call, and upon emergency the person can press a button on this medical emergency",
