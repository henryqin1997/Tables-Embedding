    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6069=As shown in the prior art configuration of FIG. 3, phone line interface circuitry, such as a hookswitch, caller ID and ringer interface circuit 1704 is provided within the line side circuitry 118. The hookswitch, caller ID and ringer interface circuitry 1704 is coupled to the external hookswitch devices through line 1705 and ground through line 1707. The phone line loop current utilized by the line side circuits 118 is shown as Iloop. Circuitry 1704 is also coupled directly to the TIP line 1602 and the RING line 1604 through a capacitive interface 1703. The capacitive interface 1703 may be comprised of three high voltage (such as 300 V) capacitors 1703 a, 1703 b, and 1703 c having capacitances of 2200 pF, 2200 pF and 5600 pF respectively, and linearly attenuates the TIP/RING signal voltage from high phone lines levels (typically 40\u2013140 Vrms, 15\u201368 Hz) to levels within integrated circuit technology limitations. Bi-directional input/output lines 1706 are shown provided from the hookswitch, caller ID and ringer interface circuitry 1704 for communication through the isolation barrier 120 to the user powered circuits 116.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{76132=The telephone line side circuit 118, which may be implemented as an integrated circuit (IC), may communicate with the phone lines through hybrid, AC and DC termination circuitry 1617 (the DC termination circuitry also provides an internal power supply voltage), and determine ring-detect and off-hook status information through off-hook/ring-detect block 1620. In addition, the hybrid, AC and DC termination circuitry 1617 and the off-hook/ring-detect block 1620 are connected to the isolation interface 1614 so that control, status, signal and other desired information may be transmitted to and received from the powered side circuitry 116 across the isolation barrier 120., 72972=The powered side circuitry 116, which may be implemented as an integrated circuit (IC), may communicate with the external controller through a control data interface 1606, a line data interface 1607 and control logic 1608. In addition, the control data interface 1606, line data interface 1607 and the control logic 1608 are connected to the isolation interface 1610 so that control, status, signal and other desired information may be transmitted to and received from the telephone line side circuit 118 across the isolation barrier 120., 46728=The user powered circuits 116 of prior art communication system 110 include ringer timing circuitry 1708. The ringer timing circuitry may bidirectionally communicate through line 1710 and the isolation barrier 120 to ringer circuits within the hookswitch, caller ID and ringer interface circuitry 1704 in the line side circuit 118. The ring detection output is provided on output line 1719 to a ring detection output pin 1720 of the user powered circuit 116. Alternatively, the ring detection output 1719 may be provided at the analog-to-digital converter (\u201cADC\u201d) data port pin 1718 by use of a mux 1716. Mux 1716 may be utilized to multiplex the ringer detection output 1719 and a signal line 1712 containing caller ID data from an ADC output from the line side circuit 118. The mux 1716 may operate in response to a caller ID field signal 1714 so that when caller ID information is present on the TIP and RING lines, caller ID information is presented at the ADC data port pin 1718 and when ringing information is present on the TIP and RING lines, ring detection information is presented at the ADC data port pin 1718. In this manner the ADC data port may reflect activity on the TIP/RING loop during ringing, caller ID fields, and off-hook operations., 117507=It will also be understood that the typical internal and external component values disclosed herein are exemplary only. Furthermore, in the practice of the disclosed telephone line interface and circuit and methods of use thereof, the number, type and/or configuration of internal and/or external components (e.g., resistors, transistors, capacitors, ADC's, etc.) may be varied to achieve one or more characteristics of a telephone line interface and circuitry as may be desirable to fit a particular application/s. For example, it will be understood that in other embodiments the disclosed systems and methods may be practiced with DAA circuitry having only one barrier capacitor, having more than two barrier capacitors, and/or having isolation elements other than capacitors. Further, it will be understood that particular circuitry embodiments illustrated and described herein (e.g., resistive interface circuitry 650, caller ID circuitry 690, combined loop voltage monitoring and ringer detection circuitry 692, signal separator resistive interface circuitry 1000, etc.) are exemplary only, and that any alternate circuit configuration suitable for implementing or performing the described tasks of one or more of these circuits may be employed in other embodiments of the disclosed systems and methods., 40352=Direct Access Arrangement (DAA) circuitry may be used to terminate the telephone connections at a phone line user's end to provide a communication path for signals to and from the phone lines. DAA circuitry includes the necessary circuitry to terminate the telephone connections at the user's end and may include, for example, an isolation barrier, DC termination circuitry, AC termination circuitry, ring detection circuitry, and processing circuitry that provides a communication path for signals to and from the phone lines. It is also desirable that the DAA circuitry act as an isolation barrier to meet the requirements of FCC regulations, Part 68. Examples of DAA circuitry known in the art may be found described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,816, U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,133, U.S. Pat. No. 6,385,235 and in U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, such levels may be utilized for on-hook or off-hook intrusion detection or determining other states of the phone line. Exemplary uses of DC loop voltage (also called DC line voltage) data may be seen in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/603,037, filed Jun. 26, 2000 and entitled \u201cINTEGRATED MODEM AND LINE-ISOLATION CIRCUITRY AND ASSOCIATED METHOD HAVING INTRUSION DETECTION\u201d by Timothy J. Dupuis, which is incorporated herein by reference., 82966=Caller-ID data: 12 mVrms\u2013476 mVrms, 1200 Hz and 2200 Hz, 74991=Similarly, the control logic 1608 may have a number of external pins providing control and status information to and from the external controller, such as ring detect output pin (RGDT_bar) for producing an active low rectified version of the ring signal, ring ground output pin (RG_bar) for providing a control signal for ring ground relay, (may be used to support ground start applications), TIP ground detect input pin (TGD_bar) for detecting current flowing in TIP for supporting ground start applications, TIP ground detect enable output pin (TGDE_bar) for providing a control signal for the ground detect relay (may be used to support ground start applications), reset input pin (RESET_bar) for providing an active low input that may be used to reset all control registers to a defined initialized state (may also be used to bring powered side circuitry 116 out of sleep mode), and analog speaker output/interrupt output pin (AOUT/INT) for providing an analog output signal for driving a call progress speaker in AOUT mode (alternatively may be set to provide a hardware interrupt signal)., 76896=In the embodiment depicted, the hybrid portion of hybrid, AC and DC termination circuitry 1617 has a receive input pin (RX) for providing the receive side input from the telephone network, an internal bias pin (IB) for providing a bias voltage to the device, a SC Connection pin (SC) for sensing a surge event and activating a clamp, DC termination pins (DCT, DCT2 and DCT3) for providing DC termination to the telephone network, a voltage regulator pin (VREG) for connecting to an external capacitor to provide bypassing for an internal power supply, and a voltage regulator 2 pin (VREG2) for connecting to an external capacitor to provide bypassing for an internal power supply., 39511=Electrical isolation barriers can be identified in many industrial, medical and communication applications where it is necessary to electrically isolate one section of electronic circuitry from another electronic section. In this context, isolation exists between two sections of electronic circuitry if a large magnitude voltage source (typically on the order of 1000 volts or more) connected between any two circuit nodes separated by the barrier causes less than a minimal amount of current flow (typically on the order of 10 milliamperes or less) through the voltage source. An electrical isolation barrier must exist, for example, in communication circuitry that connects directly to the standard two-wire public switched telephone network and that is powered through a standard residential wall outlet.}",
