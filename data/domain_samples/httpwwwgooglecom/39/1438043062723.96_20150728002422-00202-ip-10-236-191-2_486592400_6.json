    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23630=In the noted computer-mobile phone application, for example, the PC card is a data adapter which can be installed in either unit for converting data from the mobile phone into a suitable form for the computer and likewise converting data coming from the computer into a suitable form for the mobile phone. An example of a prior art system for transmitting electronic information between a cellular phone and an electronic device such as a computer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,446,783, issued to G. J. May and assigned to Hewlett-Packard Company, wherein an IR converter is provided in a battery pack which attaches to the cellular phone. It will be seen that the data adapter is disposed in the phone and the IR converter must be attached directly to the phone for proper operation. This complicates the phone unnecessarily if the data adapter is built in, since a user may only wish to use the phone for speech services and not wireless data services as well, and it renders the phone more expensive.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments and combinations, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the particular examples presented herein, and that the scope of the protection is defined in the attached claims. It will therefore be seen that a data adapter arrangement is described which provides versatility and adaptability in conducting data communications between electronic devices and particularly facilitates wireless IR communication between such electronic devices as cellular phones and computers by appropriately converting the form of the data signals using data cards and a simple adapter containing an independent power supply. The adapter accepts data cards and couples the data signals exchanged between the electronic devices to a data card therein for converting the signals to a proper form for transmission and processing. Alternatively, receptacle means 6, rather than accepting the phone 1 therein, may constitute an input/output port for removably coupling the data signals wirelessly or by cable to the transmission line 11. It should be noted that the thick transmission or communication lines between components represent those carrying parallel data, and the thin ones represent those carrying serial data. The data adapter unit 2, or preferably the data card 3, further includes a detector means 28 for automatically detecting whether there is a connection to the electrical port 24. Normally, signal transmission will be over line 30 between connection control unit 14",
