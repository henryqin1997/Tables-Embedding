In one embodiment, the dataset elements are derived from the input, although it will be understood that the invention is not so limited, as described above. Dataset elements encountered thus far in the input data are salesman name, (Bill and Tom), days of the week (Monday, Tuesday), number of items (40, 103, 100, 80, 13), status (sold, trial) and state (PA, NJ). In one embodiment of the invention, the interlocking trees datastore 1000 of FIG. 10 will result from this input. In FIG. 10, for space reasons, the first portion of the node is not shown. For example, although node 1002 is labeled \u201cBill\u201d, node 1002 actually represents \u201cBOT-Bill\u201d. Although node 1002 is labeled \u201cTuesday\u201d, node 1004 actually represents \u201cBOT-Bill-Tuesday\u201d and so on.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purpose of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention. For example, the interlocking trees datastore can be implemented using object-oriented technologies, procedural technologies, a hybrid thereof or any other suitable methodology. Furthermore, although the examples presented show the dataset elements stored in a memory, one of skill in the art will understand that this functionality can be implemented in many different ways. For example, the invention contemplates the use of many different sets of dataset elements of many different universes stored on multiple remotely located machines. The methods and system described above may be embodied in the form of program code (i.e., instructions) stored on a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy diskette, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, hard disk drive, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The present invention may also be embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, over a network, including the Internet or an intranet, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such",
