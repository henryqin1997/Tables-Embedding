The value of the HIC must not exceed 1000 at a given fall height if a playing surface is to be considered appropriate for use at that fall height. A measure of the critical fall height (CFH) is the height at which the HIC reaches a value of 1000. The height at which the maximum force exerted exceeds 200 G can also be taken as a measure of the CFH.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Similarly, references to \u201csand\u201d may in many embodiments refer to \u201cproper\u201d sand since this is cheap and durable and well-tried by us in experiments, but should not in other embodiments be viewed as restrictive. Another particulate material replacement for sand many be envisaged, for example another small-sized incompressible, or substantially incompressible particulate material, possibly having a uniform particle size or possibly having a range of particle sizes: something that can take the place of sand in use and perform comparably. It will be appreciated that by \u201crubber\u201d is meant one or more of natural rubber, or something containing natural rubber; synthetic rubber, or something containing synthetic rubber; a resistant force-absorbing material that can take the place of rubber in use, such as a resilient plastics, or polymeric material. Limitation to natural rubber is not intended for many embodiments, although some embodiments may use natural rubber. 100% polypropylene woven scrim Backing 20 mm Total Thickness Weight 100 gms/sqm Backing Scrim Not less than 1650 gms/sqm Fibre Weight 5 to 110 Denier",
