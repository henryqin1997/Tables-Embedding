There is only an added cost of approximately $500.00 for the touch screen, its functional integration (e.g. wiring) with the remainder of the machine, and the additional game software. In contrast, adding a second machine to permit keno play, for example, costs about $5,000.00 and roughly doubles the casino floor space requirements. Thus, the cost of separate poker and keno machines exceeds the added cost of a combination machine using a touch screen and the conventionally limited number of pushbutton actuators by a factor of about 10:1. In addition, there is the added, ongoing doubling of the floor space costs one necessarily encounters when using two conventional machines instead of the combination machine of the present invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In spite of the expected preference of most players to play games with the push buttons whenever this is possible, the combination gaming machine of the present invention significantly enhances player appeal. Video gaming machine players frequently spend hours playing on video gaming machines, especially the most popular games such as poker, blackjack or video slots. These games can be played with the buttons, thereby minimizing or eliminating player fatigue because of the advantageous positioning of the buttons relative to the player. However, a player can quickly change over to other games, including games which could not heretofore be played on conventional push-button video gaming machines, such as keno, for example, by making the appropriate selection at the end of a play without having to leave the machine and finding one on which keno, for example, can be played. Such machine change interrupts the play rhythm, distracts the player's concentration and, not infrequently, causes the player to lose interest in play altogether, which is undesirable for casino operators, who prefer to have players spend as much time as possible at continuous play. The combination touch screen-push button machine of the present invention makes this possible and is, therefore, a machine of choice for both players and gaming operators. Typically, the player will play with the push buttons 24 all games which are playable with them because they are better liked by the average player. Reasons for",
