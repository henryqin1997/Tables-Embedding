The solution was allowed to adsorb onto the contact lenses at room temperature in the dark for 3 hours. The polymers were then covalently linked to the plastic by photolysis for 12 hours at the appropriate wavelength (450 nm for ANP and 320 nm for BBA and nBBA derivatives). After photolysis, the contact lenses were washed with 5\ufffd5 ml of normal saline (0.85% NaCl) to remove non-covalently linked groups., 65775=The total amino acid analyses of the acid hydrolyzed contact lenses are given in Table 2. These results are expressed as total amino acids in nmole/ml. These results again indicated that the ANP-PEG-1000, ANP-PEG-4000 and nBBA-Jeff modifications of Sofspin polymacon lenses reduced the deposition of proteins on the lenses after 7 days of incubation in artificial human tears., 74294=The BBA-PEG-1450 described in Example I, in a methanol solution, is sprayed into 96 well polystyrene microtiter plates at a concentration of 3000 ng of reagent per well. The methanol is allowed to evaporate off before the plates are photoactivated as described in Example II., 24869=This application is a continuation of application Ser.

No. 4,722,906., 50815=Preparation of Photolabeled Polyethylene Glycols Polyethylene glycols of molecular weights 1000 (PEG-1000) and 4000 (PEG-4000) were labeled with fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene (FNAB) by modification of the phase transfer method of Kimura, and S. Regen, Journal of Organic Chemistry 48; 195 (1983) the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein. Briefly, the phase-transfer synthesis of 4-azido-2-nitrophenyl polyethylene glycol (ANP-PEG) involved the mixture of 60% aqueous potassium hydroxide (\"KOH\")/toluene with FNAB and PEG, followed by extraction and thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) purification as described below., 51478=ANP-PEG-1000, 64573=Reduction in total protein deposition reached 85% in ANP-PEG-1000 modified Sofspin lenses. The overall protein amounts were reduced for all lens materials except ANP-1000-OH coated Polymacon buttons, ANP-4000-OH coated polymacon buttons and ANP-hyaluronate coated polymacon buttons. These poor results were all obtained with virgin polymacon materials which appears to react differently than polymacon contact lenses, such as Sofspin lenses. Overall, these in vitro protein deposition studies demonstrated significant to dramatic decreases in protein deposition from artificial tears on various contact lens materials during a one week period., 69071=Ocular prostheses (artificial eyes) are generally made from poly methylmethacrylate. Ocular prostheses were inspected, cleaned and polished by an ocularist, and were then sprayed with a methanol solution containing 0.3% of the BBA-PEG-1450 derivative as described in Example II. The spray volume was just sufficient to completely wet the surface of the prostheses., 67054=Dihydroxy PEG 1450, 0.125 moles, was dissolved in 800 ml of toluene, followed by removal by distillation of 200 ml of solvent to provide azeotropic removal of water. Triethylamine, 0.143 moles, was then added, followed by the addition of 0.0625 moles of the acid chloride of 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (Aldrich B1,240-7). The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad to remove the hydrochloride salt of triethylamine and the toluene was removed under reduced pressure., 51510=ANP-PEG-1000 was prepared by adding 0.3 mmole PEG-1000 to 5 mls 60% KOH and 0.15 mmole FNAB to 10 ml toluene. This reaction mixture was rapidly stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The product was isolated from the organic layer. TLC in 85/15/1/1 chloroform/methanol/H2 O/acetic acid or ammonium hydroxide separated mono-and di-substituted derivatives of ANP-PEG-1000 from unlabeled PEG. The band corresponding to ANP-PEG-1000 (lower Rf value) was extracted from silica gel with TLC solvent and azeotrophed to remove residual acid or base. The final product was soluble in water.}",

The polystyrene tissue culture \"slips\" as used in example 5 were soaked for two hours in a solution containing 1.5 micrograms of the compound of Example 4 dissolved into 133 microliters of methanol. The slips are removed and the methanol solvent is allowed to evaporate in air. A solution of 200 micrograms of fibronectin peptide (FP) subunits per milliliter of 0.1M bicarbonate (pH 9.0) in water was prepared. To one side of the polystyrene slip (0.5\ufffd1.0 cm) was added enough of the fibronectin peptide solution (75 microliters) to completely cover the entire surface. The slip maintained for 4 hours at 4\ufffd C. Without removing the solution the slip is photoactivated as in Example III for three minutes. The solution was next removed from the slip. The slip was then placed into 1.5 ml of 1.0% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline and allowed to rotate on an orbital shaker. The wash solution was replaced every thirty minutes for 1.5 hours, and then allowed to continue washing for approximately 16 hours before they were exhaustively rinsed with PBS. The slips were evaluated using corneal endothelial cell tissue culture as in Example V, against control slips having adsorbed FP and",
