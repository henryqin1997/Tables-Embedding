No. 07/944,207 filed Sep. 11, 1992, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference., 131395=FIG. 52B is a schematic diagram of the optics of FIG. 52A. Illustrated are the display pod 1100 and magnifying glasses 1905. In the display pod 1100 are a display panel 1000, a reflecting mirror 1130 and a viewing lens 1160. The light rays from the display panel 1000 are reflected off from the reflecting mirror 1130 and passed through the lens 1160. Because the glasses 1905 include a magnifying lens 1907, the display pod viewing lens 1160 is a reducing lens. The reducing lens 1160 and the magnifying lens 1907 cooperate to produce a durable image to the wearer., 135900=FIGS. 57E, 57F, 57G and 57H illustrate various rotational positions of display pad including against the user's glasses 1342 at 1340, or against the eye 1343, or retracted above the eye at 1344, or closed against visor 1350 at 1345., 128672=FIG. 48 is a perspective view of another preferred embodiment of the invention. The wearer is equipped with a helmet 800' adding a blister chamber 810' and a display pod 1100. The wearer is also equipped with protective goggles 1200 and a breathing apparatus 1300., 127663=FIGS. 47A-47D illustrated another preferred embodiment of the invention in which a display is mounted above field of view of the user and which projects an image onto a transparent monocular or binocular system in front of the user's eye or eyes. FIG. 47A shows a monocular system 1600 in which a display is position in housing 1606 on visor 1605 and projects an image onto lens 1604. The user can also see through lens 1602 and 1604 to the outside environment. As shown in FIG. 47B, the display is connected by wire or fiber optic cable 1612 to a video source and can be positioned in from of either eye by sliding along rack or rail 1610. The hinge 1614 provides for rotation of lens 1604 against lens 1602. As seen in FIG. 47C, the lens can rotate about hinge 1624 and can be moved along distance 1622. Electronics 1626 for display 1620 can be incorporated into visor 1605. FIG. 47D shows a bumper 1640 for display unit 1632 which can rotate bout hinge 1630 to position lens 1634, 1638., 100308=FIG. 32A is a perspective view of a head-mounted computer 510 fitted to a wearer. The CPU and video driver are fabricated as an integral part of the head band 512. Expansion modules 525A, 525B, 525C are removable and coupled to the bus 523. As shown, the wearer 601 is fitted with a monocular display. A display pod 1100 is positioned in the wearer's field of view by a display arm assembly 600. The display arm assembly 600 includes a proximal section 610, a distal section 620, a horizontal support member 630, and a nose piece 650. The distal arm member 620 telescopes from the proximal arm member 610 using a supporting member 612. Also shown is an earplug 603.}",
