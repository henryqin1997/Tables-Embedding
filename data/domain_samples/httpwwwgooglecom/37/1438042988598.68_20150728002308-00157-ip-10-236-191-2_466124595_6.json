The printer driver, in addition to the conventional function of receiving the output information from the application program and applying it to the printer, has the function of generating the browsing data. First, a destination is decided (step 1202), and if the destination is the printer, the conventional output process is performed (step 1202)., 70127=The browsing data 1503 first waits for a request from the media editor 1501 and the browsing section 1502 (step 1701), and decides on the type of the request when the request arrives. In the case where the request is for generating the browsing data, the process is performed for generating the browsing data anew (step 1703). In the case where the request is for deleting the browsing data, on the other hand, the browsing data management table 1621 is searched for a browsing data corresponding to the media data of the parameter, which is deleted simultaneously with the record in the management table (step 1704). Steps 1705 and 1713 that follow, to search for the browsing data, as in step 1702, use the browsing data management table 1621 and the identifier for the media data designated by the parameter. In the case where the request is for page deletion, the data of the page designated by the browsing data parameter is deleted thereby to reduce the number of pages by one (step 1705)., 61452=The information processing system according to this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 11, comprises a mouse 8 and a keyboard 9 for receiving an input from the user, a display 7, a system device 1101 for performing various processing operations, disks 4, 5, 6 for storing data, and a printer 1104 for outputting information on the paper. The system device 1101 includes an application processing section 2 for editing/displaying the media data such as texts, graphics, images and video, a browsing processing section 1102 for performing management of the relations between the application-specific data and the browsing data, scaled-down display of the browsing data, list display and registration of the browsing data, a window system for receiving the input from the mouse 8 and the keyboard 9 and sending them to the processing section 2 or 3 and displaying the output from the section 2 or 3 on the display 7, and a printer driver 1103 for outputting information to the printer in accordance with the instruction from the application, generating the browsing data and relating the browsing data to the application-specific data. The contents of the disks 4, 5, 6 are identical to those shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 1 to 9., 71142=When the request is for page addition, on the other hand, the page data 224 is generated and by adding it to the end of the page data list, the number of pages is increased by one (step 1706). In the case where the request is for registration of a feature page, the page designated by a parameter is registered in the item 223 of the feature page of the browsing data (step 1707). In the case where the request is for retrieval of the feature page, the page in the feature page item 223 of the browsing page data 1622 is returned (step 1708). If the request is for retrieving the number of pages, the number in the page-number item 221 of the browsing data 1622 is returned (step 1709). When the request is for retrieving the feature section, the numeral in the item 22, of the page feature section designated by the browsing data 1622 is returned (step 1710). In the case where the request is for registration of page data, the page data is registered (step 1711), while if the request is for retrieving the page data, the page data is retrieved (step 1712). If the request is for activating the page data, the page data is activated (step 1713). If the request is for termination, the terminating process is performed. In other words, the browsing data management table 1621 and the browsing data 1622 are stored in the disks (step 1714) thereby to terminate the process., 73917=In the page data processing section, as shown in FIG. 20, the browsing data is searched for from the media data identifier designated by the parameter (step 2041), and decision is made as to whether the bit-map data corresponding to the scaling ratio and the page designated by the parameter are active or not (step 2042). If the page and the bit-map data are not active, the activation process is performed (step 2043). Next, the bit-map-id 2242 or 2246 is returned (step 1934) thereby to terminate the process., 72535=In the process for preparing the browsing data new, as shown in FIG. 18, first, the browsing data management table is searched and decision is made as to whether there exists any browsing data corresponding to the media data of the parameter (step 1821). If there is any such data, the existing browsing data is deleted (step 1822); otherwise, the record of the browsing data management data 1621 is added by one and the media data identifier 211 is registered (step 1823). Next, the browsing data 1622 is generated, and the identifier 212 thereof is registered against the media data identifier 211 (step 1824). The number of pages and the scale-down algorithm designated by a parameter are registered in the page number item 221 of the browsing data 1622 (1825), thereby terminating the process., 81030=Assume that a buffer (or memories 1506, 1507) accessible at high speed is built in the browsing data management section 1503 and the browsing section 1502. The page data can be displayed immediately without disk access by issuing an advance request for activation to the page data having a high likelihood of display by the browsing section., 74449=Accordingly, a request is sent from browsing section 1502 to browsing data management section 1503, and bit map id obtained as a result of processing in browsing data management section 1503 is sent back to browsing section 1502. While, a standard size bit-map id (2242) is selected in the event scalling ratio is 1.0, a compressed data bit map id (2246) is selected is the event the scaling ratio is other than 1.0, and returned to browsing section 1502., 67366=FIG. 16 shows the structure of the browsing data and the management table 1505 in FIG. 15. In FIG. 16, numeral 1621 designates a browsing data management table, and numeral 1622 browsing data. The browsing data management table 1621 is a list of two-item record including an identifier 211 for the media data and an identifier 212 for the browsing data 1622. The browsing data 1622 includes a list of a page number 221, a scale-down algorithm 222, a feature page 223 and page information 224. The page information 224 includes an identifier 2241 for the standard-sized bit-map file 23, a pointer 2242 (hereinafter referred to as a bit-map-id) to a region of the memory 1506 into which the file in the browsing data management section 1503 is read, a numerical value 2243 indicating the range (digit, line, width, height) read into the memory, a state graph 2244 indicating whether the bit-map data is read into the memory, an identifier 2245 of the file 24 for storing the scaled-down bit-map file 24, a bit-map-id 2246 for the scaled-down bit-map data, a state flag 2248 for the scaled-down bit-map data, and a numerical value 2249 (number of places, number of lines, width and height from origin) representing the page features., 25738=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/631,438, filed on Apr. 12, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,586,316, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/271,923 filed on Jul. 7, 1994, now abandoned., 73352=In the page data registration, as shown in FIG. 19, the browsing data is searched from the media data identifier designated by the parameter (step 1931), and decision is made as to whether the bit-map data corresponding to the scale-down ratio and the page designated of the browsing data is active or not (step 1932). If it is not active, the bit-map data is compressed and stored in the disk (step 1933). If the data is active, on the other hand, the bit-map-id 2242 or 2246 in the browsing data 1622 is changed as designated by the parameter., 64758=The programs and data stored in the external memory 1304, like those in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 8A, 8B, are appropriately read into the main memory and executed by the central processing unit 1300., 78056=To display the browsing data by icons on the screen, the media data identifier, the page, the scaling ratio and the range of retrieval are designated, and a page data retrieval request is issued to the browsing data management section 1503 thereby to acquire the bit-map data. This bit-map data is displayed on the screen, a page number retrieval request is issued to acquire the page number, and the page number is displayed in association with the particular number. This process is repeated the number of times equal to the number of media data to be displayed., 76831=Now, explanation will be made about the case in which the browsing data is utilized on the desk-top screen of the workstation or the personal computer. In the case under consideration, the desk-top processing corresponds to the browsing section 1502 in FIG. 15. FIG. 24 shows an example of desk-top screen. In FIG. 24, numeral 61 designates a scaled-down bit-map data displayed as an icon, numeral 62 a manipulation menu, numeral 63 a scroll bar attached to the icon 61, numeral 64 a window for scaled-down list display of the page data, and numeral 65 a page number display for indicating the number of pages of the browsing data by thickness. Icon-manipulating commands are assumed to exist as shown by the menu 62. They include a scale-up command for displaying a scaled-up browsing data, a scale-down command for displaying a scaled-down browsing data, a page-flipping command for displaying the contents of all pages in succession at the same position automatically, a list display command for creating a new window 64 and displaying the contents of all the pages on the window 64, and an edit command for editing the corresponding media data. Each icon is associated with a corresponding media data., 66422=FIG. 15 is a block diagram showing an information processing system according to another embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 15, numeral 1501 designates a media data editor for inputting/editing the media data such as texts, graphics, images and video, numeral 1502 a browsing section for displaying a list or flipping the pages of the browsing data, and numeral 1503 a browsing data management section for generating and managing the browsing data. Numeral 1504 designates a disk for storing the data file 25 input/edited at the media data editor 1501, and numeral 1505 a disk for storing the browsing data 22 and the management data 21. The media data editor 1501 not only inputs/edits but also scales down the media data. The browsing data management section 1503 scales down/up, compresses/expands the browsing data and stores/reads them in a disc. The browsing data management section 1503 includes a work memory 1506., 57302=The browsing program 3 according to this embodiment, in addition to the functions described in the foregoing embodiment, is assume to have the function of invoking the application program associated with an application-specific data when it is designated together with such operations as display, editing or printing. This function is realized by the use of the conventional method as disclosed in \"Nikkei Bytes May 1990, pp. 279-283\"., 75834=Next, the processing operation at the media editor 1501 will be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 23., 69762=Next, the operation flow of the browsing data management section 1503 will be explained in detail with reference to FIGS. 17 to 21. FIG. 17 shows the general flow of operation. FIGS. 18, 19, 20, 21 show the process for newly generating the browsing data, registering page data, retrieving the page data and activating the page data respectively., 64981=Although the software configuration is shown in FIG. 13B, the processing in the browsing data display 1381 is represented by the flow shown in FIG. 5, and the processing in the browsing data generator/register 1331 by the flow shown in FIG. 3., 74924=In the page data activation process, as shown in FIG. 21, the browsing data is searched from the media data identifier designated by the parameter (step 2151), and decision is made as to whether the bit-map data of a scaling ratio requested is available or not (step 2152). If there is available such data, the bit-map data in the designated range is read from the bit-map file of the particular scaling ratio for expansion thereby to register the range in 2243 (step 2153). Otherwise, the bit-map file of a range designated with a scaling ratio smaller than designated for expansion and the range is registered in 2243 (step 2154). The algorithm thus registered is scaled down (step 2155). Next, the bit-map-id thus read is registered in the browsing data (step 2156), and that the fact that the particular bit-map data is active is registered (step 2157) thereby to terminate the process., 64143=FIGS. 13A and 13B show the hardware and software configurations of a modification of the embodiment of FIG. 11. In this modification, a central processing unit 1300 having a main memory 1301 is connected with a display 1302 such as a bit-map display, an input unit 1303 such as a mouse or a keyboard, and an external memory 1304.
