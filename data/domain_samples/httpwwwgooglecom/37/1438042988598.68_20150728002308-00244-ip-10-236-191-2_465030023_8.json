It is not intended that such details be regarded as limitations upon the scope of the invention except insofar as and to the extent that they are included in the accompanying claims. The above Examples 1 and 2 and comparative Examples 3, 4 and 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of the chemical feeder of the present invention in delivering a chemical treating agent, e.g., chlorine, to a liquid stream at a relatively constant and controllable rate. In particular, the above examples demonstrate the advantage of combining within a chemical feeder according to the present invention the elements of: (a) tablet canisters having a plurality of perforations in their lower portions which serve to expose the lower most tablets loaded therein to; (b) a cyclonic flow of water provided by tangential inlet 24. The above examples further demonstrate the advantage of operating the chemical feeder of the present invention in a substantially flooded condition, which substantially eliminates the accumulation of pressurized air within chamber 62, thereby providing a significant safety advantage. The results of Example 5 are summarized in FIG. 4e, which graphically illustrates that the chlorine delivery rate was not observed to reach a steady state throughout the whole of the experiment. In addition, the chlorine delivery rate was observed to drop to nearly zero by the third hour of the third",
