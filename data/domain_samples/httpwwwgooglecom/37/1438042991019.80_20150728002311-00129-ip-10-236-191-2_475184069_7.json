No. 60/219,741, and from which priority is claimed for the present application., 102621=For the conditions given for FIG. 6, the steady state drawdown pressure difference, p*\u2212pss, is 0.5384 psi for k/\u03bc=1000 md/cp, 5.384 psi for 100 md/cp, 53.84 psi for 10 md/cp, etc. For a pump rate of 0.1 cm3/s, these pressure differences would be halved; and they would be doubled for a pump rate of 0.4 cm3/s, etc., 119604=The pump piston is stopped (or slowed) to initiate the pressure buildup. When the piston is stopped, the system volume remains constant, and flow into the probe from the formation causes compression of fluid contained in the system volume and the consequent rise in pressure. For high mobility measurements, for which only steady-state calculations are performed, determination of fluid compressibility is not required. The buildup is used only to determine p*, so the pump is completely stopped for buildup. For the conditions given for FIG. 6, the buildup time, to reach within 0.01 psi of p* is about 6, 0.6, and 0.06 seconds for mobilities of 10, 100 and 1000 md/cp 618, 620 and 622, respectively.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the particular embodiments as herein shown and disclosed in detail are fully capable of providing the advantages hereinbefore stated, it is to be understood that this disclosure is merely illustrative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention and that no limitations are intended other than as described in the appended claims. Another embodiment of the present invention includes Phase I 702, Phase II 704, Phase VI 712, Phase VII 714 and the equalization procedure 716. This method is used in very low permeability formations or when the probe seal is lost. Phase II would not be as distinct a deviation as shown, so the straight line portion 703 of Phase I would seem to extend well below the formation pressure pf. Other embodiments using one or more of the method elements discussed above are also considered within the scope of this invention. Still referring to FIG. 11, another embodiment includes Phase I through Phase IV and then Phase VII. This method is desirable with moderately permeable formations when it is desired to measure formation pressure. Typically, there would be a slight variation in the profile for Phase IV in this embodiment. Phase VII would be initiated when measurements show a substantially zero slope on the pressure curve 709. The equalizing procedure 716 would also be necessary before moving the tool. Stabilized pressures determined during Phase V 710 and Phase VI, 712 along with the",
