    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description is directed to particular embodiments of the present invention for the purpose of illustration and explanation. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that many modifications and changes to the embodiment set forth above are possible without departing from the scope and the spirit of the invention. For example, certain self-contained electronics or other equipment may be disposed on the rotating sleeve so long as no power, communication or other connection between the non-rotating sleeve and drilling system is required to operate such equipment. Of course, the use of such systems may affect the operational advantages of the present invention. For example, such equipment may limit the degree to which the overall non-rotating sleeve may be reduced. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such modifications and changes. It should be understood that the teachings of the present invention are not limited to the particular configuration of the drilling assembly described. For example, the sensor package 230 may be moved up hole of the drilling motor. Likewise the power source 230 may be moved up hole of the drilling motor. Also, there may be greater or fewer number of force application members 250. It will also be appreciated that placement of the steering assembly electronics in the rotating bearing assembly rather than the non-rotating sleeve provides greater flexibility in electronics design",
