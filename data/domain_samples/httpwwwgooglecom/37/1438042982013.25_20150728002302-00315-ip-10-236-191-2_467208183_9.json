Those with skill in the chemical, mechanical, electromechanical, electrical, and computer arts will readily appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a very wide variety of embodiments. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the preferred embodiments discussed herein. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. By directing air stream 42 through the print zone 15 as ink drops 38 are ejected during printing, air current disruption system 40 disrupts air currents acting on ink drops 38 during printing, but does not disrupt the intended trajectory of ink drops 38 during printing. As such, undesirable print defects 51, such as \u201cworms,\u201d are avoided without compromising image resolution, printing speed, and/or accommodation of various thickness of print medium. . Thus, image quality is enhanced with the air current disruption system according to the present invention. FIG. 6 , enlarged image portion 52 does not include print defects 51 identifiable in FIG. 7",
