    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations (5) The suspension system composed of the eccentric retainer and the braking system is so constructed as to only widen the braking surface in the radial direction, so that the bicycle front wheel control mechanism of this invention is simple in its structure and easy in maintenance and inspection. (4) The braking surface is adapted to be pressed by the braking member while moving in the radial direction relative to the braking member. Therefore, experiments proved that no locking occurred in the front wheel 6. (3) The front wheel 6 is adapted to move in a longitudinal direction when going over a bump 4. Therefore, the energy accumulated in the elastic body 41 by the rocking motion of the front wheel 6 is returned again to the rotation motion of the front wheel 6 so as to minimize the loss of running energy by a large margin. (2) In ordinary conditions, the eccentric retainer 10 can be kept upright in the vertical direction. Consequently, even when the rider pedals the bicycle with his full strength on a flat road surface, vertical movement is hardly created in the bicycle body so that the rider can pedal it with his full strength. Further, the shock given to the front wheel 6 from the front when an abrupt turn is made can also be dampened so that the steering ability can be improved too. (1) When the front wheel",
