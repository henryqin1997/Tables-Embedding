    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The reaction pressure is determined in view of the types of starting materials, the reaction conditions, and the conditions of cracked gases being treated downstream of the reactor. Higher temperatures result in a larger amount of acetylene. Formation of acetylene is the endothermic reaction which requires a larger amount of heat than in the case of formation of more useful ethylene, thus bringing about an increase in amount of heat per unit amount of desired ethylenic olefin product. In order to suppress the formation of acetylene, it is necessary to increase the reaction pressure. However, an increase of the reaction pressure invites an increase of partial pressure of hydrocarbons, thus accelerating coking. In this sense, it is necessary that coking be suppressed while shortening the residence time as well as increasing the reaction pressure. The reaction pressure has relation with treating conditions of cracked gas. When the process of the invention is operated as an ordinary olefin production plant, the pressure of the separation and purification system ranging from 30 to 40 kg/cm2 g should be taken into account. The reaction pressure should be determined in view of the types of starting materials and the cracking conditions. In case where partial combustion is effected in the combustion zone to obtain synthetic gas as well, the reaction pressure should be determined in consideration of applications of the synthetic gas. In the olefin production plant, the pressure is",
