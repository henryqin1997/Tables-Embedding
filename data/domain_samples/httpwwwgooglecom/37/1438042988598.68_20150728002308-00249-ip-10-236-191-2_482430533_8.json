These surfactants can be broadly described as aliphatic derivatives of secondary or tertiary amines, or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical can be straight- or branched chain. One of the aliphatic substituents contains at least 8 carbon atoms, typically from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, and at least one contains an anionic water-solubilizing group e.g. carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued Dec. 30, 1975 at column 19, lines 18-35 (herein incorporated by reference) for examples of ampholytic surfactants., 41275=Other cationic surfactants useful herein are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,228,044, Cambre, issued Oct. 14, 1980, incorporated herein by reference., 58704=i) fine dispersion mixing or granulation of at least one nonionic surfactant which is a liquid at temperatures below 40\ufffd C. in the presence of an effective amount of a powder which comprises sodium aluminosilicate and hydrophobic silica, wherein the ratio of the sodium aluminosilicate to silica is from 100:1 to 3:1., 56472=Polymeric polycarboxylate builders are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued Mar. 7, 1967. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of homo-and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid., 61911=iv) mixing the product of step iii) with a premixed powder which comprises sodium aluminosilicate and hydrophobic silica, wherein the premixed powder is used at a level of from 3% to 15% by weight of the finished detergent component or composition and that the ratio of the sodium aluminosilicate to silica is from 100:1 to 3:1., 23742=EP 0 513 824, published 19th Nov., 1992, describes a process for making nonionic detergent granules and the use of a surface coating agent having a particle size of less than 10 micrometers., 22617=U.S. Pat. No. 3,868,336, published on 25th Feb., 1975, claims blends of detergent compositions with 0.5% to 15% by weight of a particulate water-insoluble flow-promoting agent for lessening, or eliminating caking, stickiness, and oiling out when an oily liquid detergency improver is applied. Although this patent discloses various flow-promoting agents, it does not disclose the advantages to be gained from mixing specific ratios of hydrophobic silica and aluminosilicates., 23370=EP 0 351 937, published 24th Jan., 1990 and EP 0 352 135, published 24th Jan., 1990 disclose agglomeration processes carried out sequentially with high speed and low speed mixing. No finely divided particulate is present is the granulation step. However flow aids may be used, for example, aluminosilicates, precipitated silica and others are suitable., 73910=This example describes the process in batch mode in a pilot plant scale high shear mixer, an Eirich RV02, to produce high active nonionic detergent agglomerates without nonionic leakage problems. The mixer was filled first with a mixture of powders to be used, in this particular case zeolite A and fine sodium carbonate. A nonionic surfactant paste with a activity of 90%, comprising a mixture of ethoxylated nonionic surfactant and polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, was then added on top of the powder mixture while the mixer is being operated at 1600 rpm. Enough paste was added until the granulation is achieved. The agglomerates are then transferred to a rotating drum mixer and dusted for 1-2 minutes with a flow aid at a level of 5 or 10% by weight of the granular detergent. The composition of the agglomerates was given below in Table 6., 29846=Methods of manufacturing polyhydroxy fatty acid amides have been described in WO 92 6073, published on 16th Apr., 1992. This application describes the preparation of polyhydroxy fatty acid amides in the presence of solvents. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention N-methyl glucamine is reacted with a C12-C20 methyl ester. It also says that the formulator of granular detergent compositions may find it convenient to run the amidation reaction in the presence of solvents which comprise alkoxylated, especially ethoxylated (EO 3-8) C12-C14 alcohols (page 15, lines 22-27). This directly yields nonionic surfactant systems which are preferred in the present invention, such as those comprising N-methyl glucamide and C12-C14 alcohols with an average of 3 ethoxylate groups per molecule., 25514=The present invention relates to detergent components or compositions having a bulk density of at least 700 g/l which comprises a nonionic surfactant system which includes at least one nonionic surfactant which is a liquid at temperatures below 40\ufffd C., and from 0.5% to 15% by weight of the component or composition of a flow aid which is a premixed powder comprising sodium aluminosilicate and hydrophobic silica in the ratio of from 100:1 to 3:1. The invention also relates to a process for making such detergent components or compositions., 30662=Nonionic surfactant systems, and granular detergents made from such systems have been described in WO 92 6160, published on 16th Apr., 1992. This application describes (example 15) a granular detergent composition prepared by fine dispersion mixing in an Eirich RV02 mixer which comprises N-methyl glucamide (10%), nonionic surfactant (10%)., 65063=The mixture of granular ingredients listed above was placed inside a 140 liter rotating drum that operates at 25 rpm. While operating the drum a mixture of nonionic surfactant (C25E3) and a 20% aqueous solution of optical brightener at ratios of 14:1 were sprayed onto the granular mixture to a level of 7% by weight of the granular components. The spraying time was about 1-2 minutes. Immediately afterwards, perfume was sprayed on, at a level of 0.5% by weight of the granular components, while rotating the drum. Then, without stopping the rotation of the drum, a flow aid was slowly added to the mixer, taking about 30 seconds. The level and type of flow aids used is given below in Table 1. Once the addition of flow aid was finished, the mixer was allowed to rotate for about 1 minutes and was then stopped. The finished product was then removed from the rotating drum., 51702=For use in the present invention, the sodium aluminosilicate and the silica must be premixed in a ratio of from 100:1 to 3:1. Preferably the ratio will be from 20:1 to 5:1, and most preferably around 10:1, all ratios being by weight. The resulting premix is a free-flowing powder which is much easier to handle than either the zeolite power on its own, or the silica powder on its own. Sodium aluminosilicate powder alone is usually sticky and does not flow well. Silica powder on its own is very dusty, due to the very small particle size and low bulk density. However the flow aids of the present invention are a free-flowing, non-dusty powder., 48944=Aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful in the practice of this invention are commercially available. The aluminosilicates useful in this invention can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,985,669, Krummel et al., issued Oct. 12, 1976, incorporated herein by reference. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B, and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula, 21289=The present invention relates to the use of flow aids for granular products which comprise a mixture of sodium aluminosilicate and silica in a narrowly defined ratio. The silica used is hydrophobic silica, preferably fumed hydrophobic silica. The ratio of sodium aluminosilicate to silica is from about 100:1 to about 3:1, preferably from 20:1 to 5:1, and most preferably around 10:1., 36881=Other anionic surfactants useful for detersive purposes can also be included in the laundry detergent compositions of the present invention. These can include salts (including, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and triethanolamine salts) of soap, C9 -C20 linear alkylbenzenesulphonates, C8 -C22 primary or secondary alkanesulphonates, C8 -C24 olefinsulphonates, sulphonated polycarboxylic acids prepared by sulphonation of the pyrolyzed product of alkaline earth metal citrates, e.g., as described in British patent specification No. 1,082,179, C8 -C24 alkylpolyglycolethersulfates (containing up to 10 moles of ehtylene oxide); acyl glycerol sulfonates, fatty oleyl glycerol sulfates, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, alkyl phosphates, isethionates such as the acyl isethionates, N-acyl taurates, alkyl succinamates and sulfosuccinates, monoesters of sulfosuccinate (especially saturated and unsaturated C12 -C18 monoesters) diesters of sulfosuccinate (especially saturated and unsaturated C6 -C14 diesters), acyl sarcosinates, sulfates of alkylpolysaccharides such as the sulfates of alkylpolyglucoside (the nonionic nonsulfated compounds being described below), branched primary alkyl sulfates, alkyl polyethoxy carboxylates such as those of the formula RO(CH2 CH2 O)k CH2 COO--M+ wherein R is a C8 -C22 alkyl, k is an integer from 0 to 10, and M is a soluble salt-forming cation. Resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids are also suitable, such as rosin, hydrogenated rosin, and resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids present in or derived from tall oil. Further examples are given in \"Surface Active Agents and Detergents\" (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). A variety of such surfactants are also generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678, issued Dec. 30, 1975 to Laughlin, et al. at Column 23, line 58 through Column 29, line 23 (herein incorporated by reference)., 42644=Zwitterionic surfactants are also suitable for use in laundry detergent compositions. These surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivates of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quarternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued Dec. 30, 1975 at columns 19, line 38 through column 22, line 48 (herein incorporated by reference) for examples of zwitterionic surfactants., 71857=A mixture of granular raw materials was prepared according to the composition given in examples 1-7. The mixture of granular ingredients described above was placed inside a 140 liter rotating drum that operates at 25 rpm. While operating the drum a mixture of nonionic surfactants (C25E3) and a 20% aqueous solution of optical brightener at ratios of 14:1 were sprayed onto the granular mixture to a level of 7% by weight of the granular composition. The spraying time was about 1-2 minutes. Immediately afterwards, perfume is sprayed on, at a level of 0.5% by weight of the granular composition while rotating the drum. Then, the product is transferred to a Lodige FM 130 batch mixer, where the flow aid was added at a level of 10% by weight of the granular composition. The mixer was started and samples were taken at different time intervals and checked for density. Two different flow aids were compared and density was measured for fresh product, and for product after 24 hours storage. Results are listed in Table 5, given below., 40222=wherein R2 is an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group having from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, each R3 is selected from the group consisting of --CH2 CH2 --, --CH2 CH(CH3)--, --CH2 CH(CH2 OH)--, --CH2 CH2 CH2 --, and mixtures thereof; each R4 is selected from the group consisting of C1 -C4 alkyl, C1 -C4 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl ring structures formed by joining the two R4 groups, --CH2 COH--CHOHCOR6 CHOHCH2 OH wherein R6 is any hexose or hexose polymer having a molecular weight less than about 1000, and hydrogen when y is not 0; R5 is the same as R4 or is an alkyl chain wherein the total number of carbon atoms of R2 plus R5 is not more than about 18; each y is from 0 to about 10 and the sum of the y values is from 0 to about 15; and X is any compatible anion., 23112=JP 61 069897, laid open 10th Apr., 1986 states that aluminosilicate, silicon dioxide, bentonite and clay having am average particle diameter of not more than 10 micrometers can be used as a surface modifier at a level of from 0.5% to 35%.}",
