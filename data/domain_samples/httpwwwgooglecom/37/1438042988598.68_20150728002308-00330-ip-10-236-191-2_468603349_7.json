References It must be noted that although the present invention is described by reference to particular embodiments thereof, many changes and modifications of the invention may become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is only limited by the appended claims. For documents may have associated attributes used to locate the document during a search, for example, a special code word selected by the user. Additionally, this document stream operating system can be implemented as an independent operating system with all required subsystems such as: a storage subsystems in software and/or hardware for writing documents to disc drive, tape drives and the like; interrupt handling subsystems; and input/output subsystems. However, the present invention also encompasses implementations which utilize subsystems from other operating systems such as the Disk Operating System (DOS), WINDOWS, and OPERATING SYSTEM 7. In such implementations, the graphic user interface (GUI) of the other operating system can be replaced",
