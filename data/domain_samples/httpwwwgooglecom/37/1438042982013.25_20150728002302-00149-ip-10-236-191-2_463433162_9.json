    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34332=Also, there are alternative procedures for measuring the oscillatory complex peak amplitude at any prevailing cuff pressure. In one mode heretofore employed, plural (e.g., two) complex peaks are measured at each cuff pressure step during cuff deflation, and their average used as the peak value. Since the peaks should be approximately equal, any marked disparity (e.g., >20%) signals that some artifact error occurred and the data is rejected. In a fast (\"stat\") mode, after several intervals of qualifying (close or equal peak values) companion complexes are detected to develop measurement confidence, only one pulse is required during succeeding cuff deflation intervals thus speeding the composite measurement period. Please see in this later regard the aforementioned application filed July 9, 1984., 21840=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 751,826, filed July 5, 1985, now abandoned., 30665=U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above-described arrangements are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the pressure measurement mode is described above as stepped deflation from an initial inflation above the subject's systolic pressure. The measurement of the instant invention can alternatively be performed by stepped inflation from an initial sub-diastolic cuff pressure; or via continuous vis-a-vis discrete cuff inflation or deflation. The foregoing discussion has thus demonstrated that measured data may be enhanced by replacing data lost through measurement artifacts or the like or deviations from a proper data pattern by approximated values. Specific data processing algorithms were presented and discussed for the computation of a subject's measured systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. MAP=(104+2*129)/2.9=124 Eq. 28. MAPL=140+((128-140)\ufffd(62-44))/(63-44)=129 Eq. 27. To again illustrate by numerical example from the FIG. 1 data The above-discussed algorithm for determining mean arterial pressure is illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9. Step 101 (FIG. 9) finds the peak interval MAX (for example, by execution comparable to Equations 4-10). A processing variable AMP is set equal to the peak value \u03a6A(MAX+1) of the complex following the interval MAX (step 105) and the interval MN1 is next determined (step 106) as the first occurring complex less than",
