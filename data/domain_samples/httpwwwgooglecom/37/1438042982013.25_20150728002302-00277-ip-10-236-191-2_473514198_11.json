No. 60/052,218, filed Jul. 11, 1997., 30398=One attempt to overcome these problems is described in Japanese Patent No 08-232061. The patent describes a combination of forging and rolling for titanium targets at temperatures below the temperature of phase transformation. The process uses a temperature below the phase transformation temperature but well above the temperature of static recrystallization for heavy worked materials. As a result, the process cannot optimize recrystallization and develop very fine and uniform structures textures.}",

The method provides targets with significant improvement in sputtering target performance. FIG. 5 shows effect of annealing temperature on average grain size of titanium. The lowest temperature of static recrystallization is about 375\ufffd C. Corresponding very fine structure of average grain sizes of 6 micrometers demonstrates also low local dispersion of grain diameter and strong texture (1013) (FIG. 8) with orientation content ratio of 65% in the perpendicular direction to target surface. An increase of annealing temperature results in intensive grain growth and larger dispersion in grain size with only moderate strengthening of",
