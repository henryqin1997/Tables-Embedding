Reference is made to Itin, et al., \u201cMechanical Properties and Shape Memory of Porous Nitinol,\u201d Materials Characterization [32] pp. 179-187 (1994); Bobyn, et al., \u201cBone Ingrowth Kinetics and Interface Mechanics of a Porous Tantalum Implant Material,\u201d Transactions of the 43rd Annual Meeting, Orthopaedic Research Society, p. 758, Feb. 9-13, 1997 San Francisco, Calif.; and to Pederson, et al., \u201cFinite Element Characterization of a Porous Tantalum Material for Treatment of Avascular Necrosis,\u201d Transactions of the 43rd Annual Meeting, Orthopaedic Research Society, p. 598 Feb. 9-13, 1997. San Francisco, Calif., the teachings of all of which are incorporated by reference. Metals can be formed into hard, strong, continuous supportive frameworks by a variety of Aid manufacturing procedures including combustion synthesis, plating onto a \u201cfoam\u201d substrate, chemical vapor deposition (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,861), lost mold techniques (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,616,841), foaming molten metal (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,281,251, 3,816,952 and 3,790,365) and replication of reticulated polymeric foams with a slurry of metal powder as described for ceramic powders., 35923=This application is a Divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 08/944,006 filed Oct. 1, 1997 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,296,667., 50725=In preparing articles of the invention, it is preferred to begin with the formation of a supportive, open framework having interstices in the size range of about 50 \u03bcm to about 1000 \u03bcm and preferably from about 200 \u03bcm to about 600 \u03bcm and having void volumes of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 50% and most preferably at least about 70%. The material of the framework may comprise any strong, hard, biologically-compatible material such as ceramic materials, metals and composites such as zirconia, zirconia/hydroxyapatite combinations, and zirconia toughened alumina. Preferably, the framework component is of a ceramic material, zirconia, alumina and calcium phosphates and combinations thereof being preferred.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptation and modification may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. The \u201cgreen\u201d ceramic reticulum formed as in Example I before sintering was wetted with a slip containing zirconia of the same composition, binders and zirconia powders, and was adhered to a green zirconia ceramic of the same composition made by a conventional ceramic slip casting process by sintering, the latter material simulating curved cortical bone and the reticulum simulating attached cancellous bone. The struts of the reticular portion are then coated with a copolymer of glycolic acid and lactic acid as in example II. EXAMPLE VII A supportive framework was made as in Example I but utilizing a slip of zirconia and hydroxyapatite. The struts were coated, and the interstices partially filled with a solution of a copolymer of glycolic acid and lactic acid in methylene chloride. Following coating, the solvent was removed by vacuum. EXAMPLE VI A calcium phosphate framework was made by coating a reticulated polyester-polyurethane foam with a slip of calcium phosphate as described in Example I. The resulting pieces were dried at up to 100\ufffd C. in air. Following drying the pieces were heated to pyrolyze and remove organics and were sintered at a temperature of about 1300\ufffd",
