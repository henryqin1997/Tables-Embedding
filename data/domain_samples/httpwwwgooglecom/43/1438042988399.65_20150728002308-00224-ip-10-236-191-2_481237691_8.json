According to the Publications, it is possible to prevent the wound electrode sheet deposition from slipping out of place or loosening. The reason is as follows. That is, since the core having a rhombic cross-section has an adequate strength, an electrode sheet deposition does not bend while being wound around the core, resulting in that the wound electrode sheet deposition is not slipped out of place. Furthermore, the wound electrode sheet deposition is forced to have a bending tendency along an acute angle of the rhombic core. Hence, the wound electrode sheet deposition is compressed so that a portion having the bending tendency is made bent, ensuring that the wound electrode sheet deposition does not loose., 52171=For instance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-96801 has suggested a method of fabricating an electrode used for a prismatic cell. According to the method, an electrode for a prismatic cell is formed by depositing a positive electrode and a negative electrode both in the form of a sheet with an insulating porous plastic sheet sandwiched therebetween, winding the deposition around a planar plate core, and pulling the core out of the wound deposition. In place of the planar plate core, there may be employed a core having a circular cross-section or a core having an oval cross-section. Before the thus formed electrode is inserted into a prismatic cell case, the electrode or wound deposition is compressed in a diameter-wise direction to thereby cause the electrode to have an ellipse cross-section in conformity with a shape of the prismatic cell case, as having been suggested in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60501729 based on U.S. patent application Ser. No. 509133 filed on Jun. 29, 1983 which is further based on PCT/US84/00977., 92061=The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 9-107651 filed on Apr. 24, 1997 including specification, claims, drawings and summary is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.}",

While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the subject matter encompassed by way of the present invention is not to be limited to those specific embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended for the subject matter of the invention to include all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the following claims. The inventors had also checked a fraction defective for encasing a wound electrode sheet deposition into a cell case. The fraction defectives were 0% for both the wound electrode sheet depositions 10 fabricated in accordance with the first to third embodiments. whereas the fraction defective was 3% for the wound electrode sheet deposition fabricated in accordance with the reference sample. Thus, the first to third embodiments considerably improve a fraction defective for encasing a wound electrode sheet deposition into a cell case. The above-mentioned first to third embodiments provide an additional advantage that the wound electrode sheet deposition 10 can be more readily encased into a cell case than the wound electrode sheet deposition fabricated in accordance with the reference sample. This is because the porous plastic sheet 3 or the negative electrode sheet 1 at an",
