No. 08/153,713 filed Nov. 16, 1993 now abandoned which was a divisional of 07/942,868 filed Sep. 10, 1992 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,730., 35457=In the next step of the fabrication process, illustrated in FIG. 3b, a waveguide active layer 8 is grown upon the cladding layer 4, and simultaneously doped with a rare earth dopant. To this end the active layer material and dopant ions are co-deposited in the MBE process to the desired dopant concentration. Doping a fluoride crystal with a rare earth dopant by means of MBE has been disclosed in Bausa et al., \"Nd3+ Incorporation in CaF2 Layers Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy\", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 59, No. 2, Jul. 8, 1991, pages 152-154. In this reference, however, the crystal substrate was formed from a material that was identical to the material deposited by MBE, and there was no report of any refractive index differential that could have produced a waveguiding action. No upconversion fluorescence was reported, and the fluoride materials preferred in the present invention cannot be grown from the boron nitride crucibles used in the Bausa et al. reference because fluorides react with the boron nitride and release nitrogen, leading to very poor quality material. With the present invention, by contrast, the material used for the active layer 8 is deliberately selected to have a higher refractive index than the cladding layer 4. This is normally accomplished by selecting different materials for the active and cladding layers, although in some cases it may be possible to use the same material for both layers and achieve the necessary refractive index differential through the doping process., 41872=The MgF2 substrate oxide layer was removed by heating to 550\ufffd C. for 20 minutes. A 1 \u03bcm MgF2 buffer layer was grown with the substrate at 350\ufffd C. to improve surface quality for the final epitaxial layer, a common practice in MBE. A 1 \u03bcm ZnF2 :Er layer was grown using a ZnF2 and ErF3 source simultaneously with the substrate held at 300\ufffd C. by use of a quartz crystal oscillator; the Er doping was estimated to be approximately 20%. The growth conditions in general followed those set forth in a thesis by Lui, one of the present inventors, \"Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Magnetic Properties of Transition Metal Difluoride Films\", University of California at Santa Barbara, 1989, pages 18-45., 25838=An alternate to cryogenic operation is to offset the above loss by increasing the pump power density, and thereby compete directly with the losses by a more rapid pumping of the upper laser energy level. This has been achieved with single mode glass optical fibers that confine the energy of the pump source to a cylindrical region on the order of 5 microns in diameter. Because of the small fiber cross-section, the intensity of the pump beam within the fiber can be very high and thus avoid the need for cryogenic operation. An example of an upconversion device of this type is presented in Whitley et al., \"Upconversion Pumped Green Lasing in Erbium Doped Fluorozirconate Fibre\", Electronics Letters, Vol. 27, No. 20, Sep. 26, 1991, pages 1785-1786. Visible laser operation has been reported at room temperature using erbium, thulium, holmium and praseodymium as dopant ions in special single mode fibers fabricated from heavy metal fluoride glass. While theoretically it might also be possible to obtain room temperature upconversion with a crystal, presently available cutting and polishing techniques are not capable of producing crystals with faces than less than about 200 square microns, which is not small enough for the high pump beam intensities necessary for room temperature operation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention thus provides room temperature upconversion, without the limitations of the optical fiber upconversion devices discussed previously. While several illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, numerous variations and alternate embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the upconversion waveguide system can have various structures for the laser gain medium and its relation to the mirrors at either end. These include a planar waveguide, a channel waveguide, distributed feedback over the length of the channel, distributed Bragg reflectors at the channel ends, and cleaved mirrors which are particularly easy to implement for semiconductor substrates. Such variations and alternate embodiments are contemplated, and can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. An alternate arrangement is illustrated in FIG. 6, which eliminates the need for a coupling prism and is easier to miniaturize. An end firing solid state laser 32 projects an elliptical infrared radiation cone 34 into a focusing lens 36, which in turn concentrates the radiation onto the edge of the waveguide layer 8 on the substrate 28. The upconverted short wavelength radiation 38 emerges at the opposite end. When the upconversion device is not monolithically integrated with a pump laser diode, various schemes may be envisioned for coupling a pump beam into the active layer FIG. 5 illustrates one such arrangement. A coupling prism 24 is",
