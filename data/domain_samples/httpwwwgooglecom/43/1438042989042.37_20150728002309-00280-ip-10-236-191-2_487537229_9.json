There are numerous types of stitches that are well-known in the art and any one or combination of these can be used. For illustration purposes, FIGS. 12A-12C illustrate examples of other types of stitch patterns that can be used. It should be noted that although the present invention has been described with respect to an electronic enclosure, the present invention can be easily adapted for use in a shielded room, shielding cabinets, or in any other type of device requiring EMI and/or RF shielding. In addition, the present invention is not constrained for use with I/O connectors and can be used with any application that requires EMI shielding. The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the specific details are not required in order to practice the invention. In other instances, well known circuits and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessary distraction from the underlying invention. Thus, the foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, obviously many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above",
