For instance, see \"Near Field Optics: Microscopy, Spectroscopy, and Surface Modification Beyond the Diffraction Limit\", Betzig et al., Science, Vol. 257, 10 Jul. 1992, pages 189-195., 27027=Another group has attempted to improve the efficiency of a near field probe through the use of a transmission line, such a coaxial line or strip line, to collect and feed the incident energy to the limiting screen aperture. See: Fee et al., \"Scanning Electromagnetic Transmission Line Microscope with Sub-Wavelength Resolution\", Optics Communications, Vol. 69, No. 3.4, January 1989, pages 219-224. Fee et al. describe a microscope wherein an electromagnetic wave is funneled into an open-ended coaxial line. The center conductor of the coaxial line is configured as a scanning tip and is passed through a ground plane/aperture so as to create an emitting near-field probe.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. For instance, while the probe described above has been described in both illumination and collection configurations, it can be used simultaneously for both functions if the illumination and collection wavelengths are offset or are differently polarized. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the appended claims. Reflections of incident energy may occur from the antenna structure in the absence of a target and be detected by detector 41. To distinguish such reflections from energy reflected from a target, the target is scanned in the two planar dimensions and the reflection data from the antenna structure is subtracted as a background signal. This technique is needed when the observing wavelength is the same as the incident wavelength. If instead, the target emanates a different wavelength (i.e., fluoresces), a filter can be used to exclude the reflections due to the incident beam. Use of inductor 28 was shown to dramatically increase the transmission efficiency as measured in the microwave frequency region. Inductor 28 forms a resonant circuit with the gap capacitance, and this inductor-capacitor combination forms a resonant circuit at the frequency of the incident microwave beam. For optical frequencies, various approaches can",
