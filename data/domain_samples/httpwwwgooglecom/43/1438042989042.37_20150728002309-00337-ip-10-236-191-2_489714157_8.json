Endplate 2214 preferably includes a tab 2227 and a pair of spaced apart hook structures 2215 a,b. The space between hook structures 2215 a,b is preferably wider than the width of one of hook structures 2315 c,d of endplate 2314. Hook structures 2215 a,b are preferably shaped and dimensioned to hook over a top edge of any one of the cantilever arms of the invention. Alternatively, a single hook structure of sufficient size may be used instead of the pair. Tab 2227 can be used to attach endplate 2214 to reflector 1854 via, for example, set screws through screw holes 2229 a,b. Endplate 2214 also preferably includes a screw hole 2231 that can be used with a set screw to secure the position of lamp housing 1808 on, for example, arms 1804 a,b, after lamp housing 1808 has been mounted on the cantilever arms., 95229=FIG. 25 shows the luminaires 2400 a,b arranged side by side. Advantageously, offset hook structures 2215 a,b and 2315 c,d permit uptight lamp housings 2408 a,b to be in alignment with each other and allow arm 2404 a to be flush against arm 2404 b throughout substantially their entire lengths., 92415=Similarly, endplate 2314 preferably includes a tab 2327 and a pair of spaced apart hook structures 2315 c,d. The space between hook structures 2315 a,b is preferably wider than the width of one of hook structures 2215 a,b of endplate 2214. Hook structures 2315 c,d are also preferably shaped and dimensioned to hook over a top edge of any one of the cantilever arms of the invention. Alternatively, a single hook structure of sufficient size may be used instead of the pair. Tab 2327 can be used to attach endplate 2314 to reflector 1854 via, for example, set screws through screw holes 2329 a,b. Endplate 2314 also preferably includes a screw hole 2331 that can be used with a set screw to secure the position of lamp housing 1808 on, for example, arms 1804 a,b, after lamp housing 1808 has been mounted on the cantilever arms., 82985=Sideplate 1238 preferably has at least one hole 1648 through which electrical wiring can pass, or through which a nipple connector or other known fitting can be installed to permit electrical wiring to pass, for example, between adjacent wireway enclosures. Alternatively, a knockout can be used in place of hole 1648. Hole 1648 is preferably aligned with hole 430 in an adjacent arm 204 a,b. Installation of nipple connectors or other known fittings through adjacent pairs of holes 1648 and 430 preferably aligns adjacent enclosures., 94686=FIG. 24 shows a portion of two luminaires being arranged side by side in accordance with the invention.
