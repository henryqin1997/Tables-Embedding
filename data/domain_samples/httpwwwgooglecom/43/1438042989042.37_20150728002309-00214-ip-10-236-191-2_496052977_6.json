Thereafter, the manipulator is lowered, pivoted back into vertical position and raised into its nested or storage position in the manipulator carriage. The wellhead connector is then lowered onto the wellhead with the new Ax gasket in place. The cylindrical housing 160 is stored between the spaced support shafts 190 in the manipulator carriage E. When it is desired to remove and replace an Ax gasket, the wellhead connector is disconnected from the wellhead and lifted as substantial height above the wellhead to permit access by the manipulator beneath the downwardly facing well head connector. The hydraulic motor 199 is actuated to drive the support shafts 190 downwardly carrying the pivotally mounted manipulator therewith. When the manipulator has been extended a sufficient distance beneath the wellhead connector to permit retraction of the cylindrical housing from its vertical position, it is pivoted downwardly and outwardly by means of the hydraulic cylinder 178 and positioned with the cylindrical housing aligned in a vertical position beneath the downwardly facing opening 179 in the wellhead connector in which the Ax gasket is received. The motor 199 is then reversed and the support housing raised to move the cylindrical housing vertically upward into position in the downwardly facing wellhead connector opening and with it",
