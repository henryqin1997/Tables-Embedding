While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the subject matter encompassed by way of the present invention is not to be limited to those specific embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended for the subject matter of the invention to include all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the following claims. A multi-media data server program to be executed by a server computer for carrying out the above-mentioned procedure to operate the system for supplying multi-media data to users through a network may be stored in a recording medium readable by a computer, such as a floppy disc, a hard disc and a magnetic tape and the like. Then, in step 307, it is judged as to whether there is an upper grade object than the current object. If there is an upper grade object than the current object in step 307, the upper grade object is turned into a current object in step 308, and the step 304 is repeated again. If there is no upper grade object than the current object in step 307, that is, if there exists only an uppermost grade object, a partial",
