By placing member 18 on the inside surface of the glass panel, it does not interfere with movement of the windshield wiper. Further, the width of the member may be relatively narrow so as to minimize disruption of operator visibility. By utilizing the combination of a rigid member disposed along the vertical axis of the glass pane, and resiliently connecting the member to the inside surface of the glass panel, the glass is prevented from being excited to vibration amplitudes and frequencies, to ultimately prevent the glass from braking or shattering. The illustrated embodiment utilizes elastomeric adhesive member 24 to secure bar 18 to panel 16. Since the panel is affixed to the bar, vibration of the panel is prevented in both directions. If the elastomeric bumper alternative is employed, dampening will only be provided in one direction, i.e., towards the bumper; however, the glass will not be restrained from moving away from the bumper, which will render the glass subject to vibration in that direction. Further, instead of resiliently joining bar 18 to panel 16, adhesive member 24 may be replaced by one or more elastomeric bumpers affixed to bar 18 and bearing against the inside surface of the glass panel at one",
