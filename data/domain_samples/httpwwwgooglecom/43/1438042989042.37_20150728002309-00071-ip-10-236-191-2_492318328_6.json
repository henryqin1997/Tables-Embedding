    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45762=It has been observed that the Ag component carried on the porous inorganic oxide forms nearly circular aggregate upon the calcination in oxidative atmosphere. The average diameter, determined arithmetically, of the aggregate is 10-10000 nm, preferably 10-5000 nm, and more preferably 10-2000 nm. Generally the smaller the average diameter of the aggregate, the higher the activity of the Ag catalyst. However, when the average diameter is less than 10 nm, the reducing agent (hydrocarbons and/or oxygen-containing organic compounds) is likely to be predominantly oxidized, resulting in a decrease in the removal ratio of nitrogen oxides. On the other hand, when the average diameter is larger than 10000 nm, the catalytic activity of the Ag component becomes low, resulting in a low removal ratio of nitrogen oxides., 59542=The mixing ratio of the W catalyst and the Pt catalyst in the mixed catalyst is 2:1 to 100:1, preferably 5:1 to 90:1 by weight. When the ratio is less than 2:1 (excess of the Pt catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 100:1 (excess of the W catalyst), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide remain not oxidized., 41240=In the Ag catalyst made of two parts, the amount of the Ag component of the first Ag catalyst is 0.2-12 weight %, and preferably 0.5-10 weight %. When the amount is less than 0.2 weight %, the removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides is low. On the other hand, the amount exceeding 15 weight % also decreases the NOx removal ratio because the reducing agent such as hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds is likely to be predominantly burnt., 73350=A slurry containing 0.26 g of a mixed catalyst of the second Ag catalyst and the Pt catalyst (50:1 by weight), both prepared in Example 1, was coated on a honeycomb cordierite filter (diameter: 20 mm, length: 8.3 mm, 400 cells/in2) to prepare a second Ag/Pt cleaner part in the same manner as in the preparation of the first Ag cleaner part of Example 1., 61118=In the exhaust gas cleaner of the third aspect of the present invention, the weight ratio of the Ag catalyst and the Cu catalyst is 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 1:5 to 10:1. When the ratio is less than 1:10 (excess of the Cu catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 10:1 (excess of the Ag catalyst), the nitrogen-containing compound such as nitrous acid esters, ammonia, etc. generated on the Ag catalyst is not effectively reduced to nitrogen, or the aldehyde generated on the Ag catalyst is not effectively used to reduce NOx., 51058=The amount of the W component supported on a porous inorganic oxide is 0.5-30 weight %, and preferably 1-25 weight %., 62776=The weight ratio of the Ag catalyst and the mixed catalyst is 1:5 to 20:1, preferably 1:4 to 10:1. When the ratio is less than 1:5 (excess of the mixed catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 20:1 (excess of the Ag catalyst), the nitrogen-containing compound such as nitrous acid esters, ammonia, etc. generated on the Ag catalyst is emitted without reduced to nitrogen, or hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide remain not oxidized., 41711=The amount of the Ag component of the second Ag catalyst is 0.5-15 weight %, preferably 1-12 weight %, and should be larger than that of the first Ag catalyst. When the amount is less than 0.5 weight % or less than that of the first Ag catalyst, the reduction of NOx by the aldehyde generated on the first Ag catalyst does not proceed sufficiently. On the other hand, the amount exceeding 15 weight % also decreases the NOx removal ratio because the reducing agent such as hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds is likely to be predominantly burnt., 31623=Thus, in a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exhaust gas cleaner for removing nitrogen oxides by reduction, which is constituted by (1) a first Ag catalyst comprising a first porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-12 weight % of at least one Ag component selected from the group consisting of Ag and compounds of Ag; (2) a second Ag catalyst comprising a first porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.5-15 weight % of at least one Ag component selected from the group consisting of Ag and compounds of Ag, the amount of the Ag component carried on the second Ag catalyst being larger than that of the first Ag catalyst; and (3) a transition metal catalyst selected from the group consisting of a Pt catalyst, a W catalyst, a W+Pt catalyst and a mixed catalyst of the Pt catalyst and the W catalyst, the Pt catalyst comprising a second porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.01-5 weight % of at least one Pt component selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir and Au, the W catalyst comprising a third porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.5-30 weight % of at least one W component selected from the group consisting of oxides of W, V, Mo, Mn, Nb and Ta, and the W+Pt catalyst comprising a fourth porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.01-5 weight % of at least one Pt component and 0.2-10 weight % of at least one W component. The first Ag catalyst, second Ag catalyst and transition metal catalyst are disposed in this order from the inlet side to the out let side of an exhaust gas cleaner., 58164=In the exhaust gas cleaner of the first aspect of the present invention, the weight ratio of the first Ag catalyst to the second Ag catalyst is 1:10 to 20:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1, and more preferably 1:5 to 5:1. When the ratio is less than 1:10 (excess of the second Ag catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 20:1 (excess of the first Ag catalyst), the aldehyde generated on the first Ag catalyst is not effectively used for reducing NOx, or carbon monoxide and SOF remain not oxidized., 61801=The weight ratio of the Ag catalyst and the W+Pt catalyst is 1:5 to 20:1, preferably 1:4 to 10:1. When the ratio is less than 1:5 (excess of the W+Pt catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 20:1 (excess of the Ag catalyst), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and SOF remain not oxidized., 87083=A V/Pt cleaner part coated with 0.26 g of a mixed catalyst of the V catalyst of Example 11 and the Pt catalyst of Example 13 (20:1 by weight) was prepared in the same manner as in Example 9., 54929=The amount of the Cu component supported on a porous inorganic oxide is 0.2-30 weight %, preferably 0.5-25 weight %. When the Cu catalyst is mixed with the Ag catalyst, the amount is 0.5-30 weight %, preferably 0.5-25 weight %., 74197=A slurry containing 0.26 g of a mixed catalyst of the second Ag catalyst of Example 2 and the Pt catalyst of Example 1 (50:1 by weight) was coated on a honeycomb cordierite filter (diameter: 20 mm, length: 8.3 mm, 400 cells/in2) to prepare a second Ag/Pt cleaner part in the same manner as in the preparation of the first Ag cleaner part of Example 1., 40794=The amount of the Ag component supported on a porous inorganic oxide is 0.2-15 weight %, and preferably 0.5-12 weight %. When the amount is less than 0.2 weight %, the removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides is low. On the other hand, the amount exceeding 15 weight % also decreases the NOx removal ratio because the reducing agent such as hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds is likely to be predominantly burnt., 33163=In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exhaust gas cleaner for removing nitrogen oxides by reduction, which is constituted by (1) a first Ag catalyst comprising a first porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-12 weight % of at least one Ag component selected from the group consisting of Ag and compounds of Ag; and (2) a mixed catalyst of (a) the above second Ag catalyst and (b) the above Pt catalyst. The first Ag catalyst is disposed on the inlet side and the mixed catalyst on the outlet side of the exhaust gas cleaner., 63363=In the exhaust gas cleaner of the fifth aspect of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the Ag catalyst and the Cu catalyst is 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 1:5 to 10:1 by weight. When the ratio is less than 1:10 (excess of the Cu catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 10:1 (excess of the Ag catalyst), the nitrogen-containing compound such as nitrous acid esters, ammonia, etc. is not sufficiently reduced to nitrogen, or the aldehyde is not effectively used to reduce NOx., 60007=In the exhaust gas cleaner of the second aspect of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the second Ag catalyst and the Pt catalyst is 2:1 to 200:1, preferably 5:1 to 100:1. When the ratio is less than 2:1 (excess of the Pt catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 200:1 (excess of the second Ag catalyst), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide remain not oxidized., 63999=The weight ratio of the mixed catalyst and the Pt catalyst or W+Pt catalyst is 1:5 to 20:1, preferably 1:4 to 10:1. When the ratio is less than 1:5 (excess of the Pt catalyst or W+Pt catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 20:1 (excess of the mixed catalyst), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and SOF remain not oxidized., 87693=A W+V/Pt cleaner part coated with 0.26 g of a mixed catalyst of the W+V catalyst of Example 12 and the Pt catalyst of Example 13 (10:1 by weight) was prepared in the same manner as in Example 9., 58814=The weight ratio of the total amount of the first and second Ag catalysts to the transition metal catalyst (Pt catalyst, W catalyst, W+Pt catalyst and mixed catalyst) is 1:5 to 10:1, preferably 1:4 to 5:1. When the ratio is less than 1:5 (excess of the transition metal catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 10:1 (excess of the first and second Ag catalysts), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide remain not oxidized, or the nitrogen-containing compound such as nitrous acid esters, ammonia, etc. generated on the first Ag catalyst is not effectively used to reduce NOx., 60531=The weight ratio of the first Ag catalyst to the mixed catalyst of the second Ag catalyst and the Pt catalyst is 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 1:5 to 5:1. When the ratio is less than 1:10 (excess of the mixed catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C. On the other hand, when the ratio is higher than 10:1 (excess of the first Ag catalyst), the aldehyde generated on the first Ag catalyst is not effectively used to reduce NOx, or hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide remain not oxidized., 97083=A Cu/W+Pt cleaner part coated with a slurry containing 0.26 g of a mixed catalyst of the Cu catalyst and the W+Pt catalyst (40:1 by weight) was prepared in the same manner as in the preparation of the above Ag cleaner part., 35240=In a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exhaust gas cleaner for removing nitrogen oxides by reduction, which is constituted by (1) a mixed catalyst of (a) an Ag catalyst and (b) a Cu catalyst, the Ag catalyst comprising a first porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-15 weight % of at least one Ag component selected from the group consisting of Ag and compounds of Ag, and the Cu catalyst comprising a second porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.5-30 weight % of at least one Cu component selected from the group consisting of oxides and sulfates of Cu, and optionally 5 weight % or less of at least one component selected from the group consisting of alkali metal elements, rare earth elements and oxides thereof, or 30 weight % or less of at least one W component selected from the group consisting of oxides of W, V, Mo, Mn, Nb and Ta, and optionally (2) a Pt catalyst comprising a third porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.01-5 weight % of at least one Pt component selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir and Au, or a W+Pt catalyst comprising a fourth porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-10 weight % of at least one W component selected from the group consisting of oxides of W, V, Mo, Mn, Nb and Ta and the above Pt component. The mixed catalyst is disposed on the inlet side and the optional Pt or W+Pt catalyst on the outlet side of an exhaust gas cleaner., 100226=After immersing zeolite powder (SiO2 : Al2 O3 =27:1 (molar ratio)), the zeolite exchanged with copper ion was dried in air successively at 80\ufffd C., 100\ufffd C. and 120\ufffd C. each for 2 hours. The dried zeolite were then heated from 120\ufffd C. to 400\ufffd C. stepwise to prepare an Cu catalyst carrying 5.19 weight % of oxide of copper. An Ag/Cu cleaner part coated with a slurry of a mixed catalyst of 0.35 g of the Ag catalyst and 0.12 g of the Cu catalyst was prepared in the same manner as in Example 23., 55553=The total amount of the Cu component and the W component is 0.2-60 weight %, preferably 0.5-50 weight %., 33733=In a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exhaust gas cleaner for removing nitrogen oxides by reduction, which is constituted by (1) an Ag catalyst comprising a first porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-15 weight % of at least one Ag component selected from the group consisting of Ag and compounds of Ag, (2) a Cu catalyst comprising a second porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.2-30 weight % of at least one Cu component selected from the group consisting of oxides and sulfates of Cu, and optionally 30 weight % or less of at least one W component selected from the group consisting of oxides of W, V and Mo, and (3) a W+Pt catalyst comprising a third porous inorganic oxide supporting 0.01-5 weight % of at least one Pt component selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir and Au, and 0.2-10 weight % of at least one W component selected from the group consisting of oxides of W, V, Mo, Mn, Nb and Ta. The Ag catalyst, Cu catalyst and W+Pt catalyst are disposed in this order from the inlet side to the out let side of an exhaust gas., 62243=In the exhaust gas cleaner of the fourth aspect of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the Cu catalyst and the W+Pt catalyst is 100:50 to 100:1, preferably 100:30 to 100:1 by weight. When the ratio is less than 100:50 (excess of the W+Pt catalyst), a sufficiently high removal ratio of the nitrogen oxides cannot be achieved in a wide temperature range of 150\ufffd-650\ufffd C.
