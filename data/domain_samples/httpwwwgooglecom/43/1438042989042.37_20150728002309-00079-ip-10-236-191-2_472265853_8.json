No. 60/035,305 filed Jan. 11, 1997 by the same inventor entitled Method of Fabrication of a Chip Scale Package Using Jetting Technology., 52416=In the description that follows, like elements will be referred to by the same reference numeral. The invention herein is predicated on the concept of using Micro Jet Printing Technology (based upon ink jet printing), which has been modified in various ways to deposit solder and dielectric polymers in a highly controlled manner on a microscopic scale. Solder and dielectric materials can be applied by a printhead at a high rate of speed controlled by applied voltage pulses at a selected electrical frequency and delay time. This type of printhead is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,193,738, 5,229,016, 5,377,902 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/581,273, filed Dec. 29, 1995 (Printhead for Liquid Metals and Method of Use), and their entire disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference. These same devices can be employed to deposit flowable polymer materials which can be deposited as droplets from a heated printhead of the above references or in the manner of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,415,679 and 5,707,684 also incorporated by reference. Multiple solder jetting printheads can be arranged to deposit solder or organic dielectric materials as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,757 incorporated herein by reference., 73586=The highest resolution demonstrated for polymer dielectric is about 40 \u03bcm on 50 \u03bcm centers at a frequency greater than 2000 Hz. Polymer temperatures from room to 200\ufffd C. have been demonstrated from orifices ranging between about 25 \u03bcm to about 70 \u03bcm. The use of multiple jetting devices is particularly well suited to jet polymer layers and have been used. These examples are presented to provide some idea of the many variations that have been encountered in reducing the invention to practice, but not by way of limitation., 60509=FIGS. 1e and 2e show the resulting finished structure wherein the solder balls 9 constitute \"bumps\" which may be used in flip-chip fabrication to connect pads 2 to an array of electrical contacts on a substrate. Solder jetting means 14 is a printhead like that of jetting device 12. Operating parameters are mainly voltage and timing of the voltage pulses applied to a piezoelectric or electrostrictive device within the printheads 12, 14. A larger orifice diameter in jet 16 is known to produce a substantially larger droplet. Recently, ways to produce significantly larger droplets from the same orifice size in a similar printhead design has been demonstrated by manipulating the electrical input to the transducer of printhead 12, 14. This procedure is described in pending application Ser. No. 08/940,731, filed Sep. 30, 1997, entitled \"Extended Transition Time Waveform for Drop Size Modulation\". It has also been demonstrated that larger solder spheres can be produced by depositing multiple droplets at higher frequencies to a given location. In this way the droplets all hit the end of the column before freezing takes place thus producing a larger sphere.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been disclosed above with regard to a particular and preferred embodiment, which is advanced for illustrative purposes only, it is not intended to limit the scope of this invention. For instance, although the inventive method has been set forth in a prescribed sequence of steps, it is understood that the disclosed sequence of steps may be varied. It will be appreciated that various modifications, alternatives, variations, etc., may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. The highest resolution demonstrated for polymer dielectric is about 40 \u03bcm on 50 \u03bcm centers at a frequency greater than 2000 Hz. Polymer temperatures from room to 200\ufffd C. have been demonstrated from orifices ranging between about 25 \u03bcm to about 70 \u03bcm. The use of multiple jetting devices is particularly well suited to jet polymer layers and have been used. These examples are presented to provide some idea of the many variations that have been encountered in reducing the invention to practice, but not by way of limitation. Surprisingly, it was easier to build the solder columns than was expected. The highest resolution demonstrated for solder is represented by an example where 25 \u03bcm diameter columns were built on 50 \u03bcm centers to a height of more than 200 \u03bcm. Columns that were 50 \u03bcm on 200 \u03bcm centers have also been demonstrated. Typical size",
