Adder 426 then sums rounding constant K, correction factor CF, and the result (e.g., from product generator 416) to obtain the rounded result (step 1630). Finally, the rounded result is truncated to the rounding point N, where N\u22121 is the number of low-order ones in the rounding constant (step 1635). The rounded result can then be truncated by, for example, conveying only the desired bits to the general interconnect., 166276=Conventionally, symmetric rounding rounds numbers to the nearest integer (e.g., 2.5 rounds to 3, \u22122.5 rounds to \u22123, 1.5<=x<2.5 rounds to 2, and \u22121.5>=x>\u22122.5 rounds to \u22122). To accomplish this in binary arithmetic, one can add a correction factor of 0.1000 for positive numbers or 0.0111 for negative numbers and then truncate the resulting fraction. Changing the number of trailing zeroes in the correction factor for positive numbers or the number of trailing ones in the correction factor for negative numbers changes the rounding point. Slice 1500 is modified to automatically round a user-specified number of bits from both positive and negative numbers., 298654=CINSEL=11: Multiplexer 1925 decodes OpMode bits OM[6,5,4,1,0] to determine whether slice 1700 is rounding its own output OUT, as for an accumulate operation, or the output of an upstream slice, as for a cascade operation. Accumulate operations select the sign bit OUT[47] of the output of slice 1700, whereas cascade operations select the sign bit UOC[47] of upstream-output-cascade bus UOC. The select terminals of multiplexer 1925 decode the OpMode bits as follows: SELP47=(OM[1]&\u02dcOM[0 ])\u2225 OM[5] \u2225\u02dcOM[6] \u2225 OM[4], where \u201c&\u201d denote the AND function, \u201c\u2225\u201d the OR function, and \u201c\u02dc\u201d the NOT function., 122137=The first switch 632 and the second switch 634 in one embodiment include multiplexers having select lines connected to one or more registers. The registers' contents may be changed, if needed, on the order of magnitude of the input data rate (or output data rate). In another embodiment, the first switch 632 has one or more multiplexers whose select lines are connected to configuration memory cells and may only be changed by changing the contents of the configuration memory. A further explanation on reconfiguration is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,857, entitled \u201cReconfiguration of a Programmable Logic Device Using Internal Control\u201d by Brandon J. Blodget, et al, and filed Feb. 28, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference. Like in the previous embodiment, the second switch 634 has its select lines connected to a register (e.g., one or more flip-flops). In yet another embodiment, the first switch 632 and the second switch 634 select lines are connected to configuration memory cells. And in yet still another embodiment, the first switch 632 select lines are connected to a register and the second switch 634 select lines are connected to configuration memory cells., 54949=This patent application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the U.S. Provisional Application, Ser. No. 60/533,280, entitled \u201cProgrammable Logic Device with Cascading DSP Slices\u201d, by James M. Simkins, et al., filed Dec. 29, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/608,724, entitled \u201cApplications of Cascading DSP Slices\u201d, by James M. Simkins et al. filed Sep. 9, 2004., 303071=It is sometimes desirable to alter operands without interrupting signal processing. It may be beneficial, for example, to change the filter coefficients of a signal-processing configuration without having to halt processing. Storage elements 2000 and 2005 are therefore equipped, in some embodiments, with separate, dynamic enable inputs. One storage element, e.g., 2005, can therefore provide filter coefficients, via multiplexer 2010, while the other storage element, e.g., 2000, is updated with new coefficients. Multiplexer 2010 can then be switched between cycles to output the new coefficients. In an alternative embodiment, register 2000 is enabled to transfer data to adjacent register 2005. In other embodiments, the Q outputs of registers 2000 can be cascaded to the D inputs of registers 2000 in adjacent slices so that new filter coefficients can be shifted into registers 2000 while registers 2005 hold previous filter coefficients. The newly updated coefficients can then be applied by enabling registers 2005 to capture the new coefficients from corresponding registers 2000 on the next clock edge, 181437=Slice 1700 caries out multiply and add operations using a product generator 1727 and adder 1719, respectively, of an arithmetic circuit 1717. Multiplexing circuitry 1721 between product generator 1727 and adder 1719 allows slice 1700 to inject numerous addends into adder 1719 at the direction of a mode register 1723. These optional addends include operand C, the concatenation A:B of operands A and B, shifted and unshifted versions of the slice output OUT, shifted and unshifted versions of the upstream output cascade UOC, and the contents of a number of memory-cell arrays 1725. Some of the input buses to multiplexing circuitry 1721 carry less than 48 bits. These input busses are sign extended or zero filled as appropriate to 48 bits., 369228=Other decompositions for G are: G n\u22121:0 =G n\u22121:m +P n\u22121:m G m\u22121:0 G n\u22121:0 =D n\u22121:m K n\u22121:0 G n\u22121:0 =D n\u22121 :m [B n\u22121:i +G i\u22121:k +B k\u22121:m +G m\u22121:0] G n\u22121:0 =D n\u22121:m [B n\u22121:m +G m\u22121:k\u2032 +P m\u22121:i D i\u22121:j P j\u22121:k P j\u22121:k\u2032 G k\u2032\u22121:0], 57006=FPGA resources can be programmed to implement many digital signal-processing (DSP) functions, from simple multipliers to complex microprocessors. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,459, issued May 19, 1998, to Telikepalli, and incorporated by reference herein, teaches implementing a multiplier using general-purpose FPGA resources (e.g., CLBs and programmable interconnect). Unfortunately, DSP circuits may not make efficient use of FPGA resources, and may consequently consume more power and FPGA real estate than is desirable. For example, in the Virtex family of FPGAs available from Xilinx, Inc., implementing a 16\ufffd16 multiplier requires at least 60 CLBs and a good deal of valuable interconnect resources., 297516=CINSEL=00: Multiplexer 1915 provides carry-in input CI to adder 1719 via carry-in line CIN., 367974=In general, for a conventional fast carry look ahead adder the generate function is given by: G n\u22121:0 =G n\u22121:m +P n\u22121:m G m\u22121:0 where P n\u22121:m =p n\u22121 p n\u22122 . . . p m where p i =a i {circle around (+)}b i, 165351=Slice 1500 is similar to the preceding DSP slices, like-identified elements being the same or similar. Slice 1500 additionally includes a correction circuit 1510 having first and second input terminals connected to the respective sign bits of the first and second operand input ports A and B. Correction circuit 1510 additionally includes an output terminal connected to an input of adder 426. Correction circuit 1510 generates a one-bit correction factor CF based on the multiplier sign bit and the multiplicand sign bit. Adder 426 then adds the product from product generator 416 with an X-bit rounding constant in operand register 300 and correction factor CF to perform the round. The length X of the rounding constant in register 300 determines the rounding point, so the rounding point is easily altered dynamically., 379851=The Q signal is related to the P signal by the following equation: Q n\u22121:0 =P n\u22121:m \ufffdD m\u22121:0 e. where D can be expressed as: D n\u22121:0 =G n\u22121:m +P n\u22121:m D m\u22121:0 D n\u22121:0 =D n\u22121:m [B n\u22121:m +D m\u22121:0] f. Hence, for example: Q 2 =P n\u22121:i D i\u22121:k Q 1 =P k\u22121:m D m\u22121:k\u2032 Q 0 =P k\u2032\u22121:m\u2032 D m\u2032\u22121:0, 163187=Mode registers 310 store mode control signals that configure FPGA 1400 to operate as a cascaded, integrator-comb, decimation filter that operates on input data X(N), wherein N is e.g. four. Slices DSPS0 and DSPS1 of tile DSPT0 form a two-stage integrator. Slice DSPS0 accumulates the input data X(N) from register 300 in output register 1205 to produce output data Y0(N)[47:0], which is conveyed to multiplexer 424 of the downstream slice DSPS1. The downstream slice accumulates the accumulated results from upstream slice DSPS0 in corresponding output register 1205 to produce output data Y1(N)[47:0]. Data Y1(N)[35:0] is conveyed to the A and B inputs of slice DSPS0 of tile DSPT1 via the general interconnect., 365430=When subtracting, the 1-bit full adder 3610 implements the equation Zc+(X+Y) which produces S and C for subtraction by inverting Z, i.e., Zc. To produce the subtraction result the output of the CLA 3620 is inverted in XOR gate 3622 prior to being stored in register bank 1755., 183155=Product generator 1727 is conventional (e.g. an AND array followed by array reduction circuitry), and produces two 36-bit partial products PP1 and PP2 from an 18-bit multiplier and an 18-bit multiplicand (where one is a signed partial product and the other is an unsigned partial product). Each partial product is optionally stored for one clock cycle in a configurable pipeline register 1730, which includes a pair of 36-bit registers 1735 and respective programmable bypass multiplexers 1740. Multiplexers 1740 are controlled by configuration memory cells, but might also be dynamic., 183822=Adder 1719 has five input ports: three 48-bit addend ports from multiplexers X, Y, and Z in multiplexer circuitry 1721, a one-bit add/subtract line from a register 1741 connected to subtract port SUB, and a one-bit carry-in port CIN from carry-in logic 1750. Adder 1719 additionally includes a 48-bit sum port connected to output port OUT via a configurable output register 1755, including a 48-bit register 1760 and a configurable bypass multiplexer 1765., 379276=The K signal is related to the G signal by the following equation: K n\u22121:0 =B n\u22121:m +G m\u22121:0}",
