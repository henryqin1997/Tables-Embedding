No. 209,940 filed Nov. 2, 1980, a continuation of Ser. No. 1,038, now abandoned, and held with the present application by a common assignee, discloses a mechanical rotating apparatus adapted for rotating a beam of radiation about its propagation axis to effectively time average the azimuthal intensity distribution of the radiation incident on a workpiece. The beam undergoes multiple reflections within the apparatus such that the beam rotates at twice the rotation frequency of the apparatus. Displacing the beam exiting the rotating apparatus from the rotation axis effectively time averages the azimuthal and radial intensity distribution. This unit, however, does not adapt to moving the focussed spot and is limited to the frequencies reasonably attainable by mechanical rotation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and omissions in the form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Although the preferred embodiment utilizes a non-contacting electromagnetic means for inducing the compound beam to vibrate, it is to be recognized that contacting means may also be employed to induce the compound beam to vibrate such that at least the reflective undergoes vibratory motion suitable for sweeping the focus zone of the radiation across the interaction area of a workpiece. In operation, the oscillatory motion of the focus zone results in broadening of the interaction zone with a radiation-material interaction characteristic of a reduced incident average power intensity while maintaining a high local intensity incident on the workpiece which is essential to the establishment of effective radiation-material coupling of the incident radiation. The reduced effective intensity is capable of providing a broader weld zone thereby decreasing seam tracking requirements. Additionally the reduced effective intensity results in a reduced molten zone temperature with a corresponding reduction in weld defects and permits the welding operation to be conducted with a higher energy input per unit weld length resulting in a decrease in the weld cooling rate which is desirable for welding some alloy steels and permits the utilization",
