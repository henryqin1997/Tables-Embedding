The characteristics Of the thus obtained magnetic recording medium were measured. The coercive force was 1600 oersteds, the recording and reproduction output was 210 \u03bcV, and the noise was 3.7 \u03bcVrms. Although the coercive force was the same as that in the first embodiment, the recording and reproduction output, and the noise characteristic were inferior to those acquired in the first embodiment., 38095=Then, spin coating with a solution comprising a mixture of tetra ethoxy-silane (Si(OC2 H5)4) which is an organic silicon compound, minute silica particles which have a diameter of about 100 angstroms as measured using a particle distribution device Coulter counter N4 produced by Coulter Counter Co., Ltd., water, and isopropyl alcohol at a ratio of 10:0.3:3:500, is performed to form a thin film on the surface of the magnetic layer 4. The thin film, which is formed with the organic silicon compound solution that includes the minute silica particles, is heated at about 28\ufffd C. for two hours, and the protective layer 5 is fabricated in which the minute silica particles 5b are dispersed in the silicon oxide (polysilicate). In this layer, the thickness of a portion where no silica particles 6a are present is approximately 100 angstroms., 44993=A magnetic recording medium according to a third embodiment is the same as that in the second embodiment, except in that the second under layer 3 (a single-layer structure of Cr film of 2000 angstroms) used in the second embodiment is formed of a double layers of Cr film of 1000 angstroms., 35865=The second under layer 3 is Cr film having a thickness of approximately 2000 angstroms., 42031=As an additional comparison, a magnetic recording medium for a second comparison example was fabricated by the same manufacturing method, and had the same structure as that of the first embodiment, including the first under layer. The characteristics of the thus obtained magnetic recording medium were measured by the same measurement methods that were used for the first embodiment. The coercive force was 1300 oersteds, the recording and reproduction output was 190 \u03bcV, and the noise was 2.1 \u03bcVrms. Although the noise characteristic is the same as that in the first embodiment, the coercive force and the recording and reproduction output were inferior to those acquired in the first embodiment., 36770=A lubricating agent (e.g., AM2001 produced by Montedison, Co., Ltd.), that consists of perfluoropolyether, is coated on the protective layer 5 by immersion to form the lubricant layer 6 having a thickness of about 20 angstroms., 45542=The characteristics of the magnetic recording medium in the second embodiment with the intermediate layer 7 were measured by using the same measurement methods that were used for the first embodiment, and excellent results were obtained. The coercive force was 1700 oersteds, and the maximum recording density was 90 Kfci with D50. As for the CSS characteristics, the coefficient of static friction was 0.4 or lower, and the results acquired by conducting the glide test were the same as those for the first embodiment. As for the magnetic recording medium in the third embodiment, the coercive force was 1750 oersteds, and excellent magnetic characteristics were obtained; the reproduction output was 250 \u03bcV; and the medium noise was 2.2 \u03bcVrms, and the acquired maximum recording density and the CSS characteristics were the same as those obtained for the first and the second embodiments., 38989=A lubricating agent consisting of perfluoropolyether (e.g., AM 2001 produced by Montedison, Co., Ltd.) is coated on the protective layer 5, by immersion, to form the lubricant layer 6 which has a thickness of about 20 angstroms. Then, protrusions are removed from the surface by using a vanishing head, and finally a magnetic recording medium according to this embodiment is acquired., 34564=In a treatment tank containing Na ions and/or K ions, ion exchange was conducted on chemically reinforced glass, which contained, as its primary elements, SiO2 , at 62 to 75 weight %, Al2 O3 at 5 to 15 weight %, Li2 at 4 to 10%, Na2 O at 4 to 12%, and ZrO2 at 5.5 to 15%; and which had a weight ratio Na2 /ZrO2 of 0.5 to 2.0 and a weight ratio Al2 O3 /ZrO2 of 0.4 to 2.5. The resultant glass was chemically reinforced (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 5-32431 for the details to provide the chemically reinforced glass on which the glass substrate 1 was formed., 41323=As a comparison with the first embodiment, a magnetic recording medium for a first comparison example was fabricated by the same manufacturing method, and except for the first under layer 2 not being formed, had the same structure as that of the first embodiment. The characteristics of the thus obtained magnetic recording medium were measured by the same measurement methods that were used for the first embodiment. The coercive force was 1400 oersteds, the recording and reproduction output was 200 \u03bcV, and the noise was 4.0 \u03bcVrms, all of which were inferior to those acquired in the first embodiment., 40111=When the coercive force of the magnetic recording medium was measured, it was 1600 oersteds, which is excellent., 20736=This application claims the priority rights granted under 35 U.S.C 119 to Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 07-105089, filed Apr. 28, 1995, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 37697=Following this, on the first under layer 2, the second under layer 3 is formed by sputtering a Cr film having a thickness of approximately 2000 angstroms using a Cr target and an Ar gas., 47618=And then, for the third comparison, five different magnetic recording media were fabricated as comparison examples in the same manner, except that while the intermediate layers 7 were formed, the first under layers 2 were not formed. As for the magnetic recording mediums for the third comparison, the coercive force was 1450 oersteds, the reproduction output was 200 \u03bcV, and the noise was 3.9 \u03bcVrms., 35972=The magnetic layer 4 is CoNiCr film having a thickness of approximately 500 angstroms. The CoNiCr film has a constituent composition ratio of Co:Ni:Cr=65:25:10.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the above embodiments, the under layer includes the first under layer 2 that is formed on and in contact with the glass substrate 1, and the second under layer 3 that is formed on the first under layer 2, by using a material that is different from that of the first under layer 2 and that is thicker than the first under layer 2. Properties of the material for the first under layer 2 are that it supports the crystalline growth of the second under layer 3, which is deposited on the first under layer 2, in order to promote the crystalline growth of the magnetic layer 4, which is deposited on the second under layer 3, and that it reduces the internal stress due to thermal expansion between the second under layer 3 and the glass substrate 1. Since the first under layer 2 is formed of such a material, the crystalline growth of each layer can preferably be performed when the second under layer 3 and the magnetic layer 4 are formed, and thermal treatment can be satisfactory conducted for the protective layer 5, which is formed on the magnetic layer 4, to provide a desirable film quality. At the same time, the second under layer 3, the overlying magnetic layer 4, and the protective layer 5 are prevented from being affected by the internal stress that is caused by thermal expansion between",
