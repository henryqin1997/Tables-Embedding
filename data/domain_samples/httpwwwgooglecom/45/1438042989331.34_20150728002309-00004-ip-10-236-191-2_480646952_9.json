Where the composition of a group remains static for a substantial period, then the processes for detecting group members can be simplified and can, for example, simply note joiners to a particular group rather than having to add and remove persons on an on-going basis. Examples of application of the embodiments of the invention to such static groups include the following situations: Further examples include having a presence zone at a fixed location such as a busy street corner and the display",
