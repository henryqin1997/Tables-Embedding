The claims herein are directed to the apparatus., 21322=This fixture should be so constructed as not to mar the article when it is set into sympathetic vibration with the compound. The fixture should preferably be constructed and arranged to allow the article sufficient freedom of movement to vibrate with as little damping as possible. The oscillator may be automatically started when the cover is closed. When the time interval has elapsed which is necessary to completely impregnate the article, the oscillator stops, and the operator of the machines raises the hinged lid, removes the article, and repeats the same cycle. Several of these machines may be operated by one man, depending upon the length of time necessary for complete impregnation. I have found that it takes only from thirty seconds to two minutes, according to the type of article., 7489=Nov. 3, 1953 MA|ER 2,657,668, 7538=APPARATUS FOR IMPREIGNATINGl AND COATING POROUS BODIES Filed June 4, 1948 ne. 5. a, 7641=Patented Nov. 3, 1953 APPARATUS FOR IMPREGNATING AND COATING POROUS BODIES Herbert N.
