(5) The rib design can flex to accommodate the irregularities of produce size or shape when packaged. This is important to fruit inside the package, and even more important to reduce cutting and bruising of produce in other packages as the trays are stacked in display case of the supermarket. (4) A configuration without sharp edges on the bottom of the tray, inside and outside, so that packages cannot bruise or cut the contained produce, or the neighboring packages, even when stacked. (3) A rib configuration that is strong enough to resist store and consumer handling, yet flexible enough to yield and accommodate to the contours of the produce packaged, thereby further reducing bruising. There is sufficient tray strength to resist the pressures of wrapping and handling. (2) A rib configuration with broad support areas and no sharp edges, thereby holding produce without cutting and bruising which could reduce product quality. (1) A line of produce trays that give product visibility top and bottom--enough visibility to fairly represent the product in a way that allows consumers to make product quality judgment. The rib design gives",
