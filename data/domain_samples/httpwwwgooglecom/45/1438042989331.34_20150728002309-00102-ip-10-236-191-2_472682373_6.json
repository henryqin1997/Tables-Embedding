It will further be understood that various other types of fasteners, other than adhesives, nails, staples or the like, may be used as fasteners for fastening the relatively flexible attachment members to a building wall. It will further be understood that the relatively flexible attachment members may be separate members as in the case of embodiments of FIGS. 4 and 5, or may be made integral therewith, as in the case of the embodiment of FIGS. 2-3 and 6. Where the flexible members are made integral with the rigid panel members, such may be done by various techniques, such as gluing, melting together, sonic welding, heat fusion, co-extrusion, etc., or by any other means, even mechanical fastening means, such as stapling the relatively flexible member to the relatively rigid member (not shown). It will further be understood that the materials of construction of the relatively flexible members may be varied, to include rubber-like materials, fabrics, relatively flexible sheet materials, or the like, and that such may",
