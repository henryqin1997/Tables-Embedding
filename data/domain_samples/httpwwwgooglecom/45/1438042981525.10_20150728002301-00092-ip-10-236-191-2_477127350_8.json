    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations This method is thus certainly compatible with operation in the TDMA or FH mode and it may be applied to whatever modulation presenting intersymbol interference. The results of the simulation show that this method shows good resistance to noise and to an even considerable frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver. The method according to the invention has enabled to use an algorithm for coherent demodulation of the digital GMSK modulation. The results are slightly sensitive to the frequency offset as long as \u0394f0 <1000 Hz. Beyond that value, the results are slightly degraded. At an error rate of 10-2 there is a degradation of 1.2 dB for N=32 bits and 1.4 dB for N=16 bits relative to the theoretical error rate of which the curves A and B (already represented in FIG. 7) are also shown in the said Figures. For \u0394f0 =800 Hz the results are rather good. For the GMSK modulation the error rate curves obtained with the demodulation method according to the invention are represented in the FIGS. 8, 9 for the preamble sequences of 32 and 16 bits respectively, and with the frequency offsets \u0394f0 =800 Hz (curves 1) and \u0394f0 =1600 Hz (curves 2). When the error rate is 10-2, the degradation relative to the theoretical error rate is considerable (approximately 7 dB). Curve 3 corresponds with the result obtained with an analog differential demodulator. This type of demodulation",
