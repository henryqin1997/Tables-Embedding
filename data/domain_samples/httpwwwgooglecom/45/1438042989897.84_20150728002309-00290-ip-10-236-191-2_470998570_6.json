The present invention could be used in the other animals in a manner similar to that previously described for dolls in FIGS. 1 to 10. Turning to FIG. 10, shown therein is an exterior view of the present invention 10, showing the doll fully inflated in the toddler stage. Turning to FIG. 9, shown therein is an exterior view of the present invention 10, showing the doll uninflated in the infant stage. Turning to FIG. 8, shown therein is a section view of the expandable bellows 26 within the flexible skin cover 32 of the present invention 10, showing the bellows in both expanded and unexpanded condition. Turning to FIG. 7, shown therein is a view of the present invention 10, showing a the doll fully inflated by arrows 28 in the toddler stage wherein the arms, legs and head are larger and extended.
