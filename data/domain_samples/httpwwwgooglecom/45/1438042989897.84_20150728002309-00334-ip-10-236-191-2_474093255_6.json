For example, in the previously described embodiments, a high-frequency current is used to excise biotissue. However, the biotissue excising instrument according to the present invention is not limited to electric excision. It is also applicable to various excision forms such as thermal and mechanical excisions. . FIGS. 25D and 25E . Then, in this state, the sheath 2 is retreated at the side of the polyp A. Then, the loop portion 22 can be caught on the polyp A as shown in FIGS. 25B and 25C , the leading end of the sheath 2 is placed at the side of and behind the polyp A. In this state, the loop portion 22 is projected out of the side slit 2 a. The loop portion 22 is also twisted to the degree that its opening surface 24 is not completely closed, so as to place the opening surface 24 behind and opposite the polyp A. This state is shown in FIG. 25A show a method of catching the loop portion 22 on the polyp A from its rear to tightly bind it. Specifically, first, as shown in FIGS. 25A to 25E On the",
