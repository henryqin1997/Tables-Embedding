In the third embodiment the memory transistor 1 control gate potential VG is increased by step voltage \u0394V stepwise and the memory transistor 1 drain current ID is detected and when VG attains a reference potential and drain current ID also attains a reference current, drain current ID is responsively interrupted. A smaller peak value of drain current ID and a smaller current consumption can be achieved than when a fixed potential is applied to memory transistor 1 at a control gate, as conventional. Furthermore, memory transistor 1 can be prevented from having threshold voltage VT excessively increased. A reduced variation in threshold voltage VT can thus be achieved. When level shifter 56 outputs potential VPW having a level set higher by step voltage \u0394V, the memory transistor 1 drain current ID again increases. Thereafter, this cycle is repeated. When the counter 50 count value C attains reference count value CR (or at time t1) comparator 57 outputs signal \u03c657 pulled from high to low and p channel MOS transistor 52 does not conduct and the write ends.",
