Therefore the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. It is also contemplated that it may be desirable to dye articles made from compositions containing the present polyesteramide in order to increase visibility of the article in the surgical field. Dyes, such as those known to be suitable for incorporation in sutures, can be used. Such dyes include but are not limited to carbon black, bone black, D&C Green No. 6, and D&C Violet No. 2 as described in the handbook of U.S. Colorants for Food, Drugs and Cosmetics by Daniel M. Marrion (1979). Preferably, articles in accordance with this disclosure are dyed by adding up to about a few percent and preferably about 0.2% dye to the resin prior to extrusion. It is further contemplated that one or more medico-surgically useful substances can be incorporated into compositions containing the polyesteramide herein. Examples of such medico-surgically useful substances include, for example, those which accelerate or beneficially modify the healing process when particles are applied to a surgical repair site. So, for example, articles made from compositions containing the present polyesteramide can carry a therapeutic agent which will be deposited at the repair site. The",
