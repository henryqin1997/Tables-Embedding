For example, five logic circuit IC chips are mounted in the above embodiments, but any number of such IC chips can be used. It is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. In the second embodiment, the clock phase of the external terminal 39 is not set at the true central value for the observation terminals 34A to 34E, and the clock skew is a little larger than for the first embodiment. However, since the clock signals at the logic circuit IC chips 32A to 32E are output as they are to the external terminal 39, the clock signal can be adjusted taking change in clock skew due to temperature fluctuation into account. In the first embodiment, on the other hand, temperature fluctuation will cause a larger error since the clock skew differently changes for the logic circuit IC chips 12A to 12E and the propagation time adjustment means 18. After the clock phase at the external terminal 39 is determined, as in the first embodiment, the rise point (\u03b3) of the clock signal at the external terminal 39 (closest to the central value (\u03b2)) has to be made identical to the rise point (\u03b1) of the clock signal at",
