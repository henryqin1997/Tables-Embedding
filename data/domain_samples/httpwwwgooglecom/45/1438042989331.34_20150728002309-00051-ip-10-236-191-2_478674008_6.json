Further, the barrier layer 24 can improve the adhesion between the substrate and the subsequent conductive layer. The barrier layer 24 is composed of titanium, nickel or chromium. Preferably, the thickness of the barrier layer is less than 1000 angstroms and is deposited using physical vapor deposition. Successively, a conductive layer 26 is deposited on the barrier layer 24 to serve as planar coils for the present invention. Typically, the conductive layer 26 is selected from the group of copper, aluminum, silver, nickel, gold, tungsten or alloy. In a preferred embodiment, copper is used to serve as the conductive layer 26 and formed using physical vapor deposition. The thickness of the conductive layer 26 is less thiner than the thickness of the stencil layer 22. In a preferred embodiment, the copper layer 26 is formed to have a thickness about 1000 angstroms. It is appricated that any suitable method can be used for forming the conductive layer 26. It can provide conformal coverage of the substrate 20., 18849=One of the prior arts for fabricating the coils is described accompany with related drawings as follows (See \"A NEW FABRICATION PROCESS OF A PLANAR COIL USING PHOTOSENSITIVE POLYIMIDE AND ELECTROPLATING\", Y. Watanabe; The Bin International Conference on Solid State Sensors and Actuators and Eurosensors IX Stocknolm. Sweden, Jun. 25-29, 1995). Turning to FIG. 1, a ZnCu alloy substrate 2 is provided. Polyimide layer 4a, 4b are respectively coated on both sides of the substrate 2. Platinum particles 6 are formed on the surface of the top polyimide layer 4a to act as nuclei for the electroless plating. Turning to FIG. 2, a photosensitive polyimide layer 8 is then patterned on the platinum particles 6 using lithography technology. The polyimide layer 8 is cured after exposure and development process. The curing is accomplished by two steps at temperatures 140 and 350\ufffd C., respectively.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. As is understood by a person skilled in the art, the foregoing preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrative of the invention herein disclosed, and not limitative of its scope. It is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, the scope of which should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structure. The present invention uses a transparency material as the substrate 20. An exposure is performed to expose the negative photoresist from the bottom of the substrate 20 by using the layers 24, 26 as a mask, which can save a photomask for the exposure. As shown in FIG. 11, a conductive layer 34 is formed in the trenches 32 by electroplating for using as the coils. The conductive layer is selected from the group of copper, silver, gold, or nickel. Preferably, the conductive layer 34 is composed of copper. Typically, the electroplating needs external power source. The plating rate and the grain size can be controlled exactly. Alternatively, the copper layer 34 can be electroplated from a CuSO4 /H2 SO4 bath at room temperature. Electroplating allows for controlled thickness for the copper",
