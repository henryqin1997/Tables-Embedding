No. 6,119,953 which patent which application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/171,518 filed on Oct. 20, 1998 is incorporated herein by reference and to which application is claimed priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120. Further, this application incorporates by reference and claims priority to PCT/ES97/00034 filed Feb. 18, 1997 and published as WO 97/43048 published Nov. 20, 1997 under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd365, said PCT application being the international version of Spanish Application No. P9601101, filed May 13, 1996 to which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd\ufffd119 and 365. Still further this application claims priority to Spanish Application No. P9702654 filed Dec. 17, 1997 under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119., 92575=Each individual atomization device should consist of a feeding point (a capillary needle, a point with an open microchannel, a microprotuberance on a continuous edge, etc.) 0.002-2 mm (but, preferentially 0.01-0.4 mm) in diameter, where the drop emerging from the microjet can be anchored, and a small orifice 0.002-2 mm (preferentially 0.01-0.25 mm) in diameter facing the drop and separated 0.01-2 mm (preferentially 0.2-0.5 mm) from the feeding point. The orifice communicates the withdrawal gas around the drop, at an increased pressure, with the zone where the atomizate is produced, at a decreased pressure. The atomizer can be made from a variety of materials (metal, polymers, ceramics, glass)., 93297=FIGS. 1A and 1B depicts a tested prototype where the liquid to be atomized is inserted through one end of the system 2 and the propelling gas in introduced via the special inlet 4 in the pressure chamber 3. The prototype was tested at gas feeding rates from 100 to 2000 mBar above the atmospheric pressure P\u03b1 at which the atomized liquid was discharged. The whole enclosure around the feeding needle 1 was at a pressure P0>P\u03b1. The liquid feeding pressure, P1, should always be slightly higher than the gas propelling pressure, Po. Depending on the pressure drop in the needle and the liquid feeding system, the pressure difference (P1\u2212P0>0) and the flow-rate of the liquid to be atomized, Q, are linearly related provided the flow is laminar\u2014which is indeed the case with this prototype. The critical dimensions are the distance from the needle to the plate (H), the needle diameter (D0), the diameter of the orifice through which the microjet 6 is discharged (d0) and the axial length, e, of the orifice (i.e. the thickness of the plate where the orifice is made). In this prototype, H was varied from 0.3 to 0.7 mm on constancy of the distances (D0=0.45 mm, d0\u22120.2 mm) and e\u22120.5 mm. The quality of the resulting spray 7 did not vary appreciably with changes in H provided the operating regime (i.e. stationary drop and microjet) was maintained. However, the system stability suffered at the longer H distances (about 0.7 mm). The other atomizer dimensions had no effect on the spray or the prototype functioning provided the zone around the needle (its diameter) was large enough relative to the feeding needle. As explained further below it is possible to obtain a stable capillary microjet which does not disassociate into a monodisperse aerosol. However, by adjusting parameters which relate to the Weber number a stable microjet is formed which disassociates to monodisperse aerosol., 152882=Molecular assembly presents a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to the fabrication of objects specified with incredible precision. Molecular assembly includes construction of objects using tiny assembly components, which can be arranged using techniques such as microscopy, e.g. scanning electron microspray. Molecular self-assembly is a related strategy in chemical synthesis, with the potential of generating nonbiological structures with dimensions as small as 1 to 100 nanometers, and having molecular weights of 104 to 1010 daltons. Microelectro-deposition and microetching can also be used in microfabrication of objects having distinct, patterned surfaces., 154142=More fish die from a lack of oxygen than any other cause. Fish exposed to low oxygen conditions become much more vulnerable to disease, parasites and infection, since low oxygen levels will (1) lower the oxidation/reduction potential (ORP) (2) favor growth of disease causing pathogens and (3) disrupt the function of many commercially available biofilters. Moreover, stress will reduce the fish activity level, growth rate, and may interfere with proper development. A continuous healthy minimum of oxygen is approximately a 6 parts per million (ppm) oxygen:water ratio, which is approximately 24 grams of dissolved oxygen per 1000 gallons of water. Fish consume on average 18 grams of oxygen per hour for every ten pounds of fish. Low level stress and poor feeding response can be seen at oxygen levels of 4-5 ppm. Acute stress, no feeding and inactivity can be seen at oxygen levels of 2-4 ppm, and oxygen levels of approximately 1-2 ppm generally result in death. These numbers are merely a guideline since a number of variable (e.g., water temperature, water quality, condition of fish, level of other gasses, etc.) all may impact on actual oxygen needs., 147285=In addition to analysis of any compound dissolved or suspended in a solvent the methodology can be used to analyze materials such as body fluids e.g. blood or urine. The methodology can be adapted to work in a wide range of different systems, e.g. see U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,022 issued Jun. 30, 1992 and patents and publications cited therein. The present invention does not need to use electrical fields to move charged molecules as is required by many other systems. Thus, non-polar molecules can be moved, via the present invention, through the capillary microjet. Because of the manner in which the stable capillary microjet is formed and maintained materials such as large proteins, nucleotide sequences, cells, and other biomaterials are not destroyed by physical stresses.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective, spirit and scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto. 350 measured values of dj/do versus Q/Qo are plotted in FIG. 5. A continuous line represents the theoretical prediction (7), independent of liquid viscosity and surface tension. The use of different hole and tube diameters as well as tube-hole distances does not have any appreciable influence on dj. The collapse of the experimental data and the agreement with the simple theoretical model is excellent. Finally, the experimental values of Q are at least four times large than Qo (being in most cases several hundreds times larger), which justifies the neglect of the surface tension term in Eq. (4). Notice that if the measured dj follows expression (5), the surface tension cancels out in (7). Also notice that dj/do\u2245We/2. which allows for a check for the validity of neglecting the surface tension term in (4) (i.e., Q/Qo should be large). \ufffd\u2003\u2003(7) o)",
