This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. For example, the personal computer can be configured to recognize the same incoming page signals as a hand-held pager. The personal computer could then maintain a master record of received pages. This is particularly useful when the hand held pager is located in a geographic location which prohibits accurate receipt of paging signals. Thus, the hand-held paging device can be synchronized with the personal computer periodically such that any missed messages are detected by the personal computer and brought to the user's attention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. A paging system has been described which uses a stationary personal computer to receive paging signals. The personal computer executes an instruction set, or software, which allows the personal computer to forward or process received page signals. By using a stationary personal computer, received page signals can be used to control the personal computer to contact external devices such as, but not limited to: other personal computers, telephones, fax machines, Internet locations, pagers, and household devices. The personal computer can store",
