    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27754=U.S. Pat. No. 4,121,750 to Schoer et al., dated Oct. 24, 1978, discloses processes and compositions for soldering aluminum containing workpieces. The soldering is carried out in a substantially- non-oxidizing atmosphere. The solder may be used with or without flux, and a filler material comprising an aluminum containing from 6 to 20% by weight of silicon and from 0.01 to 10% by weight of an aluminum wetting agent selected from the group consisting of bismuth, antimony, strontium and barium is interposed between the workpieces to be joined., 28645=U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,493 to Christoph et al., dated Aug. 19, 1986, discloses a method of preventing oxidation of printed circuit board metal surfaces while reducing thermal stress of the board and components during soldering. Soldering is carried out in a reaction chamber which is pressurized with inert gas which seals the reaction chamber from ambient air., 41243=Circuit boards comprising epoxy-glass laminate material were initially electroplated with a 60:40 tin lead solder on top of copper circuitry. The boards were coated with RMA flux and heated in an oven to a maximum temperature between 220\ufffd C. and 240\ufffd C. The total time for heating and cooling of the boards was about 5 minutes. The atmosphere comprised dry nitrogen (typically containing less than 10 ppm oxygen) with controlled additions of oxygen. Additions of water vapor and hydrogen were made to the atmosphere used in specific experiments to determine whether the presence of these common gas additives would help prevent dewetting of the solder from the substrate surface. After reflow, the flux was cleaned off the surface of the boards using Freon TMS+, a product of DuPont Company which comprises a blend of freon 113, methanol and stabilizers. The reflowed circuit boards were examined visually for dewetting, discoloration and white haze after cleaning. The results are summarized in TABLE 1, below., 23749=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/251,259, filed Sept. 30, 1988, and now abandoned., 26968=U.S. Pat. No. 3,882,596, to Kendziora et al., dated May 13, 1975, discloses a method for flux free soldering of aluminum containing workpieces in a controlled atmosphere. The controlled atmosphere is free of contaminants such as ceramic materials, asbestos, grease, oil, rubber or plastic materials and is preferably of low oxygen content. Liquid purified nitrogen which has been vaporized is recommended as the controlled atmosphere., 28319=U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,757 to Bertiger, dated Sept. 3, 1985 describes a method of wave soldering in an enclosure which is substantially free of oxygen. A gaseous reducing agent such as hydrogen is added to the oxygen-free atmosphere in the enclosure to provide a fluxing action during the soldering operation., 27422=U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,151, to Schoer et al., dated Aug. 19, 1975, discloses a method for flux free soldering of aluminum-containing workpieces in a non-oxidizing atmosphere or a low-oxygen content atmosphere, wherein aluminum and beryllium wetting agents are added to the solder. The solder is a zinc based solder., 29023=In addition, U.K. Patent No. GB 2171042, to Kamijo et al., dated July 1, 1987, discloses an apparatus for wire bonding semiconductor chip connections. The apparatus uses an electric discharge to melt a fine metal wire into a ball shape; the ball of metal is subsequently pressed into the connections area, wherein the metal flows under pressure to form a bond. It is desired to have the metal which is pressed into the connections area be substantially free of oxides and impurities. This is accomplished using one of two methods: 1) When a fine wire of pure silver is used, the oxygen content of the atmosphere surrounding the electric discharge area in which the metal ball is formed is maintained at no more than 100 ppm. or, 2) When the metal wire is not a pure metal but has selected metal impurities added to it to increase the wire tensile strength, the oxygen content of the atmosphere surrounding the electric discharge area is maintained at 100 ppm to 300 ppm. In this second method, the metal impurities are deposited as oxides on the surface of the molten metal ball, so that when the ball is pressed into the connections area, the pure metal inside the ball forms a better bond in the contacting area., 47108=Circuit boards comprising epoxy-glass laminate material having through hole components and 120 potential locations for bridge formation per board were soldered in an Electrovert Econpak conveyorized soldering machine (of the type available from Electrovert Ltd., Montreal Canada). An RMA flux was used. The boards were preheated to about 100\ufffd C. The solder wave temperature was about 250\ufffd C. The solder alloy was 62:36:2 by weight ratio of tin:lead:antimony. The results for bridging rate and dross production are summarized in TABLE 2 below.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above disclosure illustrates typical embodiments which demonstrate the method of the present invention. The best mode of the invention as presently contemplated is disclosed. However, one skilled in the art will recognize the broad range of applicability of the generic concept of the invention. It is intended that variations on the disclosed embodiment which fall within the spirit and scope of the invention be included as part of the invention, as expressed in the appended claims. Examples of additional metal application processes which would benefit from use of a processing atmosphere of controlled oxidation capability include hot air leveling, which is used to coat circuit boards with solder, zinc galvanizing, and tin coating of steel. As previously discussed, the most preferred inert gas for use in combination with oxygen at the specified concentrations is nitrogen due to its cost and non toxicity. Cryogenic nitrogen, supplied via vaporization of liquid nitrogen, typically has an oxygen concentration of less than 10 ppm oxygen. Other forms of nitrogen which are commercially available include pressure swing absorption generated nitrogen and membrane generated nitrogen. The oxygen contents of these forms of nitrogen range from about 1,000 to about 50,000 ppm oxygen. These latter two sources of nitrogen can be much less expensive than cryogenic nitrogen. If the available nitrogen source does not provide the desired oxygen concentration, it can be adjusted in a manner which will provide the desired oxygen",
