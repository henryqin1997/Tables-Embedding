Based on their known and suspected contributions to human disease, both CSF1R and CSF1 have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for osteolytic bone loss and cancer. Indeed, CSF1R and CSF1 antagonists such as antibodies directed against CSF1R or CSF1 (see e.g., WO 2007/081879), antisense- and siRNA-mediated silencing of CSF1R or CSF1 expression (see e.g., WO 2007/081879), soluble forms of the CSF1R (see e.g., WO 2007/081879), and small molecule inhibitors of CSF1R tyrosine kinase activity (see e.g., Ohno et al., Molecular Cancer Therapy 5(11): 2634-2643 (2006); Murray et al., Clinical & Experimental Metastasis 20:757-766 (2003); and Conway et al., PNAS 102(44):16078-16083 (2005)), have been proposed for targeting osteolytic bone loss. Despite the proposed utility of such CSF1R and CSF1 antagonists, there remains a need in the art for the identification of additional agents with a demonstrated ability to inhibit disease pathology in vivo, such as osteolytic bone loss, cancer metastasis, cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss, and tumor growth., 176246=The average serum protein levels of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc in mice hydrodynamically transfected with the mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA were 1706, 1037, 714, and 536 ug/ml on days 3, 7, 14, and 25, respectively. The average serum protein levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc in mice hydrodynamically transfected with the mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA were 1197, 775, 525, and 311 ug/ml on days 3, 7, 14, and 25, respectively. The serum protein levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc in hydrodynamically transfected animals were much higher than in the animals dosed 3 times a week with purified mCSF1R-506-Fc protein at 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, in which the trough levels were 144 or 256 ug/ml, respectively. This may explain why the inhibition of tumor growth was not observed in animals dosed with purified mCSF1R-506-Fc protein., 99641=There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art. See, for example, EP 0 401 384; Malik et al., Exp. Hematol., 20:1028-1035 (1992); Francis, Focus on Growth Factors, 3(2):4-10 (1992); EP 0 154 316; EP 0 401 384; WO 92/16221; WO 95/34326; and the other publications cited herein that relate to pegylation., 170155=The 4T1 cells were cultured for two passages in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% L-glutamine at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. One day after hydrodynamic transfection with the minicircle DNA, the 4T1 cells were harvested and implanted subcutaneously over the right flank of the mice at 1.25\ufffd105 cells/100 ul/mouse. Primary tumor volume and body weight were measured two times per week. When the primary tumor volume in the saline control group was equal to 2,500 mm3, the mice were euthanized, and the lungs were collected and fixed in Bouin's solution. Metastatic lung nodules were counted manually., 174000=For the experiments involving hydrodynamic transfection of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA and mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA, corresponding serum protein levels of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc were determined in control mice that were hydrodynamically transfected but were not enrolled in the study. In this drug exposure monitoring study, 200 ul of whole blood were collected by retroorbital bleeding on days 3, 7, 14, and 25. The whole blood was transferred into EDTA-coated tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and was spun down at 5000 rpm using a benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf North America, Westbury, N.Y.). The plasma was collected and transferred into 1 ml eppendorf sample tubes. The levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc proteins were analyzed using an Fc sandwich ELISA assay. In this assay, a Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plate (# 439-454, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, N.Y.) was coated with goat anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody (#A80-104A, Bethyl Labs, Montgomery, Tex.) at a concentration of 2 ug/ml overnight at 4\ufffd C. The wells were then blocked with 1% BSA (fraction V; Sigma #A3059) in PBS at room temperature for 2 hours. Purified mCSF1R-506-Fc was used as a standard and was added into plasma from na\ufffdve SCID mice at a starting concentration of 10 ug/ml. The purified mCSF1R-506-Fc standard was then serially diluted seven times at a ratio of 1:2 in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (the dilution buffer), and was added to the wells in duplicates. The plasma samples from the study were diluted 20-fold in the dilution buffer and were added to the wells in duplicates. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes with agitation. After washing, the HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgG-Fc antibody was added at a 1:60000 dilution for 1 hour to detect the captured mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc or mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc fusion proteins. The TMB substrate (#TMBW-0100-01 BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) was added at a concentration of 10 ug/ml and was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The optical density of the tested samples was read at 450 nm using a Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.)., 95455=Methods for preparing fusion molecules conjugated with polymers, such as water soluble polymers, will each generally involve (a) reacting a CSF1R ECD with a polymer under conditions whereby the polypeptide becomes attached to one or more polymers and (b) obtaining the reaction product. Reaction conditions for each conjugation may be selected from any of those known in the art or those subsequently developed, but should be selected to avoid or limit exposure to reaction conditions such as temperatures, solvents, and pH levels that would inactivate the protein to be modified. In general, the optimal reaction conditions for the reactions will be determined case-by-case based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of polymer:polypeptide conjugate, the greater the percentage of conjugated product. The optimum ratio (in terms of efficiency of reaction in that there is no excess unreacted polypeptide or polymer) may be determined by factors such as the desired degree of derivatization (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-, etc.), the molecular weight of the polymer selected, whether the polymer is branched or unbranched, and the reaction conditions used. The ratio of polymer (for example, PEG) to a polypeptide will generally range from 1:1 to 100:1. One or more purified conjugates may be prepared from each mixture by standard purification techniques, including among others, dialysis, salting-out, ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and electrophoresis., 113457=In certain embodiments, a vector is chosen for in vivo expression of CSF1R ECDs and/or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules in animals, including humans. In certain such embodiments, expression of the polypeptide is under the control of a promoter that functions in a tissue-specific manner. For example, liver-specific promoters are described, e.g., in PCT Publication No. WO 2006/076288., 19079=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/118,427, filed on Nov. 26, 2008, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 110049=Certain exemplary signal peptide sequences are described, e.g., in the online Signal Peptide Database maintained by the Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore.
