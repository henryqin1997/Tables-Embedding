In the matched filter of FIG. 10, this step is implicit in the operation of PN code register 415 which successively and circularly shifts through each of the possible code phase hypotheses in a PN code repetition period, which, in one implementation, comprises 2046 half-chip increments.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45610=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/281,566, filed Mar. 30, 1999, now issued as U.S. Pat No. 6,577,271. This application is further related to U.S. Pat. No. 6,044,105, issued Mar. 28, 2000 and entitled DOPPLER CORRECTED SPREAD SPECTRUM MATCHED FILTER, and to U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,216, issued Oct. 16, 2001 and entitled SIGNAL DETECTOR EMPLOYING CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF NON-UNIFORM AND DISJOINT SAMPLE SEGMENTS, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 157071=In addition to Doppler shift, the motion of the receiver must be considered. The wavelength of the GPS signal at L1=1575.42 MHz is about 19 cm or 7.5 inches. If the receiver is in a hand held device, motion of half this distance will cause a phase inversion resulting in signal cancellation when using coherent integration. A person walking along at 4 mph will travel 3.75 inches in 53 milliseconds. Thus, a practical limit for even a slowly moving receiver may be only a few 20 ms periods. Nevertheless, if the values of the data bits are available, it is still beneficial to operate over several 20 ms periods with coherent integration in order to more rapidly improve SNR., 46607=The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a collection of 24 earth-orbiting satellites. Each of the GPS satellites travels in a precise orbit about 11,000 miles above the earth's surface. A GPS receiver locks onto at least 3 of the satellites, and responsive, thereto, is able to determine its precise location. Each satellite transmits a signal modulated with a unique pseudo-noise (PN) code. Each PN code comprises a sequence of 1023 chips which are repeated every millisecond consistent with a chip rate of 1.023 MHz. Each satellite transmits at the same frequency. For civil applications, the frequency is known as L1 and is 1575.42 MHz. The GPS receiver receives a signal which is a mixture of the transmissions of the satellites that are visible to the receiver. The receiver detects the transmission of a particular satellite by correlating the received signal with shifted versions of the PN code for that satellite. If the level of correlation is sufficiently high so that there is a peak in the level of correlation achieved for a particular shift and PN code, the receiver detects the transmission of the satellite corresponding to the particular PN code. The receiver then uses the shifted PN code to achieve synchronization with subsequent transmissions from the satellite., 102539=In one implementation example, each corrected subsegment of samples continues to comprise 2046 complex samples, each having I and Q components, which can be represented in combination as I+jQ, and each of which can take on any one of the discrete values \u22122, \u22121, 0, +1, and +2. In this implementation example, each component requires 3 bits for the representation thereof, and thus the 2046 samples in a corrected subsegment requires 2046\ufffd6 bits=12,276 bits in register 406 for the storage thereof., 91700=One embodiment of a GPS receiver in accordance with the subject invention is illustrated in FIG. 8. As shown, the receiver comprises a radio frequency (RF) receiver 300, sampling circuitry 308, timing circuitry 307, a PN code generator 312, a matched filter 310, and a GPS processor 303. In one embodiment, a signal is received by GPS receiver 300 which comprises a plurality of signals, each from a satellite visible to the receiver. Each satellite signal comprises a repeating PN code unique to the satellite. Each period of the PN code comprises 1023 chips which repeats every 1 mS, for a nominal chip rate of 1.023 MHz. Each satellite signal is modulated with a 50 Hz data signal. The period of the data signal, 20 mS, defines a frame. One purpose of the data signal is to convey locational information about the satellite to the receiver., 104622=In the implementation example discussed earlier in which the subsegment of samples stored in sample register 406 comprises 2046 samples, each having I and Q components, and the PN code hypothesis stored in PN code register 415 comprises 1023 chips, a correspondence is present between two of the samples in the sample register 406, and one of the chips in PN code register 415. The I and the Q components of each of the two samples is multiplied by the corresponding PN chip. Then, the sum of the I component products is determined, and the sum of the Q component products is separately determined. The sum of the I component products is output on signal line 408, and the sum of the Q component products is output on signal line 409., 103708=As indicated by signal line 414, the PN code register 415 is capable of being circularly shifted by an amount which corresponds to a code phase delay hypothesis. In the implementation example which has been discussed, in which the period of a PN code is 1023 chips, the value of the code phase delay can range from 0 to 2045 half chip increments. The PN code register 415 is configured in this implementation example to be circularly shifted by any number or fraction of chips which correspond to a code phase delay hypothesis under consideration.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While various embodiments of the application have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are within the scope of the subject invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the appended claims and their equivalents. Although embodiments and implementations have been described which utilize a GPS processor to perform various functions, it should be understood that embodiments are possible in which a generic processor is used to perform these functions. For purposes of this disclosure, a generic processor is defined to mean any device, including a computer, DSP, baseband processor, microprocessor, or microcomputer, which is capable of executing a discrete series of instructions stored in a memory accessible by the processor. It should also be understood that embodiments are possible in which analog circuitry is used to perform these functions. Another advantage is that reliance on the matched filter of the subject invention to perform coherent integration reduces the load on the GPS processor. It also reduces the amount of RAM that the outside processor must dedicate to GPS. Another advantage of the invention is that it takes advantage of cellular and PCS phone systems and their ability to provide external sources of data useful to GPS.
