    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73665=The beads can be simply implanted into a host by injection with a standard catheter or syringe, e.g., with a 16 gauge needle for beads less than 1000 \u03bcm in diameter. Larger beads can be inserted via a small incision, e.g., with a catheter or funnel-like device. The beads are preferably implanted into the host intraperitoneally. The beads can also be implanted intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Alternatively, the beads can also be implanted into immunoprivileged sites such as the brain, testes, or thymus, where the host's immune response is least vigorous, as described in Chapter 7 of Lanza et al. (eds.), Immunomodulation of Pancreatic Islets (RG Landes, Tex., 1994). In addition, the beads can be inserted through a small surgically created opening using a gun/trocar type device that slips the beads under the skin., 38513=This application is a continuation application of Ser. No. 08/228,134 filed on Apr. 15, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,980. The contents of all of the aforementioned application are hereby incorporated by reference., 79469=However, discordant xenograft studies using larger beads, e.g., 2200, 3000, and 3700 \u03bcm diameter beads, showed that porcine islet cells remained viable for more than four weeks in rats without any immunosuppression. The results (percent viability after 4 weeks) are shown in Table 1 below., 78776=In other experiments, porcine islets were. immobilized in five different sizes of uncoated alginate beads (880, 1600, 2200, 3000, and 3700 \u03bcm in diameter). These were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of STZ-induced diabetic rats for 11 to 14 days (n=2 for all tests). No immunosuppressant was used in these experiments. No islets survived in any of the 800 \u03bcm or 1600 \u03bcm diameter beads. Thus, it appears that smaller diameter beads containing porcine islets do not work without immunosuppression in rats. In other experiments, loss of blood glucose control and histology confirm that smaller diameter gel beads are rejected within about 6 to 10 days after implantation., 65542=The particles, e.g., beads, are preferably spherical in configuration and have a diameter of about 600 to 6000 \u03bcm, preferably 1500 to 3500 \u03bcm. Particles as small as 50 \u03bcm can be made. The preferred size is based on diffusion distances from the surface of the bead to the cells within. In addition, smaller beads, e.g., 700 to 900 \u03bcm are suitable for allographic transplants, whereas larger beads, e.g., 2000 to 5000 \u03bcm, are preferred for xenographic transplants., 73082=In addition, according to in vitro observations, the living donor cells within the gel beads can be protected from cytotoxic nitric oxide radicals, by co-encapsulating the cells with autologous erythrocytes, which scavenge nitric oxide that may enter the gel beads once implanted, e.g., as described in Wiegand et al., Transplantation, 56:1206-1212 (November 1993). In addition, the gel beads can be treated with nitric oxide inhibitors such as NG -methyl-L-arginine prior to implantation to provide a protective effect., 56485=Cells are isolated from surrounding tissues or grown in culture by procedures known to the art, and are then suspended in a liquid medium prior to encapsulation. For example, pancreatic islet cells were prepared from either adult mongrel dogs, pigs, or bovine calves (0-2 weeks old) by a modification of the methods of Warnock and Rajotte, Diabetes, 37:467 (1988), as previously described in Lanza et al., P.N.A.S. USA, 88:11100-11104 (1991)., 52572=In particular embodiments, the gel particle is spherical and has a diameter of from 50 to 6000 microns, and preferably from 2000 to 4500 microns. The gel can be an alginate or alginate derivative, and the alginate can be crosslinked with an ion, such as the calcium in a calcium salt. The uncoated gel particle can be biodegradable, and the rate of degradation of the gel in the uncoated particle can be selected to match the life expectancy of the donor cell.}",

Other Embodiments The epilepsies are a group of disorders characterized by chronic, recurrent, paroxysmal changes in neurologic function caused by abnormalities in the electrical activity of the brain. In some forms of focal epilepsy, inhibitory interneurons appear to be preferentially lost. Treatment with neurotropic factors and other neuropeptides such as has been found effective. Therefore the uncoated beads of the intention containing cells secreting these factors can be used to treat epilepsy Epilepsy Duchenne's dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive weakness of girdle muscles, inability to walk after age 12, kyphoscoliosis (curvature of the spine), and respiratory failure after the fourth decade. This disease can be treated by administration of uncoated beads containing myoblast cells and growth factors. Myoblasts have been injected into young boys with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy to determine whether the cells can supply a structural protein that is missing. Researchers have observed muscle strength improvement in several of the boys. Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy Various cancers can be treated according to",
