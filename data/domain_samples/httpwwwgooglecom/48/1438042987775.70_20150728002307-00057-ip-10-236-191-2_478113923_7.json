Garrison, \"Biodegradable Cuff an Adjunct to Peripheral Nerve Repair: A Study in Dogs\", U.S. Army Institute of Dental Research, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Government Report ADA044491, Aug. 29, 1977, also published in The Hand 10, (3) 259 (1978), disclose the use of the biodegradable copolymer poly(glycolide-co-lactide), as smooth, rigid tubes for use as nerve cuffs. These authors were unable to show any improvement with the use of this device. Sutures were used in both control and experimental groups since the device was not capable of providing a sutureless repair. Hakan Molander et al., \"Regeneration of Peripheral Nerve through a Polyglactin Tube\", Muscle and Nerve 5, 54-57 (1982), reported less than satisfactory results in bridging nerve defects (missing portions of nerves) by use of a biodegradable polyglactin suture mesh shaped as a tube around the defect to serve as a framework for proliferating cells., 28284=\"porous\" means the material contains void spaces or pores which communicate between the inner and outer surfaces. The interstitial pore size may vary widely, generally from about 1 micron up to about 1000 microns, although it may be preferred to use pore sizes in the range of about 100 to 500 microns. The porosity also may vary widely, generally from about 25% by volume to the limit of coherence (for example, 95% by volume) of the porous surface, and usually in the range of about 30 to about 95% by volume;, 73427=A 137 cm (54 in.) U.S.P. No. 2 Dexon\u2122 \"S\", green braided polyglycolic acid suture (Davis & Geck, Inc., Manati, P.R. 00701, U.S.A.) was cut into 3 to 6 mm lengths. The braided pieces were combined with 300 ml of dichloromethane and subjected to high shear mixing in a Waring\u2122 blender which readily debraided and separated the individual micro fibers. The suspended fibers were collected and allowed to dry. The resulting flock was then air-laid to form a web. The resultant web was carefully deposited on a piece of filter paper and gently soaked with a binder solution of 2 weight percent polyglycolic acid dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol , (99+% Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. 53201) applied from a glass sprayer. The solvent was allowed to evaporate at room temperature in a well ventilated area to produce a circular bonded web that was flexible, yet stiff and self-supporting. The web weight was approximately 0.2845 g with a thickness of approximately 0.043 cm (0.017 in.) and a diameter of approximately 7.6 cm (3.0 in.). Rectangular pieces were cut from the web and molded into U-shaped cross-section, open tubes using the type of mold described in EXAMPLE 5. The molding process was accomplished by rewetting the web with 2 weight percent polyglycolic acid dissolved in 1,1,1 3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, pressing it between the two mold halves, and allowing it to dry thoroughly. Trace residues of solvent were removed from the device by subjecting it to high vacuum for several days., 15175=This is a division of application Ser. No. 569,557 filed Jan. 12, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,534,349, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 463,242, filed Feb. 2, 1983, now abandoned., 60674=Polyglycolic acid was synthesized from glycolic acid using a procedure similar to the one described by Gilding and Reed (Polymer 20, 1459, December 1979). A one liter round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer, distillation apparatus, motor driven mixer, and nitrogen inlet and outlet was charged with 581 g of high purity glycolic acid (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y. 14650) and heated to 140\ufffd C. by means of an electric heating mantle. As distillation of water subsided the temperature of the melt was gradually increased to a maximum of 220\ufffd C. with stirring and dry nitrogen sweep. The distillation apparatus was then connected to a vacuum pump and the heating continued under high vacuum. Distillation of glycolide occurred as the temperature reached 225\ufffd to 270\ufffd C. Under these conditions, however, a large portion of the residue was converted into a carbonaceous solid. The distillate was ground to a powder upon solidification and extracted twice with chloroform to remove the yellow color. The product was then recrystallized twice from ethyl acetate and dried in vacuo to yield 96.3 g of white, lustrous crystals. The crystalline glycolide was then placed in a 500 ml round bottom flask equipped with a motor driven mixer and nitrogen inlet and outlet. Approximately 0.04 g of stannous octanoate catalyst (K & K Laboratories, Inc., Plainview, N.Y.) was added and the mixture was rapidly heated to 200\ufffd C. under nitrogen with stirring by immersion of the flask into a preheated oil bath. After about 10 minutes the viscosity increased to the point that stirring was no longer possible. The flask was heated at 220\ufffd C. for a total of 20 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature whereupon the glass flask shattered. The brown, glassy polymer was cleaved into small pieces and freed of glass particles. The polyglycolic acid was then processed into small particles by feeding thin, melt pressed sheets into a Waring\u2122 blender., 17653=Sutureless tubulization techniques are known to be successful only in the case of very small, single fascicle nerves. The saphenous nerve in rats (0.3-0.5 mm diameter) was transected and repaired with a preformed tube or single leaf of collagen membrane as disclosed by J. M. Rosen, E. N. Kaplan, D. L. Jewett, and J. R. Daniels, \"Fascicular Sutureless and Suture Repair of the Peripheral Nerves, A Comparison Study in Laboratory Animals\", Orthopaedic Review 8 (4), 85 (1979). This method of repair avoids sutures but requires a totally tensionless situation to avoid retraction of the nerve stumps. J. M. Rosen in Orthopedic Transactions 6(1), 75(1982) reports that the peroneal nerve in rats (0.5-1.2 mm in diameter) was transected and repaired with a thin-walled, extruded tube of polyglycolic acid, cut open longitudinally along one wall. This method also requires a totally tensionless situation and is not advisable in the case of larger nerves since the tight fit required to maintain adequate nerve stump approximation would not provide for the release of pressure created by post-surgical swelling. The loose fit to accommodate swelling is an important feature of commercially available Silastic\u2122 nerve cuffs, which must he used in combination with sutures (Bulletin: 14-393, Medical Products Division, Dow Corning Corp., Midland, Mich. 48640, April, 1969). Moreover, as shown in Example 6 below, longitudinally-split, extruded, smooth tubing used in sutureless repair on a 1.5 mm diameter rat sciatic nerve was found to be unsatisfactory due to retraction of the nerve., 20356=Examples of tubulization materials that have been used in combination with sutures include silicone rubber as taught by R. D. Midgley and F. M. Woolhouse, \"Silicone Rubber Sheathing as an Adjunct to Neural Anastomosis\", Surgical Clinic of North America 48, 1149 (1968), and collagen as disclosed by D. G. Kline and G. J. Hayes, \"The Use of a Resorbable Wrapper for Peripheral Nerve Repair, Experimental Studies in Chimpanzees\", J. Neurosurgery 21, 737 (1964). Silicone has the disadvantages of being impermeable and nonabsorbable whereas the disadvantage of collagen is its potential antigenicity., 57633=The drug cis-hydroxy-L-proline (CHP) has previously been shown to reduce neuroma formation when administered systemically by inhibiting the synthesis of collagen. (J. M. Lane, F. W. Bora, and D. Pleasure, \"Neuroma Scar Formation in Rats Following Peripheral Nerve Transection\", The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery 60-A:2, 197, March, 1978). Since it is known that polylactic acid is useful for dispensing drugs (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,887,699), additional tubulization devices were prepared from CHP-containing polylactic acid to determine the effect on nerve regeneration.}",
