Each of these applications is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 51756=The material comprising the sleeves 10-10 g may vary in color and may consist of designs or decorative patterns which are printed, etched, and/or embossed thereon using inks or other printing materials. An example of an ink which may be applied to the surface of the material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,706 entitled \u201cWater Based Ink On Foil And/Or Synthetic Organic Polymer\u201d issued to Kingman on Sep. 15, 1992 and which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference., 55893=It will be understood that the bonding material may be disposed as a strip or block on a surface of the sleeves 10-10 g. The bonding material may also be disposed upon either an outer peripheral surface or an inner peripheral surface of any of the sleeves 10-10 g, as well as upon the flower pot. Further, the bonding material may be disposed as spots of bonding material, or in any other geometric, non-geometric, asymmetric, or fanciful form, and in any pattern including covering either the entire inner peripheral surface and/or outer peripheral surface of any of the sleeves 10-10 g and/or the flower pot. The bonding material may be covered by a cover or release strip which can be removed prior to the use of the sleeve and/or flower pot. The bonding material can be applied by means known to those of ordinary skill in their art. One method for disposing a bonding material, in this case an adhesive, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,111,637 entitled \u201cMethod For Wrapping A Floral Grouping\u201d issued to Weder et al., on May 12, 1992, which has been expressly incorporated by reference above., 48702=The material from which the sleeves 10-10 g are constructed preferably has a thickness in a range from about 0.1 mil to about 30 mils. Often, the thicknesses of the sleeves 10-10 g are in a range from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mils. Preferably, each of the sleeves 10-10 g has a thickness in a range from about 1.0 mil to about 5 mils. More preferably, the sleeves 10-10 g are constructed from a material which is flexible, semi-rigid, rigid, or any combination thereof. The sleeves 10-10 g may be constructed of a single layer of material or a plurality of layers of the same or different types of materials. Any thickness of the material may be utilized as long as the material functions in accordance with the present invention and is expandable to an open position as described herein. The layers of material comprising the sleeves 10-10 g may be connected together or laminated or may be separate layers. Such materials used to construct the sleeves 10-10 g are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,111,637 entitled \u201cMethod For Wrapping A Floral Grouping\u201d issued to Weder et al., on May 12, 1992, which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Any thickness of material may be utilized in accordance with the present invention as long as the sleeves 10-10 g may be formed as described herein, and as long as the formed sleeves 10-10 g may contain at least a portion of a flower pot or potted plant or a floral grouping, as described herein. Additionally, an insulating material such as bubble film, preferably one of two or more layers, can be utilized in order to provide additional protection for the item, such as the floral grouping, contained therein.}",

It should be further noted that various features of the versions of the present invention such as closure bonding areas, support extensions, handles, additional perforations, drainage means, ventilation holes, combinations of material may be used alone or in combination as elements of any of the embodiments described above herein. It should also be noted that for all versions of sleeves described, it may be desirable to have a release material or cover strip covering the adhesive or cohesive bonding material when such a bonding material is disposed on any portion of the sleeve for preventing the bonding material from bonding to another surface until the desired time. Further, in each of the cases described herein wherein a sleeve is applied to a flower pot or a covered pot, the sleeve may be applied thereto either by depositing the flower pot or covered pot downwardly into the open retaining space of the sleeve, or the sleeve may be brought upwardly about the flower pot or covered pot from below the flower pot or a covered pot.
