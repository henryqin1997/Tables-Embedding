In the case of the embodiment 27 a light-guiding element 31 is arranged on the right-hand side of the light-emitting diode 27, so that only the r on the left-hand side of the light-emitting diode 30 is illuminated and a shaded region arises on the right-hand side. FIG. 3 shows two embodiments 26 and 27 of light-emitting diodes with a light-guiding element. In the case of the embodiment 26 the light-emitting diode 28 is surrounded by a pipe-like tube 29, so that the light generated is able to emerge only at the end 32 of the tube and is concentrated in a cone of light. FIG. 2 shows a motor vehicle in a view from behind. Lighting devices according to the invention are integrated in each instance in an inside rear-view mirror 21, in the two outside rear-view mirrors 22 and 23 and in the trim strips 24 and 25, which are arranged in the door region of the motor vehicle. The lighting device in the inside rearview mirror 21 can be utilized as interior lighting or as a reading lamp. The lighting devices in the outside rearview mirrors 22 and 23 and also in the trim",
