At step 1110 CPRC 100 is bound, turning CPRC 100 into a legally binding contract between the buyer and the seller. The binding process requires that the status of CPRC 100 be changed to \u201ccompleted\u201d preventing subsequent buyers from being able to bind CPRC 100. The binding process also requires that the buyer ID be added to CPRC 100. At step 1120, central controller 200 sends settlement confirmation 120 to the buyer and then sends it to the seller at step 1130., 97384=Network interface 245 is the gateway to communicate with buyer and seller through respective buyer interfaces 400 and seller interface 300. Conventional internal or external modems may serve as network interface 245. Network interface 245 supports modems at a range of baud rates from 1200 upward, but may combine such inputs into a T1, T3 or DSL line if more bandwidth is required. In a preferred embodiment, network interface 245 is connected with the Internet and/or any of the commercial on-line services such as America Online, Internet Explorer, or Compuserve, allowing buyer and seller access from a wide range of on-line connections. The practice of using commercial electronic mail servers is well known in the art and need not be described here in detail. For instance, such secure server-based electronic mail software package designed to link people and information over enterprise networks and the Internet are widely available. These products are not platform dependent and utilize open standards based on Internet protocols. Users can exchange messages with enclosure such as files., 37365=For a better understanding of the term \u201cProperty rights\u201d reference is made to the following: The Law of Property Rights Protection by Jan G. Laitos, Published 1999, Aspen Law & Business ISBN 0-07-3550152-1, 141567=FIG. 16 shows a cryptographic technique using digital signatures to provide authentication and message integrity. One such algorithm is DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), the U.S. Government standard specified in FIPS PUB 186. As in the asymmetric protocol described above, each buyer has an associated public and private key. The buyer signs buyer response 150 with his private key at step 1600 with cryptographic processor 310 and transmits it to central controller 200 at step 1610. Central controller cryptographic processor 210 extracts the buyer's ID at step 1620 and looks up the buyer's public key at step 1630, verifying the signature using buyer response 150 and the public key of the buyer at step 1640. If buyer response 150 is intelligible, then central controller 200 accepts buyer response 150 as authentic at step 1650., 134477=In another embodiment, the buyer makes a partial settlement when CPRC 100 is bound, and then completes settlement when the credits are received. The fraction of the offered settlement of CPRC 100 to be paid upon binding is a condition of CPRC 100 and is stored in payment database 285 when CPRC 100 is bound. Central controller 200 releases this portion of the settlement at step 1110, and then releases the remaining portion after credits have been delivered at step 1200. The partial settlement made upon binding may be non-refundable. This would allow an individual seller, for example, to sell his credit that was canceled on two days notice, for example, with cancellation within the two day period resulting in the forfeiture of deposit., 31953=Starting in 1992, Congress, in it's infinite wisdom, began passing energy efficiency laws such as Public Law 101-614 and 101-625 for example, which call for the use of clean energy and energy efficiency measures on all buildings in the nation. And from another direction, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, passing their own clean air standards penalize local governments for non-attainment of their clean air requirements., 68800=For example, California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, commonly referred to as Proposition 65, requires businesses using natural gas in their operations to post public warning placards. For example, OSHA recently adopted California's Proposition 65 to protect workers across the nation. For example, energy efficiency measures must be installed as per Public Law 101-625; this Act \u201c42 USC 12701\u201d may be cited as the \u201cCranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.\u201d For example, seismic gas shut off requirements are required under Public Law 101-614; this Act may be cited as the \u201cNational Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act,\u201d \u201c42 USC 7701\u201d. For example, gas surge shut off requirements are codified by the Department of Transportation (DOT, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 80 building codes issued in 1996, which includes these requirements. It is from within these laws that individual pollution credits, may be claimed by the individual utility consumer., 148949=FIG. 18 illustrates the development of counteroffer 140. At step 1800, the potential buyer selects CPRC 100 for which he wants to make a counteroffer. At step 1810, the buyer prepares a counteroffer 140 with modified conditions. The buyer follows the same process that the seller uses to generate CPRC 100 (steps 500 through 580), selecting the conditions of counteroffer 140. Alternatively, the buyer is presented with an electronic copy of CPRC 100 and is allowed to edit those conditions that the buyer wants to change. For example, a buyer owned utility might want to extend credit to the seller for installing a gas filter on his gas pipes. At step 1820, the buyer attaches the tracking number of CPRC 100 to counteroffer 140. Central controller 200 receives counteroffer 140 at step 1830, setting status to \u201cactive\u201d. Central controller 200 then adds a unique tracking number to counteroffer 140 at step 1840, and stores it in counteroffer database 267 at step 1850. Central controller 200 extracts the tracking number of CPRC 100 attached to counteroffer 140 in order to find the seller to whom counteroffer 140 is transmitted at step 1860., 123310=In another embodiment, the buyer transmits buyer response 150 directly to the seller at step 1010. The seller may then send buyer response 150 to central controller 200 for verification and authentication, or he may choose to accept buyer response 150 without verification and authentication., 122649=Central controller 200 then verifies the status of CPRC 100 at step 1030 determrining whether or not the status of CPRC 100 is \u201cactive\u201d at step 140. If CPRC 100 is currently \u201cactive\u201d, a unique tracking number is added to buyer response 150 at step 1060. Central controller 200 then stores buyer response 150 in buyer response database 270 at step 1070. If the status of CPRC 100 is not \u201cactive\u201d at step 1040, buyer response 150 is refused by central controller 200 and transmitted back to the potential buyer at step 1050., 118775=FIG. 9 illustrates the process by which a potential buyer selects CPRC 100. At step 900, the potential buyer logs onto central controller 200 using modem 350 of buyer interface 300. At step 910, the potential buyer selects an appropriate subject area. For example, a buyer that has just experienced cancellation of it's Federal funds for repair of roads and bridges might search for offsetting pollution credits might search in the pollution credit subject area in the hopes of finding a CPRC 100 that meets it's funding reinstatement needs. At step 920, the potential buyer. browses the list of available CPRCs 100 (i.e. those with a status of \u201cactive\u201d), CPRCs 100 may be listed with minimal details, with additional information available only if the potential buyer is interested in binding CPRC 100. A CPRC 100 might be listed as \u201cair pollution credit-Jul. 10, 2000-San Francisco-credit trade-value 10\u201d A potential buyer wanting more information about CPRC 100 may request additional information at step 940. In one embodiment, each CPRC 100 is hyperlinked to a separate Web page which provides complete details. The potential buyer clicks on CPRC 100 and is immediately transferred to the page of supporting details. These details might include the type of reduced chemical pollutant, the amount reduced, the energy efficiency method employed, and the requirements required to bind the ipCredits offer. In another embodiment, CPRC 100 is electronically transmitted to the buyer or related party, via electronic mail, fax, telephone, beeper, PDA, etc., 142520=FIG. 17 is an illustration that describes a cryptographic technique using message authentication codes for verifying the authenticity and integrity of buyer response 150. In the hash protocol of the present invention, the buyer and central controller 200 share a symmetric key, which the buyer includes in a hash of buyer response 150 at step 1700. In the hash protocol, a one-way function is applied to the digital representation of buyer response 150, generating a code that acts much like the fingerprint of buyer response 150. Any of the MAC algorithms, such as RIPE-MAC, IBC-Hash, CBC-MAC, and the like may be applied in this application. After transmitting buyer response 150 to central controller 200 at step 1710, cryptographic processor 210 extracts buyer ID from buyer response 150 at step 1720. Then cryptographic processor 210 looks up the buyer's symmetric key at step 1730 and hashes buyer response 150 with this symmetric key at step 1740, comparing the resulting hash value with the hash value attached to buyer response 150. If the values match at step 1750, the integrity of buyer response 150 is verified along with the authenticity of the buyer., 59850=Pipeline & Gas Journal November 1997 pg. 50, 120468=FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate the process by which CPRC 100 is bound by a buyer. At step 1000, the potential buyer selects CPRC 100 which they would like to bind, developing buyer response. 150 which represents their intention to bind. At step 1010, central controller 200 receives buyer response 150 from the potential buyer. Central controller 200 then timestamps buyer response 150 and authenticates the identity of the buyer, as well as verifying their probable capacity to honor the terms of the seller's requirements. The time stamp allows central controller 200 to determine the first unconditional acceptance to be received. If two buyer responses 150 are received within a few seconds of each other, the time stamp allows central controller 200 to decide which was received first. Alternatively, the time stamp may be appended to buyer response 150 at the time it is transmitted from buyer interface 300, using clock 335 of buyer interface 300., 137638=FIG. 14 describes a symmetric key embodiment in which the buyer and central controller 200 share a key. Thus both encryption and decryption of buyer response 150 are performed with the same key. This encryption may be implemented with an algorithm such as DES (U.S. Government standard, specified in FIPS PUB 46), or with any of several algorithms known in the art such as IDEA, Blowfish, RC4, RC2, SAFER, etc. The buyer encrypts buyer response 150 with his assigned symmetric key at step 1400, using cryptographic processor 410 of buyer interface 400. The key may be stored in message database 470 or otherwise stored or memorized by the buyer. The encrypted buyer response 150 is then transmitted to cryptographic processor 210 of central controller 200 at step 1410. Cryptographic processor 210 extracts the buyer ID from response 150 at step 1420 and looks up the symmetric key of the buyer in cryptographic key database 290 at step 1430, decrypting buyer response 150 with this key at step 1430. Cryptographic key database 290 contains algorithms and keys for encrypting, decrypting, and/or authenticating messages. At step 1450, if the resulting message is intelligible, then it must have been encrypted by the same key, authenticating that the buyer must have indeed been the author of buyer response 150., 127570=FIG. 13 illustrates a protocol in which central controller 200 establishes seller account 298. At step 1300, the seller selects his preferred method of payment for clearing a CPRC 100. Preferred methods might include credit cards, personal checks, electronic funds transfer, digital money, etc. At step 1310, the seller transmits payment data corresponding to his preferred method of payment to central controller 200. As indicated by box 1315, such payment data might include credit card number or bank account number. These payment methods are meant to be merely illustrative, however, as there are many equivalent payment methods commonly known in the art, which may be preferred by the seller such as barter, gift, deposit, deed, transfer, set-aside, etc. If the seller wants to pay by credit card, for example, payment data would include his credit card account number, expiration date, name of issuing institution, credit limit, and name as it appears on the card. For electronic funds transfer, payment data includes the name of the seller's bank and his account number. At step 1320, central controller 200 stores payment data and payment preferences in payment database 285., 64537=The \u201cGas Facts Handbook\u201d published by the American Gas Association, reports that 1,450 quadrillion cubic ft of gas was sold in the U.S. in 1993. Quadrillion (as in million)\u2014quadrillion is 1 followed by 24 zeros, viz., 1,450,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 cubic ft of gas, 128843=At step 1330, central controller 200 establishes seller account 298 which either stores money transferred by the seller or serves as a pointer to an account of the seller outside the system. For sellers using credit cards, for example, seller account 298 contains the credit card number, expiration date, and narne of the issuing institution. Sellers could also transfer money to central controller 200 to be stored in seller account 298, which would operate like a conventional checking account. Central controller 200 would send a check to the system operator performing the pollution credit work for the seller, written on seller account 298. Alternatively, central controller 200 could electronically move the funds directly from the seller account 298 to the system operator account 296. At step 1340, central controller 200 contacts the bank or credit card issuer to confirm that funds are available. A seller is thus unable to use a credit card with no credit available to establish seller account 298., 137250=The practice of using cryptographic protocols to ensure the authenticity of senders as well as the integrity of messages is well known in the art and need not be described here in detail. For reference, one of ordinary skill in the art may refer to \u201cApplied Cryptography, Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C\u201d, second edition, John Wiley & Sons., Inc. 1996., 67024=Public Law 101-614, 104 Stat. 3231 An act to authorize appropriations for the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SHORT TITLE SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the \u201cNational Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act,\u201d 42 USC 7701., 126037=FIG. 12 illustrates the exchange of pollution credit between seller and buyer. At step 1200, the seller transfers the specified ipCredit to the buyer. This transfer could involve the delivery of the physical ipCredits as well as digital credits. Physical credits might include a certificate, a coupon, a document or the like. Digital credit might include documents, coupons, certificates, credits, reimbursements, discounted payment plans, access codes, compliance with stated time requirements to produce results, etc. For example, a city government might transfer a confirmation that it has notified the utility covered by the pollution credit requirement of the seller to comply with pollution compliance codes within ten days or suffer loss of the utility's franchise. At step 1210, the buyer examines the delivered pollution credits to see if they meet all conditions and terms of the CPRC 100. A buyer negotiating a Smog ipCredits, for example, would verify that the Nitrous Oxide (NOx) levels contained in the ipCredits was the correct chemical needed to offset Smog reduction for the buyer (government agency). At step 1220, if the credit does not meet the buyer's conditions as described in CPRC 100 the buyer contacts an arbiter at central controller 200 for dispute resolution. This process is described in more detail in the dispute resolution embodiment described later. At step 1240 the transaction is complete., 150297=FIG. 19 illustrates the process by which the seller responds to counteroffer 140. At step 1900, the seller decides whether or not to bind the counteroffer 140. If he does not bind, counteroffer 140 is transmitted back to the potential buyer at step 1910. If the seller does decide to bind, seller response 110 is transmitted to central controller 200 at step 1920. At step 1930, ipCredits are removed from seller account 298 and placed in buyer account 297. At step 1940, the status of the counteroffer 140 is changed to \u201ccompleted\u201d. Settlement confirmation 120 is transmitted to the buyer at step 1950 and transmitted to the seller at step 1960. Procedures for the exchange of credits are completed as described in FIG. 12., 140225=FIG. 15 illustrates a symmetric key protocol in which buyer response 150 is encrypted with a private key and decrypted with a public key. Two such algorithms for this procedure are RSA and DSA. At step 1500, the buyer encrypts buyer response 150 with his private key using cryptographic processor 310, transmitting buyer response 150 to central controller 200 at step 1510. Cryptographic processor 210 extracts the buyer ID at step 1520 and looks up the buyer\ufffds associated public key in cryptographic key database 290 at step 1530, decrypting buyer response 150 with this public key at step 1540. As before, if buyer is intelligible then central controller 200 has authenticate the buyer at step 1550. Again, unauthorized buyers obtaining buyer response 150 before it was received by central controller 200 are not able to undetectably alter it since they do not know the private key of the buyer. Unauthorized buyers would, however, be able to read the message if they managed to obtain the public key of the buyer. Message secrecy is obtained if the buyer encrypts buyer response 150 with his public key, requiring the attacker to know the buyer's private key to view buyer response 150., 133679=Escrow account 299 allows settlement to be delayed until the seller completes delivery of the ipCredits, while at the same time ensuring that the buyer will in fact make good on the seller's settlement requirements. Central controller 200 establishes escrow account 299 as a temporary holding account. When the buyer binds CPRC 100 at step 1110, settlement is transferred from seller account 298 to escrow account 299. Only after the credits have been received by the buyer is settlement conditions transferred from escrow account 299 to seller account 298. The buyer may transmit a digitally signed release message to central controller 200, authorizing the release of the escrowed settlement to the seller.}",
