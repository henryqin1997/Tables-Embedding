After an order is received from a user 2001, all the image prints to be generated from the order enter an \u201cEntered\u201d state 2002 indicating that the images from which the image prints are to be generated are part of an order but have not yet been sent to a print lab for printing. Once the order has been sent to a print lab for printing, the image prints enter a \u201cProcessing\u201d state 2004 indicating that the images from which the image prints are to be generated have been sent to a print lab for printing. After an image print has been printed and binned, the image print enters a \u201cBinned\u201d state 2006 indicating that the image print has been printed and binned. After each image print has been shipped, the image print enters a \u201cShipped\u201d state 2008 indicating that the image print has been shipped. Also, if the image print is stored (e.g., in the storage rack 767) so that the image print can be combined for shipping with other image prints from the same sub-order, the image print enters a \u201cStored\u201d state 2010 indicating that the image print has been stored. It is to be understood, however, that not all image prints will enter the Stored state 2010., 117122=After the user's images have reached the photo-finisher and have been made available online, the user can place an order with the photo-finisher (step 404). One way to place an order is by having the user view the images online, for example, with a browser and selectively designate which images should be printed. The user also will specify one or more recipients to whom prints should be distributed and, further, print parameters for each of the individual recipients, for example, not only parameters such as the size, number of copies and print finish, but potentially also custom messages to be printed on the back or front of a print. As used herein, the term \u201cprint\u201d refers to any physical manifestation, or process for generating a physical manifestation, of graphical information. This includes of course photographic prints, but also any other item to which graphical information can be imparted, for example, greeting or holiday cards, books, calendars, playing cards, T-shirts, coffee mugs, mouse pads, key-chains, or any other type of gift or novelty item. Further details on how to allow a user to place an order are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/436,704, filed Nov. 9, 1999, and entitled \u201cDistributing Images to Multiple Recipients,\u201d which is incorporated by reference and from which priority is claimed., 64734=Priority is claimed from U.S. provisional patent applications Ser. No. 60/151,533, filed Aug. 31, 1999, Ser. No. 60/159,372, filed Oct. 14, 1999, and Ser. No. 60/,167,243, filed Nov. 24, 1999, and entitled \u201cDigital Photo Printing Services,\u201d and this application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/436,704, filed Nov. 9, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,263,139, and entitled \u201cDistributing Images to Multiple Recipients,\u201d which is incorporated by reference., 155149=FIGS. 22-23 shows an alternative embodiment of an inverter 1000 that can be used in place of the chute inverter 700 and the slide 703 to receive an image print 704 from the belt conveyor 701, invert the image print 704, and deliver the image print 704 to the belt conveyor 711. The inverter 1000 has a Y-shaped design that includes a back slide 1002 that is positioned at an oblique angle with respect to the belt conveyor 711. The inverter 1000 also includes a front slide 1004 that is separated from the back slide 1002 by a passage 1006 through which an image print 704 can pass. The front slide 1004 is held in place by a pair of brackets 1008 (which are connected to side walls 1010) at an acute angle with respect to the belt conveyor 711. When an image print 704 reaches the end of the belt conveyor 701 (not shown in FIGS. 22-23), the image print 704 is rotated (e.g., by the arm 709 shown in FIG. 13B) and falls off the end of the belt conveyor 701 and onto front slide 1004 of the inverter 1000. The image print 704 slides though the passage 1006 and into the back slide 1002. The image print 704 slides down the back slide 1002 until the bottom edge of the image print 704 contacts the belt conveyor 711. The belt conveyor 711 pulls the bottom edge of the image print 704 in the direction that the belt conveyor 711 moves, which causes the image print 704 to lay on the belt conveyor face down. As with the inverter 700, it is preferable that the outer surfaces of the back slide 1002 and the front slide 1004 on which image prints slide are constructed from and/or covered with a material (e.g., paper or stainless steel) that reduces or inhibits the build up of a static charge that would cause the image print 704 to stick to the back slide 1002 or the front slide 1004., 191245=The same states 2002-2010 also are maintained by the scheduler 608 for the image prints after the images from which the image prints are to be generated have been received by the scheduler 608; however, the image prints enter the Entered 2002 state after the images from which the image prints are to be generated have been received by the scheduler 608 (shown in parenthesis in FIG. 21). Also, the Processing state 2004 is entered by image print when that image from which that image print is to be generated has been sent to a print line 612 for printing. Each image print in an order enters the Binned, Shipped, and Stored states 2006, 2008, and 2010 when the image print has been binned, shipped, and stored, respectively., 101116=The system 300 has a web front-end computer system 320 that is connected to the network 310. The web front-end computer system 320 receives customer input or requests from the network 310 and communicates the received information to an image archive database 330. The image archive database 330 captures images submitted by the customers 302-304 and archives these images for rapid retrieval when needed. The information stored in the image archive database 330 in turn is provided to a print laboratory system 340 for generating high resolution, high quality photographic prints. The output from the print lab system 340 in turn is provided to a distribution system 350 that delivers the physical prints to the customers 302-304 and/or to their respective designated recipients. Further details on the print generation and distribution system are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/428,871, filed Oct. 27, 1999, and entitled \u201cMulti-Tier Data Storage System,\u201d which is incorporated by reference., 192075=The states 2002-2010 shown in FIG. 21 can be used to track the image prints as they are being printed and to recover from errors in the printing process. For example, if an error occurs during the processing of a given batch, all image prints for the print line 612 having the error that are in the Processing state 2004 when the error occurs still need to be printed after the error has been removed from the print line 612; however, any image prints for that batch that are in the Binned state 2006, Shipped state 2008, and Stored state 2010 when the error occurs need not be printed again once the error is removed from the print line.}",
