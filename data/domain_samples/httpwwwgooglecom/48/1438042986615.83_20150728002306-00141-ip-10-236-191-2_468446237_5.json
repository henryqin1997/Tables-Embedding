    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24415=In recent years there has been intense interest in the dental field in adhesives that bond to hard tissues such as dentin. Many of these adhesives have been used in conjunction with an acid pretreatment of the dentin prior to application of the adhesive. A very wide variety of acids have been tried, with phosphoric, citric and oxalic acids being particularly popular pretreatments. The use of such acids, especially phosphoric acid, has not been without controversy. The American Dental Association has recommended against phosphoric acid pretreatment of dentin. However, phosphoric acid is extensively used as a pretreatment in Japan in conjunction with dentin adhesives from Kuraray Company, Ltd. Citric acid has a less severe etching effect than phosphoric acid and is used as a dentin pretreatment in the U.S. in conjunction with a dentin adhesive sold by Den-Mat Corporation. Oxalic acid also has a less severe etching effect than phosphoric acid, and the use of its monoacid and certain of its salts as a pretreatment is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,990. Other references describing various pretreatments for dentin include M. Buonocore, W. Wileman, and F. Brudevold, J. Dent. Res., 35, 846 (1956 ), M. Buonocore and M. Quigley, J. Amer. Dent.

Overcoat \"A\" contained a 50:50 mixture of Bis-GMA and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, and Overcoat \"B\" contained a 65:35 mixture of Bis-GMA and HEMA. Each overcoat contained 0.25% camphorquinone and 0.5% dimethylaminophenethanol. Set out below in TABLE III are the run number, amount of acid, and the average measured adhesive shear bond strength on dentin for each overcoat., 60112=To illustrate the effect of variation in the composition of the overcoat of additional film former, a series of overcoat compositions were applied to one of two different primers, and evaluated for adhesion to dentin. Primers \"A\" and \"B\" contained a 70:30 HEMA:water mixture to which had been added 3.5% and 2%, respectively, of camphorquinone-10-sulfonic acid. Set out below in TABLE V are the run number, identity of the primer, ingredients in the overcoat and the average measured adhesive shear bond strength on dentin., 47404=Using the procedure outlined above, the shear strength on dentin of several primer compositions was evaluated. The primers were made from 0.18M solutions of various acids in a 70:30 mixture of HEMA and water. Each primer was overcoated with an additional film former made from a 65:35 mixture of Bis-GMA and HEMA to which had been added 0.25% camphorquinone and 0.5% dimethylaminophenethanol. Set out below in TABLE I are the run number, acid, its pKa, the solubility of the calcium salt of the acid in water, and the average measured adhesive shear bond strength on dentin for each primer., 52470=Two evaluators excavated a box-shaped Class V preparation at the dentin-enamel junction of five human teeth. Each prepared cavity was thoroughly rinsed with water and dried with air, followed by etching the freshly exposed enamel for 30 seconds using gelled 37% \u03c3-phosphoric acid. The etched enamel was rinsed with water for 15 seconds and dried with air. The primer of Run 4 of EXAMPLE 1 was applied to the prepared cavity and allowed to stand for 60 seconds, then dried with air. The primed, prepared cavity was overcoated with a 65:35 mixture of Bis-GMA and HEMA containing 0.25% camphorquinone and 0.5% dimethylaminophenethanol and cured for 20 seconds using a \"Visilux\" curing light (3M). The prepared cavity was filled with \"Silux\" brand restorative, universal shade (3M) and cured for 20 seconds.}",
