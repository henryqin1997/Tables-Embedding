(2) Since the ink discharge surfaces are not flush with the electrical connection surfaces and the ink supply surfaces but are protruded by 5 mm or more, reliability can be improved, and, by arranging two ink discharge port rows symmetrically at positions rotated by 180 degrees with respect to the rotational center between the rows, \u201ccost-down\u201d can be achieved because common parts can be used. Further, by connecting the ink supply portions to the head along the ink discharge direction, when the ink tank is mounted on and dismounted from the head, load acting on the head is distributed uniformly outside of the rows of the ink discharge ports, thereby preventing positional deviation of the head which would affect a bad influence upon the color recording. In addition, since the groove (recess) having the depth greater than those of the ink discharge portions (ink discharge ports and the ink passages) is formed between the ink discharge port rows of the top plate, the substrates can be closely contacted with the top plate effectively by deforming the",
