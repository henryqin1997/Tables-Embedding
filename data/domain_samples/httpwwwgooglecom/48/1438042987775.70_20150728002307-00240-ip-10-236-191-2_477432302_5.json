    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6280=FIG. 1 is a diagram depicting an example network including a switching mesh. The switching mesh includes a network of multiple switches, for example the four switches (Switch A 106, Switch B 108, Switch C 110, and Switch D 112) shown in FIG. 1. Each mesh switch implement meshing protocols. One implementation of meshing protocols is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,580,715, entitled \u201cLoad Balancing Switch Protocols,\u201d issued Jun. 17, 2003 to Ballard C. Bare, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82174=There are two branches (1506 and 1508) from hop switch D. The first branch 1506 goes to end switch H. The second branch 1508 goes to end switch I., 79030=By tracking the received TRACE_HOP and TRACE_COMPLETE packets, the original mesh switch may determine 1408 whether it has traced the entire broadcast path. For example, this determination may be made by counting the number of hop and end switches within its currently built tree and comparing that number against the mesh domain count (the number of mesh switches in the mesh domain). Alternatively, this determination may be made by checking the branch count field within the hop entries and verifying that an end switch has been found for each branch., 76812=The hop switch may also check 1316 for discrepancies, for example, by verifying that the port is still defined as a mesh port, the switch that is adjacent on that port is the same as in the previous hop entry (indicating that the port may have been disconnected and connected to a different switch), and so on. If such a discrepancy exists, then the hop switch may, for example, discard the packet. If no such discrepancy exists, then the hop switch may proceed to forward 1318 the packet on the above-discussed port., 73419=Switch C is a hop switch because it does have a port within the original mesh switch's bcast path. As a hop switch, switch C sends a trace hop packet back to switch A (the original switch). The trace hop packet may be sent back to switch A using the path defined by the hop entries in the traceroute packet. In this instance, the return path would follow the reverse of arrow 1204, then the reverse of arrow 1202. In addition, switch C forwards the traceroute packet to switch D (arrow 1206)., 79623=Until the entire broadcast path has been traced, the original switch checks 1409 to see if a timeout has occurred. A timeout may occur if the timer started 701 at the initiation of the broadcast traceroute reaches a preset time limit (for example, 30 seconds or another time limit). Upon a timeout, the original switch may assume that the broadcast trace has failed and may, for example, issue an error log 1411 indicating the switch or switches that have not responded and display the information gathered for the broadcast path up to this point. It the broadcast traceroute has not yet timed out, then the original switch continues 1410 to collect trace information from received trace complete and trace hop packets and continues to build the data structure of the broadcast tree., 78634=When receiving the packets, the original mesh switch may add 1406 to a data structure of the broadcast tree so as to build the entire broadcast tree. The reason being that a broadcast path may branch off at the original switch or at a hop switch. Such branching means that there can be multiple TRACE_COMPLETE packets sent back to the original mesh switch., 69020=If acknowledgement of the transmission (or retransmission) of a packet is received so as to indicate a successful transmission, then a trace hop packet is sent 1014 from the hop switch to the original switch. The trace hop packet may be generated by modifying a copy of the received packet, for example, by clearing the TRACE_DISCOVER mode flag and setting the TRACE_HOP mode flag. The trace hop packet indicates to the original switch that this is a new hop in the broadcast path., 80467=Once the entire broadcast path has been traced, the original switch may output 1412 the broadcast tree information. For example, the information may be output by way of a user interface. Alternatively, the information may be incrementally output to the user as the trace progresses before the entire broadcast path has been traced., 75824=The hop mesh switch may then check 1306 to see if its loopbit is set in the marked bits field 310. If its loopbit is clear, then a loop is indicated 1308 in the path back to the original switch. On the other hand, if its loopbit is set, then a loop is not detected 1310 and this switch proceeds to forward this packet back to the original mesh switch., 76236=The hop switch finds 1312 the port on which to send or forward the packet by looking for its entry in the hop entries 318 in the packet; (If there is no such hop entry, then the hop switch may discard the packet.) The input port number 409 in that hop entry is the port on which to send the packet. The hop mesh switch also clears 1314 its loop bit in the marked bits field 310 before sending the packet. This is done so as to be able to prevent loops in the \u201creverse trace\u201d path back to the original switch., 74550=Switch E is an end switch because it does not have any ports within the original mesh switch's bcast path. As an end switch, switch E sends a trace complete packet back to switch A (the original switch). The trace complete packet may be sent back to switch A using the path defined by the hop entries of the packet. In this instance, the return path would follow the reverse of arrow 1208, the reverse of arrow 1206, then the reverse of arrow 1204, then the reverse of arrow 1202., 69541=On the other hand, if no acknowledgement is received of the transmission and retransmissions, then a trace fail packet is sent 1012 back to the original mesh switch. The trace fail packet may be generated by modifying a copy of the received packet, for example, by clearing the TRACE_DISCOVER mode flag and setting the TRACE_COMPLETE mode and TRACE_RTX_FAIL status flags. The trace fail packet indicates to the original switch that the bcast traceroute failed due to a retransmission failure., 73965=Switch D is a hop switch because it does have a port within the original mesh switch's bcast path. As a hop switch, switch D sends a trace hop packet back to switch A (the original switch). The trace hop packet may be sent back to switch A using the path defined by the hop entries in the traceroute packet. In this instance, the return path would follow the reverse of arrow 1206, then the reverse of arrow 1204, then the reverse of arrow 1202. In addition, switch D forwards the traceroute packet to switch E (arrow 1208)., 68665=Issued bcast traceroute packets are added 1008 to a retransmission queue by the hop switch. If a sending switch (in this case, the hop switch) does not receive an acknowledgement within a set period of time (for example, 4 seconds), then the switch retransmits the packet up to N times (for example, up to 2 times)., 81792=There are two branches (1504 and 1510) from hop switch B. The first branch 1504 goes to hop switch D. The second branch 1510 goes to end switch E. There are two branches (1514 and 1516) from hop switch C. The first branch 1514 goes to end switch F. The second branch 1516 goes to end switch G.}",
