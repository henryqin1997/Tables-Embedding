    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38815=[0021] After substrate 14 having coating 18 applied thereon passes through air expulsion nip 28, the coating is cured by means of radiant energy. The choice of a radiant energy source will depend upon several factors, including the chemical nature of the substrate as well as the chemical nature of the coating material being cured. It is important to select a radiant energy source which will not adversely affect substrate 14, e.g. by causing discoloration of the substrate. In one embodiment and as shown in FIG. 1, radiant energy is transmitted from UV lights means 42 into the surface of substrate 14 opposite the surface having coating 10 thereon, i.e., the bottom surface of substrate 14. The radiant energy passes through the transparent substrate and is absorbed by the coating, the latter being compressed between substrate 14 and casting drum surface 26. In one embodiment, the wavelength of the UV radiation is from about 1800 Angstroms to about 4000 Angstroms. The lamp system used to generate such UV radiation may consist of discharge lamps, e.g. xenon, metallic halide, metallic arc, or high, medium, or low pressure mercury vapor discharge lamps, etc., each having operating pressures of from as low as a few milli-torrs up to about 10 atmospheres. The radiation dose level applied to coating 18 through substrate 14 may range from about 2.0 J/cm.sup.2 to about 10.0 J/cm.sup.2. The intensity of the radiation should be selected such that it completely cures the coating compostiion at an economical production rate. When the depth of the microstructure pattern is close to 0.025 mm and the resin contains primarily acrylate functionality, it is possible to complete the curing in less than one second. while keeping the temperature of the curing composition below 50\ufffd C. Greater depths of the microstructure or other resin chemistries might require longer times of exposure to complete the cure. Since the cure is accomplished while the coating is sandwiched against the metal drum, the temperature of the cure is simply controlled by controlling the drum temperature by any conventional means such as circulating temperature-contolled water or oil through the drum., 24945=[0001] THIS APPLICATION IS RELATED TO AND CLAIMS PRIORITY FROM PROVISIONAL APPLICATION No. 60/338,176 FILED ON Dec. 7, 2001, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN., 47116=[0031] Radiation curable coating 18 is of relatively low viscosity, in the range of 1-10,000 centipoise (cPs). In one embodiment of articles for use in optical applications, the viscosity of the radiation-curable coating 18 is in the range of about 1000-5000 cPs. If the coating has a viscosity above this range, air bubbles may become entrapped in the coating composition. Additionally, the composition may not completely fill the microstructure cavities in the pattern master. If the viscosity is too low, the coating may shrink upon curing that prevents the accurate replicating of the microstructure pattern.}",
