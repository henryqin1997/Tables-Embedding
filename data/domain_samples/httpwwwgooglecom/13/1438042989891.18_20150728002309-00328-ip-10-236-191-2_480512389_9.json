No. 6,447,297, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/133,733, filed May 12, 1999, which are all incorporated herein by reference., 82648=Post section 11 may be fabricated of any material to provide a flexible apical portion and a more rigid endodontic and/or coronal or supracoronal portion, such as metal, plastic, ceramic, polymeric, composite, or other material suitable for placement in the mouth. Composite materials include but are not limited to filler reinforced composite materials and fiber reinforced composite materials comprising the reinforcing component in a polymeric matrix material such as those composite materials listed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,717,341 and 4,894,012 to Goldberg et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,039,569 to Prasad et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,220 to Karmaker et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,564,929 to Alpert, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,044 to Sicurelli, Jr. et al., all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The fiber reinforced composite material may comprise fibers in the form of long, unidirectional, continuous filaments which are preferably at least partially aligned and oriented along the longitudinal dimension of the component with alignment normal or perpendicular to that dimension also possible. The fibers may be of uniform or random length, unidirectional or multidirectional, or randomly dispersed, and may be as short as about 3 to about 4 millimeters (mm) or shorter. The fibers may also be in the form of fabric as set forth in copending Ser. No. 09/280,760 filed Mar. 29, 1999 and may include any of the attributes of the post described therein, the contents all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Due to the improved structural integrity, the amount of fibers in the structural component preferably equals at least about 20% by weight (wt %) and preferably about 20 wt % to about 70 wt %. Possible reinforcing fibers, which are preferably used in accordance with U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,717,341 and 4,894,012 to Goldberg et al. (which are herein incorporated by reference), include glass, ceramic, metal, carbon, graphite, polymeric such as cellulose, polyamide, aramid, polyester, polyaramid, acrylic, vinyl and modacrylic, polyolefm, polytetrafluorethylene, mixtures thereof, as well as other fibers known in the art. One preferred version of the device is comprised of unidirectional microfilamentous glass fibers bundled in a resin matrix.}",
