When the WAS content of the aqueous phase had reached 55% by weight, the inflow rates of the sulfonation product and the sodium hydroxide solution were adjusted in such a way that the pH value in the aqueous phase was 6. During introduction of the sulfonation product and the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, 658 kg 20% by weight aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (2% by weight, based on expected washing-active substance) were introduced into the neutralization circuit. After the entire acidic sulfonation product had been introduced into the neutralization circuit, the pH value of the aqueous phase was increased to 6.1 by addition of the remaining sodium hydroxide solution. Throughout the neutralization process, the reaction temperature was kept at 90\ufffd to 93\ufffd C. The aqueous phase could readily be stirred and pump-circulated at any time during the neutralization process., 41351=The fatty acid esters are sulfonated with gaseous SO3 as the sulfonating agent at temperatures in the range from 30\ufffd to 80\ufffd C. The SO3 is contacted with the fatty acid esters after dilution with air or nitrogen, preferably in the form of a gas mixture containing 1 to 10% by volume SO3. The quantity of SO3 is gauged in such a way that the molar ratio of fatty acid ester to SO3 is in the range from 1:1.2 to 1:1.8. This reaction may be carried out in standard reactors suitable for the sulfonation of organic compounds, such as fatty alcohols, alkyl benzenes or olefins, more particularly in falling-film reactors or multistage cascades of stirred tank reactors., 43545=The starting material used was a technical palmitic/stearic acid methyl ester (in % by weight according to chain length in the fatty acid part: 0.2 C12 ; 1.2 C14 ; 61.4 C16 ; 0.9 C17 ; 35.9 C18 ; 0.4 C20 ; average molecular weight 281.5; acid value 1.1; iodine value 0.1; saponification value 202.1). The fatty acid methyl ester was continuously sulfonated with an SO3 /air mixture (5% by volume SO3) in a molar ratio of 1:1.25 in a standard falling-film reactor at a temperature of 80\ufffd C. The resulting reaction mixture was subjected to an after reaction in a holding-time cascade of four stirred tanks with a holding time of 25 minutes. Thereafter the acid value of the sulfonation product was 198. The degree of sulfonation was 96%.}",
