    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{60306=Due to the improvements in the oxygen mass transfer rate achievable in a blood oxygenation application of the present invention by a movement of the tubes 26 relative to the flow of blood therethrough, and specifically including the blood mass transfer boundary layer, the total surface area of the membranes or the tubes 26 which interfaces with the blood may be significantly reduced over existing commercial membrane blood oxygenators. This provides a number of benefits. Initially, this reduces the priming volume of the oxygenator 14. Moreover, for a given blood flow rate, the smaller the surface area of the membrane(s), the less total contact there is between the blood and the membrane(s). In one embodiment of the present invention, the total surface area of the tubes 26 which interfaces with the blood flow may be less than about 0.2 square meters for an infant unit and less than about 1.5 square meters for an adult unit, and is more preferably less than about 0.1 square meters for an infant unit and less than about 0.75 square meters for an adult unit. This can be contrasted with surfaces areas of about 0.4 square meters for typical prior art, infant oxygenators and about 3.0 square meters for typical prior art adult oxygenators. In one embodiment, the tube bundle 22 includes 41 tubes 26 which each have an inner diameter of about 0.1473 centimeters and a length of about 27.94 centimeters, although other membrane sizes and/or configurations may realize benefits associated with the present invention (e.g., the lengths of the blood channels may vary from about 1 centimeter to more than 30 centimeters)., 79237=In summary, the present invention requires that there be relative movement between the membrane and at least one mass transfer boundary layer adjacent thereto in order to reduce the resistance to mass transfer of the same. This relative movement may be affected by membrane movements other than axial as described herein and as noted above Moreover, oxygenator designs having membrane configurations other than tubular may also be utilized as noted above. For instance, relative movement between the membrane and blood mass transfer boundary layer may be achieved in a pleated membrane sheet oxygenator such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,125, issued May 5, 1987 to Gordon et al., and entitled \"Membrane Medical Device\", U.S. Pat. No. 4,455,230, issued Jun. 19, 1994 to Elgas et al., and entitled \"Pleated Membrane Transfer Device Utilizing Potting and Thixotropic Adhesive\", and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 970,781, filed Nov. 3, 1992, and entitled \"Exchanger and Method for Manufacturing the Same\", the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. Generally and again referring to FIG. 13A, in the pleated sheet membrane oxygenator 184, the above-described types of connectors 186 interconnect the inlet and outlet manifolds 192 of the oxygenator 184 with an appropriate tubing conduit 194. As such, an axial reciprocation of the oxygenator 184 is employed (drive assembly not shown) such that there would be relative movement between the pleated sheet(s) 188 which define the blood channel(s) and the blood mass transfer boundary layer adjacent thereto (e.g., an axial reciprocation along the direction of the apices of the pleats in which the blood flows in this same general direction). Moreover, relative movement between the membrane and blood mass transfer boundary layer may be achieved in a flat membrane sheet oxygenator (e.g., axial reciprocation parallel with the direction of the sheet). In addition and referring to FIG. 13B an oscillatory-like motion may be utilized for an oxygenator 184 as noted above.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. For instance and as noted, the present invention may be used in medical device applications other than oxygenators. In the case where the present invention is incorporated into a dialyzer, there is both a blood mass transfer boundary layer and a dialysate mass transfer boundary layer which are of substantially equal resistance. In this case, relative movement may be provided between the membrane and each of the mass transfer boundary layers. However, the present invention only requires that there be relative movement between the membranes and at least one mass transfer boundary layer. As such, the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the above teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present invention. The embodiments described hereinabove are further intended to explain best modes known of practicing the invention and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention in such, or other embodiments and with various modifications required by the particular application(s) or use(s) of the present invention. It is intended that the appended claims be construed to include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted by the prior art.
