The logic circuit comprises block specifying means, and, according to a single strobe signal, specified heating arrays are operated all at once, and what is called dynamic division drive is carried out. Since dynamic division drive can be conducted with a single strobe signal line, the number of port outputs on the control side such as a printer control circuit can be extremely reduced compared to the conventional one. Further, on the side of the small size printer, the number of terminals of the connector and the flexible board leading to the external can be reduced. In addition, independently of the type of the thermal head, a connector of the same pin arrangement can be used. Further, according to the present invention, the logic circuit comprises a transfer control means for conducting transfer control of history data and print data. By this, data transfer from the side of the printer control circuit to the side of the thermal printer is conducted efficiently, and what is called history control drive is improved, and thus, a small size printer which is easy to use is obtained. Further, the logic circuit comprises a data operation means, and the history data can be",
