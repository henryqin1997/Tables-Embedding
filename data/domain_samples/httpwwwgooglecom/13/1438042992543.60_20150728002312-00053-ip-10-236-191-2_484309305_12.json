While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Further, the arrangements described can be used with respect to components other than connectors, that comprise housings formed of insulative materials which carry elements to be fused onto a PWB or other electrical substrate. It will be appreciated that electrical connector and the method of its manufacture has been described in which the connector that can utilize BGA technologies for mounting on a PWB. Surprisingly and unexpectedly it was also found that there was a relatively high degree of uniformity in the profiles of the solder balls and, in particular, in the weights and/or volume of the solder balls. c and 28 d. There was only one short between adjacent signal contacts and good connections were made between the contacts and the solder balls and between the solder balls and the boards at all other points.
