One of digital I/F bus systems of this kind is an IEEE 1394 serial bus., 77477=If changed to the digital video (moving image camera/recorder), the flow advances to Step S4 to perform the unit control corresponding to the system configuration of the digital video, at Step S5 the C & S register 10 is set for use with the digital video, and at Step S6 the address setting of the I/F control and address conversion circuit 7 is changed in order to set the node information of the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 to have the information stored in the first configuration ROM 8., 61182=Data transfer becomes possible after the physical addresses are assigned. In the case of 1394 serial buses, however, prior to the data transfer, the root node arbitrates bus use privileges., 41157=In order to deal with nodes having various functions, the IEEE 1394 serial bus is generally provided with, in addition to a protocol common to IEEE 1394, other different communication protocols. In this specification, a common protocol independent from functional units of each equipment, although it is specific to each serial bus such as IEEE 1394 serial bus, is called a fundamental protocol, whereas a protocol dependent upon each functional unit is called a subsidiary communication protocol., 74049=Upon detection of an activation of the video/camera switch 12, the controller 6 temporarily stops the bus control of the 1394 I/F circuit 5 in order to execute the resetting of the 1394 serial bus 13 and the reconfiguration of the bus management configuration., 79149=As described so far in detail, according to the embodiment, different subsidiary communication protocols are selectively used to perform data communication via the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5. In this case, the equipment (having the structure such as shown in FIG. 5) having a plurality of units unable to operate at the same time is not required to have the C & S register independently for each unit. Even if the node information is required to be changed upon connection of a new equipment, the management configuration of the 1394 serial bus 13 can be reconfigured automatically., 51462=The functions of a bus manager and an isosynchronous resource manager are included in this serial bus management. These hardware and firmware are the fundamental constituents of the 1394 serial bus. Namely, the fundamental protocol of the 1394 serial bus described previously is configured by the firmware up to this transaction layer., 68592=FIG. 9 shows the contents of data to be transmitted by a subsidiary communication protocol of the digital moving image camera/recorder (first unit) or digital still image camera/recorder (second unit), the data being arranged in a data packet transmitted by the 1394 fundamental communication protocol. Each packet is added with a packet header corresponding to the fundamental communication protocol of a 1394 serial bus, and data corresponding to each subsidiary communication protocol is added to a payload area., 71720=The AV/C protocol is a well known subsidiary communication protocol, and defines a real time data transfer protocol using 1394 isochronous data transfer and an isochronous data flow control. For the real time transfer, the AV/C protocol defines a CIP (Common Isochronous Packet). As shown in FIG. 10A, a CIP and real time (AV) data are stored in the data field of the isochronous packet., 50459=FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing the functional structure of the 1394 serial bus., 48189=FIG. 1 shows an example of a network system configured by using 1394 serial busses. This system has equipments A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H and twist pair cables of 1394 serial busses interconnecting A and B, A and C, B and B, D and E, C and F, C and G, and C and H. These equipments A to H may be PCs, digital VTRs, DVDs, digital cameras, hard disks, printers, monitors, and the like., 76183=At the same time, PC sends a command which is stored in the C & S register 10 to set the equipment as the digital still image camera/recorder. During this time, the digital moving image camera/recorder (first unit) is transparent from the 1394 serial bus 13., 47768=Communication systems using 1394 serial busses have been proposed as communication systems for multiplex transfer of digital data and control data via digital busses to and from various types of digital equipments such as digital video tape recorders (hereinafter called VTRS) and digital television receivers (hereinafter called TVs)., 54760=A cable of a 1394 serial bus is constituted of three sets of shielded paired wires. Paired wires of each set-are used for transfer of protocol signals and data and for supply of electric power. Even if the system has an equipment whose power source is turned off, the operation of the whole system is ensured., 77994=If it is judged at Step S3 that the equipment has been changed to the digital camera (still image camera/recorder), the flow advances to Step S7 to perform the unit control corresponding to the system configuration of the digital camera, at Step S8 the C & S register .LO is set for use with the digital camera, and at Step S9 the address setting of the I/F control and address conversion circuit 7 is changed in order to set the node information of the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 to have the information stored in the second configuration ROM 9., 48778=Each equipment has a unique ID so that all the equipments interconnected by 1394 serial busses in one network can be identified. The digital equipments are sequentially connected by a single 1394 serial bus cable, and each equipment provides a repeater function to form one network. A Plug & Play function, which is characteristic of the 1394 serial bus, allows automatic recognition of an equipment and its connection state when it is connected by a cable to the network., 64749=Reference numeral 6 represents a system control circuit (controller) which is constituted of a microcomputer, a memory and the like. The controller 6 has an I/F control and address conversion circuit 7 which transfers, between the controller 6 and 1394 I/F circuit 5, node information and command/status information contained in the data transmitted from the 1394 I/F circuit to the 1394 bus 13., 46022=FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an address space allocation of a serial bus of IEEE 1394., 65164=Reference numeral 8 represents a first configuration ROM (CR1) which constitutes the already-described configuration ROM. This first configuration ROM stores node information for a first protocol which is used for the transmission via the 1394 bus 13 of the moving image signal sig1 and its associated command/status information, the moving image signal being obtained by a digital moving image camera/recorder (first unit) realized by a combination of the image pickup unit 1 and video processing unit 2. Proper node information in this operation state of the equipment is stored in advance in the first configuration ROM 8 during the manufacture., 64347=Image data supplied from the video processing unit 2 or digital camera processing unit 3 can be recorded or reproduced by a recording/reproducing unit 20 without being transmitted via the 1394 bus. The reproduced data may be transmitted via the 1394 bus. The recording/reproducing unit 20 includes recording media and other necessary equipments for recording/reproducing operations., 51817=On the other hand, an application layer in a software portion is made of software defined by the above-described subsidiary communication protocols, and changes with each software. Namely, this application layer defines what type of data is transmitted over the 1394 serial bus., 54332=The system shown in FIG. 5 is provided with digital equipments including: a PC (personal computers), a TV, a VTR, and a camera/recorder (hereinafter called a CAM) having a function of picking up a moving image and a still image. 1394 serial buses connect CAM and TV, TV and PC, and PC and VTR. Each of these digital equipments has a function of repeating digital data and control data on the 1394 serial bus., 50565=As shown in FIG. 2, the 1394 serial bus is configured as a layer (hierarchical) structure. The constituent at the lowest physical level is a 1394 serial bus cable whose connector is connected to a connector port. At the level higher than this connector port, a physical layer and a link layer are provided as hardware., 69372=It is assumed that the electronic equipment of this embodiment having the structure shown in FIG. 7 operates as the digital moving image camera/recorder and communicates with another node by supplying node information onto the 1394 bus 13 via the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5, under the first subsidiary communication protocol stored in the first configuration ROM (CR1) 8., 75593=In operation of the electronic equipment of this embodiment as the digital still image camera/recorder, a partner node is generally and presumably a personal computer (PC). In such a case, an image signal picked up with the image pickup unit 1 is converted by the camera processing unit 3 into image data matching the format requested by PC. This image data is supplied as a baseband image signal sig2 to PC via the switch circuit 4, 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5, and 1394 bus 13. In this case, the above-described still image subsidiary communication protocol is used., 55089=The fundamental structure of each digital equipment, for example, VTR is constituted of: a deck unit; a tuner unit; an operation unit used as user interface; a display unit; a microcomputer for the control of the whole operation, for the generation of communication packets, for the storage of addresses, and the like; a digital interface (digital I/F) unit of 1394 serial buses; and a switch unit for switching between the deck unit, tuner unit, and digital I/F unit. The fundamental structure of TV is constituted of a monitor unit and an amplifier unit in place of the display unit; and deck unit of VTR. The fundamental structure of CAM is constituted of a camera unit in place of the tuner unit. The fundamental structure of PC is constituted of a CPU, an operation unit, and an image processing unit, and similar to other digital equipments, of a switch unit and a digital I/F unit., 45794=FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an example of a communication system configured by using a serial bus of IEEE 1394., 67282=Reference numeral 14 represents a control signal and its command/status signal for the 1394 I/F circuit 5, reference numeral 15 represents a control signal for the switch circuit 4, reference numeral 16 represents a control signal for the video processing unit 2, reference numeral 17 represents a control signal for the camera processing unit 3, reference numeral 18 represents a control signal for the image pickup unit 1, and reference numeral 21 represents a control signal for the recording/reproducing unit 20., 67818=FIG. 8 is a diagram showing node information of CAM as viewed from the 1394 bus 13, the node information being mapped in the configuration ROM and the unit controlling command/status register. As shown, in this embodiment, the configuration ROM is constituted of the first and second configuration ROMs 8 and 9 (CR1, CR2)., 47496=First, a system on which the embodiments are based will be described, this system being a communication system between a plurality of electronic equipments interconnected by serial busses of IEEE1394-1995 (hereinafter simply called 1394 serial busses)., 74937=Thereafter, in order to reconfigure the management configuration of the 1394 serial bus 13 under the reset state, the bus interconnection of the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 is recovered. In this manner, the electronic equipment of this embodiment is newly defined as the digital still image camera/recorder having the still image subsidiary communication protocol, in accordance with the new bus management configuration and the node information in the second configuration ROM 9. This new definition is detected by the root node which controls the bus management of the system shown in FIG. 5, and therefore recognized by the system., 66984=Reference numeral 12 represents a video/camera switch which selects the operation of the electronic equipment of this embodiment as viewed from the 1394 bus 13, either as the digital moving image camera/recorder (first unit) or digital still image camera/recorder (second unit)., 65832=Reference numeral 9 represents a second configuration ROM (CR2). This second configuration ROM stores node information for a second protocol which is used for the transmission via the 1394 bus 13 of the still image signal sig2 and its associated command/status information, the still image signal being obtained by a digital still image camera/recorder (second unit) realized by a combination of the image pickup unit 1 and camera processing unit 3. Proper node information in this operation state of the equipment is stored in advance in the second configuration ROM 9 during the manufacture., 59009=Each node notifies a partner node connected by the 1394 serial bus that the partner is a parent. In this case, the first notice has a priority. The parent/child relationship of this system is finally determined, namely, the hierarchical structure of the system and a root node which is not a child of any node are determined., 72706=The AV/C protocol prepares a FCP (Function Control Protocol) in order to control equipments on the 1394 serial buses. This FCP packet frame is transmitted by using an asynchronous packet for the control of transmission/reception of the control command., 74329=The digital still image camera/recorder (second unit) is reconfigured and the C & S register 10 is set for use with the digital still image camera/recorder. Next, in order to change the node information of the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 from the first configuration ROM 8 to the second configuration ROM 9, the address setting of the I/F control and address conversion circuit 7 is changed. Namely, since the configuration ROMs 8 and 9 are located at different addresses in the above-described address space, the address setting is changed to select the second configuration ROM 9., 76837=Referring to FIG. 11, at Step Sl the controller 6 checks whether there is a change in the device mode, i.e., whether the video/camera switch 12 is activated. If a mode change is detected, the flow advances to Step S2 whereat the resetting operation of the 1394 serial bus 13 starts and the bus control by the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 is temporarily stopped., 55997=Communications are performed by using 1394 serial buses at a predetermined communication cycle (125 \u03bcs) as illustrated in FIG. 6. Time sequential data such as video data and audio data is transmitted through isochronous communication which ensures a transmission bandwidth at a predetermined data rate, and control data such as control commands is transmitted through asynchronous communication when it becomes necessary., 70631=In this state, the digital still image camera/recorder (second unit) is transparent from the 1394 serial bus 13. In this case, for example, the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 can be used as a dubbing terminal of communication to another digital moving image camera/recorder. A subsidiary communication protocol used in this case is an IEEE 1394 AV/C protocol., 52887=The first 512 bytes of the register space include a kernel of a known CSR architecture, and the next 512 bytes are used as a serial bus register. The specific contents of these areas are well known and the detailed description thereof is omitted. These areas and the next 1024-byte configuration ROM and a portion of a unit space are implemented on each equipment., 66854=The 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 and controller 6 constitute the interface control device of this embodiment., 52115=Next, with reference to FIG. 3, addressing of the 1394 serial bus will be described. As shown, an address space of a 64-bit width in conformity with IEEE 1212 regulations is defined for the 1394 serial bus. The first 10 bits of the 64-bit address are called a bus ID which is used for the discrimination between busses. The next 6 bits are called a node ID which is used for the discrimination between equipments. The remaining 48 bits are used as an address space which can be used solely by each equipment., 48123=The 1394 serial bus will be briefly described., 63965=Reference numeral 4 represents a switch circuit for selecting either a moving image signal sig1 from the video processing unit 2 or a still image signal sig2 from the camera processing unit 3 and supplies it via another switch circuit 22 to a 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5. This 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5 includes a reset circuit 19 for a 1394 serial bus 13., 45925=FIG. 2 is a diagram showing the layer structure of a serial bus of IEEE 1394., 78567=After the processes at Steps S4 to S6 or Steps S7 to S9, the reset state of the 1394 serial bus 13 started at Step S2 is released to recover the bus connection of the 1394 serial bus I/F circuit 5. At Step S11 the root node executes a new bus management process after the system change and recognizes the equipment of this embodiment either as the moving image camera/recorder having the AV/C protocol or as the still image camera/recorder having the still image subsidiary communication protocol, in accordance with the contents of the configuration ROM 8 or 9., 69766=In this case, the compressed moving image signal sig1 obtained by the video processing unit 2 is the data in conformity with the SD format of the DVC format, i.e., the variable length coded data after discrete cosine transformed, and is a signal having the format corresponding to the video track with sub-code data and AUX data. Such a moving image signal sig1 is transmitted via the switch circuit 4 and 1394 I/F circuit 5 in the isochronous communication mode.}",
