If the respective cover layers are harder than the above range, the initial velocity of the ball may be too high, as a result of which it may not be possible to reduce the distance of the ball. Conversely, if the respective cover layers are too soft, the ball may take on too much spin when hit with an iron and assume a high trajectory, which may result in an excessive decrease in the distance traveled by the ball. As used herein, the Shore D hardness of a cover layer is the value measured for a sheet-like specimen using a type D durometer in accordance with ASTM D2240., 131152=The flight-performance was rated as follows. In the tests conducted with a number one wood (W#1) at head speeds of 50 and 40 m/s, balls for which the total distance decreased at least 4 m relative to the total distance achieved using the Tour Stage <X\u22c601S> (2006 model) as the standard ball were rated as \u201cgood.\u201d, 39327=The golf ball of the invention may be formed to a diameter of generally at least 42.67 mm, and preferably from 42.67 to 43.00 mm, and to a weight of generally from 45.0 to 45.93 g. Moreover, to achieve the objects of the invention, it is desirable for the inventive golf ball to comply with the 2006 R&A Rules of Golf. Specifically, it is desirable for the golf ball to: (1) not pass through a ring having an inside diameter of 42.672 mm, (2) have a weight of not more than 45.93 g, and (3) have an initial velocity of not more than 77.724 m/s., 115495=Aside from setting the durometer indenter perpendicular to the curved surface of the core, the Shore D hardness at the surface of the core was measured in accordance with ASTM D2240. To measure the Shore D hardness at the center of the core, the core was cut into two halves, and the hardness at the center of the cut face was measured in accordance with ASTM D2240., 30175=The core has a surface hardness, in Shore D hardness units, of generally at least 25 but not more than 60, preferably at least 30 but not more than 57, and more preferably at least 35 but not more than 47. The core has a center hardness, in Shore D hardness units, of generally at least 25 but not more than 43, preferably at least 28 but not more than 40, and more preferably at least 32 but not more than 37. The Shore D hardness is a measured value obtained with a type D durometer in accordance with ASTM D2240. In measuring the surface hardness of the core, measurements were taken after setting the indenter substantially perpendicular to the curved surface. For both the surface and center of the core, hardness values that are too high tend to result in too hard a feel on impact and an excessive initial velocity which may make it impossible to achieve a distance-reducing effect. Conversely, hardness values that are too low may give the ball too soft a feel or may lower the rebound too much, possibly resulting in an excessive reduction in the distance traveled by the ball., 115976=The cover composition was formed under applied heat and pressure to a thickness of about 2 mm, and the resulting sheet was held at 23\ufffd C. for 2 weeks, following which the Shore D hardness was measured in accordance with ASTM D2240.}",
