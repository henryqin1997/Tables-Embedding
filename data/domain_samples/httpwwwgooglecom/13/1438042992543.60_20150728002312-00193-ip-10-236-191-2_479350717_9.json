The vessel was attached to an automated ethoxylation unit and was heated to 50\ufffd C. The vessel was continuously purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes and was then heated to 100\ufffd C. where it was again continuously purged with nitrogen for another 15 minutes. The vessel was then heated to 140\ufffd C. and was given a series of 6 purges by pressuring the vessel up to 80 psi, and then venting. Once the venting process was complete, the vessel was pressured to 20 psi with nitrogen., 54095=The macromonomer compounds useful in this invention can be prepared by a number of conventional processes, except for inclusion of the complex hydrophobe compounds described herein. Illustrative processes are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,514,552, 4,600,761, 4,569,965, 4,384,096, 4,268,641, 4,138,381, 3,894,980, 3,896,161, 3,652,497, 4,509,949, 4,226,754, 3,915,921, 3,940,351, 3,035,004, 4,429,097, 4,421,902, 4,167,502, 4,764,554, 4,616,074, 4,464,524, 3,657,175, 4,008,202, 3,190,925, 3,794,608, 4,338,239, 4,939,283 and 3,499,876. The macromonomers can also be prepared by methods disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 887,645, filed May 29, 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other macromonomer compounds which may be useful in this invention include complex hydrophobe-containing oligomers disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 887,646, filed May 29, 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference., 87037=The foregoing and numerous other useful nonionic, anionic, cationic, and amphoteric surfactants are described in the literature, such as McCutcheon's Detergents & Emulsifiers 1981 Annual, North America Edition, MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock, N.J. 07452, U.S.A., incorporated herein by reference., 180860=Polymer solutions were titrated with water and 30 RPM Brookfield viscosities (centipoise) were measured at room temperature (20\ufffd C.) and at 0\ufffd C. in a thermostated bath. The results are given in Table S below. The polymer solutions at 0 grams added water contained 0.5% polymer solids identified in Table S, an amount (weight percent based on total solution) of Tergitol\ufffd 15-S-5 nonionic surfactant identified in Table S, 1:1 ethylene glycol: water solvent mixture and a pH=9.0.

Polymers having a backbone containing urethane units are within the scope of this invention., 175638=Polymer solutions were titrated with water, and 30 RPM Brookfield viscosities (centipoise) were measured at room temperature (20\ufffd C.) and at 0\ufffd C. in a thermostated bath. The results are given in Table Q below. The polymer solutions at 0 grams added water contained 0.5% polymer solids identified in Table Q, 1:1 ethylene glycol: water solvent mixture and a pH=9.0. Negative grams water added simulates water evaporation (the \"dry-out\" phenomenon)., 126920=To a five hundred milliliter Zipperclave reactor were charged, under nitrogen, 150.2 grams (0.22 mole) of bis(nonylphenoxy) adduct of 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether prepared in Example 14 and 0.30 grams (0.2 weight percent) of BF3 \ufffdEt2 O. The reaction mixture was heated to 80\ufffd C., and 77.5 grams (1.76 mole) of ethylene oxide was fed to the reactor over a two hour period. After all the ethylene oxide was fed, the reaction mixture was allowed to cook out for one hour and then dumped hot, under nitrogen, into a jar containing 160 milliliters of a one percent aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The organic layer was separated from the water layer and washed twice with deionized water. The washes were performed at 90\ufffd C. to facilitate the separation of the two layers. The product was then dried by azeotropic removal of the water, using cyclohexane (300 milliliters) as the entrainer. The cyclohexane was stripped off under vacuum to give a pale-yellow liquid with a molecular weight by end-group MW analysis of 1047 (theoretical MW=995). Ir and nmr spectra were consistent with the expected structure of the product., 110715=While hot (<60\ufffd C.) the organic was transferred to a separatory funnel and was washed once-with 100 milliliters of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layer was drained and the organic was washed two more times with 100 milliliter portions of deionized water. The aqueous layers were decanted and the organic was dried for at least 1 hour over magnesium sulfate. Once dry the magnesium sulfate was filtered from the organic which was stripped of solvent using a rotary evaporator. The final yield of viscous polymer was 100 grams. The GPC molecular weight was Mw=2600 and the Mn=1700 based on monodisperse polystyrene standards., 184175=A steady shear viscosity profile was obtained with a standard Bohlin VOR rheolometer equipped with a temperature control and Mooney-Couette shearing geometry. The polymer solutions contained 0.4% polymer solids identified in Table U below, a amount (weight percent based on total solution) of Tergitol\ufffd 15-S-5 nonionic surfactant identified in Table U and a 1:1 ethylene glycol: water solvent mixture. The results are given in Table U. The viscosity is given in centipoise (cps)., 44503=(C) about 0.1-99, preferably about 5-60, weight percent of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated macromonomers; and, 112223=The ethylene oxide lines were opened to the motor valves along with the main feed line on the Zipperclave. The feed was continued and the vessel pressure was regulated at 55 psi and a temperature of 140\ufffd C. The automation was designed to hold the temperature and the pressure within safe operating limits while addition of ethylene oxide proceeded through a pair of motor control valves. The feed was allowed to continue until 60.0 grams of ethylene oxide (1.362 moles) was added based on a difference weight of the feed cylinder. After the feed was complete, the reaction was allowed to continue for 1 hour after which the vessel was cooled to 60\ufffd C., purged 4 times with nitrogen to 80 psi and was dumped to a container. The final product yield was 115 grams with a theoretical yield of 120 grams. The GPC molecular weight of the product was Mw=3550 and the MN=2930 based on monodisperse polystyrene standards., 50595=Illustrative macromonomer-containing polymers useful in this invention and processes for preparation thereof are disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser.

Various modifications and embodiments can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. A shear stability and water spray endurance test were performed by following the Association of European Airlines Anti-Icing Performance Test Specification for shear stability and water spray endurance as set forth in AEA Material Specification of De-/Anti-Icing Fluid for Aircraft, G6807/R. The fluid contained 49.75 grams of ethylene glycol (polyester grade), 38.90 grams of distilled water, 0.85 grams of latex containing 30 weight percent of P-8 polymer solids and 0.4 grams of Tergitol\ufffd 15-S-5 nonionic surfactant. The fluid was adjusted to a pH of about 8.5 with a 45 percent aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. The results showed less than 5 percent change in viscosity and 70 minutes for water spray endurance. For the shear stability test, the rotation speed and mixing time were twice the specification value (7000 rpm rotation speed and 10 minutes mixing time).
