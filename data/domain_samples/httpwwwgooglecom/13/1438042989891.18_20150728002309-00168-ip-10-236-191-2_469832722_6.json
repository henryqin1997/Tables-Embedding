    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has now been described with reference to preferred embodiments. Variations and substitutions will now be apparent to persons of skill in the art. In particular, a direct mapped instruction cache is utilized in the above described embodiments. However, the principles of the invention are applicable to an associatively mapped cache utilizing a cache refill algorithm. Further, the particular timing and control signals may be varied according to the particular processing environment utilized. Accordingly, the invention is not intended to be limited except as provided by the appended claims. When streaming begins as the result of an arbitrary branch, the target address is uniformly distributed throughout the block. However, if a cache miss occurs as the result of executing through a block stored in the cache 12 then the target address will be the first address in the block. In practice, the miss address is the first address in the block 70% of the time. Thus, the refill latency is reduce. Thus, the system will remain in the STREAM state so long as a stream break event, such as a branch does not occur. However, if a stream break does occur, the REFILL of the cache 12 is completed. Refill then continues during cycles L and M and, during L2 the counter counts out and causes a transition from the REFILL state to the FIXUP state and the generation of the Fixup2 signal. Thus. MUX",
