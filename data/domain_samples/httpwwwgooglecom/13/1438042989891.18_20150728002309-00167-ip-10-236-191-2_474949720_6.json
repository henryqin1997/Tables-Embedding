    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described by way of a preferred embodiment and certain variations and modifications, other variations and modifications can also be used, the invention being defined the following claims. A number of variations and modifications of the present invention can be used. Although the progressive gaming system has been described in connection with gaming terminals such as electronic slot machines and the like, the embodiments of the present invention can be used in connection with a number of user input devices which are coupled together or coupled to a central system including automatic teller machines (ATMs), vending machines, telephone systems, interactive television systems, networked computers such as local area networks, wide area networks, client server or peer-to-peer networks, dial-up computer services such as dial-up internet services, dial-up database services and the like or permanent-node internet communications or database service communications. It is possible to use some aspects of the invention without using other aspects. For example, it is possible to use a three-level terminal-casino-central system for a progressive gaming system without transmitting the identity of a winner or potential winner to central system. In light of the above description, a number of advantages of the present invention can be seen. The present invention provides a progressive gaming system which is not limited to awarding a prize or jackpot by a central system directly to an individual gaming device or terminal.
