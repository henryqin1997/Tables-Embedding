    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail herein, various modifications may be made without departing from the broader scope of the present invention. For example, the scrubbing unit may be a riding model. The scrubbing unit 110 may be provided with suitable controls for turning the pump 137 on and off. Thus, if the pump 137 is in an operating mode, solution will be moved from tank 123 to tank 121, thereby providing for recirculation of the scrubbing solution during the scrubbing operation. Alternatively, the pump 137 may be in an off mode and the scrubbing unit 110 will operate as a single cycle or nonrecirculating unit. Of course, various other controls may be provided for placing the vacuum pump 126 in an operating mode as well as controlling the power provided to the driving wheels 112. A conduit 144 may extend from tank 121 to the nozzles 122 for feeding solution from tank 121 to the nozzles 122. The scrubber 110 has a conduit system 136 including a water pump 137 which is connected to tank 123 by tubing 138. The water pump 137 is connected to a conduit 139 which extends to tank 121. A filter 142 is attached to conduit 138 interiorly of tank 123. The filter unit 142 has a vertically oriented cylindrical filter element 142a which is supported in an elevated position within the tank 123.",
