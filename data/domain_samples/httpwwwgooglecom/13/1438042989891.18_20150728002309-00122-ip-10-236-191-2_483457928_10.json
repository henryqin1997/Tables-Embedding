No. 07/692,403 filed Apr. 25, 1991, now abandoned., 236139=Asymmetric hollow fibers were cast from solutions of 12.5-13.5% poly (acrylonitrile vinyl chloride, PAN-PVC) copolymer in dimethyl sulfoxide (w/w). The fabrication process utilized a dry-wet (jet) spinning technique according to Cabasso, Hollow Fiber Membranes, vol. 12, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Wiley, N.Y., 3rd Ed., pp. 492-517 (1980). Single cell suspensions of BHK cells were prepared using calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salts (HBSS) and trypsin/EDTA. Encapsulation devices were manufactured by mounting a 1-1.1 cm length of dry hollow fiber onto hub with a septal fixture at the proximal end which has loading access for cells to be injected into the lumen of the device. Cells were loaded into the prefabricated capsules as follows: BHK control cells and BHK/hNGF cells were loaded at a density of approximately 107 cells/ml. The BHK cell suspensions, at a density of 2\ufffd107 cells/ml, were mixed 1:1 with physiologic Vitrogen\ufffd (Celtrix, Palo Alto, Calif.), and infused into the capsules through the septal access port. After infusing 2.2.5 \u03bcl of the cellular suspension, the septum was cracked off and the access port was sealed using a light-cured acrylate (Luxtrak\u2122 LCM 24, ICI Resins US, Wilmington, Mass.). The capsules were subsequently \u201ctethered\u201d by placing a 1.5 cm 0.020\u2033 silastic tube over the acrylic hub. The cell-loaded devices were transferred into sterile 5 ml polypropylene snap cap tubes containing 4.5 ml of PC-1 medium. The 5 ml snap cap tube was then placed inside a sterile 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and sealed for transport., 139300=A 2% solution of sodium alginate in physiological saline (PS; 150 mm NaCl) was prepared under sterile conditions. A sterile suspension of pancreatic islets in CRML1066 culture media isolated from adult rats was diluted 1:1 with the alginate solution, for a final concentration of 1% alginate in the islet suspension., 106190=Among the metabolic requirements met by diffusion of substances into the vehicle is the requirement for oxygen. The oxygen requirements of the specific cells must be determined for the cell of choice. Methods and references for determination of oxygen metabolism are given in Wilson D. F. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263, pp. 2712-2718, (1988). The oxygen requirement for islet cells has been applied to coupled diffusion reaction models accounting for diffusional transport from surrounding tissue through the vehicle wall and tissue compartment (core), and used to calculate the expected viability of islet cells in a number of vehicles of different sizes and configurations, after the method of Dionne, K. E., Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1989). For intact pancreatic islets, these calculations agree well with experimental observations., 266955=Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on total RNA extracted from E18 rat brain. The PCR primers that were used were synthesized based on the published sequence (Lin et al., Science, 260, pp. 1130 (1993)) for cloning into the pNUT expression vector (Baetge et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83, pp. 5454-58 (1986))., 184140=The intraperitoneal type 1 fibers induced and maintained normoglycemia for greater than 60 days in seven of nine recipients that received 1000 islets and in all of the recipients receiving 500 islets. None of the recipients of subcutaneous type 1 implants of 500 islets remained normoglycemic for 60 days; three of eight recipients of 1000 islets were normoglycemic for greater than 60 days. Removal of the fibers from these three recipients returned the mice to a diabetic state. Transplants of rat islets in the type 2 fibers produced and maintained normoglycemia in the recipient mice in greater than 80% of either the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous sites with either 1000 or 500 islets. The recipients became hyperglycemic again when the fibers were removed at 60 days. Histologic examination of the removed type 1 and type 2 fibers revealed that they were biocompatible., 200121=The cell/alginate suspension (approx. 20\ufffd106 cells/100 \u03bcl) was placed in a 1 ml syringe. A Hamilton 1800 Series 50 microliter syringe was set for a 15 microliter air bubble, and was inserted into a 1 ml syringe containing the cell solution and 30 microliters were drawn up. The cell solution was injected through the silicone seal of the hub/fiber assembly into the lumen of a modacrylic hollow fiber membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of approximately 50,000 daltons. Ultrafiltration could be observed along the entire length of the fiber. After one minute, the hub was snapped off the sub-hub, exposing a fresh surface, unwet by cell solution. A single drop of LCM 24 was applied and the adhesive was cured with blue light. The device was placed first in HEPES buffered NaCl solution and then in CaCl2 solution for five minutes to cross-link the alginate. Each implant was about 5 cm long, 1 mm in diameter, and contained approximately 2.5 million cells., 70597=The surrounding or peripheral region (jacket) of the biocompatible immunoisolatory vehicle can optionally include substances which decrease or deter local inflammatory response to the implanted vehicle, and/or generate or foster a suitable local environment for the implanted cells or tissues. For example antibodies to one or more mediators of the immune response could be included. Available potentially useful antibodies such as antibodies to the lymphokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and to interferons (IFN) can be included in the matrix precursor solution. Similarly, an anti-inflammatory steroid can be included. Christenson, L., et al., J. Biomed. Mat. Res., 23, pp. 705-718 (1989); Christenson, L., Ph.D. thesis, Brown University, 1989, incorporated by reference., 183069=Rat islets were isolated from male Wistar-Furth rats as described in Example 1 above. The islets were immobilized in alginate gel and encapsulated into 2-cm type 1 or type 2 fibers, 550 or 1000 islets per fiber, as described in Lacy, P. E., et al., Science, 254, p. 1782 (1991)., 256485=Frozen sections were cut (30\u03bcm) on a sliding knife microtome and every seventh section through the septal/diagonal band complex was processed immunocytochemically for choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) and the low affinity p75 NGF receptor (NGFr). Immunocytochemical labeling was conducted according to previously published protocols and briefly consisted of: 1) overnight incubation in PBS containing 0.4% Triton+2% normal serum, 2) 48 hour incubation in the primary CHAT polyclonal antibody (Chemicon; 1:10,000), or NGFR monoclonal antibody (generously provided by Dr. Mark Bothwell; 1:20,000), 3) overnight rinse in PBS+0.2% Triton, 4) 6\ufffd5 minute rinse in PBS followed by a 1.5 hour incubation in the appropriate biotinylated secondary IgG antibody (Vector; 1:100), 5) 6\ufffd5 minute rinses in PBS+Triton, 6) incubation with \u201cElite\u201d Avidin-Biotin complex (Vector, 1:1000) for 1.5 hours, 7) 3\ufffd10 minutes rinses in PBS, 8) incubation in the chromagen solution containing 0.05% 3,3\u2032 diaminobenzidine, 2.5% nickel ammonium sulfate dissolved in 0.1% Tris buffer for 5 minutes followed by hydrogen peroxide (0.01%) for 5 minutes. The reaction was terminated by 3\ufffd1 minute rinses in PBS. Sections were mounted, dehydrated in alcohols and coverslipped. Control sections were processed in an identical manner except the primary antibody solvent or an irrelevant IgG was substituted for the primary antibody. Adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) to aid in cytoarchitectonic delineation., 143442=The relative thickness of the membrane was modified by adjusting the relative velocity of extrusion from the bores, as described in Example 3. The ends of the cylinder were sealed using methods similar to those described in the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/461,999 filed Jan. 8, 1990, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference. The immunoisolatory vehicle so formed was maintained in sterile PS, a balanced salt solution or tissue culture medium prior to implantation., 190097=Previous to this, islets were allowed to settle into a pellet, and resuspended in 1% ungelled sodium alginate solution (solution was prepared by making a 2% alginate solution in H2O and mixing this 50/50 with medium in which islets were cultured). Islet/alginate slurry was gently mixed by stirring and aspirating. Slurry was prepared at the rate of 500 islets in 25 ul alginate per sq cm useable surface area on a single membrane side. This equates to approximately 125 ul and 2500 rat islets for a 1\u2033 sq membrane sheet., 132147=The newly-formed immunoisolatory vehicle obtained by any of the methods described herein can be maintained under sterile conditions in a non-pyrogenic, serum-free defined nutrient medium or balanced salt solution, at about 37\ufffd C., prior to implantation. Lower temperatures (20\ufffd C.-37\ufffd C.) may be optimal for certain cell types and/or culturing conditions. Other holding temperatures and medium compositions consistent with good cell viability may also be used. Alternatively, the vehicle can be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, if a cryoprotective agent such as glycerin has been incorporated into the matrix (Rajotte, R. V. et al. Transplantation Proceedings, 21, pp. 2638-2640 (1989)). In such a case, the vehicle is thawed before use and equilibrated under sterile conditions as described above., 163892=Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were recovered from adrenal glands according to the method of Livett B. G. Physiol. Rev., 64, pp. 1103-1161 (1984) by collagenase digestion and maintained in culture for 10 days to ensure lack of bacterial or fungal contamination. Clumps of chromaffin cells were washed in serum-free medium by centrifugation and resuspended in 1% alginate solution. This cell suspension was used to form a matrix-core, thermo-plastic membrane immunoisolatory vehicle by co-extrusion as described in Example 4. The aqueous precipitation bath comprised a solution of 1% CaCl2 mixed 1:2 with tissue culture medium for a final concentration of 0.5% CaCl2 in the bath. The fiber was incubated in the bath for 6 minutes to allow the alginate to gel, and was then transferred to a petri dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The fiber was visually inspected for regions with good wall morphology, then spot-checked for the presence of chromaffin cells. It was then divided into 4 mm long sections by sealing the ends of the sections with a combination of heat, solvent, and pressure., 25919=Many drugs have been administered intraspinally in the clinical setting, and numerous methods are available to deliver intraspinal medications. For instance, the most common method of intraspinal drug delivery, particularly anesthetics, is continuous infusion by way of spinal catheters. However, the use of these catheters, particularly small-bore catheters, has been implicated in such complications as cauda equina syndrome, a neurological syndrome characterized by loss of sensation or mobility of the lower limbs. In fact, the FDA was prompted to issue a safety alert in May, 1992, alerting Anesthesia Care Providers to the serious hazard associated with continuous spinal anesthesia by small-bore catheters and has taken action to remove all small-bore catheters from the market., 266307=Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegererative disorder of unknown etiology in which midbraid dopaminergic neurons are gradually lost, leading to movement disorders and eventually death. A growth factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, (GDNF) has been described that exhibits an apparent trophic activity for midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vitro (Lin et al., Science, 260, p. 1130 (1993)). These experiments evaluated the in vivo effect on dopaminergic function of delivery of rGDNF using encapsulated genetically modified BHK cells., 137951=A 2% solution of sodium alginate in physiological saline (PS; 150 mm NaCl) was prepared under sterile conditions. A sterile suspension of pancreatic islets in CRML1066 (GIBCO) culture media isolated from adult rats was diluted 1:1 with the alginate solution, for a final concentration of 1% alginate in the islet suspension. The islet suspension was extruded from a single chamber extrusion nozzle into a 1% CaCl2 bath. Once the alginate polyions were crosslinked (approx. 2 min.) and the core containing immobilized islets formed, the core was placed in a 2% alginate solution. The core was then drawn up into tubing with a diameter approximately 500 microns larger then the core and reextruded into a second crosslinking bath of 2% alginate, surrounding the core with a jacket formed of a separate cell-free layer of alginate matrix cross-linked to the core. The thus formed macrocapsule was cylindrical with dimensions of 30 mm length, 800 mm core diameter, and 1 mm diameter core to jacket. The core volume was 15 mm. The core contained 300 islets constituting a volume fraction of 10.6% of the total core volume., 56579=Additionally, a population of feeder or accessory cells can be coisolated within the vehicle. For example, hepatocytes can be coisolated with endothelial accessory cells, Cai, Z., et al., Artificial Organs, 12, pp. 388-393 (1988), or mixed with islet cells, Ricordi C., et al., Transplantation 45, pp. 1148-1151 (1987), or adrenal chromaffin cells can be coisolated with accessory cells which provide nerve growth factor (NGF), a substance needed by the chromaffin cells. In the latter case, fibroblasts which have been transfected with an expression vector for NGF can be used as accessory cells., 147160=Rat islets were immunoisolated in either matrix or liquid core thermoplastic vehicles as described in Example 6. Vehicle dimensions were 800 \u03bcm O.D., 55 \u03bcm wall thickness, 2 cm fiber length. Just under 20% loading density was used. In the case of liquid core capsules,alginate was not included in the cell suspension. In the first experiment, islets were immunoisolated within a matrix. Vehicles were implanted intraperitoneally into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice for a concordant xenograft (i.e., between closely-related species). Free-floating implants were inserted into the peritoneal cavity. Eight animals were implanted with 500-1000 immunoisolated rat islets each. One animal showed no amelioration of hyperglycemia. The others returned to a normoglycemic state (i.e., the plasma glucose levels of these animals returned to a normal range defined as 100-125 mg %) within five days posttransplantation and remained normoglycemic until day 60 when the grafts were removed and the animals again became hyperglycemic. The average results of 7 such experiments are summarized in FIG. 4. The absence of significant fluctuations in plasma glucose levels in these animals should be noted. The recovered immunoisolatory vehicles were inspected for evidence of fibrotic overgrowth, and were assessed for the ability to release insulin in response to glucose perfusion. None of the vehicles had become completely encapsulated with fibroblasts, however in some areas three to five layers of fibroblasts around the exterior of the vehicle were observed. Recovered immunoisolatory vehicles released insulin in vitro following perfusion in response to glucose and theophylline stimulation and histological analysis revealed viable islets with evidence of insulin staining within the cells. The results of the perfusion experiment with glucose and theophylline stimulation are shown in FIG. 5., 95017=The instant invention also relates to a method for making an immunoisolatory vehicle. The vehicles of this invention can be formed either by coextrusion or stepwise assembly. Techniques for coextrusion which can be used to form the instant vehicle are taught in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/461,999, filed Jan. 8, 1990, which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, a coextrusion device similar to that taught by U.S. Ser. No. 07/461,999 is used in making the subject vehicle. The device has a nested-bore extrusion nozzle, the lumen of each bore (inner and outer) being appropriately connected to sterile chambers for delivery of the core and surrounding region materials., 234675=Two human genomic clones (phbeta N8D8, phbeta N8B9) coding for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the \u03b2-NGF gene were obtained from the ATCC. A 440 bp 5\u2032 Sca1-EcoR1 fragment from phbeta N8D8 was ligated to a 3\u2032 2.0 kb EcoR1 fragment isolated from phbeta N8B9. The spliced NGF genomic sequence contained approximately 37 bp of the 3\u2032 end of the first intron, the double ATG sequence believed to be the protein translation start for pre-pro-NGF and the complete coding sequence and entire 3\u2032 untranslated region of the human gene (Hoyle et al., Neuron, 10, pp. 1019-34 (1993)). The combined 2.51 kb \u03b2-NGF fragment was subcloned into the DHFR-based pNUT expression vector immediately downstream from the mouse metallothionein-1 promotor (\u2212650 to +7) and the first intron of the rate insulin II gene (Baetge et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83, pp. 5454-58 (1986). The pNUT-\u03b2NGF construct was introduced into BHK cells using a standard calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method. Mock-transfected cells served as controls in these experiments. BHK cells were grown in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotic/antimycotic, and L-glutamine (GIBCO) in 5% CO2 and at 37\ufffd C. Transfected BHK cells were selected in medium containing 200 \u03bcM methotrexate (Sigma) for 3-4 weeks and resistant cells were maintained as a polyclonal population either with or without 200 \u03bcM methotrexate., 23223=In many disease or deficiency states, the affected organ or tissue is one which normally functions in a manner responsive to fluctuations in the levels of specific metabolites, thereby maintaining homeostasis. For example, the parathyroid gland normally modulates production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to fluctuations in serum calcium. Similarly, \u03b2 cells in the pancreatic islets of Lang rhans normally modulate production of insulin in response to fluctuations in serum glucose. Traditional therapeutic approaches to the treatment of such diseases cannot compensate for the responsiveness of the normal tissue to these fluctuations. For example, an accepted treatment for diabetes includes daily injections of insulin. This regimen cannot compensate for the rapid, transient fluctuations in serum glucose levels produced by, for example, strenuous exercise. Failure to provide such compensation may lead to complications of the disease state; this is particularly true in diabetes. Jarret, R. J. and Keen J., (1976) Lancet(2):1009-1012., 167720=Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were isolated from adrenal glands and maintained in culture for 10 days to ensure lack of bacterial or fungal contamination. Clumps of chromaffin cells were washed in serum-free medium by centrifugation and resuspended in 1% alginate solution. This cell suspension was used as the bore solution for coextrusion in 15% PAN/PVC:DMSO solution. The coextruded fiber containing chromaffin cells was collected in a bath of 1% CaCl2 mixed 1:2 with tissue culture medium. The fiber was left in that solution for 6 minutes to allow the alginate to gel, and was then transferred to a petri dish containing medium. Fiber was visually inspected for regions with good wall morphology, then spot-checked for the presence of chromaffin cells. Capsules were made by sealing the ends of 4 mm long sections with a combination of heat, solvent, and pressure. Capsules were then implanted stereotaxically into the brains of Sprague Dawley rats., 160390=Purified canine islets, prepared according to the method of Scharp and Lacy, U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,160, were dispersed into cell aggregates containing from one to 50 cells according to the following protocol. 1000 canine islets were rinsed 3 times with 50 ml of Ca++ and Mg++ free Hanks medium containing 1 mm EDTA. After the final rinse, islets were centrifuged into a pellet at 100\ufffdg for 8 min., 10\ufffd C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the same medium per 1000 islets. This slurry was agitated for 8 min. at 24\ufffd C. using a hand held micro-pipet. At the end of 8 min., trypsin and DNAse were added to final concentrations of 25 ug/ml and 2 ug/ml respectively. The slurry was further agitated by repeated pipetting for approximately 5 min at which time microscopic examination indicated that the largest aggregates consisted of no more than about 50 cells. The digestion was quenched by adding 10 ml of cold DMEM with 10% new born calf serum per 1000 islets. Aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation at 250\ufffdg for 6 min. Aggregates were cultured in Ham's F12 with 25% horse serum overnight during which time limited reaggregation occurred resulting in a volume average aggregate size of approximately 35 um., 242929=Tissue was cut at 40 \u03bcm intervals on a cryostat and mounted onto polylysine coated slides. Alternating sections were taken throughout the striatum and processed for immunocytochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) according to the following protocol: 1) overnight incubation in PBS containing 0.8% Triton X-100+10% normal serum, 2) 48 hr incubation with primary antibody (goat antiserum to ChAT; Chemicon) at a dilution of 1:1000 or (rabbit antiserum to GFAP at a dilution of 1:5,000), 3) 6\ufffd5 min rinses in PBS+0.2% Triton X-100 followed by a 1.5 hour incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody (1 gG), 4) 6\ufffd5 min rinses in PBS+0.2% Triton X-100, 5) incubation with Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC, Vector Elite) for 1.5 hours, 6) 3\ufffd5 min rinses in PBS, 7) 5 min rinse in distilled water, 8) incubation DAB (0.05%)+2% nickel ammonium sulfate (ChAT only) dissolved in 0.1% Tris buffer for 5 min followed by hydrogen peroxide (0.01%) for 5 minutes, (9) the reaction was terminated by 3\ufffd1 min rinses in PBS., 205816=Following fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the retrieved capsules were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated in graded alcohol up to 95% and embedded in blycol methacrylate infiltration solution (Historesine Mounting Medium, Reichert-Jung). Three micron thick sections were cut on a microtome (Supercut 2065, Leica), mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet. For immunohistochemistry the capsules were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in 5% agarose and cut on a cryostat (Cryocut 1800, Leica). The immunostain consisted of a mouse monoclonal antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase (Boehringer Mannheim) using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) technique and diaminobenzidine (DAB) coloration., 89416=The instant vehicle must provide, in at least one dimension, sufficiently close proximity of any isolated cells in the core to the surrounding tissues of the recipient, including the recipient's bloodstream, in order to maintain the viability and function of the isolated cells. However, the diffusional limitations of the materials used to form the vehicle do not in all cases solely prescribe its configurational limits. Certain additives can be used which alter or enhance the diffusional properties, or nutrient or oxygen transport properties, of the basic vehicle. For example, the internal medium can be supplemented with oxygen-saturated perfluorocarbons, thus reducing the needs for immediate contact with blood-borne oxygen. This will allow isolated cells or tissues to remain viable while, for instance, a gradient of angiotensin is released from the vehicle into the surrounding tissues, stimulating ingrowth of capillaries. References and methods for use of perfluorocarbons are given by Faithful, N. S. Anaesthesia, 42, pp. 234-242 (1987) and NASA Tech Briefs MSC-21480, U.S. Govt. Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively for clonal cell lines such as PC12 cells, genetically engineered hemoglobin sequences may be introduced into the cell lines to produce superior oxygen storage. NPO-17517 NASA Tech Briefs, 15, p. 54., 238730=The coating solution was withdrawn from the wells and the wells were washed 3\ufffd with 300 \u03bcl wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl/200 mm NaCl2/1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium azide; pH 7.0). The wells were then blocked with 300 \u03bcl of coating solution containing 10 mg/ml of BSA at room temperature for 30 min. The wells were then washed 3\ufffd with 300 \u03bcl wash buffer. Conditioned medium samples were diluted 1:1 in 2\ufffd sample buffer (the sample buffer is the same as wash buffer, only with 2% BSA), with 10 \u03bcl of the prepared samples loaded into the wells. The plates were covered and incubated for at least 2 hours at 37\ufffd C. or overnight at 4\ufffd C., 63834=In another aspect of the invention, it has been found that a molecular weight cutoff for the jacket considerably higher than that previously contemplated may be employed while maintaining the viability and function of the encapsulated cells. This permits the macrocapsules to be used in applications where the cells secrete a substance of high molecular weight. For this purpose, a macrocapsule with molecular cutoffs in excess of say 80 to 100 kD to as high as 200 to 1000 or 2000 kD or more may be employed in accordance with the present invention., 126616=Many cellular products which are difficult to provide using primary donor tissues can be provided using immortalized cells or cell lines. Immortalized cells are those which are capable of indefinite replication but which exhibit contact inhibition upon confluence and are not tumorigenic. An example of an immortalized cell line is the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. Transformed cells or cell lines can be used in a similar manner. Transformed cells are unlike merely immortalized cells in that they do not exhibit contact inhibition upon confluence, and form tumors when implanted into an allogeneic host. Immortalization can allow the use of rare or notoriously fragile cell or tissue types for the long-term delivery of a chosen product or metabolic function. Suitable techniques for the immortalization of cells are described in Land H. et al., Nature 304, pp. 596-602 (1983) and Cepko, C. L., Neuron 1, pp. 345-353 (1988). Candidate cell lines include genetically engineered beta-cell lines which secrete insulin such as NIT cells (Hamaguchi, K., et al., Diabetes 40, p. 842 (1991)), RIN cells (Chick, W. L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, pp. 628-632 (1977)), ATT cells (Hughes, S. D., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, pp. 688-692 (1992)), CHO cells (Matsumoto, M., et al, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, pp. 9133-9137 (1990)), and beta-TC-3 cells (Tal, M., et al, 1992, Mol. Cell Biol., 12, pp. 422-432 (1992)). Additionally, recombinant cells or cell lines can be engineered to provide novel products or functions and combinations thereof, using a wide variety of techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art., 125652=Techniques and procedures for isolating cells or tissues which produce a selected product are known to those skilled in the art, or can be adapted from known procedures with no more than routine experimentation. For example, islets of Langerhans can be isolated from a large-animal pancreas (e.g., human or porcine) using a combination of mechanical distention and collagenase digestion, as described by Scharp, D. W., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,121. Islets may be isolated from small animals such as rats by the method of Scharp, et al., Diabetes 29, suppl. 1, pp. 19-30 (1980). Similarly, hepatocytes can be isolated from liver tissue using collagenase digestion followed by tissue fractionation, as described by Sun, A. M., et al., Biomat., Art. Cells, Art. Org., 15, pp. 483-496 (1987). Adrenal Chromaffin cells may be isolated by the method of Livett, B. G., Physiology Reviews, 64, pp. 1103-1161 (1984)., 183432=The encapsulated rat islets were implanted intraperitoneally or subcutaneously in mice made diabetic by the injection of streptozotocin. Non-fasting plasma glucose concentrations were determined three times weekly; the diabetic recipients had concentrations greater than 400 mg/dl before transplantation. The loading density was 70 islets per centimeter for 1000 islets and 35 islets per centimeter for 500 islets. Twenty-six mice received fibers intraperitoneally, and 26 received fibers subcutaneously. In each group, 14 mice received fibers containing a total of 1,000 islets and 12 received fibers containing a total of 500 islets., 198376=Hollow fibers were spun from a 12.5-13.5% poly(acrylonitrile vinylchloride) solution by a wet spinning technique. Cabasso, Hollow Fiber Membranes, vol. 12, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Wiley, N.Y., 3rd Ed. pp. 492-517 (1980). The resulting hollow fiber had an outside diameter (OD) of around 900 \u03bcm and a wall thickness of around 150 \u03bcm. The fibers had a hydraulic permeability of 18 ml/min/m2/mmHg and a rejection coefficient of more than 90% for bovine serum albumin. Fibers were impregnated with glycerine for storage purposes., 74641=Syngeneic cells or tissue are rarely available. In many cases, allogeneic or xenogeneic cells or tissue (i.e., from donors of the same species as, or from a different species than, the prospective recipient) may be available. The immunoisolatory vehicle allows the implantation of such cells or tissue, without a concomitant need to immunosuppress the recipient. Therefore, the instant vehicle makes it possible to treat many more individuals than can be treated by conventional transplantation techniques. For example, far more patients suffer from Type 1 diabetes than can be transplanted with human donor islets (in 1990, fewer than about 4,000 suitable cadaver organ donors became available in the U.S. for all organ transplants). The supply of donor porcine or bovine islets is far greater; if these xenoislets are appropriately immunoisolated according to the instant invention, the diabetic condition of a far greater number of patients can be remedied., 244308=For analysis of retrieved capsules, capsules were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution, rinsed in PBS and dehydrated up to 95% ethanol. A 1:1 solution of glycol methacrylate (Historesin, Reichert-Jung, Cambridge Instruments) was then added to the capsules for one hr. Pure infiltration solution replaced the 1:1 mixture and remained for a minimum of 2 hrs. The capsules were then rinsed with the embedding solution, transferred to flat molds, and embedded in glycol methacrylate. Sections 5 \u03bcm thick were sectioned (Reichert-Jung, Supercut microtome 2065), mounted on glass slides and stained for H+E.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted including cell type, and with amphetamine dose and turning direction included as repeated measures. Rats were more active with increasing doses of amphetamine, the main effect of amphetamine dose was statistically significant, F(2,32)=36.90, p=0.0001. The main effect of movement direction was also statistically significant, F(1,6)=19.81, p=0.0004. This asymmetry in movement direction increased as the drug dose increased, the drug dose by turning direction interaction was statistically significant, F(2,32)=8.43, p=0.001, and the movement asymmetry was significantly larger in the rats receiving encapsulated GDNF-transfected bHK cells than in the rats receiving the encapsulated non-transfected bHK cells, the movement direction by cell type interaction was statistically significant, F(1,16)=24.74, p=0.0001. It should be noted that the direction of the movement asymmetry in the rats implanted with encapsulated GDNF-transfected BHK cells was such that they moved more in the direction contralateral to the implant than in the direction ipsilateral to the implant. To determine whether rGDNF has any effect on dopaminergic function in vivo, both cell lines (sense or antisense) or untransfected BHK cells were encapsulated in immunoisolatory polymeric devices and implanted unilaterally into the striatum of normal Lewis rats. In those animals receiving rGDNF, behavioral alterations including movement asymmetries were detected after a 1-2 mg/kg dose of amphetamine. No such asymmetry was seen in the control animals. GDNF mRNA and protein expression was verified in the BHK-rGDNF(sense) cell line",
