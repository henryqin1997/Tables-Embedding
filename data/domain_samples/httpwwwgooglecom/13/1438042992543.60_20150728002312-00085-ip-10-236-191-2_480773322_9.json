    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{90084=The extinction value of a given polarizer depends on the optical bandwidth of interest to the user. For laser applications, narrow bandwidths are sufficient. Privacy window bandwidths must cover at least all of the visible spectrum, while solar energy control windows desirably cover both the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum (400-1200 nm). The multilayer film reflecting polarizer described above is capable of covering any of the above bandwidths., 87130=For example, the multilayered sheet may include ten segments having layer pairs with a combined thickness ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm. Each segment may include between 10 and 50 layer pairs. This polarizer is capable of reflecting light having wavelengths in the range from 400 to 800 nm. Alternatively, the thicknesses of the layered pairs may be continuously graded from 100 to 200 nm. For optical coverage of wavelengths between 400 and 2000 nm, the pair thicknesses should range from about 100-500 nm., 83954=The optical behavior and design of such reflective polarizers is described in more detail in Assignee's copending application, U.S. Ser. No 08/402041, filed Mar. 10, 1995, entitled \"Optical Film.\", 115934=Yet another reflecting polarizer for use in the present invention was constructed. The reflecting polarizer comprised a coextruded film containing 481 layers made by extruding the cast web in one operation and later orienting the film in a laboratory film-stretching apparatus. The feedblock method was used with a 61 layer feedblock and three (2\ufffd) multipliers. Thick skin layers were added between the final multiplier and the die. Polyethylene naphthlate (PEN) with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.47 dl/g (60 wt. % phenol/40 wt. % dichlorobenzene) was delivered to the feedblock by one extruder at a rate of 25.0 pounds (11.4 kg) per hour. Glycol modified polyethylene cyclohexane dimethane terephthalate (PCTG 5445 from Eastman) was delivered by another extruder at a rate of 25.0 pounds (11.4 kg) per hour. Another stream of PEN from the above extruder was added as skin layers at a rate of 25.0 pounds per hour. The cast web was 0.007 inch (0.2 mm) thick and 12 inches (30 cm) wide. The web was uniaxially oriented using a laboratory stretching device that uses a pantograph to grip a section of film and stretch it in one direction at a uniform rate while it is allowed to freely relax in the other direction. The sample of web loaded was about 5.40 cm wide (the unconstrained direction) and 7.45 cm long between the grippers of the pantograph. The web was loaded into the stretcher at about 100\ufffd C. and heated to 135\ufffd C. for 45 seconds. Stretching was then commenced at 20% per second (based on original dimensions) until the sample was stretched to about 6:1 (based on gripper-to-gripper measurements). Immediately after stretching, the sample was cooled by blowing room temperature air at it. In the center, the sample was found to relax by a factor of 2.0., 80912=The multilayered sheet is formed by coextrusion of materials A and B into a sheet, followed by uniaxial stretching in the x direction. The stretch ratio is defined as the dimension after stretch divided by the dimension before stretch. The stretch ratio is preferably in the range from 2:1 to 10:1, more preferably 3:1 to 8:1, and most preferably 4:1 to 7:1, e.g., 6:1. The sheet is not appreciably stretched in the y direction. Material A is a polymeric material chosen to exhibit a stress-induced birefringence, or change in index of refraction with stretching. For example, a uniaxially stretched sheet of material A will have one index of refraction, nAx, associated with the stretch direction (nAx =1.88, for example) and a different index of refraction, nAy, is associated with the transverse direction (nAy =1.64, for example). Material A exhibits a difference in index of refraction between the stretch and transverse directions (nAx -nAy) of at least 0.05, preferably at least 0.10, and more preferably at least 0.20. Material B is a polymeric material chosen such that its refractive index, nBy, is substantially equal to nAy after the multilayer film is stretched. Upon stretching, the value of nBx preferably decreases., 80440=In a preferred embodiment of the device of this invention, the first and second reflective polarizers each comprise a multilayered sheet of alternating layers of materials A and B in which each of the layers has an average thickness of not more than 0.5 \u03bcm. A layer of material A adjacent to a layer of material B comprises a layer pair. The number of layer pairs is preferably in the range from about 10 to 2000, and more preferably about 200 to 1000.}",

The light source was a 12 volt tungsten-halogen lamp. The intensity of the transmitted light was measured with an amorphous silicon photodiode, which is sensitive to visible light only. In the \"closed\" position, the first plate was positioned parallel to the second plate with the birefringent film outward, or farthest from the second plate. To switch to the \"open\" position, the first plate was flipped 180\ufffd so that the birefringent film was inward, or nearest the second plate and between the two polarizers. Two control transmissions were also measured through 1) two glass plates with no polarizers or birefringent film, and 2) two reflective polarizers with polarization orientations in parallel, each laminated to a glass plate. The second control was intended to simulate the presence of a perfectly birefringent film between the polarizers. The remits are shown in the table below:",
