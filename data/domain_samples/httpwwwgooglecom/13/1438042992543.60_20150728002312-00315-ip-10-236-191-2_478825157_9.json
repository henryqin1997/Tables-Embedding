    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6379=Referring now to FIG. 10, a flowchart is shown that describes a method of delivering a seed 220 using the catheter 615 or another similar delivery device. The method begins at step 1010 with the percutaneous transluminal delivery of the catheter 615 to the heart chamber. This may be accomplished in the following manner. First, an introducer is used to provide entry into, for example, the femoral vein or artery (depending on where the seed 220 is to be delivered). The catheter 615 is then inserted so that its distal end is snaked through the inferior vena cava and into the right atrium, for example. Thus, a seed 220 may be delivered in the right atrium. The distal end of the catheter 615 may also be moved from the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle, for delivery of a seed 220 there. The distal end of the catheter may also be pushed through the fossa ovalis, accessed on the right atrial septum, for placement of seeds 220 in the left heart chambers. Alternatively, the distal end of the catheter 615 may be snaked through the femoral artery and descending aorta, through the aortic valve and into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle may be moved through the mitral valve into the left atrium. Navigating the catheter 615 may require that the catheter 615 have some type of navigational capability such as push and pull wires commonly used with electrophysiology catheters.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{189382=The seed 1800 may receive signals using a long loop of wire 1820 wrapped around the core. For example, 99.99% silver wire that is 0.002 inches in diameter and is covered in a polyurethane nylon insulation may be used. The wire 1820 may be wrapped around the core 1805 in any appropriate manner and may comprise, for example, about 900 turns of wire. In general, the voltage induced in the coil is proportional to the number of turns of wire. Wire having a smaller diameter yields more turns when the wire fills the empty volume over the core (nominally 3 mm long gap with 3 mm outside diameter and 1 mm inside diameter). However, smaller diameter wire has a higher electrical resistance, and if the coil resistance becomes comparable to the impedance of the tissue being paced, the net energy delivered to the tissue will diminish. In general the electrical resistance of the wire should not exceed a few hundred Ohms. The measured electrical resistance of the 900 turns of wire 1820 is about 60 Ohms., 191394=In general, the seed 1800 should be small enough to be delivered easily, such as through a 9 French delivery catheter. Exemplary dimensions of such a seed are 5 mm long and 3 mm in diameter. Also, the seed just described may be incorporated with the delivery and anchoring mechanisms discussed earlier in this document. Typical parameters for the seed 1800 would be a voltage pulse amplitude greater than 0.5 volts (with 2 volts being typical), and a pulse duration of approximately 0.4 msec. In addition, to neutralize charge on the electrodes, the electrical waveform that seed 1800 delivers to the tissue will generally have the pacing pulse described above (with the distal electrode being the cathode) followed by a smaller-amplitude, longer-duration pulse of the opposite polarity so that the integral of the waveform over time will be zero., 123902=If the pacing response is found, at step 1050, to be unacceptable, then the seed 220 may be removed and the process may be performed again starting at step 1020. If, on the other hand, the pacing response is found to be acceptable, then, at step 1060, the anchoring means for the seed 220 may be activated, for example, by moving the seed 220 entirely out of the catheter 615 and freeing the proximal tines 750 and 755 from the constraints of the catheter 615 and pushing the lead 735 to release the distal tines 715 and 720. Also at step 1060, the tether to the seed 220 may be released, for example, using the detachment mechanism 745. Having completed the implantation of the seed, it is now possible at step 1070 to begin placement of the next seed 220., 49413=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/971,550, filed on Oct. 20, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,532,933, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 190451=The seed 1800 may also be covered as appropriate to protect the materials in the seed 1800 and to insulate them from the tissue and fluids around the seed 1800. For example, a hermetic epoxy layer 1830 may be applied to the ends of both caps 1810, and another hermetic epoxy layer 1825 may be applied around the outside of the coiled wire 1820. In general, the ring electrodes will not be insulated, though they may otherwise be treated, so that they can deliver sufficient energy to the tissue surrounding the seed 1800. The coil 1105E and/or one or more of tines 1110E, and/or the seed distal curved face 1123E may be electrically connected to and part of the distal electrode 1135E. Alternatively, one or more of 1105E, 1110E and 1123E may be used in place of ring 1135E as the distal electrode.}",
