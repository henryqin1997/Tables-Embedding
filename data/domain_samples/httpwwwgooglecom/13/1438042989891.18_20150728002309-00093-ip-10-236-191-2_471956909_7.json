However, in graphics applications it is known that in order to achieve high quality rendering, if w=0 or 0.0000, the LIRP value must be A and if w=1 or 0.1111, the LIRP value must be B. This is to achieve complete color saturation at the end points. A rounding factor is therefore added to the LIRP value to achieve saturation at both A and B. 0.0001 A is added if w<0.1000. 0.0001B is added if w>=0.1000. These rounding factors force saturation at both ends of the range of w, while tolerating some discrepancies to true linearity at some midpoints., 39505=A more efficient approach to encoding w defines 0.1111 to be one and 0.0000 to be zero. All 16 encodable values where w has 4 bits are now useful. The LIRP equation now becomes:, 51612=What follows is an example of performing the linear interpolation function in both decimal and binary. Consider an example where A=-6, B=6 and w=1/4. In decimal the interpolation function would be performed as follows: ##EQU1## The binary equivalent would be as follows: A=11111010 (2's complement form of -6), 40472=With the addition of this rounding factor, w no longer partitions the range between A and B quite uniformly. The partition between the LIRP values when w=0.0111 and when w=0.1000 can be up to twice as large as the partition between any other two neighboring values of w. The size of this partition is, however, no larger than the size of every partition when w is encoded in the standard way described above., 52080=when inverting the sign bit of A and B, the result is A=01111010 and B=10000110. Performing the calculations in binary: ##EQU2## Adding the two results yields: ##EQU3## When the high order bit is inverted, the result is 11111101, which is the 2's complement representation of the decimal number -3 (the expected result).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, a method and apparatus for performing signed linear interpolations is disclosed. While the currently preferred embodiment is utilized in a computer controlled display system, it would be apparent to one skilled in the art to utilize the present invention in other embodiments which perform a LIRP function. FIG. 5 illustrates in block diagram form, a circuit for carrying out the signed linear interpolation function of the present invention. The circuit adds inverters 501-503 to the circuitry illustrated in FIG. 3a. The input A 301 is coupled to the inverter 501, the input B 302 is coupled to the inverter B 302 and the sum 329 is coupled to the inverter 503. Each of the inverters 501, 502 and 503 will merely invert the high order sign bit of the respective inputs. Although not illustrated in FIG. 5, a means for converting the decimal values into two's complement form would be included. Such a means may be implemented by the software generating the signals. when inverting the sign bit of A and B, the result is A=01111010 and B=10000110.
