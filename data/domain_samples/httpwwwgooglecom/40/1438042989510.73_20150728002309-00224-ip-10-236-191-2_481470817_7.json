This was originally maintained when extending cinema systems from monophonic to stereophonic format for the purpose of ensuring correct localization of the movie dialog for all seats in the theatre. Via home cinema systems, such a loudspeaker arrangement has now been standardized for multi-channel audio as well (according to ITU-R Recommendation BS.775-1, \u201cMulti-channel Stereophonic Sound Systems with and without Accompanying Picture\u201d, International Telecommunication Union, Geneva, Switzerland, 1992-1994). Also, the use of a physical center channel in audio-only systems will make the stereo image less sensitive to variations in the listener's position.}",
