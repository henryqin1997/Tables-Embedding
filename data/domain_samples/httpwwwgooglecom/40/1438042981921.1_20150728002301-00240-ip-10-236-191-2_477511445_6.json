From the above, it will be appreciated that safety penetrating instruments according to the present invention provide increased protection of the sharp tip of a tubular needle while also facilitating use and tip exposure after penetration of an anatomical cavity by providing selective, releasable locking positions for the safety probe. It will be appreciated that the safety penetrating instrument of the present invention is useful to penetrate tissue in various portions of the body, and \"anatomical cavity\" as used herein refers to any area of the body requiring penetration of tissue for access. The safety penetrating instrument of the present invention can be used for penetrating cavity walls in a manner similar to presently used trocars and can have various diameters ranging from 2 mm to 12 mm. The use of a tubular needle in the safety penetrating instrument of the present invention has the advantages of permitting placement of the portal sleeve or cannula in small or large cavities to provide a portal communicating therewith, of permitting a scooping movement during penetration to get through the wall without compressing the cavity when the needles of FIGS. 11, 13 and 15 are",
