Also, a decrease of the load on the linear motors driving the structure and the flow of refrigerant can reduce the amount of heat emitted into the atmosphere from the linear motors. This results in decreasing a change in temperature of the structure and the atmosphere due to heating, which can suppress thermal deformation of structure and fluctuation of the air, thus realizing high accuracy and improvement in reliability of apparatus. Also, because of the design of unit arrangement, assembling of apparatus is easy. The control system can also be realized in such an arrangement, as shown in FIG. 11, that a mechanical diaphragm 37, for example, such as a regulator, is provided on either side of the air supply port and the air exhaust port without using the servo valve. In that case, stability of the regulator needs to be sufficiently high. (4) The above embodiment employs a pressure control system which is a control system for keeping the pressure in the cylinder constant, but the control system can be constructed to drive the servo valve in such a manner that the electric current through the linear motor becomes zero, as shown in FIG. 10, using a value 36 of the current flowing through the linear motor as a feedback signal. In this case, the control can be realized with",
