    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is obvious to one skilled in the art that the basic idea of the invention can be implemented in many different ways. The invention and its embodiments are thus not restricted to the examples described above but may vary within the scope of the claims. The disclosed current measurement method is particularly well suited for use together with the exemplary control principle disclosed above since measurements obtained relatively seldom and mutually non-simultaneously for different phases suffice to satisfy the needs of a control which utilizes estimates. It is essential for the operation of a current observer that a current sample is obtained according to the method either at a beginning/at an end or in a middle of a modulation sequence. If the current sample were taken at a random moment in a modulation sequence, as tends to be the case in connection with the conventional methods disclosed above, the sample would be useless for enabling estimated current to be corrected directly since the estimated current normally represents the actual current either at a beginning, in a middle or at an end of a modulation sequence. , are obtained from block 96, e.g. either directly by replacing the magnitude of current calculated by the observer with the magnitude of a sample or by weighting the samples by a certain weight factor and thus correcting the value determined by the observer.
