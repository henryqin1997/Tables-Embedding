    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6373=It has also been unexpectedly found that the degree of crystallinity in the binder phase can have a pronounced effect on the formation kinetics of the molten skin. The degree of crystallinity at a given temperature may be readily determined from the phase diagram of oxides present in the mixture. For example, in a simple binary system of SiO2 and Na2O, there are three eutectic points, with the lowest one having a liquidus temperature of about 790\ufffd C. and a SiO2 to Na2O ratio of about 3. As sodium oxide concentration is increased, the liquidus temperature increases sharply, to about 1089\ufffd C. at a SiO2:Na2O ratio of about 1:1. This is illustrated in FIG. 1, which provides a phase diagram of SiO2\u2014Na2O. Most other alkali metal oxides behave similarly to sodium oxide. For example, the K2O\u2014SiO2 system has also several eutectic points, with the lowest at about 750\ufffd C. occurring at a SiO2 to K2O ratio of about 2.1. Similarly, Li2O has several eutectic points with one at 1028\ufffd C. and a ratio of about 4.5.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{67843=Typically, the peak firing temperature in the firing step is in the range of about 600 to 2500\ufffd C. more preferably about 800 to 2000\ufffd C. more preferably about 1000 to 1500\ufffd C. and more preferably about 1100 to 1400\ufffd C. However, it will be appreciated that the requisite temperature profile will typically depend on the type of aluminosilicate primary component and blowing agent used. Preferably, the exposure time to the peak firing temperatures described above will be for a period of about 0.05 to 20 seconds, more preferably about 0.1 to 10 seconds., 24930=U.S. Pat. No. 2,676,892 describes a method of forming microspheres from a Macquoketa clay shale by heating particles of the shale to a temperature of 2500-3500\ufffd F. The resulting product undesirably has an open pore structure leading to a relatively high water absorption in an aqueous cementitious environment., 25273=U.S. Patent Publication No. 2001/0043996 (equivalent of EP-A-1156021) describes a spray combustion process for forming hollow microspheres having a diameter of from 1 to 20 microns. However, this process is unsuitable for making hollow microspheres having a diameter similar to that of known cenospheres, which is typically about 200 microns. In spray combustion processes as described in the reference, rapid steam explosion ruptures larger particles thereby preventing formation of hollow microspheres greater than about 20 microns in diameter., 43389=The preferred ratio of primary component to blowing agent will vary, depending on the composition of each of the ingredients. Typically, the ratio of primary component to blowing agent is in the range of about 1000:1 to 10:1, more preferably about 700:1 to 15:1, and more preferably about 500:1 to 20:1., 37694=In one embodiment, the synthetic microsphere comprises an aluminosilicate material having an average particle diameter of between about 30 to 1000 microns and an alkali metal oxide content of less than about 10 wt. %, preferably between about 2 to 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the microsphere. In one preferred embodiment, the total alkali metal oxide content is in the range of about 3 to 9 wt. %, more preferably about 4 to 8 wt. % based on the total weight of the microsphere. In some embodiments, the total alkali metal oxide content of the synthetic microsphere is in the range of about 4 to 6 wt. %, based on the total weight of the microsphere., 28457=In preferred embodiments, the synthetic microspheres incorporated in the building material have an average particle diameter of between about 30 to 1000 microns. In preferred embodiments, the synthetic microspheres comprise at least one synthetically formed cavity that is substantially enclosed by an outer shell. Preferably, the cavity comprises about 30-95% of the aggregate volume of the microsphere., 61357=However, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood by the present inventors that, under the fast reaction kinetics of firing (with a temperature increase as fast as 2000\ufffd C. second), one of the important requirements for rapid formation of a molten skin around the agglomerate precursor is rapid melting of the binder component. Hence, it is preferred that the binder (present as, for example, sodium silicate or sodium aluminosilicate) has a eutectic or near eutectic composition. Preferably, the binder is sodium silicate having a SiO2:Na2O ratio in the range of about 5:1 to about 1:1, more preferably about 4:1 to about 1.5:1, more preferably about 3.5:1 to about 2:1. It will be appreciated that other alkali metal oxides (e.g. Li2O and K2O) can have the same effect in the binder. However, Na2O is preferred due to its low cost., 62293=It was unexpectedly found that when sodium silicate with an about 1:1 ratio of SiO2:Na2O was used as binder to formulate the agglomerate precursor, relatively dense microspheres with a particle density of about 1 g/cm3 resulted. However, sodium silicate binder with a SiO2:Na2O ratio of about 3:1 resulted in microspheres having a lower density of about 0.7 g/cm3. In both cases, the overall concentration of Na2O relative to the agglomerate was substantially the same. Under the principles of traditional glass-making technology, it would have been expected that there would be little or no difference in the final products when using the same amount of fluxing agent. However, the present inventors have found that using a eutectic or near eutectic composition in the binder, a molten skin is formed rapidly during firing, and low density microspheres result, irrespective of the total amount of fluxing agent in the agglomerate., 44995=Preferably, the agglomerate is particulate, having an average agglomerate particle diameter in the range of about 10 to 1000 microns, more preferably about 30 to 1000 microns, more preferably about 40 to 500 microns, and more preferably about 50 to 300 microns., 40983=Furthermore, an average particle diameter of between about 30 and 1000 microns for the synthetic microspheres of the preferred embodiments is advantageous. Particles of this size are known to be relatively safe is building and other materials. When very small particles (e.g. less than about 30 microns) are used in building and other materials, the risk of particulates entering the human respiratory system is greatly increased. This is highly undesirable since it is known that the entry of particulates into the respiratory system is responsible for many potentially fatal diseases, which have been well documented. The risk is increased when composite building materials incorporating the small particles are disturbed, for example, by cutting operations. Hence, the larger average particle diameter of the synthetic microspheres of the embodiments described herein permits the microspheres to be used safely in a range of applications., 19828=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/405,790, filed on Aug. 23, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/471,400, filed on May 16, 2003, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 24418=U.S. Pat. No. 2,978,340 describes a method of forming glass microspheres from discrete, solid particles consisting essentially of an alkali metal silicate. The microspheres are formed by heating the alkali metal silicate at a temperature in the range of 1000-2500\ufffd F. in the presence of a gasifying agent, such as urea or Na2CO3. Again, these alkali silicate microspheres suffer from poor chemical durability due to a high percentage of alkali metal oxides.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the foregoing descriptions of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have shown, described and pointed out some fundamental novel features of the invention, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form of the detail of the apparatus as illustrated as well as the uses thereof, may be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit of the invention. Consequently, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the foregoing discussions. Moreover, in most cases, fiber cement products are cured for up to 24 hours in an autoclave that is maintained at temperatures as high as 250\ufffd C. Microspheres produced according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention lose minimal amount of mass to dissolution, such as by leaching of silica, retain their shape, and continue to have high mechanical strength in fiber cement products, even after exposure to harsh autoclaving conditions. Still a further advantage of one embodiment of the present invention, in its preferred form, is that the microspheres produced have acceptably high chemical durability and can withstand, for example, a highly caustic environment of pH about 12-14 for up to about 48 hours. Thus, microspheres produced according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention can withstand aqueous cementitious environments, such as Portland cement paste. A further advantage of one embodiment of the present invention,",
