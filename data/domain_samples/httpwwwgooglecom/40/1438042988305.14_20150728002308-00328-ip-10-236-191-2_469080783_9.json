Although several embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated, the invention is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangements of the parts so described and illustrated. Thus, having illustrated and described the principles of the invention in a preferred embodiment, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. Thus, because the data is not required to be passed between the four memory controllers A-D 64 a-d, the four memory controller can operation simultaneously and in parallel to perform the pixel copy operation. In the variation containing a second pair of multi-buffer pointers 74-76, steps 120-130 are repeated according to the offsets C and D 74-76. At step 128, the memory controller A 64 a determines whether all the pixels have been copied (i.e., whether the command list 78 is exhausted). If true, the operation is complete and control returns to step 114. Otherwise, the operation continues to the next pixel address (step 130 branching to step 120). Next at step 124, a write address is generated to write the pixel according to the same address of the pixel fill command. However, instead",
