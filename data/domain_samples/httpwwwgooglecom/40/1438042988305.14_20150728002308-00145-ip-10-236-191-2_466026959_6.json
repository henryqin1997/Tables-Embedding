In 1988, a paper was published by Patterson, Gibson, Katz, entitled \u201cA Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID),\u201d International Conference on Management of Data, pages 109\u2013116, June 1988. This paper laid the foundation for use of RAID data storage that would not only improve the data input/output (I/O) rate over that of a comparable single disk data storage system, but would also provide fault tolerance, i.e., the ability to reconstruct data stored on a failed disk.}",

FIG. 5 presumes that the request received in step 50 is for data contained in only one stripe unit By,x. If RAID controller 18 receives requests for data stored in more than one stripe unit, the process shown in FIG. 5 It is noted that the process in Steps 56\u201366 are repeated until in step 64, the new checksum CSnew equates to the existing checksum stored in CSy. When CSnew equates to the existing checksum stored in CSy, the old data Dold stored within stripe unit By,i is considered corrupt, and in step 66, RAID controller 18 overwrites existing data Dold of stripe unit By,1 with the newly generated data Dnew. Thereafter the process ends after the newly generated data Dnew written to stripe unit By,i, is returned to computer system 12 as shown in 72. RAID controller 18 then generates a new checksum CSnew a function of the new data Dnew and data of existing stripe",
