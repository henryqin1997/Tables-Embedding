The skin 31 engages this pacer 41 along its edges 45 and, because the deformation of the skin 31 is sharp as shown at 47 rather than gradual as for the pacer according to this invention, an unsightly .[.protrusio.]. .Iadd.protrusion .Iaddend.is produced. The pacer 11 according to this invention is implanted with its .Iadd.one .Iaddend.side 33 .Iadd.defining its depth dimension .Iaddend.engaging, and neatly seated on, the pectoralis major muscle 27 and the opposite side 35 .Iadd.defining its depth dimension .Iaddend.engaging the skin 31. The pacer fits neatly against the skin 31 and does not produce an unsightly bulge. The catheter 15 is passed over the clavicle 29, is provided with a loop 37 above the clavicle 29 and then is passed through a vein (not shown) to the heart. In FIGS. 6 and 7 there are shown some of the members of the human body in which a pacer is implanted. The section is taken along the body between the head above and the feet below. The members include the ribs 22 between which the intercostal",
