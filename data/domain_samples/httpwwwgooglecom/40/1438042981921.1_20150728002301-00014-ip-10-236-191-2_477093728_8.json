They may be prepared, for example, by the know diphasic interface process from a carbonic acid derivative such as phosgene and dihydroxy compounds by polycondensation (see German Offenlegungsschriften 2,063,050; 2,063,052; 1,570,703; 2,211,956; 2,211,957 and 2,248,817; French Patent 1,561,518; and the monograph H. Schnell, \"Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates\", Interscience Publishers, New York, N.Y., 1964, all incorporated herein by reference)., 14400=Aromatic polycarbonate resins are well known and have long been used in molding compositions for the preparation of tough, dimensionally stable articles. The chemistry, synthesis, properties and applications of polycarbonates are extensively discussed in the manuscript Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates, by Schnell, Interscience, 1964 and Polycarbonates by Christopher and Fox, Reinhold, 1962., 23556=Suitable polycarbonate resins are available in commerce, for instance, Makrolon FCR, Makrolon 2600, Makrolon 2800 and Makrolon 3100, all of which are bisphenol a based homopolycarbonate resins differing in terms of their respective molecular weights and characterized in that their melt flow indices (MFR) per ASTM D-1238 are about 16.5-24, 13-16, 7.5-13.0 and 3.5-6.5 gm/10 min., respectively. These are products of Mobay Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pa., 29124=The polycarbonate resin was Makrolon 2608 polycarbonate, a bisphenol A based homopolycarbonate having a melt flow index of about 11.0 gm/10 min. per ASTM D 1238, a product of Mobay Corporation., 25853=The most preferred are the alkali or alkaline-earth metal complex fluoro-anion salts or complex oxo-anion salts.
