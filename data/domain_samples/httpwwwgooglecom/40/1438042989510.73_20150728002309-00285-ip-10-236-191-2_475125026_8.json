L1 =L2. Turning to FIG. 11, the cable retractor 10 provides a rolling action similar to the action of the involute curve of a gear tooth. This action is a smooth, continuous, rolling action with a minimum of slippage between the cable 100 and the cable retractor 10. The positional relationship of pivot point 80 and R64 (shown in FIG. 6) results in providing this action. Each restrainer segment 30 is connected to an adjacent, substantially identical restrainer segment 30 at pivot point 80. Phantom lines illustrate the smooth continuous movement of adjacent restrainer segments 30. Cable 100 is fixed to the restrainer segments 30 at fixed points 110 by conventional cable ties 92 passing through openings 90 (see FIG. 4). The Greek letter THETA \"\u03b8\" used in FIG. 11 represents the angular arc created as a restrainer segment 30 unfolds with respect to an adjacent restrainer segment 30. The distance \"L1 \" represents the length of cable 100 between the fixed point 110 on web 60 of a restrainer segment 30 and the tangent point (\"T1 \") where the cable",
