It will be appreciated that these examples are merely illustrative of the present invention which is defined by the following claims. Many variations and modifications will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art As discussed above, various embodiments of the present invention permit the collection of network utilization data while ensuring the privacy of individual users. In the embodiments discussed above, the system maintains the IP addresses of users in order to match data collected on the client side with data collected on the merchant side. The use of IP addresses alone can weaken the privacy-protection features of various embodiments of the present invention by providing an identifier that can possibly be traced to a particular user. In this embodiment, the IP addresses are hashed in a manner analogous to user identifiers. The aggregation server 501 retrieves all the information about the user's connections to Amazon.com\u2122 from the collection engine 103; however, that collection engine cannot determine whether a purchase was made. If Amazon.com\u2122 were running a merchant collection engine 106, then a transaction code containing information about the purchase would have been logged. The aggregation server 501 can collect the information from both collection engines and aggregate it into a single database so that the data can be analyzed to determine the actions that led",
