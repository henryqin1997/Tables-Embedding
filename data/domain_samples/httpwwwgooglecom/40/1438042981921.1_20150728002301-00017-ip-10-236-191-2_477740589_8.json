The number and function of such output signal pins are defined in Centronics Engineering Standard, Number 9, Revision B, Genicom Corp., Apr. 9, 1980, IBM Personal Computer Technical Reference Options And Adapters Manual, Number 6322509, IBM Corp., and Standard Signalling Method For Bi-Directional Parallel Peripheral Interface For Personal Computers, IEEE-1284 (1994). Since the other output signal pins in the plurality of output signal pins are identical in both structure and function to output signal pin 105, a detailed description thereof is omitted for the sake of brevity., 35562=The reconfigurable connector of the present invention utilizes a standard parallel connector physical pin arrangement, as described in Centronics Engineering Standard, Number 9, Revision B, Genicom Corp., Apr. 9, 1980 (e.g., Amphenol 57-40360 or its equivalent), IBM Personal Computer Technical Reference Options And Adapters Manual, Number 6322509, IBM Corp., and Standard Signalling Method For Bi-Directional Parallel Peripheral Interface For Personal Computers, IEEE-1284 (1994). Likewise, when operating in its default configuration, also called a first standard configuration, the reconfigurable connector utilizes standard pin assignments, which are also described in Centronics Engineering Standard, IBM Personal Computer Technical Reference Options And Adapters Manual, and Standard Signalling Method For Bi-Directional Parallel Peripheral Interface For Personal Computers cited above.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Likewise, the reconfigurable connector of the present invention can have a physical pin arrangement other than that of a standard parallel connector, so long as the reconfigurable connector includes a pin which can supply power to an interfaced device. The reconfigurable connector of the present invention is described above with respect to a dongle. However, it is noted that the reconfigurable connector of the present invention can interface to any type of device which interfaces to the parallel port of a peripheral, regardless of whether the device interfaces to, or can interface to, a network. It should be noted that the second embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the foregoing optical system for detecting an interfaced device connected to reconfigurable connector 201. Rather, the second embodiment could be modified so as to employ any type of mechanical and/or electro-mechanical or any other feedback as an indication that dongle 280 or its equivalent is connected to reconfigurable connector 201. When an interfaced device which does not have distal arm 280 is connected to reconfigurable connector 210, reconfigurable connector 201 is not configured into",
