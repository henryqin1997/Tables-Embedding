Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Also, before the heating processing on the substrate to be processed, the temperature of a reference sample, which is made of the same material as the substrate to be processed and set to a desired temperature, is measured by a radiation thermometer or a thermocouple for temperature correction embedded in a reference sample. Based on the data obtained from the measurement, correction is made to the measurement value of the radiation thermometer. As a result of this, influences from drifting of the radiation thermometer are eliminated, so that dimension errors among a plurality of substrates to be processed can reduced to be very small. As has been specifically described, according to the present invention, the measurement wavelength of the radiation thermometer is set within a range of 2.7 to 2.8 \u03bcm or at 4.3 or more when the temperature of the surface of the substrate to be processed is measured in a non-contact manner by a radiation thermometer, in a heat treatment method and a heat treatment apparatus by which the substrate to be processed",
