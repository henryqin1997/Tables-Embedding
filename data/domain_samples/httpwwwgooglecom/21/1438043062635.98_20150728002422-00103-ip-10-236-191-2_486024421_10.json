No. 5,446,747. This type of code has attracted much attention in the digital transmission field because of its bit error rate performance close to the Shannon limit. The Turbo encoder as originally proposed consists of two recursive systematic convolutional coders. The two encoders receive the same information bits, but the input of one of the encoders is connected to an interleaver so that the order of the input bits is scrambled., 53571=In the decoder 34, the bits are demodulated and a probability is estimated for each bit. The demodulated bits are separated into data bits d, non-interleaved parity bits p and interleaved parity bits q according to the format used for transmission. The bits are then decoded using a MAP decoder, of the type known from example from \u2018Implementation and performance of a serial MAP decoder for use in an iterative turbo decoder\u2019, S. S. Pietrobon, IEEE Int. Symp. Inform. Theory, Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, September 1995., 29712=Parallel concatenated encoders using constituent codes other than convolutional codes have also been proposed, for example in the article \u2018Unveiling Turbo Codes: Some Results on Parallel Concatenated Coding Schemes\u2019 by Benedetto and Montorsi, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 42, No. 2, March 1996, and in \u2018Iterative Decoding of Turbo Codes and Other Concatenated Codes\u2019, a dissertation dated February 1996, by S. A. Barbulescu of the Institute of Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above embodiments are provided purely by way of example, and further modifications may be envisaged without departing from the scope of the appended claims. Modifications of the above embodiments may be envisaged within the scope of the present invention. For example, alternative modulation schemes may be used, such as 8 PSK (8 phase shift keying). Alternative rate codes may be produced, by using different puncturing rates. Although recursive convolutional codes are preferred as the constituent codes of the encoder 20, other constituent codes such as block codes may be used. The data bits d may be pre-coded before being input to the encoder 20, and/or further encoded after being output from the buffer 21. In the decoder 34, the bits are demodulated and a probability is estimated for each bit. The demodulated bits are separated into data bits d, non-interleaved parity bits p and interleaved parity bits q according to the format used for transmission.
