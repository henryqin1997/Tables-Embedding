For example, a greater number of stepped surfaces may be provided so that more than two spacings may be achieved between the reel members. It has also been found that the rim portion 14, 14' can be made by gas-injected molding so as to provide an enclosed rim rather than the U-shaped cross-section illustrated in the drawings. It is therefore wished to have it understood that the present invention should not be limited in scope, except by the terms of the following claims. In order to assemble the two reel members together, the tongues of each reel member are brought into registry with the large openings of the slots of either one of the two stepped surfaces. With reference to FIG. 6, the top part of each tongue penetrates into the large opening of its corresponding slot and then by a clockwise rotation of one reel member and a counter-clockwise rotation of the other reel member, the tongues are moved through the narrow openings of the slots. The dimensions of the narrow openings are such that, due to the resiliency of the plastics material of which is made the reel members, a secured inter-engagement is obtained by forcing the engagement so that",
