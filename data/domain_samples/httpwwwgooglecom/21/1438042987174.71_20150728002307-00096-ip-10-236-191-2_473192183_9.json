A particularly preferred class of polymerizable monomer is the phosphorus acid esters described in said European published patent application No. 0 058 483, such class containing compounds comprising an organic ester of one or more acids of phosphorus, the organic radical of said ester containing at least one free-radically polymerizable functional group, wherein said ester has chlorine or bromine bonded directly to phosphorus (hereafter referred to as \"halophosphorus acid esters\"). An especially preferred subclass of such halophosphorus acid esters is halophosphorus acid esters wherein said organic radical is the residue remaining after removal of one or more hydroxyl hydrogen atoms from BIS-GMA, particularly those wherein phosphorus is doubly bonded to an oxygen atom, is bonded to at least one chlorine atom, and the ratio of said phosphorus to said BIS-GMA is between about 0.025:1 and 1:1., 22497=Practitioners in the field of dentistry have long sought polymerizable compositions which would adhere well to dentin. A number of compositions having varying degrees of adhesion to dentin have been reported in the literature, see, e.g., M. Buonocore, W. Wileman, and F. Brudevold, J. Dent. Res., 35, 846 (1956), M. Buonocore and M. Quigley, J. Amer. Dent. Assoc., 57, 807 (1958), M. Anbar and E. Farley, J. Dent. Res., 53, 879 (1974), E. Farley, R. Jones, and M. Anbar, J. Dent. Res., 56, 1943 (1977), R. L. Bowen, E. N. Cobb, and J. E. Rapson, J. Dent. res., 61, 1070 (1982), R. L. Bowen, E. N. Cobb, and L. E. Setz, Denistry 82, 11 (December 1982), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,182,035, 4,222,780, 4,235,633, 4,259,075, 4,259,117, and 4,368,043, European published patent application No. 0 058 483, and Japanese laid-open patent application (Kokai) Nos. 57-143372 and 57-167364. These compositions generally are used in the form of primers or liners which are applied to dentin in one or more thin coats followed by application of a dental composite, restorative, or adhesive composition to the primer-coated dentin surface., 45125=A refrigerated resin mixture containing 237.5 g BIS-GMA, 237.5 g triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 0.314 g butylated hydroxytoluene and 0.0475 g hydroquinone methyl ether was stirred in a flask with 25 g phosphorus oxychloride for three hours while keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture below 24\ufffd C. with an ice bath. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stand for 8 days, at which time its viscosity was measured and found to be 2962 cps at 20\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was placed under a vacuum of 1 mm Hg for 3 hours in order to remove dissolved hydrogen chloride, yielding 487 g of product having an index of refraction of 1.5051 at 25\ufffd C.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications and alterations of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, and it should be understood that this invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein. In a second comparison, the first part of the non-peroxide-containing composition of Example 9 was combined with a second part containing 0.5 weight percent fluorenone and 0.5 weight percent diethylaminoethyl methacrylate in absolute ethanol. When the resulting composition was evaluated as in Example 9, the average measured shear strength of the primer-dentin bond was 5.2 kg/cm2, a value only 9 percent of the value (60.6 kg/cm2) obtained for the sulfur compound-containing composition of Example 9. The effect of removal of the sulfur compound and its replacement by an amine was demonstrated as follows. The first part of the non-peroxide-containing composition of Example 1 was combined with a second part containing 0.25 weight percent 2-chlorothioxanthone and 0.5 weight percent diethylaminoethyl methacrylate in absolute ethanol. When the resulting composition was evaluated as in Example 1, the average measured shear strength of the primer-dentin bond was 18.9 kg/cm2, a value only 38 percent of the value obtained (49.3 kg/cm2) for the sulfur compound-containing composition of Example 1. COMPARISON EXAMPLE These examples show the use of a variety of types and amounts of free-radically polymerizable monomers, sulfur compounds, and photoinitiators in compositions of the",
