    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{88573=As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, in addition to the sensors 8, the components of the mud pulse telemetry system according to the current invention include a conventional mud telemetry data encoder 24, a power supply 14, which may be a battery or turbine alternator, and a down hole pulser 12 according to the current invention. The pulser comprises a controller 26, which may be a microprocessor, a motor driver 30, which includes a switching device 40, a reversible motor 32, a reduction gear 44, a rotor 36 and stator 38. The motor driver 30, which may be a current limited power stage comprised of transistors (FET's and bipolar), preferably receives power from the power supply 14 and directs it to the motor 32 using pulse width modulation. Preferably, the motor is a brushed DC motor with an operating speed of at least about 600 RPM and, preferably, about 6000 RPM. The motor 32 drives the reduction gear 44, which is coupled to the rotor shaft 34. Although only one reduction gear 44 is shown, it should be understood that two or more reduction gears could also be utilized. Preferably, the reduction gear 44 achieves a speed reduction of at least about 144:1. The sensors 8 receive information 100 useful in connection with the drilling operation and provide output signals 102 to the data encoder 24. Using techniques well known in the art, the data encoder 24 transforms the output from the sensors 8 into a digital code 104 that it transmits to the controller 26. Based on the digital code 104, the controller 26 directs control signals 106 to the motor driver 30. The motor driver 30 receives power 107 from the power source 14 and directs power 108 to a switching device 40. The switching device 40 transmits power 111 to the appropriate windings of the motor 32 so as to effect rotation of the rotor 36 in either a first (e.g., clockwise) or opposite (e.g., counterclockwise) direction so as to generate pressure pulses 112 that are transmitted through the drilling mud 18. The pressure pulses 112 are sensed by the sensor 20 at the surface and the information is decoded and directed to a data acquisition system 42 for further processing, as is conventional. As shown in FIG. 1(a), the pressure pulses 112 generated at the down hole pulser 12 have an amplitude \u201ca\u201d. However, since the down hole pulser 12 may be as much as 5 miles from the surface, as a result of attenuation, the amplitude of the pressure pulses when they arrive at the surface will be only a\u2032. In addition, the shape of the pulses may be less distinct and noise may be superimposed on the pulses.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, it should be appreciated that the current invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the invention. Thus, although the current invention has been illustrated by reference to certain specific embodiments, those skilled in the art, armed with the foregoing disclosure, will appreciate that many variations could be employed. For example, although the invention has been discussed with reference to a reversible electric motor, other motors, such as hydraulic motors capable of being quickly energized, could also be utilized. Although, according to the current invention, pressure pulses are preferably generated using the oscillating rotary pulser 12 described above, the principle of controlling one or more characteristics of the pressure pulses transmitted to the surface by sensing the generated pressure pulses or by transmitting instructions to the down hole pulser is also applicable to other types of pulsers, including reciprocating valve type pulsers and convention rotary pulsers, provided that, by employing the principals of the current invention, they can be adapted to permit variations in one or more characteristics of the pressure pulses. For example, a special controller, motor driver, variable speed motor and down hole dynamic pressure transducer constructed according to the teachings of the current invention could be incorporated, as required, into a conventional",
