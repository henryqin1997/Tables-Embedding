For example, if the receiving party receives the incoming Caller ID Message 1110 and wants to forward the Caller ID Message 1110, the receiving party presses the \u201cForward\u201d button 1410 that brings up a Forwarding Caller ID Messaging GUI 1420 with an identifier of the Caller ID Message to forward (shown as \u201cForwarding Caller ID Messaging #10 from Rob in FIG. 14\u201d). Thereafter, the receiving party selects a communications address similar to the methods and systems described in FIG. 4.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{49877=Another embodiment describes a caller identification messaging device that accesses, integrates, configures, generates, and/or otherwise manages data communicated between the caller identification messaging device and a communications network and/or communications device. The caller identification messaging device may include an input/output processor, a communications device interface, a memory device, a processor, and a caller identification messaging program. The input/output processor allows the input, output, and/or access to data of a caller identification messaging signal. The caller identification messaging signal includes a caller identification message, an identifier of the calling party, a destination communications address associated with a receiving party's communications device, and/or an identifier of at least one of a calling party's communications device and the caller identification messaging device. The communications device interface communicates the data of the caller identification messaging signal with a communications network and/or with a communications device selected from a plurality of communications devices. For example, a wired communications device may connect with the caller identification messaging device via a cable connected to a serial or parallel port and a wireless communications device may transceive signals, such as the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) Band frequencies, such as, 2.4-2.5 GHz and 300-428,000 GHz for infrared transmission, cellular telephone frequencies, such as, 806-960 MHz, 1710-1855 MHz, and 2500-2690 MHz, paging frequencies, and any other frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum. The memory device stores the data of the caller identification messaging signal and also stores the caller identification messaging program. The processor communicates with the memory device to operate the caller identification messaging program for processing caller identification messaging signals and also operates with the communications device interface to format and communicate the caller identification messaging signal., 117271=Referring back to \u201cBlock 1840,\u201d if the receiving party communications device does not support enhanced Caller ID Messaging, then the telecommunications network determines whether the receiving party (and/or receiving party's communications device) blocks or prevents incoming Caller ID messaging [block 2000]. If yes, then the telecommunications network advises the calling party that the receiving party does not accept Caller ID messaging [block 2010] and determines whether the calling party wants to establish an alternate communication connection such as a voice connection (if the Caller ID Messaging Signal is just transmitted as a data transmission to the Caller ID Messaging Device) [block 2020]. If yes, then the telecommunications network establishes the alternate communications connection [block 2030]. However, if the calling party does not want to establish alternate communications, then the communication is terminated [block 2040]. Referring back to \u201cBlock 2000,\u201d if the receiving party and/or the receiving party's communications device does not block Caller ID messaging, then the telecommunications network supplants the ICLID signal with the Caller ID message of the Caller ID messaging signal [block 2050], establishes a connection to the address of the receiving party's communications device [block 2060], and communicates the Caller ID message to the receiving party's communications device [block 2070].}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While several exemplary implementations of embodiments of this invention are described herein, various modifications and alternate embodiments will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the next generation \u201csoftswitch\u201d simply replaces the SCP with an \u201capplication server.\u201d This application server is a conventional computer server that also includes triggers for telecommunications services so that \u201cnew entrants\u201d into telecommunications services (e.g., new telecommunications service providers) don't have to purchase an expensive SSP and/or SCP to process telephone calls. This next-generation packet network represents an alternative operating environment for the Caller ID Messaging systems, methods, programs, and apparatuses. Here the telecommunications switch includes a packet-based \u201csoftswitch.\u201d This \u201csoftswitch\u201d uses software control to provide voice, data, and video services by dynamically changing its connection data rates and protocols types. An application server interfaces with the \u201csoftswitch\u201d via a packet protocol, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This application server includes voice service protocols, triggers, and operations that allow the PSTN and the data network (e.g., the world wide electronic communications network) to interoperate. Accordingly, this invention is intended to include those other variations, modifications, and alternate embodiments that adhere to the spirit and scope of this invention. Referring back to \u201cBlock 1840,\u201d if the receiving party communications device does not support enhanced Caller ID Messaging, then the telecommunications network determines whether the receiving party (and/or receiving party's communications device) blocks or prevents incoming",
