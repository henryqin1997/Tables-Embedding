The sealing sleeve 48 should be positioned so as to extend across the casing window 32. After positioning the sleeve 48, it should be polymerized and allowed to cure. In a specific embodiment, the sealing sleeve 48 may be of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,106, which is incorporated herein by referenced, and in SPE 8202, a paper entitled \"In-Situ Polymerisation of an Inflatable Composite Sleeve to Reline Damaged Tubing and Shut-Off Perforation\" that was presented at the 1996 Offshore Technology Conference, held in Houston, Tex. Related sleeves are disclosed in PCT applications WO 94-25655 and WO 96-01937. In a specific embodiment, the sleeve 48 may include a cylindrical body 50 having a longitudinal bore 52 therethrough, and may be constructed of fibers and polymerizable resins. The sleeve 48 may also include a drillable sidewall 54 in the cylindrical body 50, and a resilient outer skin 56 substantially covering the cylindrical body 50., 26848=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/024,960, filed Aug. 30, 1996.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction, operation, exact materials or embodiments shown and described, as obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, the step of running and setting the window mill pilot 26 may be eliminated, and the lower whipstock 24 may be used to divert the milling tool (not shown) and the drilling tool (also not shown) to their desired locations. It should also be understood by those of skill in the art that the use of the method and apparatus of the present invention to reenter a central wellbore having one or more lateral branch wellbores that have been sealed with cement, or other known sealing substance, to provide a backup seal to the cement, or other sealing substance, is intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. After the window remill pilot 62 has been set in place, and after removing the running tool (not shown) used to run the window mill pilot 62 into the sleeve 48, the next step, as illustrated in FIG. 9, is to run a milling tool, such as a tapered mill (not shown), into the window remill pilot 62, which will guide the milling tool so that it",
