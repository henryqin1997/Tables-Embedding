    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30764=In order to set up our video jukebox for operation, it is necessary to consider first the problem of access to a particular selection on the video tapes in the two video cassette recorder and playback devices 54 and 62. Normally it takes nearly four minutes to scan from one end of a video tape to another. In solving the problem of providing a reasonable access time, we first select two video recorders with identical tapes so that while you are playing one selection on one of the recorders, the other recorder can be cued up and, when the first selection is finished, the second one can start up within just a few seconds. Part of this problem is to locate the selections on the tape. In order that this be accomplished we employ recorders in which the tape is kept engaged with the reading head both in fast forward or fast reverse scan. One type of recorder which is suitable for this purpose and which we employ in our video jukebox is a Sony SL-2000. In order to enable the computer 50 to locate the selections, we place a \"data dump\" at the beginning of each tape. This data dump identifies the location of each of the selections on the tape. Information from this data dump is read into memory 214 during an initialization period when the tape is installed., 33864=If desired we may set up the machine so that video selections take precedence over audio selections. That is to say, if a selected audio presentation is being played, it will continue to the end. However, other audio selections which have already been made may be delayed until a later selected video presentation is played. In achieving this result, we can set up the machine so as to choose any ratio of video to audio or we can give video the preference. While, as is pointed out hereinabove by an \"audio\" selection, we need one which does not include a video uniquely associated therewith, we may if desired present something on the screen 20 during an audio play. For example, we might display a message such as \"AN AUDIO RECORD IS BEING PLAYED. PLEASE SEE THE TITLE RACK FOR VIDEO SELECTIONS\". Alternatively, we might use the audio that's being generated to create a psychodelic color display on the screen 20 which is responsive to the music and changes in time with the music analogous to the operation of the disco lamp controller for coin-operated phonograph described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,009, issued Mar. 17, 1981.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of our claims. It is further obvious that various changes may be made in details within the scope of our claims without departing from the spirit of our invention. It is, therefore, to be understood that our invention is not to be limited to the specific details shown and described. It will be seen that we have accomplished the objects of our invention. We have provided a video jukebox which selectively plays any selection from among a plurality of video or audio selections. Our video jukebox permits of the independent pricing of video and audio selections. It comprises a central controller which operates the record player directly and which operates the video system through a subsidiary video controller. Our video jukebox is provided with means for minimizing the time for accessing a selected video presentation.
