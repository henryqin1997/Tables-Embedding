No. 787,953 Claims priority, application Great Britain Jan. 21, 1958 26 Claims. (Cl. 74241) This invention relates to felt and like guides, such as wire guides, and is particularly, though not exclusively, applicable to guides for the felt or wire of paper-making machines. The expression band guide is used hereinafter generically to include the aforementioned guides., 19182=As shown in FIG. 19, the operating cylinder 29a is provided with an adjustable stop screw 2911 Whilst the piston rod 28a is provided with an adjustable stop collar 28b. These stops 2% and 28b may be set so as to limit the angular displacement whereby the momentary power-induced angularity of the guide roller may be adjusted to an efiective value so that the guiding correction for the band will be quickly applied without over correction. The setting of these stops can be effected during the running of the belt, as to some extent such settings will vary with each band according to its tendency to run out of normal alignment., 46150=References Qited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 1,992,649 Brunk Feb. 26, 1935 2,530,122 Hornbostel Nov. 14, 1950 2,654,599 Frisbie et a1.

HINDLE EIAL 3,043,153, 13607=FIG. 19 is a fragmentary vertical section showing a 3,@43,l53 Patented July Ill, 1952 modified construction of pneumatic operating cylinder., 13768=As shown in FIGS. 1 to 6, a guide roller 2%] is located transversely across the run of a travelling belt 21, such as a papermakers dryer felt, the roller being so positioned, as can be seen from FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 that the path of the belt is slightly deflected to give a small angle of contact with the roller. The roller is mounted at one end (the upper end in FIGS. 4, 5 and 6) in a conventional bearing, for example, such as the bearing 16 disclosed in the United- States patent to Saebe, 2,853,295, September 23, 1958 for pivot-a1 movement whilst the other end is adapted to be moved to one side or the other of a normal central position at right-angles to the run of the belt. When the roller is in the central position (FIG. 2) and the line of contact As shown in FIGS. 7 to 11, the laterally movable end of the axle 22 of the guide roller 23 is pivotally suspended by a link or lever 24 at 25 from a bracket 26 adapted to be secured by a base 27 to a frame memer (not shown) of the dryer section of a papermaking machine. At its lower end, the link 24 is connected to the outer end of a piston rod 28 of a pneumatic motor, comprising the cylinder 29, by an adjustable end extension Zfia, the ends of the cylinder being connected (see FIGS. 9 to 11) to a valve box 30 by ducts 31 and 32. Slidably mounted in the valve box is a valve bobbin 33 controlling a central pressure supply 34 and release The adjustment for setting the roller axle to an approximate running position as here illustrated comprises a rod 41 having, at its outer end, a hand wheel 42 and being screw threaded at its other end 41a for engagement with a swivel nut 43 carried by the link 24. Near the center of the rod is a collar 44, fixed to the rod and adapted to pass through an aperture 45 in a central partition 46. On each side of the partition 46 is a further partition 47, and 48, respectively, and between such partitions and around the rod are centralizing springs 50 and 51 carrying collars 52 and 5 3 on their inner ends complementary to the collar 44 aforesaid on the rod, but of larger diameter than the collar 44. These collars 52 and 53 can slide freely on the rod 41., 9554=' FELT AND LIKE GUIDES I Filed Jan. 20. 1959 '5 Sheets-Sheet 2 ATTORNEY July 10, 1962 T.
