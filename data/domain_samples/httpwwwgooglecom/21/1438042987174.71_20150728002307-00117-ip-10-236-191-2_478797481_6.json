    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Comminuted wood pulp (fluff) is preferred as an absorbent fiber, but other cellulose fibers such as cotton linters can be used. The preferred fluff is southern pine kraft wood pulp (i.e., made according to the sulfate process commonly known in the art) which has been bleached, such as can be purchased from International Paper Company. Other softwood fluffs may be purchased from Kimberly-Clark Corporation, such as CR-54. Various hardwood fluffs may also be blended with the softwood fluffs to form the absorbent composite. A water-swellable hydrogel material, preferably in particulate form, may be used in a number of various arrangements within the absorbent composite in order to decrease the bulkiness and enhance the capacity of the composite 38. Many such hydrogel materials are known and available to those skilled in the art. It should be understood that additional elements could be provided in conjunction with those already set forth, without departing from the contemplated scope of the present invention and the description herein is not intended to be in any way limiting. Various materials are contemplated for use as the absorbent core 38, including fibrous materials, foams, particulates, etc. In general, the most economical liquid absorbent material for use in disposable diapers has been an absorbent fiber. The absorbent fiber most commonly used is cellulosic fiber such as comminuted wood pulp, commonly known in the art as \"pulp fluff,\" or simply \"fluff.\" The bodyside liner 34",
