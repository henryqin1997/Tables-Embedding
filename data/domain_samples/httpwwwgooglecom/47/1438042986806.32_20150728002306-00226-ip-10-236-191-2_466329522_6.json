A description of semantic networks can be found in \"A Fundamental Tradeoff in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning\", Readings in Knowledge Representation, by Brachman and Leveseque, Morgan Kaufman, San Mateo, 1985., 53849=The term \"object\" will be used extensively in the following discussions. As is well known to software developers, an \"object\" is a logical software unit comprising data and processes which give it capabilities and attributes. For example, an object can be queried as to its type and can return such data as the number of words that it contains, what its bounding box (BBOX) is, etc. Objects can contain other objects of the same or of a different type. Objects can also be used to project images on a screen according to their object type. Example of object types used in the following description include paragraph, line, and word objects. There are many well known texts which describe object oriented programming. See, for example, Object Oriented Programming for the Macintosh, by Kurt J. Schmucher, Hayden Book Company, 1986., 58567=The character style preference area 76 includes a recognized character style area 78, a probability selection area 80, a character index area 82, and a control bar area 84. Upon opening of the character style preference area 76, a default selection of the character \"a\" is chosen for display. Of course, in alternate embodiments, other characters could also be chosen to be the default character displayed, such as the last character displayed when the character style preference area was last active. As shown, the recognized character style area 78 includes the character style variant groups that are recognized by the chosen recognition system as an input of the character \"a\". An appropriate recognition system is described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/068,443, filed May 27, 1993 on behalf of Beernink, and entitled \"Method and Apparatus for Recognizing Handwritten Words\", the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety. A first variant group 86 is shown highlighted, e.g., with a surrounding solid box, and represents one set of strokes recognized as a capital \"A\". The probability that that particular letter style is going to be input by the user is indicated both by the shading of the variant group and by the probability selection area 80. The selection of the \"sometimes\" button 88 indicates that that variant is expected to be written more frequently by the user, which is reflected by the dark, solid shading of the variant group 86. Alternatively, the rarely button 90 could be selected, which would indicate that that variant is expected to be written infrequently or not at all and would lighten the shading of the variant group. Selection of the rarely button 90 is illustrated and explained in greater detail with reference to FIG. 2c. Of course in alternate embodiments, other probability levels could also be included, such as a higher level of \"always\" or a lower level of \"never\", to have more indicator levels for each variant group. An appropriate shading scheme, e.g., a thicker, darker shading for higher levels and lighter shading for lower levels, may be used to visually indicate to the user the probability associated with each variant group., 51152=In this preferred embodiment, the keypad 24', as explained previously, comprises a printed or silk-screened member 60 provided beneath a lower edge of a thin, clear, stylus-sensitive membrane 62 of the input \"tablet.\" Alternatively, a keypad could comprise a mechanical keypad (or keyboard) 24, or a keypad could comprise \"soft buttons\" i.e. images generated at convenient locations on the screen 52, in which case a \"button\" would be activated by touching the stylus to the screen over the image of the button. The keypad 24' preferably includes a number of dedicated function buttons 64 and a pair of scroll buttons 66a and 66b. The operation of the note areas 54a, 54b, etc., scroll buttons 66a and 66b, and other aspects of computer system 10 are discussed in greater detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/868,013, filed Apr. 13, 1992 on behalf of Tchao et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 52841=A status bar 68 is provided at the bottom of the notepad application. The status bar 68 is provided with a number of active and display areas, which again are not particularly germane to the present invention and will therefore not be discussed in detail herein. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/976,970 filed Nov. 16, 1992 on behalf of Foster et. al, entitled \"Status Bar for Application Windows\" and assigned to the assignee of the present invention describes how to make and use the status bar, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 55112=It will be noted there is a liberal use of graphic elements in the present invention. For example, the header bars 56a and 56b include lines and other graphical elements. Processes for drawing lines on a computer screen are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, graphics software such as QUICKDRAW from Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. can be used to draw lines, simple geometrical shapes, etc. A description of the QUICKDRAW graphics software is found in the book Inside Macintosh, Volumes I, II, and III, by C. Rose et al., Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., July 1988. With such graphics software, a line can be drawn by simply specifying the coordinates of the beginning and the end of the line, and by specifying the width of the line.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although only one embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Particularly, the invention has been described in the context of a recognizer \"database\" of information concerning a set of character styles and their associated probability of occurring. Of course, the invention is equally applicable to other \"databases\" of information. Alternatively, although the embodiment illustrated uses alphanumeric characters of the English language, the invention is capable of use with other languages as well. Further, the processing of a probability selection has been described in terms of two probability levels but is applicable to systems with multi-levels as well. Therefore, the present examples are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims. The processing of a reset selection (step 176 of FIG. 5) is presented in the flow diagram of FIG. 9. The logic begins in step 220 with the displaying of a warning that the reset button has been selected, which allows the user to cancel or confirm the selection. The next step 222 determines if the cancel option of the warning was selected. If it was, then the selection of the reset button",
