    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29196=Prior techniques for dealing with this problem have included the use of separate ground nodes in an n-channel push-pull MOS output buffer, one of said ground nodes for sinking current during the initial transition from a high output state to a low output state, and the other for sinking DC current during the steady state condition of a low output state. Such an output buffer is shown and described in \"A LAN System Interface Chip with Selectable Bus Protocols\", by Donald Walters, Jr. et al., 1985 Digest of Technical Papers, 1985 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (IEEE, 1985), pp. 190-191. The separate ground nodes allow the DC ground node to sink output current without having the undershoot associated with the original transition coupled to it. However, the use of n-channel technology inherently precludes the circuit described in this paper from driving a \"1\" logic state to the full level of the biasing power supply, since the n-channel pull-up transistor will turn off as the output terminal of the circuit reaches a voltage greater than the blasing power supply voltage less a transistor threshold voltage. While further prior techniques have provided the use of a transistor in series between the output terminal and the drain of the pull-down transistor to damp the undershoot generated by a high-to-low transition, such a technique is ineffective for low-to-high transitions; if used in the pull-up side of an NMOS output buffer, the n-channel pull-up transistor would switch off a even a lower voltage, further reducing the drive level and increasing the switching time.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in detail herein with reference to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that this description is by way of example only, and is not to be construed in a limiting sense. It is to be further understood that numerous changes in the details of the embodiment of the invention, and additional embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to, and may be made by, persons of ordinary skill in the art having reference to this description. It is contemplated that such changes and additional embodiments are within the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. The ability to float output terminal 10 allows multiple output buffers to be connected to a common output terminal 10, with the enable signal ENABLE-- serving to select and not select the desired output buffer circuits. A device utilizing the output buffer shown in FIG. 1 can also be constructed with a common input/output terminal at output terminal 10, with enable signal ENABLE-- in its low logic state enabling output through output terminal 10, and in its high logic state enabling input data to be presented to an input buffer (not shown) via output terminal 10 without a data conflict from the data state of the output buffer circuit. The output of NOR gate 18 also goes to a low logic state responsive to enable signal ENABLE-- being at a high",
