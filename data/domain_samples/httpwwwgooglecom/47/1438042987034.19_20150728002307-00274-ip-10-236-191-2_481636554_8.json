    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations An asymmetrical, non-round vertebra for use in the bending section of an endoscope has been described. The non-round vertebra is constructed to behave like a symmetrical, round vertebra. The present invention includes any vertebra constructed according to the principles of this invention and is not limited to the preferred embodiments described herein. Given the teachings herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art could construct many different vertebra designs that fall within the scope of this invention and the claims. Alternatively, the conventional feel may be provided with wire pairs 67, 68 and 69, 70 being displaced different lengths from each other for the same degree of bend by providing different diameter control rods as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,947,827, incorporated herein by reference. The shape of angles and the size of the protrusions are selected, based on their distance from longitudinal axis 53, to provide the same degree of bend for the same displacement of the respective control wires. Thus, the distance that wire 69 is retracted for a 90\ufffd upward bend is the same distance that wire 67 is retracted for a 90\ufffd bend to the left. This results in a bending for a section that has symmetrical and uniform bending characteristics in all directions. The nonsymmetrical size and shape of the protrusions exactly compensate for the nonsymmetrical shape of the vertebra to produce symmetrical bending of the bending section 32. The",
