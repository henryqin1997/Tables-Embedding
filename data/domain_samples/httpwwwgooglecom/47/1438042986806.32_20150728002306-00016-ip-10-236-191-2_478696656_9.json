The description was selected to best explain the principles of the invention and practical application of these principles to enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention not be limited by the specification, but be defined by the claims set forth below. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for updating site ranking factors in a wireless communication system. By incorporating information regarding quality of inbound transmissions into the decision to update site ranking factors, the present invention provides a more reliable basis upon which a subscriber unit can assess site rankings. This represents an advance over prior art techniques that did not incorporate such information in the site ranking process. At step 703, it is determined if the signal quality information is unfavorable. As described above, this determination is performed by comparing the signal quality information against one or more predetermined thresholds. If the signal quality information is unfavorable, the transmitter 608 is used to transmit an inbound transmission feedback message that instructs the subscriber unit to update at least one site",
