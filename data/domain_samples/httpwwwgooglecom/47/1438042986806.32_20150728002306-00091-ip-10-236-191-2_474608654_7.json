In the same time, the water vapor (H2 O) was introduced into the second pipe 30 for producing the oxygen radicals. The ratio between the two gases was determined to 1:1. This step is continued for approximately three minutes., 33592=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/531,399, filed Jun. 4, 1990, abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/237,031, filed Aug. 29, 1988, abandoned., 44434=When a halogen radical having a strong reactivity, obtained by activating a gas including halogen element or elements such as fluorine is used for etching, the halogen radical can solely react with the organic compound film to remove it. However, when the photoresist or the gate electrode formed on the silicon or silicon oxide base film is etched by the halogen radical alone, the base film is also etched, and hence the halogen radical alone cannot be used for the etching process. Further, the etching rate of the organic compound film using the halogen radical alone becomes approximately 1000 \u212b/min which is not so quick, in practice.}",

In this embodiment, when it is difficult to feed the water vapor (H2 O) into the chamber, the carrier gas such as hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) may be used with the same effects and advantages. Further, this embodiment is not restricted to the treatment of the polycrystalline silicon film and the silicon oxide film, and may be applied to other materials such as silicon nitride film, molybdenum, tungsten, titanium, tantalum, hafnium and siliside thereof film and the like. Then, when the photoresist removal of the material 22 is conducted in a conventional oxygen plasma ashing process, the film walls could not be removed. The photoresist removing treatment of the material 22 is carried out in the chamber 231 in FIG. 26 using the nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and the water vapor (H2 O) in the same manner as described above according to the present method, the photoresist 253 and the film walls could be completely and clearly removed, as shown in FIG. 29b. FIG. 29 schematically shows another etching process of",
