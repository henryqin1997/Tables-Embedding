The dispatch unit 46 provides the FXUA 22 with tags for the operands \"a\" and \"b\" to tell the FXUA 22 where to retrieve the data for the operands, as is well understood by those skilled in the art. For example, in a system with six rename buffers, the dispatch unit 46 might suitably tag the operand for \"a\" as being located in a rename buffer 1 with a six bit tag 100000. A tag of 010000 might then suitably be used to indicate that the operand \"b\" is in the rename buffer 2. Since the FXUA 22 does not write into GPRs 32, the dispatch unit 46 must use a rename buffer tag for the target of the operation, such as 001000, for the result of the \"add\" instruction to be placed in rename buffer 3.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments above, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that variations in form and detail may be made without departure from the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, multiple load/store units can be used in parallel with the processing of instructions according to other embodiments of the invention. According to still a further embodiment, the Formatter could be designed such that if the final data is received before the first data then the final data is stored in the merge latch. When the first data is received, it would then be reassembled with the final data and forwarded to the rename register file. If the formatter is implemented in this manner, the use of the Mis-Queue Table 600 could be avoided. After the final access has retrieved its data from the cache, then the load instruction is ready for completion. At completion, the bit in the Misaligned/Busy Latch 208 is cleared and the load/store unit may now issue subsequent misaligned instructions. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an event in which the data from the final access is passed to the Formatter before the data from the first access is treated similarly to cache miss. Thus, on each cycle, the processor scans the Mis-Queue Table 600, accesses the cache data for the address of the",
