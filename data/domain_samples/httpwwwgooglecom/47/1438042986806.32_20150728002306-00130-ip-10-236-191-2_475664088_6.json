In the absence of a card in its environment the Reader Antenna \u2018falls asleep\u2019, there will be but low radiation from the Reader. This would be further reduced because of a degree of mutual cancellation of the twin coils of the Reader Antenna at non-proximity distances. The FIG. 5 of GB 2291725 indicates the basic circuitry in the card when receiving input from the Reader twin radiator elements which operate in antiphase.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The second feature is a facility to choose between the already described de-emphasis of the short wave spectrum of resonance possibilities (by means of resonator 64 in the emitter to ground connection) and an emphasis for the shortwave or gigahertz region. A switch handle SWH can externally actuate switches SW1 and SW2 to produce the changeover to a connection where the resonator 64 is replaced by a straight ground connection 78, and the resistor R in the collector of transistor 47 is substituted by another resonator 64 a. Similar switches may be provided to produce a changeover from twin-loop to a single loop mode, for temporary range extension. The circuit of FIG. 29 shows the antenna containing points x and \u03b2, but is otherwise very similar to that shown in FIG. 24. It is here used also to indicate two further features which may be in demand. One is the addition of the analogue communication facilities producing analogue modulation of the field covered by the twin-antenna geometry. Accordingly, the input to the base of transistor 47 consists of a microphone MIC and the digital data output is replaced by a diode controlled detector circuit and earphone 76. FIGS. 27 and 28 show the front and side elevations of a card terminal which feasibly may be used for outdoor installations, or as a mobile outdoor unit. In FIG. 27 it will be observed that the antenna layout",
