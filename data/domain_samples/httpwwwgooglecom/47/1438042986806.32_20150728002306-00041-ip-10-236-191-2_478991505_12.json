    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75051=In yet another embodiment, the antibody component of the PIC is a tumoricidal antibody. The term \u201ctumoricidal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody that inhibits tumor cell growth and/or proliferation through epitope binding. Antibodies that possess tumoricidal activity are also known in the art, including IMC-C225, EMD 72000, OvaRex Mab B43.13, anti-ganglioside G(D2) antibody ch14.18, CO17-1A, trastuzumab, rhuMAb VEGF, sc-321, AF349, BAF349, AF743, BAF743, MAB743, AB1875, Anti-Flt-4AB3127, FLT41-A, rituximab, 2C3, CAMPATH 1H, 2G7, Alpha IR-3, ABX-EGF, MDX-447, anti-p75 IL-2R, anti-p64 IL-2R, and 2A11., 32452=This application claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 60/287,767, filed on May 1, 2001 and to U.S. application Ser. No. 60/338,961, filed on Dec. 7, 2001, both of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into this application., 196935=To compare the uptake of C225 PIC and free BPD in transfected cells as well as in human tumor cells, CHO, CHO-EGF, CHO-ERBB2 and OVCAR-5 cells were studied as previously described (Hamblin et al., 1996). NIH:OVCAR-5 cells were obtained from the Fox Chase Cancer Institute (Philadelphia, Pa.), maintained in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech Inc, Herndon, Va.) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, GIBCO Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 15 hours with either 140 nM BPD or the equivalent of C225 PIC. A quantitation of the uptake of both free BPD and C225 PIC was achieved by measuring the BPD fluorescence (expressed as \u03bcmol of PS/mg cell protein) in cell lysates, prepared in NaOH/SDS after incubation and comparison of this fluorescence to standard curves of BPD., 80484=In a preferred embodiment, the antibody component of the high-density PIC binds with specificity to a receptor or an epitope of a receptor-binding molecule present on the surface of a tumor cell. Antibodies of this category include, but are not limited to, IMC-C225, EMD 72000, BIWA 1, trastuzumab, rituximab, tositumomab, 2C3, rhuMAb VEGF, sc-321, AF349, BAF349, AF743, BAF743, MAB743, AB1875, Anti-Flt-4AB3127, FLT41-A, CAMPATH 1H, 2G7, alpha IR-3, ABX-EGF, MDX-447, SR1, Yb5.B8, 17F.11, anti-p75 IL-2R and anti-p64 IL-2R. Receptor epitopes or an epitope of a receptor-binding molecule include, but are not limited to those known in the art to be present on CD20, CD52, CD33, HER2/neu, epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB3, erbB4, CD44v6, VEGF, VEGFRs (e.g., VEGFR-3), estrogen receptors, TGF\u03b21, IGF-1 receptor, EGF\u03b1, c-Kit receptor, transferrin receptor, and IL-2R., 161414=To test the effect of the combination treatment in vivo, a known animal model system was utilized (Molpus et al., 1996a). As discussed above, the xenograft model of intra-peritoneal epithelial ovarian carcinoma has been noted to be desirable for measurement of the effects of PDT (Molpus et al., 1996a). This model manifests tumor derived from human ovarian carcinoma cells with all of the inherent biological properties of human disease. As has been previously described, the model is characterized, as in human patients, by diffuse solid tumor, ascites, parenchymal invasion, lymph-vascular space invasion, and neovascularization (Molpus et al., 1996a). Briefly, athymic Swiss female nude mice, weighing 20-25 grams (6-8 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally, using a 27-gauge needle, with 31.5\ufffd106 NIH:OVCAR-5 cells, suspended in 2 ml PBS. NIH:OVCAR-5 cells were obtained from the Fox Chase Cancer Institute (Philadelphia, Pa.). Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 media (Mediatech Inc, Herndon, Va.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (GIBCO Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37\ufffd C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. At the time of NIH:OVCAR-5 cell injection, mice were given a numeric ear tag. Animals were anesthetized before the cell injection with 0.03 ml of a ketamine/xylazine mixture (ketamine, 120 mg/kg; xylazine, 15 mg/kg)., 78724=In a preferred embodiment, the antibody component of the PIC comprises an antibody to VEGFR-3. Tumoricidial antibodies to VEGFR-3 are known in the art. For example, sc-321 is commercially available from Bioscience (Santa Cruz, Calif.). Tumoricidial antibodies to VEGFR-3 include, but are not limited to AF349, BAF349, AF743, BAF743, MAB743, AB1875, Anti-Flt-4AB3127, and FLT41-A. PICs comprising tumoricidial antibodies to VEGFR-3 can be localized to the lymphatic vessels and selectively activated with light at the tumor site, causing local lymphatic vessel eradication., 81388=In yet another embodiment, binding of the antibody component of the high-density PIC to the receptor epitope or an epitope of a receptor binding molecule inhibits growth and/or proliferation of the tumor cell. Tumoricidal antibodies in this category include, but are not limited to, IMC-C225, EMD 72000, trastuzumab, rituximab, 2C3, rhuMAb VEGF, sc-321, AF349, BAF349, AF743, BAF743, MAB743, AB1875, Anti-Flt-4AB3127, FLT41-A, CAMPATH 1H, 2G7, alpha IR-3, ABX-EGF, MDX-447, anti-p75 IL-2R and anti-p64 IL-2R., 125029=A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells and J774A. 1 (J774) mouse monocyte-macrophage cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1555 and ATCC TIB-67, respectively; Rockville, Md.). 3T3-NR6 (NR6) cells, an EGFR-negative variant cell line derived from the 3T3-Swiss albino embryonic mouse fibroblast cell line (Pruss, 1977) were a generous gift from Dr. A. Wells (Department of Pathology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Ala.). J774 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. A-431 cells were grown in DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. NR6 cells were grown in DMEM containing 1.0 g/L glucose and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cell growth media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37\ufffd C. in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. C225 anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from ImClone Systems Incorporated (Somerville, N.J.). Rabbit IgG was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.)., 35329=To date, several thousand patients have been treated with PDT for a variety of neoplasms. Randomized clinical trials of this modality were initiated in 1987, using a purified form of HPD, Photofrin\ufffd (Marcus, 1992), (Dougherty et al., 1998). These first randomized trials were sponsored by Quadra Logic Technologies, Inc. (now QLT Phototherapeutics, Vancouver, Canada) and American Cyanamid Co. (Pearl River, N.Y.), and compared the efficacy of PDT with that of other forms of therapy for bladder, esophageal, and lung cancers. Within the past 5 years, significant progress has been made worldwide in obtaining regulatory approval for a variety of indications. Currently, PDT with the photosensitizer Photofrin\ufffd is approved in at least 10 countries. Approval for treatment with other photosensitizers has been requested in the United States, Canada, and Europe.}",
