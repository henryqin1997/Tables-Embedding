No. 5,811,392., 341290=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.63-0.68 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 58917=(wherein, R1 is Pro, R2 is Ser in native bradykinin). The change of proline at position 7 of native bradykinin to D-Phe confers antagonist activity. This compound was described in Steranka, et al., P.N.A.S. U.S., 85:3245-3249, 1988 and is one of a plethora of candidate sequences for modification by the current technology, i.e. backbone cyclization. In this regard, it is worth noting the applications: WO 89/01781, EP-A-0370453 and EP-A-0334244 which disclose a wide range of candidate structures. Antagonist peptides on which stability and/or tissue selectivity can be conferred by appropriate cyclization will be selected from the many such known sequences., 318522=A solution of 0.05 mole of amino acid t-butyl ester acetate in 200 mL H2O was acidified to pH 2 with AcOH, washed with PE (70 mL X5) cooled and the pH adjusted to 9 by NH4OH 25%. The free amino acid t-butyl ester was extracted with i-Pr:CHCl (3:1, 3\ufffd100 mL). The combined extracts were dried on Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The benzylation reaction was performed according to Procedure 2., 260777=TOF MS: 1424.6 (M+), 459530=Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, specific pathogen free (SPF), weighing 200-350 g, were maintained on a constant light-dark cycle (light from 8:00 to 20:00 h), temperature (21\ufffd3\ufffd C.), and relative humidity (55\ufffd10%). Laboratory chow and tap water were available ad libitum. On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg). Rats anesthetized with pentobarbitone exhibit low somatostatin levels in portal blood vessels. (Plotsky, P. M., Science, 230, 461-463, 1985). A single blood sample (0.6 ml) was taken from the exposed cannulated jugular vein for the determination of the basal GH levels (\u221215 min). Immediately thereafter the appropriate peptide pretreatment was administered. The animals received 10 \u03bcg/kg of either native somatostatin (SRIF) or the synthetic analog octreotide (Sandostatin), or the cyclic peptide analog. A saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was administered as a control. All peptides were administered subcutaneously in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Further sampling was carried out at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after peptide administration. Immediately after the collection of each blood sample, an appropriate volume (0.6 ml) of saline was administered intravenously. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing heparin (15 unites per ml of blood) and centrifuged immediately. Plasma was separated and kept frozen at \u221220\ufffd C. until assayed., 341657=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.65-0.72 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 236393=TOF MS: 1351.4 (M+), 42198=Once these peptidomimetic compounds with rigid conformations are produced, the most active structures are selected by studying the conformation-activity relationships. Such conformational constraints can involve short range (local) modifications of structure or long range (global) conformational restraints (for review see Giannis and Kolter, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 32:1244, 1993)., 43967=Three representative examples are compounds wherein partial structures of each peptide are made into rings by linking two penicillamine residues with a disulfide bridge (Mosberg et al., P.N.A.S. US, 80:5871, 1983), by formation of an amide bond between a lysine and an aspartate group (Charpentier et al., J. Med. Chem. 32:1184, 1989), or by connecting two lysine groups with a succinate unit (Rodriguez et al., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 35:441, 1990). These structures have been disclosed in the literature in the case of a cyclic enkephalin analog with selectivity for the \u03b4-opiate receptor (Mosberg et al., ibid.); or as agonists to the cholecystokinin B receptor, found largely in the brain (Charpentier et al., ibid., Rodriguez et al., ibid.)., 442019=Initial screening is conducted using 125I-labeled SST analogs and pituitary membrane preparations or cell lines. The binding assay is described in Tran, V. T., Beal, M. F. and Martin, J. B. Science, 228:294-495, 1985, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and is optimized with regards to membrane concentration, temperature and time. The assay is sensitive (nM range) and robust. Selectivity will be based on the recent cloning of the five human SST receptors. The ability to screen the compounds with regard to binding and biological activity in mammalian cells should facilitate the development of subtype-selective analogs. These compounds are useful in the treatment of specific endocrine disorders and therefore should be devoid of unwanted side effects., 343534=TLC (Method B) Rf 0.6-0.65 (one spot); (\u03b1)D=\u22123,3 (c=1, MeOH); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 340552=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.50-0.54 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 402011=TLC (Method D) Rf=0.42-0.47 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 343090=Yield 85%. TLC (Method B) Rf 0.6-0.65 (one spot); (\u03b1)D=+3,3 (c=1, MeOH); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 317772=A solution of 1.1 mmol Boc-amino acid, 1 mmol N\u03b1-(\u03c9-(benzylthio)alkylene) amino acid ester, 1.1 mmol BOP and 3 mmol DIEA in 10 mL DCM was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Then the mixture was diluted with 40 mL of DCM and washed successively with saturated KHSO4 (3\ufffd100 mL), saturated KHCO3 (3\ufffd100 mL) and brine (2\ufffd100 mL), dried over MgSO4 and the solvent evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was cleaned on a silica-gel column with DCM:MeOH-99:1 or crystallized from DIE:hexane., 340048=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.32-0.35 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 303212=TOF MS: 1278 (M+), 443002=The biological effects of SST on growth hormone, insulin and glucagon release is conducted by measuring the levels of these hormones using commercially available RIA test kits. Pharmacological effects of SST in patients with neuroendocrine tumors of the gut will require determination of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (for carcinoid) and VIP (for VIPoma). In vivo visualization of SST receptor-positive tumors is performed as described by Lambert et al., New England J. Med., 323:1246-1249 1990, following i.v. administration of radio-iodinated SST analogs., 46097=In Gilon, EPO Application No. 564,739 A2; and J. Org. Chem., 57:5687, 1992, two basic approaches to the synthesis of building units are described. The first starts with the reaction of a diamine with a general \u03b1 bromo acid. Selective protection of the \u03c9 amine and further elaborations of protecting groups provides a building unit, suitable for Boc chemistry peptide synthesis. The second approach starts with selective protection of a diamine and reaction of the product with chloroacetic acid to provide the protected glycine derivative, suitable for Fmoc peptide synthesis., 316634=10 mmol (R) or (S) N-(\u03c9-(benzylthio)alkylene) amino acid methyl ester was dissolved in 50 mL 1,4-dioxane and 50 mL 1N NaOH were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The disappearance of the starting material was followed by TLC (Silica gel+F254, CHCl3:MeOH-1:4). When all the ester was hydrolyzed, 50 mL water were added, followed by 30 mmol Boc2O. The mixture was stirred overnight, then the dioxane was evaporated in vacuo, the mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath, covered with 100 mL EtAc and acidified with saturated KHSO4 to pH 2-3. The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional 2\ufffd100 mL EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water (2\ufffd100 mL), dried over MgSO4 and the solvent evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was cleaned on a silica-gel column with DCM:MeOH-99:1 or crystallized from DIE:hexane., 339238=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.2-0.24 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 387259=TLC (Method A) Rf=0.52-0.54 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound., 195749=Boc-L-Arg(Tos)-O-resin (0.256 g, 0.1 mmole, 0.39 meq of nitrogen/g) was placed in a shaker flask and swelled for two hours by the addition of DCM. The resin was then carried out through the procedure in Table 1 which includes two deprotections of the Boc protecting group with 55% TFA in DCM for a total of 22 minutes, washing, neutralization with 10% DIEA in NMP and washing (Table 1 steps 1-8). After positive ninhydrin test, as described in Kaiser et al., Anal Biochem., 34:595, 1970 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, coupling (Table 1 steps 9-10) was achieved in NMP by the addition of Fmoc-L-Phe (0.232 g, 0.6 mmole) and after 5 minutes of shaking, solid BOP reagent (0.265 g, 0.6 mmole) was added to the flask., 340919=TLC (Method A) Rf 0.62-0.65 (one spot); NMR (CDCl3) in agreement with the title compound.}",

These two doses are several orders of magnitude higher than those needed to elicit the desired endocrine effect. The peptides dissolved in saline produced no untoward side effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, body temperature, nor on the periphery of the animals. Rats were observed for 4 hours post administration of the peptides. PTR 3007 and 3013 produced no respiratory disturbances, did not result in the appearance of stereotyped behavior, or produce any changes in muscle tone. After 3 hours, postmortem examination did not detect any abnormality in the liver, kidneys, arteries and veins, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, genital system, nor the spleen.
