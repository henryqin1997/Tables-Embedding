    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art, having the benefit of the teachings of the present invention as hereinbefore set forth, may effect numerous modifications thereto. Such modifications are to be construed as lying within the contemplation of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims. An adequately trained neural network comprises a set of trained weights which meet the specified requirements for the incidence of false positivesand false negatives. However, if the user is unable to achieve specified percentages of true positives and false positives from iterative training of the neural network, it may be necessary to select different initial weights, e.g. by choosing a new random weight vector. One might also increase the number ofhidden layers to reduce the error percentage or increase the number of nodes in the hidden layer to further reduce the error. If the analog image is digitized from a video signal, markers may be placedon an overlay transparency or a superimposable graphics layer to indicate the positions of suspected abnormalities on the video monitor displaying the original video image. With reference again to FIG. 1, if at least one cluster of anomalies is detected a signal is sent to a printer 36. The printer 36 produces a transparency overlay sheet 38 containing at least one marker 40 which, when superimposed upon the original image 2, calls a viewer's attention tothe location of possible anomalies. In the preferred embodiment the marker",
