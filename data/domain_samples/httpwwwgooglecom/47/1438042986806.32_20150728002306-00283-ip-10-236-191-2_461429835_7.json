This is discussed in more detail below in connection with the flow chart 1100 of FIG. 11. In some embodiments, this may be handled by manager 905 or other system process which may initially evaluate any search request and consult index 910 or other information stores to determine which metabases within the system are likely to include responsive information. The results of this evaluation may be provided to the computing device handling the search request and may be in the form of pointers or other indicia or identifiers identifying a metabase such as a metabase ID. This may allow the computing device posing the search request to contact and search the identified metadata directly. In other embodiments manager 905 may process the request and provide substantially complete results to the computing device that submitted the query.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{181014=Moreover, metabases associated with each storage operation cell may contain information relating to data and storage operations as described herein. In some embodiments, master storage manager 1835 may include a master metabase index or database (not shown) that reflects some or all of the metadata information from the hierarchically subordinate storage operation cells within the system. This allows the system to consult the master storage index or database for information relating to data within those storage operation cells rather than requiring each cell be contacted of polled directly for such information., 133153=Journaling agents 1165 and classification agents 1164 may operate in conjunction with one another to detect and record data interactions as further described herein. For example, each type of electronic data interaction (e.g.\u2014instant messaging, web surfing, Internet search activities, electronic gaming, multimedia usage, etc.) may be identified, captured, classified, and otherwise tracked by a different journaling agent 1165 and classification agent 1164, for example an interaction-specific journaling agent 1165 or classification agent 1164 dedicated to processing a single type of interaction with electronic data. Thus, the system may have a first journaling agent 1165 and a first classification agent 1164 monitoring network traffic on a given network interface (not shown) directed to interactions associated with Internet usage, and a second journaling agent 1165 and a second classification agent 1164 monitoring a different system resource directed to interactions associated with electronic gaming (e.g.\u2014recording and classifying gaming interactions such as recording games played, opponents played, win/loss records, etc.) or directed to interactions associated with use of an Internet browser to \u201csurf\u201d web (e.g.\u2014tracking pages visited, content, use patterns, etc.) In some embodiments, journaling agent 1165 and classification agent 1164 may function as a single module capable of performing some or all functions associated with journaling agent 1165 and a classification agent 1164., 194102=The search process may further involve consulting one or more indexes associated with the clients to identify where responsive data objects or other copies of client data, etc., may be located within the system. At step 1915, it may be determined whether client data objects satisfying the query are located in primary storage, secondary storage, or both (e.g., based on index information in a storage manager). This may be based on polling various storage managers or a master storage manager that includes information the covers or represents whole system or the portion of system specified for search., 151384=Thus, as can be seen from the above, although the first and second storage operation cells are logically distinct entities configured to perform different management functions (i.e., HSM and SRM respectively), each cell may contain the same or similar physical devices in both storage operation cells. Alternatively, in other embodiments, different storage operation cells may contain some of the same physical devices and not others. For example, a storage operation cell 1550 configured to perform SRM tasks may contain a media agent 1505, client 1585, or other network device connected to a primary storage volume, while a storage operation cell 1550 configured to perform HSM tasks may instead include a media agent 1505, client 1585, or other network device connected to a secondary storage volume and not contain the elements or components associated with and including the primary storage volume. These two cells, however, may each include a different storage manager 1501 that coordinates storage operations via the same media agents 1505 and storage devices 1515. This \u201coverlapping\u201d configuration allows storage resources to be accessed by more than one storage manager 1501 such that multiple paths exist to each storage device 1515 facilitating failover, load balancing and promoting robust data access via alternative routes., 158881=Storage manager 1501 may also include a management agent 1530 that is typically implemented as a software module or application program. In general, management agent 1530 provides an interface that allows various management components 1501 in other storage operation cells 1550 to communicate with one another. For example, assume a certain network configuration includes multiple cells 1550 adjacent to one another or otherwise logically related in a WAN or LAN configuration (not shown). With this arrangement, each cell 1550 may be connected to the other through each respective interface agent 1525. This allows each cell 1550 to send and receive certain pertinent information from other cells 1550 including status information, routing information, information regarding capacity and utilization, etc. These communication paths may also be used to convey information and instructions regarding storage operations., 182585=In some embodiments, master storage manager 1835 may store status information and other information regarding its associated storage operation cells and other system information in an index cache, database or other data structure accessible to manager 1835. A presentation interface included in certain embodiments of master storage manager 1835 may access this information and present it to users and system processes with information regarding the status of storage operations, storage operation cells, system components, and other information of the system., 199198=First, at step 2002, a query seeking certain data may be identified. The query may be analyzed to ascertain certain additional information that may assist in identifying responsive information such as identifying a certain point in time to search (step 2004). This may involve consulting storage manager and/or media agent index or database for responsive information relating to a certain point in time. This may also involve consulting certain metabases for similar information that may be associated with these or other media management components providing copy and management functions. Point in time information may be specified by the user or may be assigned by the system absent a specific time frame established by the user. For example, a user may specify a certain time range within the query (e.g., a time range, a certain date, all information related to a project since its inception etc.). The system however, may assign a certain time limit based on the query (e.g., such as based on the specifics of the query (e.g., only have data relating to a certain time frame)), and may limit the search to the time frame of information present in certain metabases, master storage manager, or index within the system, and/or poll or otherwise communicate with storage devices within the system to determine the range or time frame of available data within the system and present the user with options for retrieving it (e.g., some, all within a time frame, etc.), 157442=Storage manager 1501 may include a jobs agent 1520 that monitors the status of some or all storage operations previously performed, currently being performed, or scheduled to be performed by storage operation cell 1550. Jobs agent 1520 may be communicatively coupled with an interface agent 1525 (typically a software module or application). Interface agent 1525 may include information processing and display software, such as a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d), an application program interface (\u201cAPI\u201d), or other interactive interface through which users and system processes can retrieve information about the status of storage operations. Through interface 1525, users may optionally issue instructions to various storage operation cells 1550 regarding performance of the storage operations as described and contemplated by the present invention. For example, a user may modify a schedule concerning the number of pending snapshot copies or other types of copies scheduled as needed to suit particular needs or requirements. As another example, a user may employ the GUI to view the status of pending storage operations in some or all of the storage operation cells in a given network or to monitor the status of certain components in a particular storage operation cell (e.g., the amount of storage capacity left in a particular storage device)., 200714=Next, at step 2006 certain archive files may be identified and associated media agents (step 2008) that may have been involved in transferring responsive data objects. This may be determined by consulting a master storage manager or other media management component index or metabase to determine whether the archive files have been handled by such components. Once the appropriate media agents have been identified, it may be determined whether information regarding the identified archive files is present in a cache or index associated with the media agents (step 2010). If not, the index information may need to be uploaded so the appropriate archive files may be retrieved and accessed. This process may be performed until all identified media agents have the appropriate index information loaded and/or until it is determined that no responsive information has been handled by the media agents and therefore no index information need be uploaded., 173839=Next, at step 1724 one or more target secondary storage devices may be identified. This may involve consulting a storage policy or storage manager to determine the destination point. In some embodiments, destination maybe determined dynamically, such that it is selected based on certain system preferences or optimization routines that select a storage device based on storage capacity, availability, data paths to the destination, etc. Once the secondary storage device(s) are identified, the archive files may be routed to a media agent, storage manager, or other system component that supervises the transfer to the target secondary storage device (steps 1724 and 1728). This may involve selecting and appropriate data transfer route and ensuring the proper resources and are available (e.g., bandwidth) such that the data may be copied with a certain period of time. Supervision may further include parsing a copy operation into several portions with each portion being transferred by certain media agent or other resources, etc, to meet system or transfer requirements (e.g., a time window)., 185795=As another example, and as previously described herein, different storage operation cells directed to different functions may also contain the same or a subset of the same set of physical devices. Thus, one storage operation cell in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be configured to perform SRM operations and may contain the same, similar or a subset of the same physical devices as a cell configured to perform HSM or other types of storage operations. Each storage operation cell may, however, share the same parent or, alternatively, may be located on different branches of a storage operation cell hierarchy tree. For example, storage operation cell 1845 may be directed to SRM operations whereas storage operation cell 1855 may be directed to HSM operations. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of such combinations and arrangements of storage operation cells are possible to address a broad range of different aspects of performing storage operations in a hierarchy of storage operation cells., 154695=If a client computer 1585 has two or more types of data, one data agent 1595 may be required for each data type to copy, archive, migrate, and restore the client computer 1585 data. For example, to backup, migrate, and restore all of the data on a Microsoft Exchange 2000 server, the client computer 1585 may use one Microsoft Exchange 2000 Mailbox data agent 1595 to backup the Exchange 2000 mailboxes, one Microsoft Exchange 2000 Database data agent 1595 to backup the Exchange 2000 databases, one Microsoft Exchange 2000 Public Folder data agent 1595 to backup the Exchange 2000 Public Folders, and one Microsoft Windows 2000 File System data agent 1595 to backup the client computer's 1585 file system. These data agents 1595 would be treated as four separate data agents 1595 by the system even though they reside on the same client computer 1585., 183199=In some embodiments, master storage manager 1835 may store and/or track metadata and other information regarding its associated storage operation cells and other system information in an index cache, database or other data structure accessible to manager 1835. Thus, during a search procedure as further described herein, queries can be directed to a specific storage operation cell or cells based on the cell's function, past involvement, routing or other information maintained within the storage manager or other management component., 179489=The storage operation cells may be configured in any suitable fashion, including those which involve distributed or centralized metabases. For example, storage operation cell 1840 may include a centralized primary storage metabase and a centralized secondary storage metabase, storage operation cell 1845 may include a centralized primary storage metabase and multiple secondary storage metabases, storage operation cell 1850 may include multiple primary storage metabases and a centralized secondary storage metabase, and storage operation cell 1855 may include multiple primary storage metabases and multiple secondary storage metabases (not shown). However, it will be understood that this is merely illustrative, and any other suitable configuration may be used if desired., 135201=For example, in operation, a user of computing device 1162 may interact with certain applications such as multimedia application 1170 and instant messaging application 1172. This may include sending, receiving, viewing and responding to various audio/video files in any suitable format and may include instant, text or email messages. Journaling agent 1165 may detect the interactions between these applications and computing device 1162 and classification agent 1164 may classify and record information (e.g., metadata) associated with these interactions in metabase 1166 as further described herein., 160599=Another illustrative example is the case where management agent 130 in the first storage operation cell 1550 communicates directly with and controls the components in the second storage management cell 1550 and bypasses the storage manager 1501 in the second storage management cell. If desired, storage operation cells 1550 can also be organized hierarchically such that hierarchically superior cells control or pass information to hierarchically subordinate cells or vice versa., 207731=In certain embodiments, the copied data and metadata may be deleted from the source location (steps 2044-2048). For example, at step 2044, it may be determined whether the copied data objects in secondary storage should be deleted based user preferences, storage policy requirements or other system constraints such has diminished storage capacity, etc. At steps 2046 and 2048 the data objects and records may be deleted within the system including any metabase or other system management information associated with the retrieved data. Storage management components such as storage managers, media agents may also be updated to reflect the removal or deletion of such information (step 2050)., 148409=In some embodiments, storage operations may be performed according to various storage preferences, for example as expressed by a user preference or storage policy. A storage policy is generally a data structure or other information source that includes a set of preferences and other storage criteria associated with performing a storage operation. The preferences and storage criteria may include, but are not limited to, a storage location, relationships between system components, network pathway to utilize, retention policies, data characteristics, compression or encryption requirements, preferred system components to utilize in a storage operation, and other criteria relating to a storage operation. Thus, a storage policy may indicate that certain data is to be stored in a specific storage device, retained for a specified period of time before being aged to another tier of secondary storage, copied to secondary storage using a specified number of streams, etc. A storage policy may be stored in a storage manager database 1511, to archive media as metadata for use in restore operations or other storage operations, or to other locations or components of the system., 164784=Generally speaking, information stored in cache is typically recent information that reflects certain particulars about operations that have recently occurred. After a certain period of time, this information is sent to secondary storage and tracked. This information may need to be retrieved and uploaded back into a cache or other memory in a secondary computing device before data can be retrieved from storage device 1515. In some embodiments, the cached information may include information regarding format or containerization of archive or other files stored on storage device 1515., 167005=Moreover, in operation, a storage manager 1501 or other management module may keep track of certain information that allows the storage manager to select, designated or otherwise identify metabases to be searched in response to certain queries as further described herein. Movement of data between primary and secondary storage may also involvement movement of associated metadata and other tracking information as further described herein., 205794=If, however, at step 2020, it is determined that the identified data objects are moving to primary storage, accordingly, the data objects may be reformatted (e.g., unpacked from archive file format) for copying to a computing device (step 2038). Next the unpacked data may be copied to a target computing device along with any associated metadata (steps 2040 and 2042). For example, this may involve reading metadata and/or index information from the archive file and repopulating the metabase and/or management component indexes with this information as further described herein. For example, metadata from the archive file may be retrieved and integrated into a metabase associated with the target computing device including information relating to data management and as well as certain content and storage information as further described herein with respect to the classification process and metabase population. Thus, such archive information may be fully restored to primary storage and any associated information, such as metabase information may be searched and retrieved accordingly., 150318=For example, an administrator may find it preferable to separate e-mail data from financial data using two different sub-clients having different storage preferences, retention criteria, etc. Storage operation cells may contain not only physical devices, but also may represent logical concepts, organizations, and hierarchies. For example, a first storage operation cell 1550 may be configured to perform a first type of storage operations such as HSM operations, which may include backup or other types of data migration, and may include a variety of physical components including a storage manager 1501 (or management agent 1530), a media agent 1505, a client component 1585, and other components as described herein. A second storage operation cell may contain the same or similar physical components, however, it may be configured to perform a second type of storage operations such as SRM operations, and may include as monitoring a primary data copy or performing other known SRM operations., 176374=At step 1736, it may be determined whether the data objects transferred from the primary storage device are to be deleted. If so, the data objects and associated metadata in a first metabase may be erased or otherwise designated for overwrite (steps 1738 and 1740). In some cases, a pointer or other reference such as a file stub may be left in the original data location., 195420=Next at step 1920, storage managers may be consulted to identify responsive archive files. At step 1925, media management components that may have handled responsive data objects are be identified. This may be based on information retrieved from the storage manager index regarding archive files, e.g., an association of archive files with media agents and media items. It may then be determined whether the identified media management components have metadata relating to the identified archive files available readily available in an index cache (step 1930)., 171247=At step 1708 the identified data objects may be copied from primary storage of a first computing device (the source) to primary storage of a second computing device (the target or destination). Any metadata associated with the first computing device describing the copied data may also be copied to a metabase associated with the second computing device such that this description information is not abandoned or lost, but rather travels with the copied data for subsequent use (step 1710)., 202227=At step 2018, the new destination for the data objects may be determined. For example, if certain data objects are being migrated off as part of an ILM operation, the query or other information may indicate the intent or reason for the search and the data object's destination. This may be useful in determining whether certain data objects are responsive to search criteria or query. At step 220 it may be determined whether the new destination is primary storage (a restore operation) or secondary or other tier of storage (ILM). Such information may be further useful in determining whether the data objects are likely to fall within a time frame or category of interest and thus may be useful in further identifying data objects of interest., 186893=In some embodiments, hierarchical organization of storage operation cells facilitates, among other things, system security and other considerations. For example, in some embodiments, only authorized users may be allowed to access or control certain storage operation cells. For example, a network administrator for an enterprise may have access to many or all storage operation cells including master storage manager 1835. But a network administrator for only the New York office, according to a previous example, may only have access to storage operation cells 1845-1855, which form the New York office storage management system., 139599=Likewise, interactions with gaming applications (network or stand alone) may also be recorded stored with appropriate information stored in database 1168 and metabase 1166. Thus, a user may have the ability to retrieve, replay and transmit certain saved gaming sequences to third parties., 184748=Storage operation cells may also be organized hierarchically according to function, geography, architectural considerations, or other factors useful or desirable in performing storage operations. For example, in one embodiment, storage operation cell 1840 may be directed to create snapshot copies of primary copy data, storage operation cell 1845 may be directed to create backup copies of primary copy data or other data. Storage operation cell 1840 may represent a geographic segment of an enterprise, such as a Chicago office, and storage operation cell 1845 may represents a different geographic segment, such as a New York office. In this example, the second storage operation cells 1845, 1850 and 1855 may represent departments within the New York office. Alternatively, these storage operation cells could be further divided by function performing various types of copies for the New York office or load balancing storage operations for the New York office., 175781=At step 1734, any metadata stored in a first metabase associated with the transferred data objects may also be transferred and used to update a second metabase associated with the target secondary storage device. Such metadata may be copied from the first metabase to the second metabase using network transmission resources. In some embodiments, the metadata in the first metabase may be deleted after it is confirmed the metadata has been copied to the second metabase. In other embodiments, the metadata may remain in both first and second metabases., 152831=Alternatively, in some embodiments, the same storage manager 1501 may control two or more cells 1550 (whether or not each storage cell 1550 has its own dedicated storage manager 100). Moreover, in certain embodiments, the extent or type of overlap may be user-defined (through a control console (not shown)) or may be automatically configured to optimize data storage and/or retrieval., 146742=A storage operation cell, such as cell 1550, may generally include combinations of hardware and software components associated with performing storage operations on electronic data. According to some embodiments of the invention, storage operations cell 50 may be related to backup cells and provide some or all of the functionality of backup cells as described in application Ser. No. 09/354,058, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, in certain embodiments, storage operation cells may also perform additional types of storage operations and other types of storage management functions that are not generally offered by backup cells., 191073=In alternate embodiments, HSM and SRM components may be aware of each other due to a common database or metabase of information that may include normalized data from a plurality of cells. Therefore, in those embodiments there is no need for such information to pass through a master storage manager as these components may be able to communicate directly with one another. For example, storage operation cell 1845 may communicate directly with storage operation cell 1855 and vice versa. This may be accomplished through a direct communications link between the two or by passing data through intermediate cells., 197447=Next, if no further media management components have been identified, a list of media management components to be searched may be compiled (step 1945). At step 1950, a list of clients identified as potentially having responsive data objects may also be compiled. After a complete list of secondary storages devices and clients potentially having responsive data objects is identified, the associated metabases are queried for these components, step 1960, and results are returned indicating data objects that may satisfy the search criteria, step 1965. In some embodiments, these results may be reviewed and analyzed to ensure relevance, with only reasonably relevant or responsive data objects actually being retrieved., 137017=Moreover, in some embodiments, specialized classifications agents may be employed for some or all of the applications that a user or administrator desires to track and record. For example, the multimedia and instant messaging applications described above may each have a dedicated classification agent that analyzes journal records to create entries for metabase 1166. Further still, each classification agent may have its own associated metabase and or repository for source data (not shown), so application histories and content may be quickly indexed and searched. In other embodiments, however, a \u201cuniversal\u201d classification agent may be used that recognizes the application type (e.g., based on the journaling agent entries) and process interactions accordingly (which may include routing metadata to one or more specialized metabases)., 196034=This may be accomplished by searching for reference information relating to the identified archive files. If such information is already present in the cache, responsive data objects may be identified and retrieved using the index cache information, which may include, offsets and any file identifiers, etc., by the media management component, and the system may proceed to step 1940 (determine whether another media management component needs to be analyzed)., 163274=Each secondary storage computing device 1505 may maintain a index, a database, or other data structure 1506 which may store index data generated during backup, migration, and restore and other storage operations as described herein. For example, performing storage operations on Microsoft Exchange data may generate index data. Such index data provides a secondary computing device 1505 or other external device with a fast and efficient mechanism for locating data stored or backed up. Thus, in some embodiments, a secondary storage computing device index 1506, or a storage manager database 1511, may store data associating a client 1585 with a particular secondary computing device 1505 or storage device 1515, for example, as specified in a storage policy, while a database or other data structure in secondary computing device 1505 may indicate where specifically the client 1585 data is stored in storage device 1515, what specific files were stored, and other information associated with storage of client 1585 data. In some embodiments, such index data may be stored along with the data backed up in a storage device 1515, with an additional copy of the index data written to index cache in a secondary storage device. Thus the data is readily available for use in storage operations and other activities without having to be first retrieved from the storage device 1515., 132542=In operation computing device 1162 may be coupled to or interact with various other applications, networks, and electronic information such as, for example multimedia applications 1170, instant messaging/chat applications 1172, network applications 1174 such as an enterprise WAN or LAN, Internet 1176, and gaming applications 1178. It will be understood, however, that these are only examples and that any other network, application, or type of electronic information suitable for the purposes described herein may be added if desired., 51420=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/740,686, entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CLASSIFYING INFORMATION IN A STORAGE NETWORK, filed Nov. 28, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/752,203, entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CLASSIFYING AND TRANSFERRING INFORMATION IN A STORAGE NETWORK, filed Dec. 19, 2005, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 154054=Embodiments of the present invention may employ multiple data agents 1595 each of which may backup, migrate, and recover data associated with a different application. For example, different individual data agents 1595 may be designed to handle Microsoft Exchange data, Lotus Notes data, Microsoft Windows 2000 file system data, Microsoft Active Directory Objects data, and other types of data known in the art. Other embodiments may employ one or more generic data agents 1595 that can handle and process multiple data types rather than using the specialized data agents described above., 191732=Moreover, in some embodiments searches may be performed across a numerous storage cells within the hierarchy. For example, a query may be posed to master storage manager 1835 that may pass the query down through the hierarchy from cells 1840 to 1845 to 1850 and 1855, etc. This may be accomplished by passing the query form one manager component of each cell to another, or from one data classification agent to another, one metabase to another etc. The results may be passed upward through the hierarchy and compiled with other results such that master storage manager 1835 has a complete set of results to report. In other embodiments, each storage manager cell may report results directly to the requester or to a designated location., 180327=Thus, in operation, master storage manager 1835 may communicate with a management agent of the storage manager of the first storage operation cell 1840 (or directly with the other components of first cell 1840) with respect to storage operations performed in the first storage operation cell 1840. For example, in some embodiments, master storage manager 1835 may instruct the first storage operation cell 1840 with certain commands regarding a desired storage operation such as how and when to perform particular storage operations including the type of operation and the data on which to perform the operation., 161765=Generally speaking, a media agent, which may also be referred to as a secondary storage computing device, 1505 may be implemented as software module that conveys data, as directed by storage manager 1501, between a client computer 1585 and one or more storage devices 1515 such as a tape library, a magnetic media storage device, an optical media storage device, or any other suitable storage device. In one embodiment, secondary computing device 1505 may be communicatively coupled with and control a storage device 1515. A secondary computing device 1505 may be considered to be associated with a particular storage device 1515 if that secondary computing device 1505 is capable of routing and storing data to particular storage device 1515., 201720=Next, at step 2016 data objects satisfying the query criteria may be identified by searching metabases and/or indexes. In some embodiments, such data objects may be compiled into a list of data objects for present or subsequent retrieval. For example, such a list of responsive data objects may be provided to the user (which may itself satisfy the query) and then provide the user with the option to actually retrieve all or certain selected identified data objects., 139934=In some embodiments, database 1168 may become large and thus some information stored thereon may be moved to single instance storage from database 1168 with a pointer placed in the logical address of the instanced information (not shown). This may be performed as a memory saving measure as at least some of the entries in database 1168 are likely to be duplicative., 159902=For example, a management agent 1530 in first storage operation cell 1550 may communicate with a management agent 1530 in a second storage operation cell 1550 regarding the status of storage operations in the second storage operation cell. Another illustrative example includes the case where a management agent 1530 in first storage operation cell 1550 communicates with a management agent 1530 in a second storage operation cell to control the storage manager 1501 (and other components) of the second storage operation cell via the management agent 1530 contained in the storage manager 100., 162611=In operation, a secondary computing device 1505 associated with a particular storage device 1515 may instruct the storage device to use a robotic arm or other retrieval means to load or eject a certain storage media, and to subsequently archive, migrate, or restore data to or from that media. Secondary computing device 1505 may communicate with a storage device 1515 via a suitable communications path such as a SCSI or fiber channel communications link. In some embodiments, the storage device 1515 may be communicatively coupled to a data agent 105 via a Storage Area Network (\u201cSAN\u201d)., 134786=Thus, as a user or group interacts with various types of electronic information, some or all of those interactions may be captured and recorded in database 1168. Change record 1167 and metabase 1166 may record certain aspects of the interactions as further described herein and may represent an interaction by interaction log of the user's computing activities., 189557=Alternatively, a storage manager in a particular storage operation cell may be unavailable due to hardware failure, software problems, or other reasons. In some embodiments, master storage manager 1835 (or another storage manager within the hierarchy of storage operation cells) may utilize the global data regarding its associated storage operation cells to suggest solutions to such problems when they occur (or act as a warning prior to occurrence). For example, master storage manager 1835 may alert the user that a storage device in a particular storage operation cell is full or otherwise congested, and then suggest, based on job and data storage information contained in its database, or associated metabase, or an alternate storage device. Other types of corrective actions based an such information may include suggesting an alternate data path to a particular storage device, or dividing data to be stored among various available storage devices as a load balancing measure or to otherwise optimize storage or retrieval time. In some embodiments, such suggestions or corrective actions may be performed automatically, if desired. This may include automatically monitoring the relative health or status of various storage operation cells and searching for information within the cells of the system relating to systems or resource performance within that cell (e.g., index, metabase, database, etc.) for use in diagnostics or for suggesting corrective action., 156916=Generally speaking, storage manager 1501 may be a software module or other application that coordinates and controls storage operations performed by storage operation cell 1550. Storage manager 1501 may communicate with some or all elements of storage operation cell 1550 including client computers 1585, data agents 1595, media agents 1505, and storage devices 1515, to initiate and manage system backups, migrations, and data recovery., 181671=In other embodiments, master storage manager 1835 may track the status of its associated storage operation cells, such as the status of jobs, system components, system resources, and other items, by communicating with manager agents (or other components) in the respective storage operation cells. Moreover, master storage manager 1835 may track the status of its associated storage operation cells by receiving periodic status updates from the manager agents (or other components) in the respective cells regarding jobs, system components, system resources, and other items. For example, master storage manager 1835 may use methods to monitor network resources such as mapping network pathways and topologies to, among other things, physically monitor storage operations and suggest, for example, alternate routes for storing data as further described herein., 128860=Once the search request or query has been analyzed or parsed, the system may identify all metabases likely to contain records related to relevant data objects based on a query. This may be accomplished by using information obtained from analyzing or parsing the request as well as consulting with a management module that may have a substantially global view of metabases within the system that includes index information or a general overview of the information the metabases contain. After a set of metabases have been identified, the management module or other computing device may perform the search to identify a data set satisfying a query as further described herein and return a set of results (step 1130). At step 1140 the results may optionally be normalized. If normalization is not required, the results may be reported at step 1150. If normalization is desired, the system may analyze the results for both content and completeness. If, based on the returned results, other unsearched metabases are implicated as potentially having information that satisfies the search criteria, those metabases may be searched as well. This process may continue in an iterative fashion until a substantially complete set of results is obtained. Even if no additional metabases are implicated, these results may then be optionally normalized by performing certain functions such as locating and removing duplicative results, identifying network pathways to data objects identified in the search, and formatting or arranging the results for further processing (whether another computing process or for a user). For example, the returned results may be used to locate and retrieve the responsive data objects that may include information located on primary or secondary storage devices within the system or for other purposes as further described herein., 153277=Data agent 1595 may be a software module or part of a software module that is generally responsible for copying, archiving, migrating, and recovering data from client computer 1585 stored in an information store 1590 or other memory location. Each client computer 1585 may have at least one data agent 1595 and the system can support multiple client computers 1585. In some embodiments, data agents 1595 may be distributed between client 1585 and storage manager 1501 (and any other intermediate components (not shown)) or may be deployed from a remote location or its functions approximated by a remote process that performs some or all of the functions of data agent 1595., 147454=In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, additional storage operations performed by storage operation cells may include creating, storing, retrieving, and migrating primary storage data (e.g., 1590) and secondary storage data (which may include, for example, snapshot copies, backup copies, HSM copies, archive copies, and other types of copies of electronic data) stored on storage devices 1515. In some embodiments, storage operation cells may also provide one or more integrated management consoles for users or system processes to interface with in order to perform certain storage operations on electronic data as further described herein. Such integrated management consoles may be displayed at a central control facility or several similar consoles distributed throughout multiple network locations to provide global or geographically specific network data storage information., 161147=Storage manager 1501 may also maintain an index, a database, or other data structure 1511. The data stored in database 1511 may be used to indicate logical associations between components of the system, user preferences, management tasks, media containerization and data storage information or other useful data. For example, the storage manager 1501 may use data from database 1511 to track logical associations between media agent 1505 and storage devices 1515 (or movement of data as containerized from primary to secondary storage)., 172312=In some embodiments the data objects may be deleted but certain metadata may be retained. If it is decided not delete the data objects, the data is retained and an index in an associated storage manager may be updated (step 1718), for example by updating an index to reflect a new location, data object status, any changes, etc., and return to step 1702. In other embodiments, if data is deleted from the system, for example, a user permanently deletes certain data from an application, that associated data may also be deleted from both primary and secondary storage devices and associated metabases to free storage space within the system., 135884=Moreover, in some embodiments, some or all the content being exchanged or otherwise associated with these interactions may be captured and stored in database 1168 or other storage locations in the system. This may include capturing screen shots or summaries of information exchanges during data interactions. For example, the system may download all content associated with web pages viewed thus being able to recreate the original page content and interaction without access to the original or source version of the page on the Internet or other network. This may be advantageous, for example, if a user wishes to interact with content associated with a previous interaction when that content is no longer available, as is common with web pages and other network resources over time. As another example, the system may also capture or otherwise store data associated with other interactions, for example chat transcripts, video game replays, search queries, search results, and associated search content, songs accessed, movies accessed, stored songs and movies, in addition to metadata, etc., 155657=Alternatively, other embodiments may use one or more generic data agents 1595, each of which may be capable of handling two or more data types. For example, one generic data agent 1595 may be used to back up, migrate and restore Microsoft Exchange 2000 Mailbox data and Microsoft Exchange 2000 Database data while another generic data agent may handle Microsoft Exchange 2000 Public Folder data and Microsoft Windows 2000 File System data, etc., 171784=Next, at step 1712, it may be determined whether the copied data objects and associated metadata are to be deleted from the source computing device. For example, this may be done in order to free storage space on the source computer or in accordance with certain data aging or migration criteria. If it is decided to delete the data objects (and associated metadata) the memory locations which include the data may be erased or designated for overwrite (step 1714 and 1716)., 165419=In some embodiments, certain components may reside and execute on the same computer. For example, in some embodiments, a client computer 1585 such as a data agent 1595, or a storage manager 1501 coordinates and directs local archiving, migration, and retrieval application functions as further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/610,738. This client computer 1585 can function independently or together with other similar client computers 1585., 144745=At step 1420, the query may be analyzed and a first data store associated with a first computer may be searched for data objects satisfying the search criteria. Data objects identified during this process may then be transferred to a second data store associated with a second computing device (step 1430). Metadata associated with the transferred data objects may also be identified in a first metabase associated with the first computing device and transferred to an appropriate second metabase associated with the second computing device (step 1440). Such a transfer may involve copying data objects and metadata from one data store and metabase to another, or in some embodiments, may involve migrating the data from its original location to a second location and leaving a pointer or other reference to the second location so the moved information may be quickly located from information present at the original location., 205082=In some embodiments, the copied data objects and metadata may be deleted from the source location (steps 2028-2032). For example, at step 2028, it may be determined whether the copied data objects should be deleted based user preferences, storage policy requirements or other system constraints such has diminished storage capacity, etc. At steps 2030 and 2032 the data objects and records may be deleted. However, a stub, pointer or other referential element may be placed at the same logical location to act as a marker for the moved data. This allows subsequent operations to quickly track down and locate the moved data at its new location., 188980=In other embodiments master storage manager 1835 may alert a user such as a system administrator when a particular resource is unavailable or congested. For example, a particular storage device might be full or require additional media. For example, a master storage manager may use information from an HSM storage operation cell and an SRM storage operation cell to present indicia or otherwise alert a user or otherwise identify aspects of storage associated with the storage management system and hierarchy of storage operation cells.}",
