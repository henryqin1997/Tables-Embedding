    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115899=The circuit structure of Compare LT & TOP block 209 is embodied in the schematic of FIG. 36. Data is coupled into shift register 282 from columns 12, 13 or 16 of Buffer Latch 202 through selectors 281 and 287. Column 16 is used for E13B font, column 13 for 1428 and column 12 for all others. New column bit data is entered into row 20 of shift register 282 as old data is shifted down through rows 3 and 1. Selector 283 chooses row 1 or 3 depending on the font. The bit values from logic block 284 actuate up/down counter 285 to maintain a running total. The total column count NL from counter 285 is then compared with the count NT for row 20 from Row Data Counter 203 in comparator 286., 156089=Begin the analysis of Recognition Timing block 357 (FIG. 50A) with the segments designated parts 1 and 2, respectively corresponding to FIGS. 57A and 57B. Crystal 355 and clock signal generator 495 create the basic 4 MHz clock signal used throughout the Recognition board. The signal is designated RECCLK. RECCLK is coupled into counter 488 to generate a sequence of addresses for PROM 489. The outputs from PROM 489 are clocked into latch 501 for external coupling. The timing sequence is reset with template counter set signal RSTTEM/, while the timing variations needed for font 7B, E13B and 1428 are introduced as address changes to PROM 489 by gate 490., 55323=The embodying OCR Reader System also incorporates a variety of features which have only secondary relationship to the invention itself. However, they are included to illustrate the overall flexibility of a system which employs the present invention. A first example is the variety of fonts which can be optically captured and processed with the same system. This includes not only the conventional OCRA, OCRB, 1403, 1428, FARRINGTON 7B (7B), and E13B fonts, but also special customer configured fonts or symbols. Another example includes the remittance processing (RPS) mode, during which the first symbol in the character field automatically selects the font of the succeeding characters. These and other aspects of the invention features will be developed in greater detail hereinafter., 155796=It was previously described that the size of the window varied with the font being processed. The timing signals are similarly affected. Namely, the recognition clock signals used for fonts 7B, E13B and 1428 differ from those used when processing characters of other fonts., 159387=FIGS. 58A and 58B schematically depict a set of waveforms embodying the timing used in present Recognition board. The 4 MHz master clock signal, RECCLK, is shown at the top of FIG. 58A, but has been deleted from the continuation appearing in FIG. 58B. Generally, the waveforms in FIG. 58A represent the timing for approximately one-half the recognition cycle for a single template. During this period, the templates are sequentially incremented and the differences between template data and character data are determined and evaluated. FIG. 58B represents the waveform for the second half of recognition timing for the above-noted template, during which the values for MIN 1, MIN 2, and MIN1-MIN2 are determined. The adjustments for fonts 7B, E13B and 1428, noted previously, are illustrated by dashed lines in the plots., 130429=Finder board 15 also contains a Recognition Delay circuit, shown as block 222 in FIG. 17. The function of block 222 is to allow the window to move off a currently found character without refinding that same character. For present purposes, a delay of 16 columns is suitable with E13B font, 13 for 1428 font, and 12 for all other fonts., 40315=This application is related to copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 254,838, filed Apr. 16, 1981, on behalf of inventors John Grabowski and ChinChih Shiau, and assigned to the assignee of the present application. Accordingly, the subject matter of the copending application is incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations At this point, one undoubtedly recognizes the essential features which characterize the present invention, as well as the complexity of implementing the features into an operable embodiment. In view of the numerous variations by which the features may be practiced, it should be recognized that the scope and spirit of the presently claimed invention fully encompasses such variation of the embodiment. Controller 552 on the OCR Interface board receives recognition synchronization clock signals and various other commands to control the entry and release of buffered data. Typical functions performed by controller 552 include the decoding of input commands, the resetting of operations from document to document, the sequencing of the data coupled into and out of buffer 551, the monitoring of the buffer for overflow conditions, and the synchronization of the various operations to interface the OCR Reader System with the next stage of equipment. Given the extensive description of the operations performed by the preceding boards, the comparatively rudimentary operations performed on OCR Interface board 17, and its secondary relationship to the fundamental invention, no further development is warranted. Referring back to the general block diagram of FIG. 1, it is shown that the character data from Recognition board 16 is coupled to OCR Interface board 17. This is accomplished in the manner generally depicted in FIG. 60. Namely, the six lines of data representing the character found and recognized are coupled from latch 473",
