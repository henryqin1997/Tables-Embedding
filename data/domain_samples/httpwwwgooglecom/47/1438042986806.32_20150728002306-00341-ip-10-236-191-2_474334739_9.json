    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36438=More recently, a number of methods have been developed that allow microfluidic devices to be constructed from plastic, silicone or other polymeric materials. In one such method, a negative mold is first constructed, and plastic or silicone is then poured into or over the mold. The mold can be constructed using a silicon wafer (see, e.g., Duffy et al., Analytical Chemistry (1998) 70: 4974-4984; McCormick et al., Analytical Chemistry (1997) 69: 2626-2630), or by building a traditional injection molding cavity for plastic devices. Some molding facilities have developed techniques to construct extremely small molds. Components constructed using a lithography, electroplating and molding (LIGA) technique have been developed at the Karolsruhe Nuclear Research center in Germany (see, e.g., Schomburg et al, Journal of Micromechanical Microengineering (1994) 4: 186-191), and commercialized by MicroParts (Dortmund, Germany). Jenoptik (Jena, Germany) also uses LIGA and a hot-embossing technique. Imprinting methods in PMMA also have been demonstrated (see, Martynova et al, Analytical Chemistry (1997) 69: 4783-4789) However, these techniques do not lend themselves to rapid prototyping and manufacturing flexibility. Additionally, these techniques are limited to planar structures. Moreover, the tool-up costs for both of these techniques are quite high and can be cost-prohibitive., 85695=The volume of the channels can be adjusted to accommodate various sample sizes. Because of errors in delivering small volumes of samples, sample injection volumes can have substantial variability within a range from a high end to a low end. Importantly, the volume of sample area (within 158) must be smaller than the low end of the sample volume injected. Additionally, the volume of channel 156 and chambers 159 and 161 must be greater than the high end of the sample volume injected. For example, for a sample injection volume of 1 microliter\ufffd30%, the volume of chamber 158 between the two microfluidic impedances (166 and 167) must be less than 700 nl. Additionally, the volume of 156,159, and 161 must be greater than the total possible volume, 1300 nl minus the sample volume. In a preferred embodiment, the metering volume would be 600 nl and the waste system would be 1 microliter., 48488=In embodiments where a device is constructed from modular layers, such layers can be joined with an adhesive. The adhesive can be, for example, a rubber-based adhesive, an acrylic-based adhesive, a silicone adhesives or a gum-based adhesive. The material used for forming the layer also can be self adhesive. For example, a layer used can be an adhesive tape. Adhesive tapes can, for example, have a polymer layer with one or more sides coated with an adhesive. Many adhesive tapes are known including, for example, pressure-sensitive tapes, chemically-activated tapes, heat-activated tapes and optically-activated tapes. In another embodiment, individual stencil layers can be joined with mechanical pressure. A number of techniques for constructing microfludic devices from stencil layers arc disclosed in application Ser. No. 09/453,029 filed Dec. 2, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other techniques for constructing microfluidic devices are disclosed in application Ser. No. 09/453,026 filed Dec. 2, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.}",

It is to be appreciated therefore, that changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention and that the scope of the invention should be interpreted with respect to the following claims. The disclosures of all references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. When aqueous buffer was injected into entry port 210, it passed through channel 221 until it reached the overlap region 223. The fluid then entered into channel 220 first, which is on the next adjacent stencil layer 215. The fluid then entered channel 219, and finally it entered channel 218. The assembled device is shown in FIG. 9B and contains a fluidic overlap region 223 where all four of the channels come together at a single vertical position. In this example, a device is shown that contains four channels that meet at a central point that results in a multi-layered microfluidic impedance. Referring to FIG. 9A, an inlet port 210 and three outlet ports 211 were created in a \u215b\u2033 thick polycarbonate base 212. Five stencil layers were created 213-217 that have channels 218-221 and multiple apertures 222 cut into them. The stencils were",
