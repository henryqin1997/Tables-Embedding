Rather the scope of the present invention includes various combinations and subcombinations of the features described hereinabove as well as modifications and variations thereof as would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description with reference to the drawings and which are not in the prior art. It is appreciated that, while the above embodiments of control logic circuitry 134 include selecting an intermediate delay which is a function of the initial and terminal data integrity delays, control logic circuitry 134 may alternatively select an intermediate delay which is a function of the only initial data integrity delay. In this alternative, steps f\u2032 and g above may be obviated. h. selecting an intermediate delay which is a function of the initial and terminal data integrity delays and applying said intermediate delay as the variable time delay. g. repeating steps c. and d. for further increasing delays until write/read data integrity is found to not to exist for a terminal data integrity delay; f\u2032. writing to the double data rate type memory at least a first burst of data; f. repeating steps c. and d. for increasing delays until write/read data integrity is found to exist for",
