Kibler. Gerald R. Laooin It is certified that error appears in the above-identified patent and that said Letters Patent are hereby corrected as shown below:, 16361=The incorporation of extremely low concentrations of alkali metal salts of sulfoisophthalic acid or other sulfoacids into a fiber-forming polyester or the like for the purpose of improving the dyeability of the fiber has been taught in a number of patents. None of these references, however, are concerned with a water-dissipatable polyester or polyesteramides, nor do they teach (1) the preparation of a polymer from a glycol of which at least 15 mole percent is a poly(ethylene glycol), i.e., a poly- (oxyethylene glycol), or (2) such a preparation Where the total of all components contains at least about 8 mole percent of a poly(ethylene glycol). One of these patents, US. 3,018,272, discloses the use of a variety of sulfoacids, including -sulfoisophthalic acid. The upper limit of sulfoacid concentration disclosed in this patent, however, is 10 mole percent of the total acid components and the polymers identified therein are not water-dissipatable and do not contain poly(oxyalkylene) glycols. A Japanese patent application No. 12,149/62 (apparently published on Aug. 27, 1962) discloses in a translated English abstract that polyester copolymers are prepared from terephthalic acid, sodium sulfophthalic acid or other sulfo-carboxylic acids, glycols having 2-1O carbon atoms and poly(oxyalkylene glycols); however the sulfo-carboxylic acid component is said to be used in an amount of l-5 mole percent based on terephthalic acid residues in the copolymer produced, and the illustrated polyoxyethylene glycol has a molecular weight of 4,000 and is used in an amount of 2 parts along with 70 parts of ethylene glycol (mol. Wt. of 62); hence, 2 parts represents a very small fraction of one mole percent based on the total glycols used. The resulting polymers clearly lack the characteristics of being water-dissipatable., 27911=Advantageous difunctional sulfo-monomer components are those wherein the sulfonate salt group is attached to an aromatic acid nucleus such as a benzene, naphthalene, diphenyl, oxydiphenyl, sulfonyldiphenyl, or methylenediphenyl nucleus. Preferred results are obtained through the use of sulfophthalic acid, sulfoterephthalic acid, sulfoisophthalic acid, 4 sulfonaphthalene-2,7 dicarboxylic acid, and their esters; metallosulfoaryl sulfonate (as described in Lappin, Kibler, Gilmer, and Jones US. patent application Ser.
