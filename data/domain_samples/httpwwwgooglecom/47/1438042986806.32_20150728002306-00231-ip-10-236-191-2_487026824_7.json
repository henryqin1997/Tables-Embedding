Such heaters typically incorporate flexible electrical substantially flat heating elements. As examples, a lay-wire heater, a carbon fiber heater or the like, which are typically supported with a backing (e.g. a cloth or fabric type backing) may be used within the insert. In a preferred embodiment, the heater layer 28 is a carbon fiber type heater with a backing (e.g., a non-woven layer). Preferably, the heater layer, the backing or both are breathable for allowing air to pass therethrough. One exemplary preferred heater is sold under the tradename CARBOTEX\ufffd and is commercially available from W.E.T. Automotive Systems, Inc. in Germany and/or FTG Fraser-Technik GmbH, Schleizer Strasse 56-58, D-95028 Hot/Saale, Germany. An example of such a heater is disclosed in U.S. Pat.
