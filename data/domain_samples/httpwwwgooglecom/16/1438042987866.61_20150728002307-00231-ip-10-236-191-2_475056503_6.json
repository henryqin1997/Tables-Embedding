FIG. 4 , 14, and 15, quick-mount support 11 further includes a connector 97 arranged to pass through aligned apertures 24, 124 formed, respectively, in each of rack 18 and rack mount 54 to mate with connector mount 98. Aperture 124 can also have internal threads (not shown) to mate with connector 97 to omit mount 98. Fasteners 99 a and 99 b (e.g., \u201cflat-head\u201d countersink rivet or screw) can be used to couple retainer mount 52 to slide support bracket 32 as also suggested in FIGS. 4 As suggested in Then, application of forces 101, 102 is ended to \u201crelease\u201d the spring-loaded bottom and top latches 41, 42 to allow spring 81 to pivot bottom latch 41 in counterclockwise direction 95 and to allow spring 83 to pivot top latch 42 in clockwise direction 96. This causes bottom latch 41 to be moved to assume a \u201clowered and locked\u201d position to cause a portion of latch lug 112 to extend out of channel 65 formed in first alignment guide 64 to block removal of latch lug 112 from latch aperture 23. This also causes top latch 42 to be moved to assume a \u201craised and locked\u201d position to cause a portion of latch lug 122 to extend out of channel 70 formed in second alignment guide 69 to block removal of latch lug 122 from latch aperture 25.",
