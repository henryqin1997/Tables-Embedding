Authoring 10 provides the PPML/VDX file for the prepress 20. The invention operates in the area of prepress 20 to prepare the VDP Job for production 30. FIG. 1 b illustrates a NexPress\u2122 2100 digital printing system 2 with GUI 6 and NexStation\u2122 4 providing input and control for printer 3.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{61302=In order for the prepress operator to run View VDP Job 23, the PPML/VDX file is first opened by system software and an Adobe\ufffd Job Ticket (PJTF or JDF) is associated with the PPML/VDX file to describe the imposition layout for the VDP print job. The prepress operator selects an option via the GUI 6 that will allow viewing of the PPML/VDX file as it is be printed in imposed form. The prepress operator can view other pages as well by using standard Acrobat\ufffd navigational tools. The preferred embodiment envisions allowing select viewing of the PPML/VDX file in an imposed form by supporting Adobe\ufffd Job Ticket (PJTF and JDF) layout parameters. A sheet surface view of a PPML/VDX file as specified by the associated Adobe\ufffd Job Ticket is provided with features such as page layout, document marks (trim, fold, bleed, bar codes), and annotations. The system software provides imposed views of PPML/VDX files within the network environment of the application. Imposed views of PPML/VDX files within an accessible NexStation\u2122 4 environment are also supported. Accordingly, the preferred embodiment is described in a manner that is specific to a NextStation\u2122 2100 environment, however, variations will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that can easily be ported on other pieces of equipment.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description details the best mode known to the inventors for practicing the invention. Variations of the best mode will be readily apparent to those persons skilled in the relevant arts, therefore, the scope of the invention should be measured by the appended claims. Within the preferred embodiment, the system supports and integrates a NexStation\u2122 4 print driver as well as a GUI 6 to launch and support a NexStation\u2122 4 print driver. The GUI 6 allows selection and submission by submitting the PPML/VDX job to the selected device (NexStation\u2122 4 or other printing device). It is envisioned by the invention to employ network browsing, provided by the system, to locate existing virtual printers or other printing devices for the NexStation\u2122 4. The invention also envisions future re-printing provided by having the printing device selected by the Job Ticket so that the job can be identically reproduced. Upon selection of a \u201cPrint\u201d command, the system software moves the selected PPML/VDX file to the input queue of the selected NexStation\u2122 4 or other printing device Job Submission 27 begins with the operator for prepress 20 selecting the device to print on, which in the preferred embodiment is the NexStation\u2122 4, however other devices also are envisioned as being supported. For example, if all pages in a job are to be printed in black and white, then a black and white printer would be",
