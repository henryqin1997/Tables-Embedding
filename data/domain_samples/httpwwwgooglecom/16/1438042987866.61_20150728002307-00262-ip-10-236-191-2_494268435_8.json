Although the present invention has been described particularly with reference to the figures, it will be apparent to one of the ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may appear in any number of systems which provide data integrity verification and authentication functionality. It is further contemplated that many changes and modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Since an operating system's program loader may modify software modules when the loader moves the modules from secondary memory such as data storage device 510 shown in FIG. 5 to primary memory such random access memory 504 shown in FIG. 5, the memory checker may include intelligence to reverse such modifications. In particular, a program loader often modifies program instructions to reflect the address changes from the secondary memory to the primary memory. The memory checker in one embodiment of the invention may elect to copy the affected regions of the modules from the primary memory, reverse the address modifications and then attempt to reconstruct and validate the signed image of the module. However, when Bob's module has been loaded into memory, Bob's module is verified using the digital signature verifier in steps 706 and 708. After the validation of Bob's module, Alice performs another",
