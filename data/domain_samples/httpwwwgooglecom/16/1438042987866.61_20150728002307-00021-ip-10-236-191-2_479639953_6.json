The invention, as shown and described, provides a low profile, compact detector with wide field-of-view area coverage. One application of the described detector would be as a sensor of longwave infrared radiation emitted by people, for the purpose of activating an intrusion alarm or for detecting human presence in order to control lights or air-conditioning. A detector in accordance with the invention can effectively provide complete coverage of a typical room space in a small, unobtrusive, aesthetically pleasing package. Another application would be as a flame sensor in computer rooms and hospitals. For example, the cap or filter plate could be coated or constituted by a material that limits optical transmission to 4.3 micrometer wavelength radiation. This would give an advantage over conventional smoke detectors which cannot respond quickly enough to explosions or rapidly escalating fires. A detector in accordance with the present invention also lends itself well to being a \"mother\" detector to a bundle of optical fibers especially in applications involving the detection or transmission of longwave infrared radiation frequencies. The reflector may be a simple conical shell, inverted pyramid (three or more sides with no base or top), truncated hyperboloid, or any other",
