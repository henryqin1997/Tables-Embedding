Additional aspects of the use and placement of the duodenal balloon tamponade device 23 are analogous to those described above for the esophago-gastric tamponade device 11. In an analogous fashion to the placement of the esophago-gastric tamponade device 11 above, the use of an endoscope as a guide means for placement of the device 23 provides the capability of monitoring the position of the device before and during final placement, as well as upon deflation of the balloons and removal. Additionally, the gastroduodenal tamponade device 23 can also be placed using guide means other than an endoscope, such as a balloon introducer. Also, the bridal wires 26 and lumens 28 and 29 of the gastroduodenal tamponade device 23 can be secured as described for the corresponding components of the device 11 above, and the device 23 can be used to deliver and apply to the lower stomach or duodenum suitable hemostatic or other therapeutic substances such as gels, meshes or foils as described above. Accordingly, the device 23 can be placed during gastrointestinal endoscopy as",
