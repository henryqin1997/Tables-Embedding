    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{330288=Inorganically filled sheets using any of the mix designs set forth above are used to manufacture printed reading materials, such as magazines or brochures. Such magazines and brochures contain both thinner, more flexible sheets, as well as thicker, less flexible sheets. The thinner, more flexible sheets have a thickness of about 0.25-0.05 mm, while the thicker, less flexible sheets have a thickness of about 0.1-0.2 mm., 332405=A hardened sheet (Sheet 1) formed therefrom and having a thickness of 1 mm had a tensile strength of 18.48 MPa, a modulus of 1863 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 2.42%. Sheet 1 was then \"sized\" (or coated in order to seal the pores of the sheet) using an aqueous starch solution. The resulting sized sheet had a tensile strength of 21.83 MPa, a modulus of 2198 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 2.02%. This shows that a starch sizing increases the tensile strength and stiffness of an inorganically filled sheet., 332963=A second hardened sheet formed from the above moldable mixture (Sheet 2) was found to have a tensile strength of 21.21 MPa, a modulus of 2120 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 3.22%. Sheet 2 was then sized using an aqueous latex-kaolin sizing (70% loading). The sized sheet had a tensile strength of 18.59 MPa, a modulus of 3305 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 2.13%. This shows that a latex-kaolin sizing decreases the tensile strength while increasing the stiffness of an inorganically filled sheet. This coating reduced the water absorption of the sheet to a more significant degree than the starch coating., 57231=Although hydraulically settable materials have heretofore found commercial application only in the manufacture of large, bulky structural type objects, hydraulically settable mixtures have been created using a microstructural engineering approach which can be molded or shaped into relatively small, thin-walled objects. Indeed, such mixtures, which were developed by the inventors hereof, have been found to be highly moldable and can be extruded and/or rolled into thin-walled sheets, even as thin as 0.1 mm. Such mixtures and methods used to manufacture sheets therefrom are set forth more fully in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/101,500, entitled \"Methods and Apparatus for Manufacturing Moldable Hydraulically Settable Sheets Used in Making Containers, Printed Materials, and other Objects,\" and filed Aug. 3, 1993, in the names of Per Just Andersen, Ph.D., and Simon K. Hodson (hereinafter the \"Andersen-Hodson Technology\")., 157513=The fibers used in making the sheets of the present invention preferably have a high length to width ratio (or \"aspect ratio\") because longer, narrower fibers can impart more strength to the inorganically filled structural matrix without significantly adding bulk and mass to the composite materials. The fibers should have an average aspect ratio of at least about 10:1, preferably at least about 100:1, and most preferably greater than about 200:1. Nevertheless, fibers having a smaller aspect ratio are generally more easily placed within the sheet and yield a sheet with more uniformity and fewer defects., 42527=This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/154,436, filed Nov. 19, 1993, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,670, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/095,662, filed Jul. 21, 1993, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,764, and also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/982,383, filed Nov. 25, 1992 in the names of Per Just Andersen, Ph.D., and Simon K. Hodson and entitled \"Food and Beverage Containers Made from Inorganic Aggregates and Polysaccharide, Protein, or Synthetic Organic Binders, and the Methods of Manufacturing Such Containers.\" now abandoned, and also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/101,500, filed Aug. 3, 1993 in the names of Per Just Andersen, Ph.D., and Simon K. Hodson and entitled \"Methods And Apparatus For Manufacturing Moldable Hydraulically Settable Sheets Used In Making Containers, Printed Materials, And Other Objects,\" now abandoned. Each of the foregoing applications is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/929,898, filed Aug. 11, 1992 in the names of Per Just Andersen, Ph.D., and Simon K. Hodson and entitled \"Cementitious Food And Beverage Storage, Dispensing, And Packaging Containers And The Methods Of Manufacturing Same,\" now abandoned. For purposes of disclosure of the present invention, each of the patents and applications identified in this section are incorporated herein by specific reference., 194750=The direction-specific strength properties of the highly inorganically filled sheets of the present invention should be contrasted with those of paper, which is known to have a strong and weak direction with regard to tensile and tearing strength. The strong direction in conventional paper is the machine direction, while the weak direction is the cross-machine direction. While the ratio of the strengths in the strong and weak direction is about 3:1 in conventional paper, in the present invention it is about 2:1, and can approach about 1:1 depending on the particular forming process is used. In general, decreasing the differential forming speed tends to allow the fibers to remain in a more random orientation., 334033=A third hardened sheet formed from the above moldable mixture (Sheet 3) was found to have a tensile strength of 11.11 MPa, a modulus of 1380 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 1.86%. Sheet 3 was then sized using a latex-kaolin sizing (50% loading), yielding a sized sheet having a tensile strength of 10.78 MPa, a modulus of 2164 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 1.62%. This sizing material slightly decreases the strength while moderately increasing the stiffness of the sheet., 280526=The mix design and methods set forth in Example 13 were repeated in every way except that 0.25 kg of southern pine was added to the moldable mixture used to form the inorganically filled sheets. The final hardened sheets had a tensile strength of 14.56 MPa, a modulus of 2523 MPa, an elongation of 1.42% before failure in the strongest (machine) direction, and a tensile strength of 6.66% MPa and an elongation before failure of 0.93% in the weak (cross-machine) direction., 334545=Another of Sheet 3 was instead sized using a latex-kaolin-starch sizing (50% loading), yielding a sheet having a tensile strength of 10.86 MPa, a modulus of 1934 MPa, and an elongation before failure of 1.15%.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects as illustrative only and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. Further, the present invention provides compositions and methods which allow for the production of highly inorganically filled materials having greater flexibility, tensile strength, toughness, moldability, and mass-producibility compared to materials having a high content of inorganic filler. The present invention provides compositions and methods for mass producing highly inorganically filled sheets that can rapidly be formed and substantially dried within a matter of minutes from the beginning of the manufacturing process. Moreover, the present invention provides compositions and methods which make possible the manufacture of sheets, containers, and other objects therefrom at a cost that is comparable or even superior to existing methods of manufacturing paper or polystyrene products. Further, such methods for manufacturing sheets are less energy intensive, conserve valuable natural resources, and require lower initial capital investments compared to the manufacture of sheets from conventional materials. In addition, the present invention provides sheets, as well as containers or other objects made therefrom, are readily degradable into substances which are commonly found",
