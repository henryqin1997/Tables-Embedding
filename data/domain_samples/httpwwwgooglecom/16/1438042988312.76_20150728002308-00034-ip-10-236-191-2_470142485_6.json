Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the claims. Disclosed herein is an inductive reader device with an integrated antenna and signal coupler. The inductive reader device does not require a discrete transformer component directly coupled to the main antenna. Rather, a second coil element is integrated in the antenna element space to form an integrated transformer to couple a responsive signal from a transponder to a receiver in the reader. The second coil element utilizes printed circuit board space that was otherwise unused and frees up space occupied by the discrete transformer device. In operation, transmitter 112 generates a radio frequency excitation signal under control of reader control circuit 120. The excitation signal is emitted by first coil element 116. When a transponder, such as transponder 102 is brought in close proximity to reader device 104, transponder 102 receives the excitation signal. More specifically, coil element 106 receives the excitation signal and uses the energy of the excitation signal to power circuitry on transponder 102. The control circuit then drives transceiver 108 to emit an appropriate response signal. In a preferred embodiment, the response signal is a modulated version of the excitation signal.",
