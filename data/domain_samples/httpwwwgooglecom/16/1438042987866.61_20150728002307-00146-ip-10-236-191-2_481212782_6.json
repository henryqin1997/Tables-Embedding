The dichloromethane and methyl ethyl ketone mixture were allowed to evaporate. The aluminum foil was wrapped around a 300 watt halogen tube, which was inserted into a T-shaped glass tube. Both of the openings of the tube were left open and the third opening was connected to a 1 liter, 3-neck glass flask. The glass flask was further connected to a large piston capable of drawing 1.1 liters of air through the flask. Alternating current was run through the halogen bulb by application of 90 V using a variac connected to 110 V line power. Within 1 s, an aerosol appeared and was drawn into the 1 L flask by use of the piston, with collection of the aerosol terminated after 6 s. The aerosol was analyzed by connecting the 1 L flask to an eight-stage Andersen non-viable cascade impactor. Results are shown in table 1. MMAD of the collected aerosol was 1.1 microns with a geometric standard deviation of 4.2. Also shown in table 1 is the number of particles collected on the various stages of the cascade impactor, given by the mass collected on the stage divided by the mass of a typical particle trapped on that stage. The mass of a single particle of diameter D is given by the volume of the particle, \u03c0D3/6, multiplied by the density of the drug (taken to be 1 g/cm3). The inhalable aerosol particle density is the sum of the numbers of particles collected on impactor stages 3 to 8 divided by the collection volume of 1 L, giving an inhalable aerosol particle density of 7.2\ufffd107 particles/mL. The rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation is the sum of the numbers of particles collected on impactor stages 3 through 8 divided by the formation time of 6 s, giving a rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation of 1.2\ufffd1010 particles/second.}",

One method involves forming the aerosol in a device through which a gas flow (e.g., air flow) is maintained, generally at a rate between 0.4 and 60 L/min. The gas flow carries the aerosol into one or more traps. After isolation from the trap, the aerosol is subjected to an analytical technique, such as gas or liquid chromatography, that permits a determination of composition purity., 74007=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

The aerosol was allowed to sediment onto the walls of the 1 L flask for approximately 30 minutes. The flask was then extracted with acetonitrile and the extract analyzed by HPLC with detection by light absorption at 225 nm. Comparison with standards containing known amounts of buprenorphine revealed that 0.2 mg of >99% pure buprenorphine had been collected in the flask, resulting in an aerosol drug mass density of 0.2 mg/L.
