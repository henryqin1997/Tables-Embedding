    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53808=FIGS. 6, 7, and 8 show examples of categories customized from a host computer, following on the previously mentioned claims adjuster example, and the resulting file format and image display. As shown in FIG. 6, the categories (tags) are given names, optional text strings, and graphics. The category information also includes overlay control information indicating whether or not the text string, date, and time should be overlaid into the image. In this example, the user, a free-lance claims adjuster, has created four different categories (H111 and H122) for different insurance claims from a first insurance company, one (F123) for a claim from a second insurance company, and one (KIDS) for personal images. The user also indicates whether the text string should be overlaid into the image, and whether the camera should overlay the date and/or time in the image. This category information, including names, text, and graphics, is then downloaded to the host computer from the memory card 24. A typical technique for such downloading is described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/219,608, entitled \"Electronic Imaging System Using a Removable Software-Enhanced Storage Device\", which is to issue as U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,264 on Dec. 19, 1995., 42965=In this example, the signal port 26 is a card interface and the removable storage device is a memory card 24. While a memory card 24 is shown in this system as the storage device, other devices may be used, such as a floppy disk magnetic medium, a small hard drive, or optical storage (in the latter cases, suitable conventional reading/writing apparatus would be provided in the camera, e.g., magnetic or optical read/write head, etc.). A representative memory card is a card adapted to the PCMCIA card interface standard, such as described in the PC Card Standard, Release 2.0, published by The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association, Sunnyvale, Calif., September 1991. The memory card 24 accordingly contains solid state memory 24a, such as Flash EPROM memory, which the card uses to store image data files.}",
