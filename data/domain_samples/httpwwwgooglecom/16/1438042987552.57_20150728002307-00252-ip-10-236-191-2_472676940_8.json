    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the description of FIG. 4, the generation of the positive and negative logic signals for MIC ON was described. These signals are both provided to the timing and gating circuits 78 of the digital board shown in FIG. 5. These signals are used to detect when a child has spoken to the doll and has ceased speaking to the doll for approximately one second to initiate the doll's speaking response. For this purpose a sequencing ROM 76 is provided with a number of sentences of a relatively nonspecific nature, any one of which should be a suitable response with the timing and gating circuits randomly selected at the start of one of those sentences in response to the voice actuation. Finally, as shown in FIG. 5, the timing and gating circuit 78, while controlling the synthesized speech of the system based upon the setting of switches 66 also provides a logic signal TALK which as may be seen in FIG. 4 biases the input of amplifier 40 to clamp the MIC ON signal below the enabling level irrespective of the sound pick up by the microphone so that the doll's own synthesized speech will not itself illicit a voice response. The sequencing ROM 76 as well as the digitized word storage ROM 84 have an eight bit output and accordingly can provide to the inputs of the sequencing ROM an address segment ranging from zero",
