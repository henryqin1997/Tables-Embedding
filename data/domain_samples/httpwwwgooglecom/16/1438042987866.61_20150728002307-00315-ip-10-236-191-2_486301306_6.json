For example, an administrator or other user may rely on the true processor utilization to determine business-related details such as the efficiency of an application, an amount of servers to deploy and/or an amount of money to charge customers. \u2014 . The difference between the method 600 and the method 500 is that the method 600 does not modify the count data. If the current operating frequency of a processor is less than the processor's maximum operating frequency (determination block 508), the method 600 calculates a true processor utilization based on the count data and a comparison of the processor's current operating frequency and maximum operating frequency (block 602). If the current operating frequency of a processor is not less than the processor's maximum operating frequency",
