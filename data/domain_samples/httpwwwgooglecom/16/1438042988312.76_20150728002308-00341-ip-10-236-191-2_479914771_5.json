Thanks to the fact that the object to be measured is first accelerated and then slowed, the time it takes the object to travel between the first end of the first conveyor and the second end of the first conveyor is precisely that given by the distance between said two points divided by the first conveyor speed T1, without altering the travelling time at all. The invention described above therefore achieves the preset aims. It must be emphasised that the pusher element which picks up the object 100 at the third conveyor 10 outfeed is the same pusher that released the object to the second conveyor 8, guaranteeing that the object 100 travelling time on the second and third conveyors 8, 10 is determined precisely by the time the first conveyor 2 takes to transfer the pusher elements 3 over the same distance. , the pusher elements 3 have made up the delay built up as the object was transported on the second conveyor 8 and again engage the object 100 and transport it at the first conveyor 2 speed T1. FIG. 5 At this point, as shown in Once the object 100 has passed",
