    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30591=A step referred to as \"fuzzification\" is used to relate an input to a membership function in a system which implements fuzzy logic. The fuzzification process attaches concrete numerical values to subjective expressions such as \"the temperature is warm.\" These numerical values attempt to provide a good approximation of human perception which is not generally limited to an environment of absolute truths. After the fuzzification step, a rule evaluation step is executed. During execution of the rule evaluation step, a technique referred to as \"min-max\" inference is used to calculate numerical conclusions to linguistic rules defined by a user. Conclusions from the rule evaluation step are referred to as \"fuzzy outputs\" and may be true to varying degrees. Thus, competing results may be produced. A last step in the fuzzy logic process is referred to as \"defuzzification.\" As the name implies, defuzzification is the process of combining all of the fuzzy outputs into a composite result which may be applied to a standard data processing system. For more information about fuzzy logic, refer to an article entitled \"Implementing Fuzzy Expert Rules in Hardware\" by James M. Sibigtroth. The article was published in the April, 1992 issue of AI EXPERT on pages 25 through 31.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there have been described herein the principles of the invention, it is to be clearly understood to those skilled in the art that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended, by the appended claims, to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The implementation of the invention described herein is provided by way of example only. However, many other implementations may exist for executing the function described herein. For example, the points necessary to define the membership set may be provided by a user of data processing system 10 as operands of the MEM instruction, rather than as previously stored data values in memory. Additionally, ALU 56 may be implemented such that thirty-two bit results may be obtained. In the case of either a multiplication or substraction operation, each of the low and high sides would produce a sixteen bit result during a split mode of operation. Additionally, by operating ALU 56 in split mode in which two eight bit results may be concurrently produced, further time is saved. ALU 56 provides a unique circuit which may be used to produce two eight bit results when in a split mode of operation, and a sixteen bit result when not in a split mode of operation. Due to the",
