There are, however, many configurations for network transaction processing techniques not specifically described herein, but with which the present invention is applicable. The present invention should therefore not be seen as limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but rather, it should be understood that the present invention has wide applicability with respect to network transaction processing techniques generally. All modifications, variations, or equivalent arrangements and implementations that are within the scope of the attached claims should therefore be considered within the scope of the invention. [0244] Alternatively, the program steps can be received into the operating memory 910 over the network 920. In the network method, the computer receives data including program steps into the memory 910 through the network interface 918 after network communication has been established over the network connection 922 by well-known methods that will be understood by those skilled in the art without further explanation. The program steps are then executed by the CPU 902 thereby comprising a computer process. [0243] The CPU 902 operates under control of programming steps that are temporarily stored in the memory 910 of the computer 900. When the programming steps are executed, the computer performs its functions. Thus, the programming steps implement",
