At one end was glued a 8.5\ufffd4.0 cm. long paper strip followed by a 3.5 mm. space. Then three one cm. long paper strips were glued onto the Mylar strip with 2.0 mm. spaces between them. The paper on the Mylar was wetted with a solution of 0.02% o-dianisidine in water. The spaces were then filled in with a suspension of microcrystalline cellulose prepared by mixing 50% suspensions of the IgG-cellulose and the glucose oxidase-cellulose in a 20:1 ratio. The first space was filled with 20 ul. of this suspension and the other three spaces each contained 10 ul. These strips were air dried, then stored dry until used., 55852=Small columns are prepared from silanized Pasteur pipettes by breaking off both ends, attaching a short piece of tubing to the bottom (constricted) end and inserting glass wool plugs in the tube bottoms. The columns are packed by sequential insertion of layers of agarose-Ferene separated by layers of unmodified agarose. Typically, 0.4 ml of a 1:1 agarose suspension is applied directly above the support, followed by alternating layers of 50 microliters of a 1:1 suspension of agarose-Ferene and 0.2 ml of agarose suspension. After each addition to the column, the walls of the columns are rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the solution above the gel is allowed to flow into the gel before addition of the next layer., 60147=Small columns were prepared from silanized Pasteur pipettes by breaking off both ends, attaching short pieces of tubing to the bottom (constricted) ends and inserting glass wool plugs in the column bottoms.

Typically 0.4 ml of 1:1 agarose suspension was applied directly above the plugs, followed by alternating layers of 50 microliters of a 1:1 suspension of agarose-IgG (to form the reaction zones) and 0.2 ml of agarose suspension (to form spacer layers).

No. 609,794, filed Nov. 6, 1990, which is a divisional of Ser. No. 467,229, filed Feb. 23, 1983, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,484, which is a continuation in part of Ser. No. 356,459, filed Mar. 9, 1982, abandoned., 47653=For example, carbon dioxide may be analyzed with phenolphthalein at a slightly alkaline pH. Calcium ion may be analyzed utilizing a reactant comprising calmodulin and mammalian phosphodiesterase or another calmodulin-sensitive enzyme (Maekawa and Abe, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 97:621 (1980)). Ferrous ion may be analyzed utilizing, as a reactant, a ferrocene derivative (Katz, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104:346 (1982)).

Weast, Ed., CRC Press, Cleveland, 1976, and in other references cited therein., 49507=Various other analyte reagent pairs may be selected from the field of chemistry for adaptation to the invention from such reference works as: Schuurs, et al, U.S. Pat.

Invest. 39:1157 (1960)., 60918=For use in an assay, tubing at the bottom of the prepared column was connected to a peristaltic pump to control the flow rate of the assay. An appropriate dilution of penicilloyl-glucose oxidase (\"Pen-GO\") (typically 0.1 microgram Pen-GO in 1 ml PBS) with or without known amounts of the analyte (penicilloyl-epsilon amino caproate) (Pen-EAC), was applied to the column. The Pen-GO was prepared by reacting penicillin G with glucose oxidase in borate buffer, pH 9.0, for 2-3 days at 4\ufffd C. The Pen-GO solution was passed through the assay column at controlled flow rates, typically between 10 and 15 minutes for complete entrance into the gel. When all the solution was into the gel bed, a detector solution was added to the column. The detector solution was prepared as follows: 0.20 ml of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) solution (2 mg/ml), 2 ml of 18% glucose solution, 1 ml of 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 0.100 ml of 1% o-dianisidine was diluted 1:10 in PBS and 1 ml or less was applied to the columns at the same flow rate as the previous solutions. Brown color developed in some of the reaction zones. Presence of the penicilloyl moiety in the Pen-GO solution results in the upper reactive zone or zones being lighter in color, with color being generated in zones further down the column., 50854=Yet other analyte-reactant pairs may be found in: reference works such as Feigl, F., Spot Tests in Inorganic Analysis, 6th edition, Elsevier Publishing Co., New York, 1972; Feigl, Fritz, Spot Tests in Organic Analysis, 7th edition, Elsevier Publishing Co., New York, 1966; Snell, F. and Snell, C., Colorimetric Methods of Analysis, Vols. 1-4AAA, Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York, 1967-74; and Braibanti, A., Ed. Bioenergetics and Thermodynamics: Model Systems--Synthetic and Natural Chelates and Macrocycles as Models for Biological and Pharmaceutical Studies, D. Reidel Publishing Co., Boston, 1980., 58254=B. Amino acids and other nucleophilic amine compounds are measured by use of the chromogenic reagent 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (FDNB), which produces a yellow product upon reaction. A 0.1 ml aqueous sample, containing about 0.1-1.0 micromoles of amino analyte, is transferred to a siliconed glass vessel. The pH is adjusted to 7.0, if necessary, and two milligrams (25 micromoles) of NaHCO3 is added and dissolved. Next is added 0.12 ml of 0.15% FDNB in absolute alcohol (1.5 micromoles). This solution is prepared fresh shortly before use. After the reaction has neared completion, it is analyzed for remaining FDNB (reactant) content by flow exposure to the assay system prepared according to Example I. In this case, a similar amine-containing analyte is immobilized in the zones in a permeable solid medium at a known content (e.g., 0.1-0.25 micromoles per reaction zone). After rinsing with 50% ethanol in aqueous solution, the number of yellow reaction zones produced and remaining after rinse will be inversely related to the amount of analyte in the test sample.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. The accuracy and reliability of the apparatus of the invention depends to some extent upon how readily or easily the generation of color or other detectable change in the different reaction zones may be ascertained. A reaction zone in the direction of analyte flow desirably should show detectable changes only when a significant, minimum quantity of analyte or other material being detected has passed through the preceeding reaction zone; since the physical nature of the apparatus often does not permit reaction to go fully to completion in each such zone, a small \"tail\" e.g., trace, amount of material may flow into successive zones and may be marginally detected in such zones to yield readings that are difficult to interpret. One may largely avoid this problem, however by several means. Detectors may be employed that are sensitive only to minimum concentrations of a chemical moiety to be detected. For example, one may utilize o-phenylene diamine in place of o-dianisidine as a chromophore in the above examples, the former being less sensitive. Another method involves the placement in spacer layers or, less desirably, in reaction zones, of small quantities of \"scavenger\" reactants capable of immobilizing or deactivating trace",
