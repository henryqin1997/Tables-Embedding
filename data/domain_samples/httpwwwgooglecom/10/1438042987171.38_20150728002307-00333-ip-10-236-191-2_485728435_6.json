Examples of circuits incorporating this microcomputer are detailed in the Toshiba 16-Bit Microcontroller TLCS-900/L MCU Series (2) Data Book (March 1995). The monitor computer 418 includes a data processor 420 which performs 16-bit operations with 32-bit extended registers. The monitor computer 418 also incorporates a memory 422 consisting of at least 32 kilobytes of static RAM, a timer 424, a serial interface 426, and a battery status monitor circuit 428.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is contemplated, and will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing specification, drawings, and examples that modifications and/or changes may be made in the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, it is expressly intended that the foregoing are only illustrative of preferred embodiments and modes of operation, not limiting thereto, and that the true spirit and scope of the present invention be determined by reference to the appended claims. Upon receipt of an alert message, the command station 6 notifies an operator and displays which machine monitor 4 is the source of the alert message. Based on the nature of the alert message, the operator may transmit further instructions from the command station 6 to the machine monitor 4 to carry out a different measurement or analysis operation, or the operator may take action to shut down the machine. Between synchronization transmissions, the command station 6 is listening for data transmissions from the machine monitors 4. Upon receipt of a transmission from a machine monitor 4, the command station computer 612 determines, based on the received identification code, which machine monitor 4 is the source of the transmission, and stores the received data accordingly. This data may be stored for later analysis or may be displayed in real-time, such as in a graphical plot of vibration versus time. At the next regularly-scheduled transmit time, the machine monitor timer 424 causes the machine",
