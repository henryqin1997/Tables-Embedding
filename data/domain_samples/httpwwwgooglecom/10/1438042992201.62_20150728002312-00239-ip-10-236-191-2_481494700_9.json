Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative devices shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Therefore, the user is only required to store the least number of types of logic ICs and the maker can simplify the production control. Further, according to this invention, a desired logic circuit having a large degree of symmetry can be realized by using a logic circuit having a 3-state output as a smallest unit and connecting the smallest units in a tree structure. Also, a multi-input logic gate complicated in construction can be easily obtained. Further, since it is only necessary to select one of the \"1\" level signal, \"0\" level signal, signal A, and signal A in order to program the input, the circuit programming can be easily effected and the programming implement can be made simple in construction. When memory cells are used to effect the programming operation, the number of memory cells can be significantly reduced and an easily programmable IC can be realized. As described above, according to this invention, a programmable logic circuit which is simple in construction and programming operation and in which the gate can be easily",
