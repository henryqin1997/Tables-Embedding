Timing and gray scale conversion are shown and described in relation to FIGS. 4a and 4b. This display is also described in Lee, S. N., Stewart, R. G., Ipri, A., Jose, D., and Lipp, S., \"A 5\ufffd9 Inch Polysilicon Gray-Scale Color Head Down Display Chip,\" 1990 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, IEEE, 1990, pp. 220 and 221., 39666=In a liquid crystal implementation, the scanning frequency could, for example, be 480 per second, which would allow presentation of 8 distinct, continuous gray levels; 1920 per second, which would allow presentation of 32 distinct, continuous gray levels; or 3840 per second, which would allow presentation of 64 distinct, continuous gray levels., 76049=If instead backplane voltage is reversed every frame, two level drivers could be used, with the data inverted to achieve the necessary polarity inversion, a technique used with amorphous silicon displays as described in relation to FIG. 5 of Lewis, A. G., and Turner, W., \"Driver Circuits for AMLCDs,\" Conference Record of the 1994 International Display Research Conference and International Workshop on Active-Matrix LCDs & Display Materials, Monterey, Calif., Oct. 10-13, 1994, pp. 56-64, incorporated herein by reference. When the backplane is high, the pixel is driven high for a \"0\" and low for a \"1\" and vice versa when the backplane is low., 29784=Morozumi, S., Oguchi, K., Misawa, T., Araki, R., and Ohshima, H., \"4.25-in. and 1.51-in. B/W and Full-Color LC Video Displays Addressed by Poly-Si TFTs,\" SID 84 Digest, 1984, pp. 316-319, describe a 1.51 inch active matrix LCD with drivers integrated on the same substrate. Left and right Y-drivers each include 210 bit shift registers and upper and lower X-drivers each include 180 bit shift registers and sample and hold circuits (referred to as \"sample holders\"). The sample and hold circuits receive a video signal and provide the video signal to data lines under control of shift registers. The outputs of the upper and lower sample and hold circuits may be connected to each other through data lines and the left and right shift registers may be connected to each other through gate lines, providing redundancy., 32367=In practice, the driving technique of Morozumi et al., cited above, although it provides a simple analog sampling scheme, requires an analog video signal of sufficient voltage magnitude to drive the data lines. The sample and hold circuits can be implemented with pass gates that provide the video signal to each of the data lines in turn under control of the shift registers, as shown in FIG. 5(b) of Lewis, A. G., Lee, D. D., and Bruce, R. H., \"Polysilicon TFT Circuit Design and Performance,\" IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 27, No. 12, December 1992, pp. 1833-1842. In this implementation, the pass gates must be able to charge the data lines at a sufficient rate to obtain adequate gray scale precision in the available line time. Therefore, as the number of display lines and the required gray scale precision increase, the necessary integrated sample and hold acquisition time and accuracy can only be achieved by increasing the number of analog input lines for receiving video signals, making the analog input interface and the required external circuitry significantly more complicated., 75251=Each stage of each data drive shift register could be implemented as described in Lewis, A. G., Lee, D. D., and Bruce, R. H., \"Polysilicon TFT Circuit Design and Performance,\" IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 27, No. 12, December 1992, pp. 1833-1842, also incorporated herein by reference. Lewis et al., at pages 1836 and 1837, describe a shift register stage in relation to the inset in FIG. 6., 65344=Relationships between the relevant frequencies along a logarithmic frequency (log F) axis are shown in greater detail in FIG. 2. The maximum perceptual frequency (MPF), i.e. the maximum frequency at which a normal human viewer can perceive switching between two different colors, above which the normal human viewer instead perceives a continuous, intermediate color, is approximately 60 Hz, as indicated by Numao, U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,495, at col. 4 lines 35-39. The maximum response frequency (MRF), i.e. the maximum frequency at which electrooptical element 20 can respond independently to successive signals, will depend on the manner in which electrooptical element 20 is implemented. In an LCD, for example, the MRF may not be constant across array circuitry 14, but will typically be approximately 20-60 Hz, as described in Fiske, T., Hack, M., Martin, R. A., and Steemers, H., \"Analysis of Transient Optical Response of Active-Matrix LCDs,\" SID 95 Digest, May 1995, pp. 743-746., 85170=An array as described above could be fabricated using conventional techniques as described, for example, in Wu, I-W., Stuber, S., Tsai, C. C., Yao, W., Lewis, A., Fulks, R., Chiang, A., and Thompson, M., \"Processing and Device Performance of Low-Temperature CMOS Poly-TFTs on 18.4-in.-Diagonal Substrates for AMLCD Application,\" SID 92 DIGEST, 1992, pp. 615-618, incorporated herein by reference., 80519=The array of FIG. 3 could be implemented with simple cell circuitry like that described in Wu, I-W., \"High-definition displays and technology trends in TFT-LCDs, \" Journal of the SID, vol. 2, no. 1, 1994, pp.1-14 or with more complex cell circuitry like that described in copending, coassigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/572,357, entitled \"Array with Metal Scan Lines Controlling Semiconductor Gate Lines,\" both incorporated herein by reference, with appropriate adjustment of features to provide acceptable levels of capacitance. FIG. 7 shows an alternative cell layout that could be used in the implementation of FIG. 3., 72922=Stage 260 in FIG. 5 includes D-type latch 262 and AND gate drivers 264 and 266. Clock buffer 270 receives clock signal phi-1' and provides clock signals phi-1 and nphi-1, while clock buffer 272 receives clock signal nphi-2' and provides clock signals nphi-2 and phi-2. Buffering the two phase clock at each stage minimizes clock skew problems, eliminates the need for a single buffer serving the entire register, and makes circuit operation independent of shift register length. AND gate drivers 264 and 266 are conventional CMOS structures with the TFTs in the final inverters (which provide out-1 and out-2) being large enough to drive the scan line capacitance at the required speed. In other words, AND gate drivers 264 and 266 must be able to drive scan lines with rise and fall times less than 100 ns while the shift register is operating at a clock rate well over 1 Mz. Lewis, A. G., Lee, D. D., and Bruce, R. H., \"Polysilicon TFT Circuit Design and Performance,\" IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 27, No. 12, December 1992, pp. 1833-1842, provide further information about simple scan drive circuitry like that in FIGS. 4 and 5. Lewis et al., in relation to FIG. 6 on page 1837, indicate that error-free data transfer can be obtained at frequencies in the 9-30 MHz range using poly-Si TFT CMOS dynamic shift registers. Frequencies in that range can provide duty intervals short enough for scan drive circuitry as discussed above in relation to FIG. 2., 88043=Table I illustrates how dithering logic 414 can map a four bit value indicating one of 16 grayscale levels into 15 subframes, in the case where P=15. If the four bit value is 1111, for example, all 15 subframes are ON; if the four bit value is 1010, only the odd subframes and subframes 4 and 12 are ON; if the four bit value is 0101, all the even subframes are ON except subframes 4 and 12; and so forth., 33503=Stewart et al. and Lee et al., in the articles cited above, describe a chop ramp scanning technique used to handle 32 gray levels for a color display. Data scanners are partitioned into serial loaded registers driven from a multiplexed bus. Associated with the data scanner circuitry is a five-bit gray scale counter. In the chop ramp scanning technique, each data line is driven by a transmission gate that is controlled by output of a 5-bit counter. During the first line period, the 5-bit gray scale code for each pixel is loaded into the data shift registers. At the end of the line period, the data is transferred from the shift register latches to the counters. During the second line period, the master data bus is ramped from the lowest to the highest pixel voltage while each data line's counter is incremented until it reaches a count of 11111, at which time its transmission gate is turned off, determining the level to which the data line is charged. As a result, the analog voltage presented on each data line depends entirely on the contents of its respective counter. The chop ramp scanning circuit achieves digital-to-analog conversion.}",
