The input select unit described in the inventor's thesis also describes a full adder to enable inclusion of externally generated digital noise or interference to the selected signal. The corrupted samples are then sent through a data path of the IC, allowing for a comprehensive logic test.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations To those skilled in the art, many changes and modifications will be readily apparent from consideration of the foregoing description of a preferred embodiment without departure from the spirit of the present invention, the scope thereof being more particularly pointed out by the following claims. The descriptions herein and the disclosures hereof are by way of illustration only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention which is more particularly pointed out by the following claims. During a factory test (AP test) a test machine is used in lieu of the actual hard disk drive electronics to command and monitor the on-board tests performed by the test block 60. However, since the test block 60 remains active and available for testing after printed circuit assembly, the drive firmware may command self testing of the digital section 21 by the test block 60 and record the test results in memory 72 or in a track on disk 12. If the drive fails, it is possible to quiz the synchronous data detection channel from the drive ASIC 70 and obtain a digital signature as a result of the on-chip test process implemented by the test block 60. If there is a defect in the digital elements of the channel chip, this situation can be readily determined and reported. The serial data stream is then converted into ideal e.g. PR4 samples using e.g. a",
