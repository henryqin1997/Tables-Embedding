    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention, and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the number of logic elements in each LAB can be altered if desired. Similarly, the number of LABs can be varied, as can the numbers of the various types of conductors and inter-conductor connections. Also, the number of look-up table inputs is arbitrary and can be made more or less than four if desired. As still another example of modifications with the scope of this invention, any of the techniques shown in FIGS. 5-9 can be used to facilitate providing conductor interconnections of the type indicated, for example, at 231, 249, and 253 in FIG. 11 herein. Although the use of tri-state drivers is preferred for elements such as 256 and 260 in FIG. 11, in some embodiments of the invention it may be possible to employ simple buffers instead. As mentioned above, FIG. 18 shows a typical tri-state driver 350 such as can be used for drivers 256 and 260 in FIG. 11. (Of course, any other suitable tri-state driver can be used instead if desired.) Data is applied to input terminal TRIIN, and a driver-enabling signal is applied to terminal RSELTRI (e.g., from a programmable RAM cell). If driver 350 is enabled by",
