The drive mechanism 23 includes gear assembly 40 and a d.c. motor 34 including an integral reduction assembly. While a stepper motor could alternatively be employed, a d.c. motor is preferred as it requires less power and is controllable in a less expensive and complex manner than a stepper motor. Motor 34 is powered by an appropriate power source such as the four batteries 36 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. The motor may have an integral reduction gear assembly which drives pinion 38. The output shaft of the motor includes pinion 38 which is engageable with a gear reduction assembly 40 which provides a substantial overall gear reduction. A reduction on the order of about 15,000:1 is provided by the combined operations of the integral reduction assembly of motor 34 and gear reduction assembly 40.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. The pump may be removed from the I.V. pole by turning knob 28 in the opposite direction from that used to tighten the clamp. The initial rotation of knob 28 causes pole clamp 30 to move outwardly a fraction of an inch due to the movement of eccentric cam 208. Further rotation causes peg 209 extending from eccentric 208 to engage pawl 186 and rotate it about peg 184 extending from carriage 178. The teeth of pawl 186 are thereby disengaged from those of upper surface 172. Upon such disengagement, spring 202 causes pole clamp 30 to move to the fully extended position where the pump can easily be removed from the pole. Pole clamp 30 is constructed such that knob 28 cannot be turned until pole clamp 30 is pushed in towards the I.V. pole from its fully extended position. As shown in FIG. 12A, the protrusion 168 is positioned within notch 206 when pole clamp 30 is fully extended. Knob 28 can only be turned when protrusion 168 is moved out of the notch. In",
