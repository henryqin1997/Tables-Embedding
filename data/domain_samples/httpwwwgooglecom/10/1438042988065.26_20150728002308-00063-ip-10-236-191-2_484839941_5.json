The M4-88 PVA had the particle distribution as shown by Sample C of Table 1. The mixer was run for 30 seconds, then a total of 259.4 grams of glycerin and water were sprayed in at a uniform rate over 75 seconds. A mixture of sorbitol and magnesium stearate was added, the blender was run for 30 seconds, and the blend discharged. No temperature increase was noted. The mixer was extremely messy, with wet beads of resin coating the entire mixer. The blend was very dense and wet, and caked severely. No particle size distribution was obtained due to the caking., 29047=To achieve a uniform plasticizer coating it is preferred to utilize a spray mechanism to coat the PVA resin. The spray pattern must be appropriate for the PVA batch size, and for the spray nozzle and mixing apparatus used. A poor spray pattern may result in poor coating, incomplete plasticization of the PVA resin, and ultimately, an inferior product after thermoplastic processing. Spray patterns will be individual to the apparatus used, however, some generalities may apply. In general, a less viscous spray will coat better and cause less clogging of the nozzle. Nozzles providing a fine spray are preferred as they will generally coat more evenly than those with a coarse spray. Nozzles should be arranged so that a maximum area is covered. An example of a preferred spray nozzle is that manufactured by Spraying Systems Company, Wheaton, Ill., and sold under the trademark VEEJET, especially a VEEJET Model 31655 atomizing nozzle. The pressure used to spray the plasticizer through this particular nozzle is about 30 psig. The nozzle may be employed in a single, or more commonly, a ganged, configuration. The PVA granules may be mixed, agitated, or fluidized during coating to assure a uniform plasticizer layer. If used, mixing should provide maximal exposure of the granules with a minimum of heat generated. Thus, low and medium-intensity mixers, such as those utilized in the art for plastic processing, are preferred if mixing is used., 46458=A clean, dry medium-intensity mixer was started and charged with pulverized V205 PVA from Air products, IRGANOX 1010, and TMP in the proportions given in Example 4. The pulverized V205 PVA had the particle size distribution as shown by Sample E of Table 1. The mixer was run for 30 seconds, and then glycerin and water were sprayed in at a uniform rate over 75 seconds. A mixture of sorbitol and magnesium stearate was then added, the mixer was run an additional 30 seconds, and the blend was discharged. No temperature increase was noted: the temperature remained near ambient. The mixer appeared clean except for some residue on the plows and walls. The blend was dry and flowable, and did not cake. The particle size distribution of the resulting PVA/plasticizer blend was such that at least 95% of the granules passed a 1/4 inch screen, at least 90% passed a 6 mesh screen, at least 75% passed a 16 mesh screen, and at least 50% passed a 20 mesh screen., 36278=In a preferred embodiment, one or more antioxidants are mixed with PVA resin granules before coating with plasticizer. The choice of antioxidant, if any, will depend in part upon the ultimate use of the PVA product and of the thermoplastic environment. For example, if the PVA is to be used in a water-soluble film, it is preferable that the antioxidant be water-solubhle. Antioxidants which are appropriate for use with the present invention include but are not limited to citric acid, aspartic acid, phosphoric acid, heavy metals, and a tetrakis (methylene [3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate]) methane with the chemical formula of C73 H108 O12, especially that sold under the trademark IRGANOX 1010 by Ciba-Geigy Corp. Other appropriate antioxidants are well known in the art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the above description and the claims which are appended hereto describe methods and compositions which are useful for providing a PVA/plasticizer blend suitable for thermoplastic processing, in fact, variations and modifications thereof will be obvious to those skilled in the art, and obvious equivalents and alternative embodiments consistent with the scope and content of this application are included herein. Example F demonstrates the inability to obtain a useful product due to high intensity mixing resulting in a blend temperature of above about 105\ufffd F. Runs were carried out with both Nippon Gohsei GL-05, and Kuraray 405-S resins, each having a particle size distribution satisfying the minimum requirements of the present invention. The formulations used to produce the blends were as defined in Example 1. A clean, dry high-intensity mixer, of the type used in the art for plastic processing, was filled with the dry ingredients. The mixer was started at low speed, then run to high speed as liquid plasticizer was sprayed in. Mixing continued until the blend reached a temperature of about 212 to 220\ufffd F., then mixing was stopped and the blender cooled. The mixer was emptied when the blend temperature dropped to about 150\ufffd F. The GL-05 resin batch yielded a very clumped blend, having a number of \"plastic\" lumps which were difficult to break apart. The 405-S batch mixed well, however the walls of the mixer were gummed up with the",
