No, 6,193,726, which application(s) are incorporated herein by reference., 15643=U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,682 dated May 26, 1998 and PCT Application No. PCT/US97/13980 (International Publication No. WO 98/06356 based U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 08/882,397 filed Jun. 25, 1997) teach an implant for defining a blood flow conduit directly from a chamber of the heart to a lumen of a coronary vessel. An embodiment disclosed in the aforementioned patent and applications teaches an L-shaped implant in the form of a rigid conduit. The conduit has one leg sized to be received within a lumen of a coronary artery and a second leg sized to pass through the myocardium and extend into the left ventricle of the heart. As disclosed in the above-referenced patent and applications, the conduit is rigid and remains open for blood flow to pass through the conduit during both systole and diastole. The conduit penetrates into the left ventricle in order to prevent tissue growth and occlusions over an opening of the conduit., 16603=Commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 08/944,313 filed Oct. 6, 1997, entitled \u201cTransmyocardial Implant\u201d teaches an implant such as that shown in the aforementioned '682 patent with an enhanced fixation structure. The enhanced fixation structure includes a fabric surrounding at least a portion of the conduit to facilitate tissue growth on the exterior of the implant.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having disclosed the present invention in a preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that modifications and equivalents may occur to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefits of the teachings of the present invention. It is intended that such modifications shall be included within the scope of the claims appended hereto. After placement of the implant 10, the sheath 201 can be removed. The physician simply pulls on handle 205. This imparts a force which splits the score line 219. With the score line 219 split, the surgeon can pull the sheath body 215 rearwardly out of the vessel 102. The flexible material of the sheath body 215 spreads apart at the bend of the implant 10 to pass the split sheath body 215 over the bend so that the sheath body 215 can be removed without disrupting the position of the artery 102 over the implant's leading end 22. Instead, any frictional force between the artery 102 and the sheath body 215 will tend to further urge the artery 102 over the leading end 22. Therefore, the artery 102 remains over the leading end 22 of the implant 10 and surrounding groove 13 so the artery 102 can be fixed to the implant 10 with sutures 70 (FIG. 2) surrounding groove 13. With the sheath 201 and dilator 203 fully inserted into the artery 102, the dilator 203 can be removed. The",
