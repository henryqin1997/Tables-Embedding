In total, 8 l isopropanol were subsequently added in this manner. The ion exchange resin was separated by coarse filtration, and the filtrate was reduced to 1127 g, corresponding to 28% by weight SiO2, at a temperature of 35\ufffd to 45\ufffd C. and at a pressure of 100 to 200 mbar., 38514=1000 ml Levasil\ufffd 300/30% were mixed, with stirring, with 40 g of activated Lewatit SPC 108 in the H+ form, and were subsequently mixed, with stirring and at room temperature, with 2000 ml isopropanol., 29084=The process can be conducted at normal pressure, or may also be conducted under reduced pressure. In general, pressures between 50 and about 1000 mbar are employed, preferably between 100 and 200 mbar. Separation processes for reducing the water content which are operated under pressure, such as ultrafiltration for example, operate under higher pressures of 0.2 to 10 bar, for example, or under corresponding pressures which are particularly suitable for the process. When water is removed by azeotropic distillation, the operating temperature and operating pressure are related to each other by the temperature-dependent vapour pressure equilibrium of the solvent mixture (e.g. i-propanol/water)., 34927=1148 g (953 ml) Levasil\ufffd 300/30% (a commercial product supplied by Bayer AG; 30% solids content, specific surface 300 m2 /g, pH 10.0) were mixed with stirring with 40 g of activated, strongly acidic Lewatit SPC 108 cation exchange resin in the H+ form (commercial product supplied by Bayer AG), and were subsequently mixed, with stirring and at room temperature, with 1000 ml isopropanol., 26499=The anion and electrolyte content of the silica sol dispersion obtained can be further reduced by subsequently treating the alcoholic dispersion in an agitated bed with a strongly basic anion exchange resin until the pH no longer increases further in a sample diluted with water in a 1:1 weight ratio., 38808=The water contained in the mixture was almost completely removed by azeotropic distillation at constant volume under reduced pressure (35\ufffd to 45\ufffd C., 100 to 200 mbar). 1 liter of isopropanol per hour was steadily added, and 1 liter of isopropanol/water per hour was distilled off as an azeotropic mixture. In total, 8 l isopropanol were subsequently added in this manner. After the addition of this amount of isopropanol, the product was reduced to 1195 g, corresponding a concentration of 31% by weight SiO2, at a temperature of 30\ufffd to 45\ufffd C. and at a pressure of 100 to 200 mbar. The product was separated from the ion exchange resin by coarse filtration and was washed with a little isopropanol., 40839=500 g Levasil\ufffd 300/30% were mixed with 1000 g methanol; 20 g of Lewatit SPC 108 cation exchange resin in the F form were added to the mixture. A methanol-water mixture was distilled off from the stirred mixture at normal pressure. A total of 13,500 g methanol were added over 10 hours in order to keep the volume constant. Thereafter, the ion exchange resin was filtered off and the filtrate was reduced by boiling to a residue of about 280 g., 37519=2000 ml Levasil\ufffd 300/30% (30% solids content, specific surface 300 m2 /g, pH 9.9) were mixed, with stirring, with 90 g of activated Lewatit SPC 108 in the H+ form, and were subsequently mixed, with stirring and at room temperature, with 1500 ml isopropanol., 30639=When carrying out the process according to the invention, the alkaline, aqueous silica sol is preferably treated with a C1 to C3 alcohol in a weight ratio of 1:0.6 to 1:2 and with a sufficient amount of the strongly acidic cation exchange resin, whereby almost all the cations contained in the dispersion are removed and a low-salt product is obtained. The cation content can be determined by customary analytical methods. In a preferred variant, following the addition of C1 to C3 alcohol and cation exchange resin to the silica sol, a distillation at constant volume is effected, which is preferably an azeotropic distillation for the C2 and C3 alcohols, by the addition of alcohol for the removal of the water. In this respect, the amount of solvent mixture distilled off per unit time is substantially dependent on the available evaporator capacity, namely on the amount of energy which can be supplied. During the process of solvent exchange and the concentration step which optionally follows it, good mixing throughout of the reactor contents must be ensured. The effect of this is to ensure contact of the dispersion with the ion exchange resin, which is advantageous for ion exchange., 36806=The products obtained in Examples 1 and 2 were mixed. The conductivity of the mixture was 95 \u03bcS, and the pH of a sample mixed with water in a 1:1 ratio was measured as 2.6. The product had a density of 1.03 g/ml and a viscosity, as measured in a Hoppler falling sphere viscometer, of 12 mPas at 20\ufffd C. The SiO2 content of the silica sol dispersion was 30% by weight, its water content as determined by Karl Fischer titration was 1% by weight, and its turbidity was 220 TE/F. Measurement of the particle size distribution in an analytical ultracentrifuge showed that it contained particles in the range of 6 to 24 nm., 36005=1150 g (955 ml) Levasil\ufffd 300/30% were mixed with 3000 ml isopropanol, and were thereafter mixed, with stirring, with 40 g of activated, strongly acidic Lewatit SPC 108 cation exchange resin in the H+ form., 37818=The water contained in the mixture was almost completely removed by azeotropic distillation at constant volume under reduced pressure (35\ufffd to 40\ufffd C., 100 to 200 mbar). 1 liter of isopropanol per hour was steadily added, and 1 liter of isopropanol/water per hour was distilled off as an azeotropic mixture. In total, 16 l isopropanol were subsequently added in this manner. The ion exchange resin was separated by coarse filtration, and the filtrate was reduced to 2234 g, corresponding to a SiO2 concentration of 32% by weight, at a temperature of 35\ufffd to 45\ufffd C. and at a pressure of 100 to 200 mbar.}",

A methanol-water mixture was distilled off from the stirred mixture at normal pressure. A total of 13,500 g methanol were added over 10 hours in order to keep the volume constant. Thereafter, the ion exchange resin was filtered off and the filtrate was reduced by boiling to a residue of about 280 g. Example 7 Concentration of the product by distilling off ethanol gave a clear sol containing 0.04% by weight H2 O and 56% by weight SiO2 in ethanol. 250 g Levasil\ufffd 300/30% were mixed with 500 g ethanol, and were treated, with stirring, with 10 g of activated, strongly acidic Lewatit SPC 108 cation exchange resin in the H+ form. A total of 3925 g ethanol were added to the mixture at constant volume at 50\ufffd to 55\ufffd C., and at a pressure of 250 to 300 mbar, whilst an identical volume of ethanol-water mixture was distilled off. Thereafter, the ion exchange resin was filtered off. Example 6 The silica sols from Examples 4 and 5 were mixed.
