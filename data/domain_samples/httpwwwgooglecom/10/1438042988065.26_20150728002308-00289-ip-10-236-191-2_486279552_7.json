No. 60/043,070, client docket No. TT1800, filed on Apr. 8, 1997, entitled \"Trace Cache for a Microprocessor-Based Device,\" and which is incorporated herein by reference., 73378=Bits 9:8 (EN-- TRACE-- OFF, EN-- TRACE-- ON) of the ITCR allow a user to map the DR5, DR4 breakpoint registers as trace control breakpoints. The DR4 breakpoint register is used to turn trace on if the EN-- TRACE-- ON bit 8 is set to 1, and the DR5 breakpoint register is used to turn trace off if the EN-- TRACE-- OFF bit 9 is set to 1. When using this feature, the developer may enable and disable trace unit 140 on the occurrence of particular instructions so that only selected portions of code are traced, thereby conserving space in trace buffer 144 and allowing for more focused code tracing. When processor 110 hits a breakpoint which is mapped as a trace control breakpoint (e.g., DR4, DR5), processor 110 is not stopped. The instruction trace stream is turned on (e.g., DR4) or off (e.g., DR5) as enabled by the EN-- TRACE-- OFF, EN-- TRACE-- ON bits 9:8., 58744=I/O port 162 provides a port for transferring trace information between target system 100 and a host system 170. In one embodiment, host system 170 executes debug control software module 180 for transferring high-level commands and controlling the extraction and analysis of debug information generated by target system 100. Host system 170 and target system 100 communicate via a bus 145. Bus 145 is, for example, a serial bus. Most computers are equipped with a serial or parallel interface which can be inexpensively connected to debug port 152 by means of a serial I/O port 162, allowing a variety of computers to function as host system 170. Alternatively, bus 145 could be replaced with higher speed JTAG-to-network conversion equipment. Debug port 152 preferably uses an IEEE-1149.1-1990 compliant JTAG interface or other similar standardized serial port interface. Bus 147 provides a parallel interface between bond-out pins of processor 110 and host system 170., 59734=Referring to FIG. 2, trace unit 140 includes trace controller 142, trace buffer 144, CPU interface 210, debug interface 220 and pad interface 230. Trace CPU interface 210 provides an interface to processor core 112. Trace debug interface 220 provides an interface to debug unit 150 (e.g., an IEEE-1149.1-1990 compliant JTAG debug circuit). Trace pad interface 230 provides a parallel interface to bus 147 to provide trace information from trace unit 140 to host system 170. Trace pad interface 230 and debug port 152 provide alternative trace outputs. Trace controller 142 includes control logic for storage and/or retrieval of trace information provided by processor 110 via CPU interface 210. Trace buffer 144 provides storage for the trace information. Trace buffer 144 is a dual-ported random access memory (RAM) design and is organized as 256 entries by 20 bits. Alternatively, trace buffer 144 may have 128 entries or any other number of entries.}",

Although an attempt has been made to outline some exemplary variations, other variations are within the scope of invention as defined in the claims below. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that boundaries between the functionality of the above described operations are merely illustrative. The functionality of multiple operations may be combined into a single operation, and/or the functionality of a single operations may be distributed in additional operations in accordance with the invention. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that circuit elements in circuit diagrams and boundaries between logic blocks are merely illustrative and that alternative embodiments may merge logic blocks or circuit elements or impose an alternate decomposition of functionality upon various logic blocks or circuit elements. For example, an indicator may provide a corresponding indication through any appropriate structure such as a bit or a plurality of bits in a register or a plurality of registers or a location in a memory. Moreover, alternative embodiments may include multiple instances of a particular component. For example, exemplary processor 110 of FIG. 1 is an SLE486 processor available from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. The SLE486 is compatible with the x86 microprocessor architecture which has gained wide-spread acceptance. The x86 architecture introduced in the i386\u2122 microprocessor is also the basic architecture of both",
