The term \"multifunctional\" as used herein refers to crosslinking agents which possess two or more free radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated groups. Useful multifunctional crosslinking agents include those selected from the group consisting of acrylic of methacrylic esters of diols such as butanediol diacrylate, triols such as glycerol, and tetrols such as pentaerythritol. Other useful crosslinking agents include those selected from the group consisting of polymeric multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates, e.g., poly(ethylene oxide) diacrylate or poly(ethylene oxide) dimethacrylate; polyvinylic crosslinking agents, such as substituted and unsubstituted divinylbenzene; and difunctional urethane acrylates, such as Ebecryl\u2122 270 and Ebecryl 230\u2122 (1500 weight average molecular weight and 5000 weight average molecular weight acrylated urethanes, respectively--both available from Radcure Specialties), and mixtures thereof., 58596=Preferred macromonomers also include those selected from the group consisting of p-vinyl benzyl terminated poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone); p-vinyl benzyl terminated poly(acrylamide); methacrylate terminated poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone); and mixtures thereof. These macromonomers may be prepared through the esterification reaction of a carboxy terminated N-vinyl pyrrolidone or acrylamide, beta-mercaptopropionic acid chain transfer agent, and chloromethyl styrene or methacryloyl chloride, as described in a series of papers by M. Akashi et al. [Angew. Makromol. Chem., 132, 81 (1985); J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 39, 2027 (1990); J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem., 27, 3521 (1989] all incorporated by reference herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations 5 cm (2 inch) wide strips of the tape approximately 30.5 cm (12 inches) long were applied longitudinally to the end of a golf club with the microparticle-containing pressure sensitive adhesive facing outwards. The taped end of the golf club was then submerged in water for approximately 10 seconds. After the 10 second soak, the golf club was removed and a rubber grip was applied. The resulting assembly was air dried at room temperature. Time for the tape to dry exceeded 60 minutes. MS-D was coated at 152.4\u03bc (6 mils) wet onto a 50.8\u03bc (2 mil) polyester, then oven dried at 80\ufffd C. for 3 min. An acrylic adhesive was coated at approximately 101.6\u03bc (4 mils) wet on the opposite side, then oven dried at 80\ufffd C. for 3 min.
