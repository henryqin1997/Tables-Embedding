Linear density (or gauge) of a fiber expressed in grams per 1000 meters., 96574=The coating or saturant 107 of this invention can be formed substantially by the water-resistant resin, but good results can also be achieved by forming the coating or saturant from a mixture of resin and fillers, such as silicates, silica, gypsum, titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate. The saturant or coating 107 can be applied in latex or curable thermosetting form. Acceptable resins include styrene-acrylic copolymer, acrylics, flame retardant acrylics or brominated monomer additions to acrylic, such as Pyropoly AC2001, poly(vinyl acetates), poly(vinyl alcohols), vinylidene chloride, siloxane, and polyvinylchloride such as Vycar\ufffd 578. In addition, fire retardants, such as bromated phosphorous complex, halogenated paraffin, colloidal antimony pentoxide, borax, unexpanded vermiculite, clay, colloidal silica and colloidal aluminum can be added to the resinous coating or saturant. Furthermore, water resistant additives can be added, such as paraffin, and combinations of paraffin and ammonium salt, fluorochemicals designed to impart alcohol and water repellency, such as FC-824 from 3M Co., organohydrogenpolysiloxanes, silicone oil, wax-asphalt emulsions and poly(vinyl alcohol) with or without a minor amount a minor amount of poly(vinyl acetate). Finally, the saturant and coatings can include pigment, such as kaolin clay, or lamp black thickeners such as modified bentonite clay, defoamers, such as fatty acid/polyglycol mixtures, UV resistance additives, setting accelerators, such as clay compounds, polyacrylamide, potassium salts, or combinations thereof, and dispersants such as sodium polyacrylate. Known preservatives and, of course, water can be added in latex compositions, and solvents in thermosetting compositions. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,864, which includes insulation boards including polyvinylchloride based coatings including fire- and water-repellants, and which is hereby incorporated by reference). Other additives, suggested herein as being useful in the binder or cementitious core 101, could also be employed in the coating or saturant 107., 24841=This application is a Division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,489, filed Jan. 21, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,049,251, issued May 23, 2006.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, it can be realized that this invention provides facing materials for cementitious boards which are lightweight, exhibit high strength in combination with set cementitious core materials, and which remain porous to water vapor. The preferred glass fabric facings of this invention bond to set gypsum and Portland cement to form a strong integral structure, yet can present a textured surface for joining to other layers of EIF systems, such as, for example, adhesive bonding to polystyrene insulation. The woven, knitted or needled exterior surface of the preferred textile fiber fabrics is also easier to handle by construction workers, and will not lead to as much injury or irritation as chopped fiber glass mats having exposed sharp individual fibers. The choice of needling, weaving and knitting operations of this invention lend themselves to numerous engineering and design choices which can combine wefts and warps of different filament orientation and filament composition, for creating unique facing properties. One of the desirable properties of the current invention is its ability to resist the penetration of cementitious slurries, thus avoiding roll contamination in continuous wall board making machinery. Although various embodiments have been illustrated, this is for the purpose of describing, but not limiting, the invention. Various modifications, which will become apparent to one skilled in the art, are within the scope of this invention described in the attached claims. The exterior finishing material can",
