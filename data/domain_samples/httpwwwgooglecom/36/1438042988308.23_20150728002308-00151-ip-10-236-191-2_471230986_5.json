    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, the present invention demonstrates a great increase in practicability. Furthermore, the absence of a need for wiring connection raises the degree of freedom of the mounting position of the human body sensor body, thus it is possible to mount the body at a location which does not hinder the use thereof and to widen the space around the water outlet, in other words, convenience use is improved to that extent. Conventionally, since wiring connection has been required between the human body sensor body and the control device, a strict waterproof processing must be applied. On the contrary, the present invention need not execute the waterproof processing and wiring work, thereby saving labor during manufacturing. As seen from the above, the human body sensor of the present invention transmits the human body detection signal from the sensor body to the control device by the radio system, whereby the wiring connection between the sensor body and the control device is not required. Accordingly, since constraint in the disposed position of both the members is reduced, not only manufacture of the automatic faucet apparatus is facilitated, but also the existing faucet can be utilized to construct the automatic faucet apparatus. Effect of the Invention By the above-mentioned construction, in the human body sensor of the present invention, the human body sensor body provided in the vicinity of the water outlet, when detecting a human body, outputs",
