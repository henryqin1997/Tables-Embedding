As shown in FIG. 8, it is possible to preattach the vial 14 to the connector 10 for shipment. Preattaching the vial 14 to the connector 10 may be accomplished using aseptic connecting techniques. The preferred method of preattaching the device 10 to the vial 14 include the steps of: 1) positioning the vial 14 and the second end 82 of the second sleeve 32 into opposed relationship, 2) simultaneously bringing the segmented fingers 84 into operative engagement with the vial 14 while sterilizing the connection by exposing the connecting portions of the device 10 and the vial 4 with, preferably, gamma sterilization or other sterilization energies or techniques, 3) locking the vial 14 to the connector. These steps can be carried out manually by medical personnel or automatically by a machine. The preattached vial 14 and connector 10 assembly may be wrapped in an outer pouch for shipping and storage. In another embodiment of the present container, the beveled end 73 of the cannula 34 could be replaced by a blunt end 150 as shown in FIG. 7.
