In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of formula I will depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. For all the protection, de-protection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in \u201cProtecting Groups\u201d, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994 and, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts in \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d, Wiley-Interscience, 1991., 233303=A solution of sodium hydroxide (4.5 g, 112 mmol) in water (70 ml) was added to the relevant proline olefin methyl ester (66 mmol) in 3:1 dioxane:water (500 ml) and the reaction stirred for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then washed with diethyl ether (2\ufffd50 ml), and the aqueous phase acidified to pH 2 (0.1N HCl) and extracted into ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent was then removed in vacuo to give the desired product in near quantitative yields as an oil which was used without further purification., 101442=The entire Bcl-2 family comprises both anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1, NR-13, BHRF1, LMW5-HL, ORP16, KS-Bcl-2, E1B-19K, CED-9) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bok, Bik, Blk, Hrk, BNIP3, BimL, Bad, Bid, EGL-1) molecules (see Kelekar, A., and C. B. Thomp-son 1998. Trends in Cell Biology 8:324\u2013330). The specific member thereof, i.e. the first found, Bcl-2 is a 26 kDa protein that localizes to the mitochondrial, endoplasmatic reticulum and perinuclear membranes. The Bcl-2 family proteins can form homo- and hetero-dimers that involve amino acid sequences known as Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. So far, four of said domains (BH1 to 4) have been identified, the BH3 having been attributed a particularly prominent role in view of the death-promoting cascade. Said BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic members appears to be required for the interaction between anti and pro-apoptotic molecules. The principal site of action of some of the Bcl-2 family members seems to be the mitochondria. Mitochondria have been shown to play a major role in many types of apoptosis. In particular, this organelle has been shown to release Apoptosis Inducing Factor and cytochrome c, a hemoprotein which is bound to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Said cytochrome c has been shown to trigger caspase 9 activation through Apaf-1/caspase 9 complex formation. Bcl-2 family members play a key role in regulating cytochrome c release. While Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been shown to suppress cytochrome c release, Bax has been found to stimulate this event both in vitro using isolated mitochondria as well as in intact cells following heterologous expression (Martinou et al.; The Journal of Cell Biology, 128, 1995, 201\u2013208). The mechanisms by which these proteins perform their function are currently unknown. The three-dimensional structure of Bcl-xL and Bid revealed structural similarities between these proteins and the channel-forming domains of the bacterial toxins colicins and diphtheria toxins. Consistent with such structural similarity, some members of this family including Bax were also found able to form ion channels in synthetic lipid membranes., 100902=Neuronal death occurs via either apoptotic or necrotic processes following traumatic nerve injury or during neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple components are emerging as key players having a role in driving neuronal programmed cell death. Amongst the components leading to neuronal apoptosis are protein members belonging to the Bcl-2 family (see Jacobson, M. D. 1997. Current Biology 7:R 277\u2013R281; Kroemer, G. C. 1997. Nature Medicine: 614\u2013620; Reed, J. C. 1997. Nature 387:773\u2013776)., 194430=Compounds of formula XIIa are commercially available or prepared by standard synthetic techniques as hereinafter described in the Examples. Compounds of formula II with X=S are accessible from the corresponding suitably protected ketopyrrolidine intermediates VII through standard functional group interconversion methods well known to the person skilled in the art, such as, e.g., by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or others (Pedersen, B. S. et al.; Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 1978, 87,223), followed by saponification., 173703=According to a preferred embodiment, the above cited diseases or disease states are treated by the modulation of the Bax function, or the modulation (e.g. the inhibition) of the activation or expression of Bax, respectively, via the use of compounds of formula I, whereby the term Bax function notably comprises the actually active form of Bax as an oligomer (see B. Antonsson et al. in Biochem. J., Vol. 345, 2000, pages 271\u2013278). Through the modulation of the Bax function, a convenient method of treatment of disorders mediated by Bax is expected, including in particular neuronal disorders and/or disorders of the immune system. Said modulation could notably involve the inhibition of the activity (activation) and/or of the expression of Bax. Also, said modulation of the Bax function or activity could actually comprise the inhibition or disruption for instance of the Bid interaction with Bax, which has been shown to play a role within the context of the Bax activation leading to cytochrome c release (see J. C. Martinou et al. in The Journal of Cell Biology, Vol. 144, No. 5, Mar. 8, 1999, pages 891\u2013901). As a result of the inhibition of the Bax activation by Bid upon using the compounds according to formula I, the cytochrome c release could be inhibited or essentially blocked, thus providing a convenient means to modulate the above described apoptosis pathways. As a result, by said modulation of the apoptosis pathways a whole variety of disorders associated with abnormal apoptosis is expected to be treated., 211618=The above described components for orally administered or injectable compositions are merely representative. Further materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set out in Part 8 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, 1985, Marck Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein be reference., 104547=In WO 97/01635 (Neurex Corp.) the inhibition of apoptosis in an effort to promote cell survival is suggested to be achieved by introducing into the cell a chimeric gene containing a polynucleotide encoding a Bax-\u03c9-polypeptide (a splice variant of the Bax gene, which displays\u2014in contrast to Bax\u2014an anti-apoptotic activity) being operably linked to a promoter effective to cause transcription of the polynucleotide in the cell. It is reported that the expression of the Bax-\u03c9-polypeptide is effective to inhibit apoptosis in the cell. Perez et al. in Nat. Genet. 1999, 21(2), 200\u2013203 have indicated that apoptosis plays a fundamental role in follicular atresia and they suggest to selectively disrupt the Bax function in order to extend the ovarian lifespan., 223828=A solution was made containing (2S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (5.0 g, 22 mmol) and O-allylhydroxylamine hydrochloride monohydrate (7.2 g, 65.5 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of pyridine and ethanol (100 ml). The reaction was heated to reflux for 2.5 h before cooling and removal of solvent. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed rapidly with 1.3N HCl (40 ml). The acidic layer was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd20 ml) and the combined organic layers washed with brine before drying over magnesium sulfate, filtering and re-moval of solvent in vacuo. The desired product (5.9 g, 94%) was isolated as a pale yellow oil., 516408=Mitochondria (30 \u03bcg) from mouse liver are incubated with 200 nM recombinant Bax in the presence of various compounds (5 \u03bcM) in 200 mL of KCl buffer for 20 min at 30\ufffd C. and are then centrifuged for 4 min at 13,000 g at 4\ufffd C. Mitochondrial pellets corresponding to 1.5 \u03bcg proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE using 4\u201320% Tris-Gly gels (NOVEX) and their respective contents of cytochrome c are estimated by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (dilution 1:2,500). Antigen-antibody complexes are detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhance chemiluminescence detection reagents. The cytochrome c bands are scanned and quantified using a Bio-Rad (GS-700 Imaging Densitometer)., 203313=However, the reaction sequences outlined in the above Schemes usually provides mixtures of (E) and (Z) isomers with respect to the substituents on the exocyclic double bond of the pyrrolidine ring. In all cases studied, these (E)/(Z)-isomers could be separated by standard chromatography techniques well known to the person skilled in the art, such as by reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or silica gel flash chromatography (FC). The assignment of the absolute configuration of the exocyclic double bond was performed using NMR-techniques well described in the literature as will be known to the practitioner skilled in the art (for configurationnal assignements of e.g. oxime functionalities, see e.g. E. Breitmaier, W. Voelter Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy, 3rd Ed, VCH, 1987, p. 240)., 213842=Commercial (2S,4R)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (30 g, 0.13 mol) was dissolved in acetone (1500 ml). A mechanical stirrer was placed in the flask and the solution stirred vigorously. A freshly made solution of 8N chromic acid was prepared by dissolving chromium trioxide (66.7 g, 0.667 mol) in water (40 ml), adding concentrated sulphuric acid (53.3 ml) and adding enough water to bring the solution volume to 115 ml. The 8N chromic acid solution (115 ml) was then added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes with continued vigorous stirring, the reaction's exotherm being maintained at the optimal temperature of 25\ufffd C. by the use of an ice bath. After the complete addition of the chromic acid, the reac-tion mixture was stirred for a further 15 minutes\u2014maintaining the optimal temperature of 25\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was then quenched by the addition of methanol (20 ml). Exotherm controlled by the use of an ice bath and, if necessary, direct addition of a small amount of crushed ice to the reaction mixture itself. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad and then concentrated in vacuo. The resulting acidic solution was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd300 ml) and the combined organic layers washed with brine (2\ufffd100 ml). Organics then dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. Crude product recrystallised from ethyl acetate to give the white crystalline product, (2S)-1-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)-4-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (22.55 g, 76%). The antipodal intermediate, (2R)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid, was made according to the same protocol, starting from commercial (2R,4S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid., 513304=A compound of formula I is admixed as a dry powder with a starch diluent in an approximate 1:1 weight ratio. The mixture is filled into 250 mg capsules (125 mg of active pyrrolidine derivatives according to formula I per capsule)., 230364=A mixture of 2-bromo-3-methylpyridine (22.5 g, 0.1312 mol), 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenylboronic acid (25 g, 0.164 mol), Pd(PPh3)4 (9.5 g, 0.0082 mol), and sodium carbonate (200 g in 500 ml of water) in toluene (750 ml) were refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere for 15 h. Separated the toluene layer and distilled under reduced pressure to give a residue. The residue was then purified by column chromatography to yield [4-(3-methyl-2-pyridinyl)phenyl]methanol (12 g, 47%)., 514129=The compound of formula I is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ratio. A minor amount of magnesium stearate is added as a lubricant. The mixture is formed into 450\u2013900 mg tablets (150\u2013300 mg of active pyrrolidine derivatives according to formula I) in a tablet press., 226374=A solution was made containing ethanolamine (36.5 ml, 0.6 mol) in chloroform (1000 ml). The Boc2O (13.1 g, 60 mmol) dissolved in chloroform (600 ml) was slowly added dropwise at 0\ufffd C. over a 6-hours period (the temperature was maintained all over this period). The reaction was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred overnight. The organic layer was washed with water (2\ufffd500 ml), brine and dried over magnesium sulfate before being concentrated in vacuo. The desired product (9.5 g, >95%) was isolated as a colourless oil and was used without further purification. A solution was made containing the Boc-ethanolamine (1.92 g, 12 mmol) with potassium carbonate (5 g, 36 mmol) in DCM (40 ml). Acetyl chloride (30 ml, 0.42 mol) was added and the reaction stirred for 6 hours at room temperature. The excess of acetyl chloride was removed in vacuo and the crude dissolved in DCM(100 ml). The organic layer was washed with water (50 ml), brine and dried over magnesium sulfate before being concentrated in vacuo. The desired product (1.86 g, 77%) was isolated as a colourless oil and was used without further purification. A solution was made containing the O-acyl, Boc-ethanolamine (1.65 g, 8.1 mmol) in DCM (20 ml) and TFA (20 ml) was added. After one hour at room temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude was concentrated from methanol (2\u20133 times) and from DCM (2\u20133 times) to give the expected compound (1.75 g, quant.) as an oil used without further purification., 517341=Concerning the Bid-induced activation of Bax leading to mitochondrial Cytochrome C release, it is referred to the description of Martinou et al. in The Journal of Cell Biology, Vol. 144, No. 5, Mar. 8, 1999, pages 891\u2013901. Mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells are incubated for 15 min at 30\ufffd C. in 100 \u03bcl of KCl buffer in the presence or absence of 10 nM recombinant Bid. The various compounds (10 \u03bcM) are pre-incubated for 5 min prior to addition of Bid. Following incubation, mitochondria were centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 g at 4\ufffd C. and the supernatant is collected for cytochrome c analysis. Cytochrome c is detected by Western blotting. The cytochrome c bands are scanned and quantified using a Bio-Rad (GS-700 Imaging Densitometer)., 512897=A compound of formula I is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ration. A minor amount of magnesium stearate is added as a lubricant. The mixture is formed into 240\u2013270 mg tablets (80\u201390 mg of active pyrrolidine derivatives according to formula I per tablet) in a tablet press., 242801=The pure E-isomer was isomerized to a mixture of the E/Z-isomers by the following procedure: the E-isomer was dissolved in dioxane/water 3:1 mixture. NaOH (1.7 eq; 0.52 mL of NaOH 1.6N) was added and the resulting solution was stirred 2 h at r.t. The mixture was neutralysed with HCl 0.1 N and lyophilised. The components of the resulting E/Z-mixture were separated and purified by flash chromatography using same conditions as described above., 513620=A compound of formula I (1250 mg), sucrose (1.75 g) and xanthan gum (4 mg) are blended, passed through a No. 10 mesh U.S. sieve, and then mixed with a previously made solution of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (11:89, 50 mg) in water. Sodium benzoate (10 mg), flavor, and color are diluted with water and added with stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce a total volume of 5 mL., 103688=Studies performed with Bax-deficient mice led to the conclusion that Bax plays a promi-nent role within the apoptosis pathways, notably in neuronal apoptosis. Bax is viewed to be essential for apoptosis induced by NGF deprivation in neonatal sympathetic neurons or for apoptosis induced in cerebellar granule cells by potassium deprivation from the culture medium. Moreover, it was found that in the Bax-deficient mice (knock-out) neonatal moto-neurons from the facial nucleus can survive following axotomy (see Deckwerth, T. L., Elliott J. L., Knudson C. M. et al. 1996. Neuron 17,401\u201341). Hence, the inhibition of the Bax activity leading to the prevention of cytochrome c release from mitochondria during apoptosis, is viewed to be useful to protect neurons and also other cell types from various cell death stimuli., 222837=A solution was made containing (2S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (5.0 g, 22mmol) and O-ethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (6.4 g, 65.5 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of pyridine and ethanol (100 ml). The reaction was heated to reflux for 2.5 h before cooling and removal of solvent. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed rapidly with 1.3N HCl (40 ml). The acidic layer was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3\ufffd20 ml) and the combined organic layers washed with brine before drying over magnesiom sulfate, filtering and removal of solvent in vacuo. The desired product (5.5 g, 93%) was isolated as a pale yellow oil., 128002=Under no circumstances B could be a group COOR or a group \u2014(C\u2550O)NR(OR), whereby R is H, alkyl or acyl. Such compounds, notably having a group B=hydroxamic acid are described in WO 99/52868 as being potent inhibitors of metalloproteases., 215854=A solution of (2S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (1 g, 4.3 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and toluene (60 ml) was made. Trimethylsilyl diazomethane (6.5 ml of a 2M solution in hexanes, 13 mmol) was then added dropwise to the stirred solution at room temperature under nitrogen. After completion of the evolution of nitrogen gas, the resulting yellow solution was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue filtered through a pad of silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate. Removal of solvent from the filtrate gave a yellow oil (1.05 g, near quantitative yield)., 515677=Mitochondria are isolated from mouse liver cells by differential centrifugation. Cells are broken with a dounce homogenizer and the suspension is centrifuged at 2,000 g in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4\ufffd C. This procedure is repeated until almost all the cells are broken. 20 Supernatants from each step are pooled before centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4\ufffd C. for 10 min. The pellet is resuspended in 40 mL MB buffer and centrifuged at 2000 g for 2 min. The supernatant is removed and centrifuged at 13 kg for 4 min. The mitochondria are recovered in the 13 k pellet and resuspended in MB buffer at a density of 30 OD600 nm/mL., 241975=(2S,4Z)-N-[(2S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl]-4-(methoxyimino)-1-[(2\u2032-methyl[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4-yl)carbonyl]-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamide: M.p. 78\ufffd C.; IR (neat) \u03bd 3318, 2938, 1622, 1538, 1416, 1233, 1045, 852 cm\u22121; 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): 2.28 (s, 3H, ArCH3), 2.69 (dd, J=6, 10 Hz, 1H), 3.02\u20133.22 (m, 2H), 3.25 (br s, 1H), 3.60 (m, 1H), 3.86 (s, 3H, NOCH3), 4.14 (m, 2H), 4.71 (m, 1H), 4.96 (m, 1H), 7.03\u20137.42 (m, 11H, H arom.), 7.45\u20137.54 (m, 2H, H arom.); M+(APCI+): 472; M\u2212(APCI\u2212): 470.
