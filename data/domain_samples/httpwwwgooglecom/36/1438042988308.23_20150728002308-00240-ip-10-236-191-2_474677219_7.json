For example, in FIG. 5D, it shows a table 584 of all the users managed by the central server 500. Among the users, John's access privilege 585 is at level 10 (assumed highest) and can access secured documents all days at all times from any of the three locations. Dell's access privilege 586 is at level 1 (assumed lowest) and can access secured documents 8 hours (e.g., 9:00 AM-5 PM) a day, Monday to Friday and only from location A. Mike's access privilege 587 is at level 5 and can access secured documents 12 hours Monday to Saturday and only from locations A and B. If three local servers are employed respectively for the three locations A, B and C, there can be three different access control management possibilities as shown in FIG. 5E, each assigned to one local server. As a result, the local users need only to check with the corresponding local server and none of the users would be affected if other local servers are down for whatever reasons or disconnected from the central server.}",

Various modifications to the present invention can be made to the preferred embodiments by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description of embodiments. The processes, sequences or steps and features discussed above are related to each other and each is believed independently novel in the art. The disclosed processes, sequences or steps and features may be performed alone or in any combination to provide a novel and unobvious system or a portion of a system. It should be understood that the processes, sequences or steps and features in combination yield an equally independently novel combination as well, even if combined in their broadest sense, i.e., with less than the specific manner in which each of the processes, sequences or steps and features has been reduced to practice. The present invention may be implemented as a method, a system, a computer readable medium, a computer product and other forms that achieve what is desired herein. Those skilled in the art will understand that the description could be equally applied to or used in other various different settings with respect to various combinations, embodiments or settings provided in",
