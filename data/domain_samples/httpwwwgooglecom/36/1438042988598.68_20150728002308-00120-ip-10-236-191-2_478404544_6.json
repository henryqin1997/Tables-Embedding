For example, and as represented in FIG. 2, the present invention utilizes the Windows\ufffd 2000 I/O system architecture that provides I/O Request Packets (IRPs) from an I/O manager 60 in response to filesystem 62 I/O requests from an application program 64 on a local client machine 66. Notwithstanding, there is no intention to limit the present invention to Windows\ufffd 2000 or Windows NT\ufffd, but on the contrary, the present invention is intended to operate with and provide benefits with any operating system, architecture and/or file system that uses I/O requests for transferring information., 89705=As can be readily appreciated, via the I/O request, the present invention is completely general with respect to remote devices, although in the Windows\ufffd 2000 environment the memory usage of IRPs needs to be known. However, it is not possible to know the memory usage for all I/O requests. In Windows 2000, IOCTL \u201cMETHOD_NEITHER\u201d IRPs are essentially private agreements between a device-specific user mode code and a device driver. To support this particular type of I/O request, customized dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that understand the memory usage may be implemented for each such device class.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions, a certain illustrated embodiment thereof is shown in the drawings and has been described above in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific form or forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. As can be seen from the foregoing detailed description, there is provided a method and system that allows a client to remotely access and control devices over a network. The method and system provide access to any type of remote device in a flexible and extensible manner. When the reply is thus received, step 740 aggregates the result as necessary (for segmented requests) as described above so that the IRP is or will be configured with its appropriate status. Lastly, when all segments are processed at step 742, the request is completed, the IRP is configured with its appropriate status, and the IRP is sent by the IRP completer 168 back up to the I/O manager 60 via step 744. Returning to FIG. 7C, the client filter driver object 68 handles the reply, first receiving the reply via its connection state machine 162, also represented by FIGS. 9A-9B. Thus, as generally described above, steps 900-906 await the reply (although the client need not",
