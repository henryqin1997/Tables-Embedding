The probe 40 comprises a reference body 38 forming the casing of the probe 40 and supporting the optical scanners A 1 to A 5. A position-control element 36 is located within the reference body 38. Said position-control element is provided with the scales 30, 32, 34 and, at one end, swingably, displaceably and rotatably clamped in the reference body 38, and supports at the other end a scanning ball 42 which, in measuring operations, slides along the test surface and, in doing so, encounters deflections and/or compressive strains. Based on such deflections and/or compressive strains it is then possible, with application of the above formulas, to determine a number of measured values that permit a reproduction of the contour of the surface. The data of the scanners A 3, A 4 and A 5 are suitable for the determination of the Z-direction. If the position-control element 36 and the reference body 38 are aligned in parallel and also not turned around the X-axis, the data of the three scanners A 3, A 4 and A 5 supply the same value. However, the values are different in the presence of inclinations around the Y-axis and/or the X-axis. The Z-coordinates are obtained according to the following formula: ##EQU10## The angles of inclination can be calculated based on the",
