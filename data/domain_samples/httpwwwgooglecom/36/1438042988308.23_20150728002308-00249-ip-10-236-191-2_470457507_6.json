In the assembled condition, as shown in FIG. 3, the syringe is now a liquid-tight storage container and can be shipped, for instance to a laboratory, for analysis. In preparation for inserting the syringe or attaching the syringe to a centrifuge (not shown), the members 20 and 34 are removed while cap 40 remains mounted on the nozzle 16. The vial 10 is then handled in the conventional manner for purposes of specimen analysis. With the closure member 20 in situ and in locking engagement with the piston 34, the rearward end is securely tightened for liquid integrity. The cap at this time either has already been or may then be secured to the forward end thereof in a manner as will be apparent from the preceding description. Alternatively, the rod 32 may be composed of portion 32A' and 32B' which are threadedly connected together as shown in FIG. 1a. In any event, the main objective is that the portion 32B does not extend much beyond the",
