However, access control systems have been developed for controlling access to television programming based on the paying of a program fee or the desired censorship of programs containing subject matter deemed unsuitable for all viewers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,229 issued to Benjamin et al. on Aug. 30, 1988 describes a restrictive access control system that includes a three-state switch for limiting television tuning access to only designated channels. U.S. Pat. No. 5,550,575 issued to West et al. on Aug. 27, 1996 discloses a viewer discretion television program control system which relies upon suitability ratings and personal identification numbers of household viewers to restrict television program access., 50092=The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/233,296 filed Aug. 30, 2002 which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/304,447 filed May 3, 1999 (abandoned) which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/771,951 filed Dec. 23, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,136. Said U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/233,296, 09/304,447 and 08/877,951 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the examples given but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. The compliance questions and compliance instructions illustrated are exemplary of just one possible embodiment of the invention. Many other questions and instructions may be displayed or telephoned to patients in alternative embodiments. Additionally, the preferred embodiment describes a system and method for encouraging patients having diabetes. However, the invention is not limited to diabetic patients. The system and method described are equally effective for patients having asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, HIV, mental health disorders, or any other health condition requiring a treatment plan. Further, the preferred embodiment describes the use of medical monitoring devices and telephones for collecting compliance data from the patient. However, many other methods of collecting data from a patient are possible in alternative embodiments. For example, the patient could be provided with an electronic logbook and modem for transmitting compliance data via telephone lines. In another embodiment, the patient is provided with a paper based logbook and an automated reader for digitizing and transmitting the compliance data to the patient database. Alternatively, the patient could mail or fax the compliance data to the healthcare provider for entry into the database. Additionally, the set-top processor described is exemplary of just one possible embodiment of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that",
