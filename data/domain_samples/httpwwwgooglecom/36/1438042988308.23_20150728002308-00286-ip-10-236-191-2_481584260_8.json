In addition, some embodiments limit impacted designations when sufficient redundancy remains despite a failure. For example, if one of three connections fails, and redundant connections remain, some embodiments do not mark the redundantly connected device as \u201cimpacted\u201d. These and other variations upon and modification to the illustrated embodiments are provided for by the present invention, the scope of which is defined by the following claims. Herein, \u201callocation\u201d involves matching workloads to resources, e.g., software programs to servers. Herein, an allocation planner gives a higher priority to a first resource than to another if, all else being equal, it allocates a workload to the first resource. Thus, in the present context, an allocation planner will assign a workload to a non-impacted server instead of an impacted server, even though the capabilities of the two servers are the same. In some cases, some overriding consideration might result in an allocation of a workload to an impacted server instead of a non-impacted server. E.g., where the workload is already running on the impacted server or where an impacted server is",
