    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims. It should be noted that the error detection and scrubbing technique described herein may not distinguish between soft and hard errors. While corrected data may still be distributed through the output of the host controller 58, if the errors are hard errors, the scrubbing operation to correct the erroneous data words in the memory sub-system 40 will be unsuccessful. To solve this problem, software in the host controller 58 may track the number of data errors associated with a particular data word or memory location. After some pre-determined number of repeated errors are detected in the same data word or memory location, the host controller 58 may send an error message to a user or illuminate an LED corresponding to the device in which the repeat error is detected. Further, the host controller 58 may include a content addressable memory (CAM) controller 78. The CAM controller 78 provides a means of insuring that memory WRITEs are only performed when",
