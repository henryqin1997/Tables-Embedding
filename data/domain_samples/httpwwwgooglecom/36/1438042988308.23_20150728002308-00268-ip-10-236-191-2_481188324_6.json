In addition, if the quaternary read only memory array 8 is contained on a semiconductor chip which is independent of the sense amplifier circuits 12, a reduction in the number of I/O pads on the semiconductor chip is achieved, resulting in a reduction in packaging and wiring costs. The circuit implementation of B is well-known and for the sake of completeness an example is shown in FIG. 9d. FET devices 32, 34 and 36 are connected as a NOR with load device 30, yielding the output 38. FET devices 44, 46 and 48 are connected as a NOR with load device 42, yielding the output 50. FET devices 40 and 52 with inputs 38 and 50 respectively, are connected as a NOR with load device 54, producing an output inverted by FET devices 56 and 58, yielding the desired binary bit B at 18'. If binary logical outputs A and B have a voltage level not compatible with subsequent FET circuitry, the level may be adjusted with additional inverters. B=S2 \ufffd(S0 S1 +S0 S1) Now that the three variables S0, S1 and S2 are available the required binary bit A is equal to S1 while for the binary bit B, the switching expression, as mentioned before,",
