    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6550=Phosphopeptide peaks detected during MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (FIG. 19, top panel) are accompanied by companion peaks that are broader and apparently 84 lower in mass, e.g., the peak with a mass of 1989 has a partner peak at 1905, etc. These companion peaks correspond to metastable decomposition products of phosphopeptides, formed by neutral-loss of phosphate while the phosphopeptide ions are traveling to the detector of the mass spectrometer. The peaks for decomposition products are broader than the peaks for phosphopeptides because the decomposition products form after ionization and the instrument is configured to focus ions that are stable during analysis. For similar reasons, the expected mass shift for loss of phosphate is \u221298, but \u221284 mass shifts are observed because, unlike a stable ion, the mass of a decomposition product changes during analysis. Metastable decomposition of phosphopeptides has been noted by others and can be used to recognize and assign phosphopeptides in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum (Annan and Carr, supra.). Analysis of a large number of synthetic phosphopeptides by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicates that some peptides containing phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (but not phosphotyrosine) residues undergo metastable decomposition. For this reason, metastable decomposition is a reliable indicator of peptides that contain phosphoserine or phosphothreonine.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{211552=The method of the invention was further demonstrated using a motif-specific, context-independent polyclonal antibody, phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody, to purify phosphopeptides containing the phospho-Akt substrate motif from a mixture of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated synthetic peptides. The Akt protein kinase plays a central role in cell growth (Marte and Downward, Trends Biochem. Sci. 22: 355\u2013358 (1997)), angiogenesis (Jiang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 1749\u20131753 (2000)), and transcriptional regulation (Scheid and Woodgett, Curr. Biol. 10: R191\u2013194 (2000)). The Akt protein kinase is able to phosphorylate protein substrates at threonine or serine residues when the target residue occurs within the consensus sequence motif RXRXX(T/S), where R is arginine, X is any amino acid, and T/S indicates the target threonine or serine., 54696=This application claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 60/299,893, filed Jun. 21, 2001, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/337,012, filed Nov. 8, 2001, both abandoned, and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 10/175,486, filed Jun. 19, 2002, presently pending, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/535,364, filed Mar. 24, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,982,318, itself a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 09/148,712, filed Sep. 4, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,140, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein., 157075=In certain cases, if phosphopeptides are being isolated, it may be observed that, during MS/MS, some phosphopeptides undergo neutral loss to a very high degree, with very little residual fragmentation along the peptide backbone (which is needed to produce spectra of a quality high enough for unambiguous assignments). In such cases, analysis of MS/MS product ion spectra using a search program (such as Sequest) in an attempt to assign a phosphorylation site and parent protein to each peptide may not result in unambiguous assignments. This is a common limitation encountered during MS/MS analysis of peptides containing phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. See e.g., DeGnore et al., J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 9: 1175\u20131188 (1998). Even when phosphopeptides lose phosphate by neutral loss, the position of the phosphorylation site can be determined, as long as there is sufficient residual backbone fragmentation, because neutral loss leaves an unusual residue at the phosphorylation site: phosphoserine becomes dehydroalanine, and phosphothreonine becomes dehydroaminobutyric acid., 405355=To identify more phosphorylation sites, the same SU-DHL-1 cell extract was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase GluC, or elastase, and tyrosine phosphorylated peptides were purified and analyzed as described above, resulting in the identification of 90 phosphotyrosine peptides from the trypsin digest, 58 from chymotrypsin, 43 from endoproteinase GluC, and 82 from elastase. A panel of proteases increased the number of distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sites found from 88 using trypsin alone to 197 using all four proteases. Most (35 of 54) phosphorylation sites from the elastase digest were not found in the tryptic digest. This small union between phosphorylation sites from two digests shows that the use of different proteases produced a more complete phosphorylation profile. Activation loop phosphorylation at Tyr-1282 of ALK was found only after digestion with chymotrypsin, as a 12-residue peptide; this residue is predicted to be in a 5-residue tryptic peptide or a 57-residue endoproteinase GluC peptide, both outside the range of peptide lengths amenable to MS/MS-based identification. In addition, the protease panel generated overlapping phosphopeptide sequences, which confirmed phosphorylation site assignments. The ALK Tyr-1507 site was found in five peptides: three tryptic peptides, one chymotryptic peptide, and one elastase peptide., 375883=The method of the invention was employed to identify tyrosine phosphorylated peptides from two cancer cell lines that express the same activated tyrosine kinase. Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 are derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). The majority of ALCL is characterized by the presence of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that causes the fusion of the nucleophosmin and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes. See Morris et al. Science 263: 1281\u20131284 (1994). Although the two cell lines are derived from different patients, both express the oncogenic fusion kinase NPM-ALK, which possesses constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and can transform non-malignant cells., 62887=Another widely used method for purifying modified peptides is immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). This pseudo-affinity purification method is based on the interaction of metal ions and negatively charged peptide moieties, such as phosphate. See, e.g. Posewitz et al., Anal. Chem. 15: 2883\u20132892 (1999). Pre-purified, phosphorylated proteins are digested to peptides, and the phosphorylated peptides are then purified by passing the digest through a miniaturized chromatography column containing a resin with a covalently attached metal chelator, e.g. iminodiacetic or nitrilotriacetic acid. A cation is non-covalently attached to the chelator by treating the resin with one of several metal salts, such as Fe3+, Ni2+, Ga3+, or Cu2+. When the protein digest is applied to the column, peptides with a sufficiently high negative charge density, such as from a phosphate group, can bind to the metal cation. Eluted peptides can then be analyzed by chemical sequencing or by mass spectrometry (MS or MS/MS) to assign phosphorylation sites., 332138=BRB1 is the B1 bradykinin receptor. It is known that the B1 bradykinin receptor activates protein kinase C (see Christopher et al. Hypertension 38: 602\u2013605 (2001)). There are no known phosphorylation sites in the B1 bradykinin receptor, but the B2 bradykinin receptor is phosphorylated at Ser residues in response to activation of protein kinase C (see Blaukat et al. J. Biol. Chem. 276: 40431\u201340 (2001)). Furthermore, protein kinase C phosphorylation of receptors has been postulated as a general mechanism for receptor desensitization. It is therefore reasonable to presume that protein kinase C could phosphorylate B1 receptors as well. In addition, it is known that the expression of the BRB1 receptor is upregulated on T cells derived from peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis, relevant because this phosphopeptide was purified from a human cell line derived from an acute T cell leukemia (see e.g., Prat et al. Neurology 53: 2087\u20132092 (1999)). The site of phosphorylation tentatively assigned here is in a domain of the protein that is predicted to be cytoplasmic. This tentative assignment may be further explored by analyzing a synthetic peptide with the assigned sequence and phosphorylation site as described above., 250906=The selective isolation of modified peptides from a complex mixture according to the method of the invention was further demonstrated using a digested whole cell extract and a general phosphotyrosine antibody to isolate known phosphopeptides. A model system, the A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was selected since the modification (phosphorylation) of sites on this protein is well-studied. Activation of EGFR family members is associated with many tumors. Five sites of in vivo autophosphorylation have been identified in EGFR: three major sites (Tyr-1068, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173) and two minor sites (Tyr-992 and Tyr-1086) (Downward et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 14538\u2013546 (1985); Hsuan et al., Biochem. J. 259: 519\u201327 (1989); Margolis et al., EMBO J. 9: 4375\u2013380 (1990); Walton et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 1750\u201354 (1990)). EGFR is the major phosphorylated protein expected to be expressed in this cell line., 158198=Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the disclosed method, isolated modified peptides may be further characterized by MS3 (for example LC-MS3, as in a preferred embodiment) analysis; that is, the neutral-loss ions may be subjected to an additional level of MS to give sufficient backbone fragmentation for identification. This process is simpler to implement on ion trap mass spectrometers than on other types of mass spectrometers. As peptides elute from the LC system, a survey MS scan is performed, and MS/MS spectra are collected for the three most abundant ions, if they are above a pre-set intensity threshold and if they have not been recently analyzed by MS/MS already. However, if neutral loss of 49, 32.7, or 24.5 is detected during MS/MS, then before collecting another MS/MS spectrum or another survey MS scan, the instrument first isolates the neutral loss ion, fragments it, and measures the product ion masses. In the case of phosphopeptides, if the neutral-loss ion no longer contains phosphate, it is more likely to fragment like a non-phosphorylated peptide and give a useful product ion spectrum. With certain modifications to the instrument control software, MS3 spectra can be collected in the same data-dependent manner as MS/MS spectra, and the MS3 spectra can be analyzed further with Sequest. See Tomaino and Rush et al. Abstract ThOE 3:00, presented at the 50th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Jun. 6, 2002., 60628=Several researchers have employed immobilized phospho-specific antibodies, along with mass spectrometry (MS or MS/MS), to identify phosphorylation sites in proteins. Immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies have been used to purify phosphopeptides from digests of gelsolin, an actin binding-protein. See De Corte, et al., Prot. Sci. 8: 234\u2013241 (1999). However the single protein of interest, gelsolin, was first purified and phosphorylated in vitro, before digesting to yield gelsolin-specific phosphopeptides. Immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies have similarly been employed to identify EphB phosphopeptides from purified EphB digests (Kalo et al., Biochem. 38: 14396\u2013408 (1999)) and to purify alpha-enolase phosphopeptides from a purified digest of human alpha-enolase (Marcus et al., Electrophoresis 21: 2622\u20132636 (2000)). However, in the latter attempt the method failed, and the authors expressly concluded that the low binding affinity between the antibody and the phosphopeptides makes the detection of phosphorylation sites almost impossible (Id. at p. 2635). The prevailing view (enunciated by Marcus et al.) that phosphospecific antibodies are not generally suitable for isolating phosphopeptides has recently been reiterated in a review on protein phosphorylation analysis authored by recognized leaders in the field of biological mass spectrometry. Mann et al., Trends in Biotech. 20: 261\u2013268 (2002)., 334604=J. Biol. Chem. 273: 19929\u201319932 (1998), and Caspase-9 (Cardone et al., Science 282: 1318\u20131321 (1998)) indicate that Akt phosphorylates its substrates only at a serine or threonine in a conserved motif characterized by arginine at positions \u22125 and \u22123.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations This demonstrates the method of the invention can be used to identify tyrosine kinases that are abnormally activated in cancer cells as well as their substrates, including other protein kinases and adaptor proteins. About one-third (56 of 156) of the phosphotyrosine peptides found in this sample originated from proteins with well-documented roles in T cell receptor signaling. Among these were the tyrosine kinases ZAP70 and Lck, which are activated by T cell receptor stimulation. Six tyrosine phosphorylation sites were found in ZAP70, including Tyr-493 in the activation loop, and three sites were found in Lck, including the activation loop site Tyr-394. All the tyrosine phosphorylation sites found in ZAP70 and Lck have been reported previously. Phosphorylation sites in the activation loops of two other tyrosine kinases and three serine/threonine kinases were also found: the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4 and the cytoplasmic Fer tyrosine kinase, as well as activated serine/threonine kinases p38 MAP kinase, GSK3 alpha, and PRP4. In addition, many phosphotyrosine-binding adaptor proteins involved in signal propagation were identified as tyrosine phosphorylated, including p62dok1, NCK, SHC, SHP2, and the phospholipase C gamma 1 and gamma 2 isoforms.
