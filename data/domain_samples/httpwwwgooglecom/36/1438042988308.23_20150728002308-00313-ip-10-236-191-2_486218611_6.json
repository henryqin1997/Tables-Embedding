If it is necessary to service portions of the vehicle which require removal of the bulkhead 20 and platform 18 is should be noted that the speed control mechanism can be disconnected from the speed regulator simply be removing the plug 132 from the keyhole slot 130 and by then moving the enlarged portion 128 of the cable 124 downwardly until it can pass through the enlarged portion of the keyhole slot. The operator's platform and forward bulkhead can now be removed without further disassembling of the speed control mechanism. As the fitting 126 engages the sheath 122 of the cable assembly there is no movement between these parts and therefor adequate protection against dust, noise, etc. can easily be maintained. In normal operation the hand lever 26 is set for the desired engine operating speed. If it were moved from the idle position shown in full lines in FIG. 2 to the maximum speed shown in broken lines in FIG. 1 this would cause the shaft 28 to rotate and also to cause",
