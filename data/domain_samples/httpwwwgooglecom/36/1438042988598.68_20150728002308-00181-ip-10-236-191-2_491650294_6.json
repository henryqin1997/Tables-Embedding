    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23210=All lifting slings elongate under heavy load to some degree, with slings made of polyester having greater elongation under load than a similarly rated sling composed of Kevlar or Aramid fibers. For example, a fourteen foot polyester sling load rated at 6,000 pounds may elongate up to five inches for a load approaching 6,000 pounds. Because elongation occurs under load, certain means for measuring or sensing the amount of elongation or any defects in continuity of the fiber core of a sling have been developed. Examples of such are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,719 to Franke, U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,572 to St. Germain, and U.s. Patent Publication No. 2006/0261617 to St. Germain, which disclose means comprising electrical circuits, optical fibers or exposed tell tails. Such systems may add significant costs to the slings and are subject to environmental degradation or operational damage., 20446=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/368,142, filed Mar. 3, 2006, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 7,422,256, issued Sep. 9, 2008.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is understood that equivalents and substitutions to certain elements set forth above may be obvious to those skilled in the art, and therefore the true scope and definition of the invention is to be as set forth in the following claims. In the event the load exceeds the sling safe load value, the sling cover 14 and core 11 elongate excessively, the slack in the frangible indicator member 43 is taken up and the frangible indicator member 43 breaks, and the second jacket 45 and the first jacket 44 are pulled apart to expose the warning marker 46 to the operator. When the load is removed, the second jacket 45 will again cover the warning marker 46, but the broken frangible indicator member 43 will show upon inspection that the safe load value for the sling 14 has been exceeded and therefore the sling 14 should not be re-used. Thus, this embodiment provides both a real-time and a permanent indication of overload. . FIGS. 5 and 6 A first sleeve-like jacket member 44 encircles the first web member 41, the lifting sling cover 14 and the load bearing core 11, and is affixed to the lifting sling cover 14 and load bearing core 11 by suitable fastener means 24, such as by stitching. The first jacket member 44 is sized so as to terminate without covering the frangible indicator member",
