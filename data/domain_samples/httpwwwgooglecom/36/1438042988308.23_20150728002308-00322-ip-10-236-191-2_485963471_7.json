The scope of our invention may be determined from the following claims. FIGS. 14C-14E illustrate that this system can be used to perform coronary arteriography (FIG. 14C); perform selective coronary arteriography (FIG. 14D); and transmit hydraulic pressure (FIGS. 14E) depending upon the presence or absence of the dilatation system within the channel of the guiding catheter and depending upon the location of the guidewire relative to the dilatation system. This system permits the performance of all three of these functions with a particularly low-profile device. Additionally, the hydraulic pressure is conducted largely by the lumen 218 of the guiding catheter 216. Given the relationship between hydraulic performance and hydraulic channel dimensions, this system permits the construction of a high performance, highly steerable, ultra-low profile telescoping angioplasty system. FIG. 14D illustrates the appearance of the overall system following introduction of the dilatation catheter system. The shaft of the dilatation catheter forms a seal with the two polyimide sleeves disposed within the proximal and mid-portions of the guiding catheter lumen 218. The fenestrations in the dilatation catheter shaft 110 permit direct communication between the multi-purpose perfusion channel 266 and the multi-purpose hydraulic channel 64 of",
