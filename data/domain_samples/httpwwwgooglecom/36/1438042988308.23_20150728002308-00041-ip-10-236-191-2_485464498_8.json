As such, the invention is not limited to only the above described embodiments. Rather, it is recognized that one skilled in the art could conceive alternative embodiments that fall from the scope of the invention. As color requirements change, the inks can easily be rinsed out and replaced with a new custom set. The product set could be enhanced by options to include more than one multi-color printhead (which allows for more colors than the number of printheads for which space is available in the printer), complete with ink and electronics support, to keep the customer up-and-running with multiple custom configurations. As described above, multiple multi-color printheads could be added to increase output speed. Also, specialized spot color printing would be possible by selecting a specialty ink such as translucent or light scattering material. This could allow a \u2018high-fi color\u2019 printing capability without the costs associated with using many single-color printheads. Wider printheads result in faster speed; however, a printhead width could nonetheless be divided into many sections (e.g. 8 sections) and still result in a competitive printing speed, with much higher color resolution as a result of the advantages noted above. As acoustic ink printhead technology grows to produce wider heads, this technique would provide the opportunity to add many-more",
