The illustrated display is mapped such that each screen defines data window area DW, a soft key menu field MF, a screen title field TF, and a prompt/error field PF. The soft keys shown at 8a through 8f are aligned to respective segments of the screen field MF to allow the operator to associate options presented in the segments of the field MF with the respective adjacent soft key. Operator instructions, requests for operator data input and error messages may be presented in the prompt field PF. Data window DW allows other pertinent information to be displayed. A detailed description of the operation and control of the display is available from U.S. application Ser. No. 629,796 filed Dec. 19, 1990 entitled \"USER INTERFACE FOR A MAIL PROCESSING SYSTEM\" now abandoned and filed as Ser. No. 08/210,651 assigned to the assignee of the present application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations After the printout is accomplished, the Meter Activity Log registers are cleared, preferably, except for the most recent entry in order to compress the number of entries to allow reuse of the registers after the printing operation, block 710. It is believed preferable that the clearing of the Meter Activity Log take place automatically, but it will be appreciated that if desired the clearing operation may be placed under operator control as well. FIG. 7 illustrates the routine for printing the Meter Activity Log. In general it comprises retrieving the data from the nonvolatile memory partition at 400, block 700, and printing the Meter Activity Log in a desired format, block 705. As discussed in previously cited U.S. application Ser. No. 08/210,651, the operator can control printing of the Meter Activity Log using the keyboard-display 7 for printing in a similar manner to that discussed in conjunction with the printout of other journal information. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that when so constructed, the Meter Activity Log contains a history or archive of the activity taking place at a particular mailing machine in conjunction with each uniquely-identified meter that has been operated at that mailing machine. The information to be stored in the Meter Activity Log suitably includes information such as the ascending and descending register values pertaining to each unique meter by serial number and the date that postage was expended or refills",
