No. 6,522,391, issued on Feb. 18, 2003, entitled \u201cTHERAPEUTIC PROSTATIC THERMOTHERAPY\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 76863=Heat treatment according to the present invention preferably provides the urethra proximal tissues with a heat dose that is sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect, but which is low enough to avoid excessive undesired side-effects. For example, treatment according to the present invention provides at least an estimated minimum cumulative thermal dose of at least about 1500 equivalent 45\ufffd C. minutes (i.e., 25 equivalent 45\ufffd C. hrs.). More preferably, treatment according to the present invention provides at least about 2000 equivalent 45\ufffd C. minutes. Treatment according to the present invention preferably provides an estimated maximum cumulative thermal dose which does not exceed about 30,000 equivalent 45\ufffd C. minutes, and more preferably does not exceed about 20,000 equivalent 45\ufffd C. minutes, and yet more preferably does not exceed about 7000 equivalent 45\ufffd C. minutes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been described with an emphasis upon preferred embodiments, it will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that variations of the preferred embodiments may be used and that it is intended that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes all modifications encompassed within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. All of the references cited herein, including patents, patent applications, and publications, are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference. Although increasing the temperature in predetermined or specified steps is preferred, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment. For example, the control program may implement a slow ramping function from an initial temperature to a destination temperature. The initial temperature may be about 37\ufffd C. The destination temperature may be about 51\ufffd C. In order to implement the ramping function the temperature control program may actuate the electromagnetic energy source. The temperature sensor measures the tissue temperature. The temperature control program may sample and store values corresponding to the measured temperature. The control program may determine the rate of change of the temperature signal, i.e., by differentiating the temperature signal utilizing the stored values. The control program may compare the calculated rate of change to a desired rate of change. If the rate of change in temperature is greater",
