    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{43608=The constant portion of the probe represented by X1X2 . . . Xm has a prescribed base sequence and discriminates nucleic acid analyte base sequences that are complementary thereto by hybridization. Thus, the discriminating power extends for m bases, although the probe itself has a length of m+n bases. Preferably, m is an integer of 3 to 7 and n is an integer of 5 to 8. For example, when m is 3, 4 or 5 and n is limited to 7, 6 or 5 respectively, the length of the probe itself will be 10 bases, and estimation of the Tm by the aforementioned 2+4 method gives Tm=20-40\ufffd C. Consequently, the Tm falls in a range that is sufficiently practical for a thermo-cycled polymerase reaction. Moreover, the probe synthesis will only require about 64, 256 or 1024 different types, respectively., 44478=When degenerate oligonucleotide probes are actually used, however, only a small portion of the probe mixture has a base sequence completely matching the nucleic acid analyte at the variable portion of N1N2N3 . . . Nn. For example, when n=6, the probability of a probe with the desired base sequence is 1 out of 4096. This raises a number of problems involving, specifically, (1) whether or not an adequate amount of completely matching probes can be guaranteed for the thermo-cycled polymerase reaction, (2) whether or not mismatching of probes other than completely matching probes will affect the analysis results, and (3) possible reduced reaction efficiency in the thermo-cycled polymerase reaction with the nucleic acid analyte due to primer-dimer formation between probes. It has also been pointed out that short base length probes may not be suitable for sequencing (base sequence determination) because of the reduced discriminating power for complementary sequences when short bases sequences are used. Based on experimental results that will be presented in the Examples, a degenerate probe according to the invention is designed such that m is in the range of 3-5 and n in the range of 5-8. Thus, the total number of probes used will preferably be 64 for 3 bases, 256 for 4 bases and 1024 for 5 bases, and depending on the purpose (for example, for detection of 3-base repeats), only a portion thereof may sometimes be used as a subset. In any case, by allowing the degenerate probes to hybridize to complementary partial sequences contained in the nucleic acid analyte and using them as primers for a thermo-cycled polymerase reaction, a universally applicable gene analysis method can be realized. Because of the problems mentioned above, prior to this invention such approach had not been recognized by those skilled in the art as being applicable to gene analysis., 71093=A portion (2002 bases long) of the single-stranded \u03bbDNA prepared in the production example was used as a nucleic acid analyte, a combination of 256 different 4-base degenerate probes similar to those used in Example 1 (a constant portion of 4 bases and a variable portion of 6 bases: N1N2N3N4N5N6ATGC, etc.) were used in an attempt to determine the base sequence by the sequencing method of the invention. Before sequencing, it was first necessary to confirm the precision or reliability of the sequencing. SBH methods, including the present method, have a drawback of mismatching during hybridization, and even probes that are not fully complementary will hybridize with the nucleic acid analyte. This can pose a serious problem for sequencing., 60131=After amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, the excess primers and nucleotides were removed using ethanol precipitation and a spin column (G-50 Microcolumn), and the polymerase chain reaction product was purified. The resulting single-stranded nucleic acid had a base length of 2002, and its base sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. This nucleic acid was dissolved in distilled water as a nucleic acid analyte, and prepared to a concentration of about 100 ng/\u03bcl based on the OD value (A260) at 260 nm for use in the following experiment., 68279=Therefore, three kinds of degenerate probes with a different number of Ns, N1N2N3N4N5N6N7N8ATGC (SEQ ID NO: 8), N1N2N3N4N5N6ATGC (SEQ ID NO: 9) and N1N2N3N4ATGC (SEQ ID NO: 10), were prepared and used in a thermo-cycled polymerase reaction according to the protocol described in 1.1. Judging from the number of extension fragments theoretically predicted among this set (base lengths of 353, 393, 1254, 1404, 1478, and 1616) and the heights of the peaks, N1N2N3N4N5N6ATGC was found to be most advantageous from the standpoint of fewer excess extension fragments and more theoretically predicted extension fragments (FIG. 2A)., 75043=When the extension fragments corresponding to base lengths near base 650 and near base 1050 of the nucleic acid analyte are actually aligned in order of base length shortness, according to the Eulerian path-finding algorithm, the layouts shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 are obtained. Here, the portions without 3-base overlapping are shown to the right outside of the base-aligned groups. The 3-base overlap portions are successively matched up and the overlapping portions are read in order (from the 5\u2032-end to the 3\u2032-end, i.e. from left to right), so that the sequences described below can be predicted., 40045=FIG. 4 is a graphical illustration of a technique of sequencing the region near base No. 1050 of the nucleic acid analyte, according to the sequencing method of the invention. Sequencing is accomplished by reading the bases successively from left to right. The numerals in the illustration represent the actual measured base lengths of the extension fragments obtained from the extension reaction products using the respective probes., 72675=Next, the frequency of mismatching was examined for a 1000-base long extension reaction site from base length 100 to base length 1100 of the nucleic acid analyte. The results revealed 736 completely matching sites, 528 1-base mismatching sites and 196 2-base or more mismatching sites (with some overlapping sites; for example, one site had only one mismatch while another site had one complete match and one 1-base mismatch, etc.) The sites at which extension reaction occurred with complete matches and 1-base mismatches comprised about 96% of the total length. The sites at which extension reaction did not readily occur were sites such as, for example, TTTTTT and AAAAAA. Thus, it was demonstrated that for the specific base length portion mentioned above, an even higher proportion of complete matches or 1-base mismatches can be expected, giving a considerable degree of sequencing precision., 23355=A possible alternative is to use electrophoresis to carry out gene analysis according to the method described above. To this end the number of base of an oligonucleotide probe (i.e. the probe base length) must be no greater than 7, and preferably as small as about 3, 4 or 5. The number of possible probe combinations is 64 in the case of 3 bases, 256 in the case of 4 bases and 1024 in the case of 5 bases. If oligonucleotide probes of such short length are used, the method can be satisfactorily accomplished even using currently available electrophoresis apparatuses. However, since a hybridizable site appears on an average of once every 64 bases for a 3-base length, once every 256 bases for a 4-base lenght and once every 1024 bases for a 5-base length, multiple probe-complementary sites will be present when it is attempted to sequence nucleic acid analytes that are over 1 kb long using the aforementioned oligonucleotide probes, and this presents a problem that renders it unsuitable for methods employing DNA chips. Also, when such short oligonucleotide probes are used for polymerase reaction, the melting point of the double-stranded nucleic acid produced with the oligonucleotide probe as such and the annealing temperature onto the nucleic acid analyte are extremely low. The melting point Tm is calculated by one of the following equations according to three known methods., 79205=Since both of these sequences are actually included in the nucleic acid analyte (see SEQ ID NO: 3 in the Sequence Listing), sequencing was shown to be possible by the present method. The above base sequences are set forth as SEQ ID Nos: 13 to 16 in the Sequence Listing. Similar visual 3-base overlap sequencing was carried out from base 100 to base 1100, and a base length of 663 (66.3%) was actually determined., 73627=As the mismatch verification in 2.1 showed that sequencing of a nucleic acid analyte is actually possible by this method, sequencing was then undertaken for the portion from base length 100 to base length 1100 of the above-mentioned nucleic acid analyte. This was based on the \u201cEulerian path-finding algorithm\u201d method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication HEI No. 7-203998. Specifically, sequencing can be accomplished by measuring the lengths of the extension fragments containing the probe sequences (the base lengths according to electrophoresis), and aligning in order of length (from short to long) of the extension fragments.}",
