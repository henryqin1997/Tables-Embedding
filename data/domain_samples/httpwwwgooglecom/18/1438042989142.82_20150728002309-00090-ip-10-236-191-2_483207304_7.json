Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, wafer W is initially subjected to a processing step at a processing tool at step 200 (FIG. 2), then a tool identifier unique to the processing tool is stored in MES 340 (FIG. 3) along with a set of process parameters used at the tool (see step 205). At step 210, it is determined (either manually by the user or automatically by MES 340) whether another processing step is to be performed on wafer W before it is to be inspected. If so, the wafer is brought to another processing tool, and steps 200, 205 and 210 are repeated., 59194=A more detailed review procedure is thereafter carried out on the individual defect sites, such as imaging with imager 310 or scanning with SEM 360 to produce a relatively high-resolution image, which is then analyzed at step 515 to determine the nature of the defect (e.g., a defective pattern, at particle, or a scratch) and to classify the defect accordingly. The analysis and classification of the defects can be carried out, as by one of processors 320 and 370, using conventional pattern recognition techniques or using an automated technique as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser.

It is to be understood that the present invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. The present invention can be practiced by employing conventional materials, methodology and equipment. Accordingly, the details of such materials, equipment and methodology are not set forth herein in detail. In the previous descriptions, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific materials, structures, chemicals, processes, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it should be recognized that the present invention can be practiced without resorting to the details specifically set forth. In other instances, well known processing structures have not been described in detail, in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. The present invention is applicable to the inspection of any semiconductor wafer, and is especially useful for in-process inspection of semiconductor wafers during manufacture of high density semiconductor devices with submicron design features. The inventive semiconductor wafer inspection technique provides real-time information identifying the tools visited by wafers under inspection and the process parameters including tool parameters used at those tools, thereby facilitating investigation of the causes of defects and enabling effective corrective action to be",
