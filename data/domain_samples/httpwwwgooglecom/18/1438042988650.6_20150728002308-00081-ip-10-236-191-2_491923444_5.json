These phosphonates are available from Monsanto Chemical Company under the trademark DEQUEST\ufffd. Most preferably it is 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid or its salt (DEQUEST\ufffd 2010, available from Monsanto Chemical Co.). The chelating agent is present preferably from about 0.1 to 15 wt-% of the reactants. More preferably it is present at about 0.5 to 10 wt-%. The use of the chelating agent increases the life of the resin catalysts, and it significantly reduces the catalyst swelling., 49187=A series of reactions were performed using a 1.5:1 mole ratio of acetic acid to hydrogen peroxide to compare the use of homogeneous sulfuric acid catalysts with a heterogeneous sulfonic acid resin catalyst. The reactions took place at 75\ufffd F., the reaction time is indicated below in Table IV (actual time for batch reaction or residence time for continuous flow reaction) as is the reaction type and the proportion of the homogeneous sulfuric acid catalyst. The sulfonic acid resin catalyst was present in a packed column reactor. The resulting concentration of the product peroxyacetic acid for each reaction type is shown below in Table IV.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above discussion, examples, tables and data disclose and demonstrate the invention as it is currently understood by the inventors, the invention can take a variety of embodiments without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The invention is embodied in the claims herein and after appended. The product of the process of the invention results in significant and sanitizing kills of micro-organisms at typical use concentrations of temperatures for the peroxy acid material. The above specification, examples and data demonstrate that the use of a chelating agent in conjunction with the hydrogen-peroxide and carboxylic acid reactants protect the strong acid ion exchange resin catalyst bed from swelling and decomposition during reaction and produce a relatively stable peroxy acid composition. Further the data shows a significant increase in productivity of peroxyacetic acid due to the greater acid equivalent concentration using a continuous resin catalyzed reaction system.
