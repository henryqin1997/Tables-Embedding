These endotracheal tubes are readily available and may be purchased from Baxter, Incorporated through the Baxter Hospital Supply Division, 1955 Wehrle Drive, Williamsville, N.Y. 14221. Reference also may be had to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,244,362 and 4,063,561 which also illustrate the construction of an endotracheal tube; the disclosure of each of these patents is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. Thus, referring to FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,362, proximal adaptor 21, pilot balloon 19, and cuff 17 are illustrated., 38872=Suitable magnetic materials which may be used in magnet 20 are well know to those skilled in the art and are described, e.g., in \"Testing and Measurement of Permanent Magnets\" (Magnetic Materials Producers Association, 1717 Howard Street, Evanston, Ill., 1975); page 8 of this publication lists the composition of typical magnetic materials., 39243=In one preferred embodiment, magnet 20 is a rare earth magnet. As is know to those skilled in the art, a rare earth magnet is comprised of one or more rare earth metals such as, e.g., Samarium, Praseodymium, Cerium, Yttrium, Neodymium, and the like. Thus, by way of illustration, the magnet may be an alloy of Neodymium, Iron, and Boron which is commercially available as \"Rare Earth Magnets,\" Catalog Number 64-1895, Radio Shack, Fort Worth, Tex., 44235=Adaptor 14 preferably is an integral body which consists essentially of an inert plastic material. Any of the inert plastic materials know to those skilled in the art may be used. In one embodiment, adaptor 14 consists essentially of polycarbonate. As is know to those skilled in the art, most of the polycarbonate materials are based on a reaction between bisphenol A and carbonyl chloride. See, e.g., the \"Modern Plastics Encyclopedia,\" Mid-October 1990 issue, Volume 67, Number 11, Modern Plastics., 45223=Sensor 22 preferably is removably attached to the suprasternal notch 90 of the patient. The suprasternal notch, as is know to those skilled in the art, is the depression above the sternum; it is an external landmark that corresponds to the middle of the trachea. See, e.g., an article by R. D. Stewart et al., \"Correct positioning of an endotracheal tube using a flexible lighted stylet,\" Critical Care Medicine, 18(1): 97-9, January, 1990., 23131=The prior art has recognized certain limitations in the use of the \"TRACH-MATE\" system. Thus, in an article by Arthur Engler entitled \"Verifying Endotracheal Tube Placement With the TRACH MATE . . . Intubation System,\" appearing in Pediatric Nursing, July-August, 1989, Volume 15, No. 4 (at pages 390-392), it is disclosed that: \"Use of the TRACH MATE . . . endotracheal tube is contraindicated in cases in which the infant has metallic or magnetic objects or devices located near the trachea . . . . Special care should be used when magnetic resonance imaging . . . scans are needed on patients with the TRACH-MATE endotracheal tube in place. Image distortion of anatomical locations near the tube's magnetic marker in the trachea may occur.\" (at page 391)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the aforementioned description is illustrative only and that changes can be made in the apparatus, in the ingredients and their proportions, and in the sequence of combinations and process steps, as well as in other aspects of the invention discussed herein, without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. In another embodiment, applicant's claimed device may be utilized to exclude placment of the endotracheal tube within the patient's esophagus. In one embodiment, not shown, applicant's claimed device is modified to utilize several means for sensing magnetic flux's 22. This array of sensors 22 may be arranged over the thyroid cartilage of the patient; and they will assist in determining blind intubation position. Thus, with applicant's device, one may determine both the outer limits of placement of the endotracheal tube (c.f. the positions of FIGS. 15 and 17) as well as the optimum positioning of such tube (c.f. the position of FIG. 16). The magnet 20 is so disposed within the endotracheal tube 18 (normally within about 0.5 to about 2.0 centimeters of the tip of such tube) that it will preferably activate the indicator 32 when the tube is at the locations specified in the Figures. When the endotracheal tube 18 is pushed still further into the trachea, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the magnet is moved outside of the 2-4 centimeter activation distance,",
