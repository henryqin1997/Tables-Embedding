Medwick, Larry A. Miller and Gary J. Marietti., 44351=With continued reference to FIG. 2, a double metal layer reflective coating stack that is preferably used in the practice of the invention includes a zinc stannate film 58 on the air surface of a glass substrate 14 cut from a float glass ribbon; a zinc oxide film 60 on the zinc stannate film 58; a silver film 46 on the zinc oxide film 60; sputtered titanium metal film on the silver film 46, the titanium metal oxidizes to titanium dioxide film 48 during sputtering of the next dielectric film i.e. a zinc oxide film; a zinc oxide film 62 on the primer layer 48; a zinc stannate film 64 on the zinc oxide film 62 and a zinc oxide film 66 on the zinc stannate film 64; a silver film 52 on the zinc stannate film 64; a titanium metal film 54 deposited on the silver film 64 which is oxidized to titanium dioxide as previously discussed; a zinc oxide film 68 over the titanium oxide film 54 and a zinc stannate film 70 on the zinc oxide film 68. The coating stack 42 is of the type disclosed in published EPO Application No. 0 803 381 based on U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing discussion and test results are applicable for silicon oxynitride protective layers as well as silicon aluminum oxynitride layers. As can now be appreciated the invention is not limited to the above examples which were presented for illustration purposes only and are not limiting to the invention. The scope of the invention is defined in the following claims. It is preferred in the practice of the invention to have a silicon aluminum oxynitride protective layer in place of silicon aluminum nitride because silicon aluminum oxynitride is more resistant to chemical attack. A silicon aluminum oxynitride overcoat of approximately similar thickness as a silicon aluminum nitride overcoat provides a better protection for low-E coatings, and it is expected to provide similar protection for other types of sputtered coatings. In practice, in an in-line production coater one chamber may be dedicated to the deposition of the overcoat. In current magnetic sputter vacuum deposition coater designs, the deposition chamber may include up to three deposition bays with each bay including one or two targets. Therefore a total of up to six targets may be available for the deposition of the homogeneous, graded, or non-homogeneous protective layer of the invention. The following approach is provided as an example for depositing the graded oxynitride protective layer but is not limiting to the invention. Through three main gas manifolds, nitrogen flows into all chambers while a controlled flow of oxygen is",
