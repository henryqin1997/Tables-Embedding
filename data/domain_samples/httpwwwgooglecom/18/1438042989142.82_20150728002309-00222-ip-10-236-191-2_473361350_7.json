The absorbent structure comprises a microbial polysaccharide having a mean pore size of at least about 0.01 microns, desirably at least about 0.1 microns, more desirably from about 0.1 to about 500 microns, and even more desirably from about 0.1 to about 10 microns. In addition, the bulk density of the microbial polysaccharide of the present invention is from about 0.0001 to about 0.5 grams per cubic centimeter, desirably from about 0.001 to about 0.5, more desirably from about 0.005 to about 0.1 grams per cubic centimeter, and even more desirably from about 0.01 to about 0.05 grams per cubic centimeter. Further, the absorbency of the microbial polysaccharide is at least about 10 grams of aqueous saline solution (0.9 weight percent) per gram of polysaccharide, desirably from about 10 to about 100 grams of aqueous saline solution per gram of polysaccharide, and more desirably from about 20 to about 1000 grams of aqueous saline solution per gram of polysaccharide. In a specific aspect of the invention, the absorbent structure comprises a microbial polysaccharide which is microbial cellulose., 58236=Absorbent articles such as diapers, training pants, adult incontinence products and the like comprise a porous facing layer, an outer cover and an absorbent structure located between the facing layer and the outer cover. Specific embodiments of diapers and incontinence products are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,704,116 issued Nov. 3, 1987, to Enloe; No. 4,798,603 issued Jan. 17, 1989, to Meyer et al.; No. 4,710,187 issued Dec. 1, 1987, to Boland et al.; No. 4,770,656 issued Sep. 13, 1988, to Proxmire et al.; and No. 4,762,521 issued Aug. 9, 1988, to Roessler et al.; the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. The absorbent structure that is disposed between the porous facing layer and the outer cover may be the absorbent structure of the present invention. The absorbent structure may also comprise a means for containing the microbial polysaccharide. For example, the microbial polysaccharide may be contained by a nonwoven wrap sheet such as a sheet of tissue or of nonwoven fibers. Alternatively, the microbial polysaccharide may be incorporated into a fibrous matrix such as wood pulp fluff or extruded polymeric fibers. The microbial polysaccharide may also be adhered to a substrate or sandwiched between two substrates which are bound together at least in certain locations. Any means of containing the microbial polysaccharide in place are suited for use in the present invention. Alternatively, the microbial polysaccharide may be contained by the porous facing layer and the outer layer of the absorbent article., 79438=The samples are then subjected to supercritical drying by the following process. The samples are placed in a vessel of a continuous-flow pressure apparatus having a volume of 3 cubic centimeters and supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure of about 1400 pounds per square inch (100 atmospheres) and temperature of about 45 degrees Centigrade is flowed through the samples for approximately one hour. The vessel is then sealed to stop the flow of supercritical carbon dioxide and the pressure in the vessel is slowly released to the atmosphere over a period of approximately one hour while holding the temperature constant. The vessel is then opened and the samples of microbial cellulose are removed., 29791=This is a divisional application of copending application Ser. No. 08/241,117, filed on May. 10, 1994 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,241., 71117=The samples are then subjected to supercritical drying by the following process. The samples are placed in a vessel of a continuous-flow pressure apparatus, and supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure of about 1400 pounds per square inch (100 atmospheres) and a temperature of about 45 degrees Centigrade is flowed through the samples for approximately one hour. The vessel is then sealed to stop the flow of supercritical carbon dioxide and the pressure within the vessel is slowly released to the atmosphere over a period of approximately one hour while holding the temperature constant. The vessel is then opened and the microbial cellulose samples are removed., 42417=Processes for producing microbial polysaccharides, such as microbial cellulose, are well-known to those skilled in the art. In general, the process comprises aerobically incubating a quantity of nutrient medium comprising a polysaccharide-producing microorganism. For example, such processes for producing microbial cellulose in a static aerobic medium are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,378,431 issued Mar. 29, 1983, to Brown, Jr.; No. 4,588,400 issued May. 13, 1986, to Ring et al.; and No. 4,742,164 issued May. 3, 1988, to Iguchi et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. The microbial polysaccharide is generally formed on the surface of a static culture which is usually contained in shallow trays. In the alternative. microbial polysaccharides may be produced in a continuous cultivation process such as in a fermenter. Many well known processes are available for fermentations where fresh nutrient is continually added to the culture comprising the polysaccharide-producing microorganisms while depleted nutrient medium containing metabolic waste products and produced microbial polysaccharides are withdrawn. For example, such processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,929,550 issued May. 29, 1990, to Byrom; and British Patent No. 2 169 543 published Jul. 16, 1986, to Roberts et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference., 75350=The samples are then subjected to supercritical drying by the following process. The samples are placed in a vessel of a continuous-flow pressure apparatus, and supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure of about 1400 pounds per square inch (100 atmospheres) and temperature of about 45 degrees Centigrade is flowed through the samples for approximately one hour. The vessel is then sealed to stop the flow of supercritical carbon dioxide, and the pressure is slowly released to the atmosphere over a period of approximately one hour while holding the temperature constant. The vessel is then opened and the samples of microbial cellulose are removed., 83947=The samples are then individually subjected to supercritical drying by the following process. The samples are placed in the vessel of a continuous-flow pressure apparatus having a volume of approximately 28 cubic centimeters, an exit valve and an inlet valve. Liquid carbon dioxide at a pressure of about 955 pounds per square inch (65 atmospheres) and a temperature of about 25 degrees Centigrade is flowed through the samples for approximately 30 minutes to displace at least a portion of the ethanol. The vessel of the continuous flow pressure apparatus is then sealed by closing the inlet and exit valve and the pressure inside the chamber is raised to 1600 pounds per square inch (110 atmospheres) by heating the apparatus to a temperature above the critical temperature of carbon dioxide. The pressure is then slowly released to the atmosphere over a period of approximately one hour while holding the temperature constant. The samples of microbial cellulose are then removed from the vessel.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The samples of microbial cellulose are then subjected to the Free-Swell Capacity test (absorbency), the pore size test, and the bulk density test as described above. The average absorbency of samples without CMC is 11.18 grams of saline per gram of microbial cellulose. In addition, the average absorbency of samples with CMC is 14.12 grams of saline per gram of microbial cellulose. The microbial cellulose samples on the watch glasses are allowed to air dry for several hours. The samples are then placed in an oven at a temperature of approximately 95 degrees Centigrade for approximately 12 hours. The samples are then scraped from the watch glasses and weighed. Yields of between 6 and 22 milligrams (oven dry weight) of microbial cellulose resulted. The microbial cellulose samples are washed five more times with an excess of distilled water. The fleakers containing the samples in an excess of distilled water are returned to the water bath at a temperature of 28 degrees Centigrade and shaken in an orbital fashion at 100 revolutions per minute for approximately 5 days. The samples are then washed with an excess of reagent grade distilled water and the water is decanted. 400 milliliters of reagent grade distilled water is then added to the fleakers containing the microbial cellulose samples. The fleakers containing the samples are returned to the water bath at a temperature of 28 degrees Centigrade and shaken in an orbital",
