Further, under conditions of high Reynolds numbers (>2000), the boundary layer is receptive to \u201ctripping\u201d. Tripping is a process by which a small perturbation in the boundary layer amplifies to turbulent conditions. The receptivity of a boundary layer to \u201ctripping\u201d is proportional to the Reynolds, Re, number and is nearly zero for Reynolds, Re, numbers less than 2000., 19968=This application is a continuation application of pending U.S. application Ser.

No. 6,051,019., 24956=Selected organ hypothermia has been accomplished using extracorporeal perfusion, as detailed by Arthur E. Schwartz, M.D. et al., in Isolated Cerebral Hypothermia by Single Carotid Artery Perfusion of Extracorporeally Cooled Blood in Baboons, which appeared in Vol. 39, No. 3, NEUROSURGERY 577 (September, 1996). In this study, blood was continually withdrawn from baboons through the femoral artery. The blood was cooled by a water bath and then infused through a common carotid artery with its external branches occluded. Using this method, normal heart rhythm, systemic arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gas values were maintained during the hypothermia. This study showed that the brain could be selectively cooled to temperatures of 20\ufffd C. without reducing the temperature of the entire body. However, external circulation of blood is not a practical approach for treating humans because the risk of infection, need for anticoagulation, and risk of bleeding is too great. Further, this method requires cannulation of two vessels making it more cumbersome to perform particularly in emergency settings. Even more, percutaneous cannulation of the carotid artery is difficult and potentially fatal due to the associated arterial wall trauma. Finally, this method would be ineffective to cool other organs, such as the kidneys, because the feeding arteries cannot be directly cannulated percutaneously.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiment is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not as restrictive and the scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. In addition to the detailed description above, a myriad of alternate embodiments will be readily discernible to one skilled in the art. For example, the bellows sections may be made of flexible conductive or non-conductive material rather than metallic conductive material. In addition, a non-coaxial flow pattern may be used to transport the working fluid through the supply catheter. The working fluid may flow up the outer coaxial lumen and back down the inner coaxial lumen. In some cases, it may not be necessary to provide internal turbulence. In the embodiment above, turbulence was created using regular clockwise and counterclockwise invaginations on the exterior surface of the heat transfer element. However, other external surface configurations may create turbulent flow patterns. In addition, in some applications, it may be advantageous to attach a stent to the distal end of the heat transfer element. The stent may be used to open arteries partially obstructed by atheromatous disease prior to initiation of heat transfer. Further, the",
