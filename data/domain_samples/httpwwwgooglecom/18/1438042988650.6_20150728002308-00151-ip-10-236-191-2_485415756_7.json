In use, the technician simply places the smooth surfaced, inelastic, flexible, belt-like strip 2 on the patient's chest 27 and adjusts the positions of the marked location 5a over recording location V1 so the precordial electrode contacts 5 are over their proper recording areas, when present in the preferred embodiment, the marked location can be at either V1, V2, or V3. After fastening the elastic strip 9 to the clasp or buckle 10 on the free end of the belt-like strip 2, the movable precordial electrode contacts 19 are placed over their proper recording areas. The arm lead electrodes 3,4 are attached to the body in the usual manner and then connected to the male connector plugs 26 located on the free ends of the external flexible wire leads 8. The leg lead electrodes 23 are also attached to the body in the usual manner and then connected to the male connector plugs 26 located on the free ends of the flexible wire lower limb leads 16. The operator then applies an electrolyte conducting paste to the patient's chest 27 under each precordial electrode. Finally, the adapter/plug 13 or cable 12 is attached to the electrocardiograph machine 15 and",
