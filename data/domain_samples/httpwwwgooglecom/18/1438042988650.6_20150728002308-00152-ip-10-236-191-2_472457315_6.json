Signals on the AFEED line 344 are shaped and buffered by the inverting Schmitt buffers 388, 390 to generate signals on MATRIX IN line 392 for use by the matrix communications section 306. An inverted signal on AFEED line 344 is NANDed with the signal on NSDIR line 374 to deliver serial data to an addressable switch 394 having a memory which stores a unique identification code (also referred to herein as an address). An inverted signal on AFEED line 344 is also routed to the DATAIN line 396 for use by the receive/transmit ID slot data section 310. A high signal on the RCGND line 354, caused by the loss of the connection between the remote controller 54 and the local controller 214, is gated by NAND gate 398 to create a low reset signal which resets the addressable switch 394 and, thereby deactivates the drawer 98. In response to the receipt of appropriate input data (including a switch address) from AFEED line 344, via NAND gate 375, the addressable switch 394 outputs serial data to an inverting Schmitt buffer 400 which provides inverted serial data to a two line-to-one line, open collector multiplexor 402 comprised of NAND gates 404,406. Serial output data available from the addressable switch 394, upon receipt of appropriate input data, includes a unique identification code for the switch, data residing in the switch's memory, and the status of the switch's bi-directional port. Preferably, the addressable switch is a DS2405 from Dallas Semiconductor Corporation of Dallas, Tex. A MATRIX OUT line 408, from the matrix communications section 306, and the EN5V line 368, from the enable section 316, also connect to the multiplexor 402. Upon application of the appropriate SDIR and NSDIR signals 372,374 and EN5V signal 368, the multiplexor 402 selects serial data from either the MATRIX OUT line 408 (i.e., from the matrix communications section 306) or the addressable switch 394 and outputs the selected serial data on the BUSY line 332 for receipt by the parallel port section 300., 34450=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/003,429, filed Sep. 8, 1995.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Whereas this invention has been described in detail with particular reference to its most preferred embodiments, it is understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention, as described herein before and as defined in the appended claims. The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the claims below are intended to include any structure, material, or acts for performing the functions in combination with other claimed elements as specifically claimed. In accordance with an alternate preferred method of the present invention, the identification codes of the object identification assemblies 182,502 are loaded into the remote controller 54 for later use by receiving the assemblies 182,502 in the front face ID slot 112 of a drawer 98 and then by reading their identification codes. After reading, the identification codes are associated with descriptive information related to the object being controlled and tracked by the system 50. The remote controller 54, at step 658, reads the identification codes of the object identification assemblies 182 which are present in the drawer 98. To read the identification codes, the remote controller 54, as described above, scans the connectors 154,570 by selecting each connector 154,570 of each row and column matrix of connectors 154,570 and attempting to read output data, on BUSY line 332, from an electronic device 194 which may or may not be",
