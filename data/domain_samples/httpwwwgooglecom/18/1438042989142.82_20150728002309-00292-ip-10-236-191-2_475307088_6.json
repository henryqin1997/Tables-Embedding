All such variations which basically rely on the teachings through which the invention has advanced the art are properly considered within the scope of the invention. While the invention has been described with regard to packaging a particular semiconductor chip, it will be appreciated that the concepts can be utilized for any semiconductor chip having a high density of contact areas on a side (especially for those devices with a contact pad center-to-center spacing of 0.008 inches or less). In addition, the invention may be used for packaging hybrid integrated circuits or other electrical components. Furthermore, additional lead frames could be provided for certain needs. For example, a third lead frame functioning as a ground plane could be provided beneath the lower lead frame (12) shown in the figures. A third lead frame might also be provided to further reduce the center-to-center spacing of the leads. Strips of insulating material (see FIG. 2) which act as spacers, 18 and 19, can be placed on the lower lead frame of FIG. 3, before or after mounting the chip. However, in order to prevent possible damage to the chip, it is desirable to deposit the strips before mounting the chip. The upper lead frame of FIG. 4 is then oriented over the lower lead frame of FIG. 3 so that the leads of",
