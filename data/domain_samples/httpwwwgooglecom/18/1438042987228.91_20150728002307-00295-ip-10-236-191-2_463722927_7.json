    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been described for instructional purposes in order to illustrate the present invention, the present invention is not limited thereto. The definition of an autotransfer command for purposes of determining whether to execute a command without waiting for a communication from a microprocessor can be different from the specific definition used by the sequencer of the specific embodiment described. In some embodiments, some bits in the reserved fields of a command may be set and the command may nevertheless be considered an autotransfer command. Moreover, in some embodiments, a microprocessor may be interrupted more than two times for the execution of an autotransfer command. Although the specific embodiment of the CDB parsing state machine deparses fields of information into a set of transparent D-latches, other information storage devices may be used. The information storage devices in some embodiments are a plurality of microprocessor accessible registers which together comprise a first-in-first-out memory. In some embodiments, the SCSI interface portion is modular and can be realized on a single integrated circuit along with various other circuits. The processor may, for example, be integrated onto the same chip as the disk controller. In other embodiments, a disk controller integrated circuit operates in conjunction with two microprocessors external to the disk controller integrated circuit. Accordingly, various adaptations, modifications and substitutions of various of the features of the specific embodiments described can be practiced",
