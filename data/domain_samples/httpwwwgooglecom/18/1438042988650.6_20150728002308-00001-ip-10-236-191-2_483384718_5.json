A portion of the anode 12, the first and the second porous webs 40 and 42 proximate the anode, and the separator package 44 extend between the rectangular support 104. A gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane 106 fits tightly between the cell case 18 and the rectangular support 66. The membrane 106 extends across the air side 32 of the cathode 14 and allows passage of air to and from the cathode, but seals electrolyte within the cell case 18.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that the foregoing relates to particular embodiments of the present invention, and that numerous changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. Alternatively to the flat plate rigid support 22 shown in FIG. 3, the rigid support can comprise a rectangular sheet with a plurality of pin holes substantially evenly distributed across the rigid support for releasing gas from the anode, or a rectangular sheet of rigid material having a network of channels running across the side of the rigid support that faces the current collector to provide a flow path for the release of gas from the anode. In addition, the rigid support can comprise a mechanical spring to exert force against the anode 12 and keep the current collector 24 contiguous with the anodic layer 20. For example, the rigid support can comprise a bowed sheet of rigid material that functions as a mechanical spring. When the bowed support is substituted for the flat rigid support 22 shown in FIG. 3, the convex side of the bowed support faces the current collector 24 and the bowed support is compressed so as to be substantially flat as the rigid support 22 is shown in FIG. 3. The rigid support 22 could also include a rectangular rigid plate with a plurality of contoured tabs extending out the plane of",
