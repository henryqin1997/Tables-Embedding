In some such biopsy systems, a guide cube and positioning grid plate may be used. The guide cube may be selectively located within an opening in the grid plate. The guide cube may include guide holes to receive a portion of the probe and/or other components, for example a needle, cannula, obturator, or combinations of these or other components. With the guide cube inserted in the grid plate, the probe or other components can be guided through a selected guide hole of the guide cube to arrive at a desired biopsy site. The desired biopsy site may or may not have been identified and/or targeted by one or more of the guidance approaches mentioned above. In some situations, it might be desirable to provide a guide cube with features that improve a guide cube's use with one or more positioning grid plates.

The disclosure of each of the above-cited U.S. patents and U.S. patent application Publications is incorporated by reference herein., 70843=Another component that may be used with probe (91) (or needle (90)) is depth stop (95). Depth stop may be of any suitable configuration that is operable to prevent cannula (94) and obturator (92) (or needle (90)) from being inserted further than desired. For instance, depth stop (95) may be positioned on the exterior of cannula (94) (or needle (90)), and may be configured to restrict the extent to which cannula (94) is inserted into a guide cube. It should be understood that such restriction by depth stop (95) may further provide a limit on the depth to which the combination of cannula (94) and obturator (92) (or needle (90)) may be inserted into the patient's breast. Furthermore, it should be understood that such restriction may establish the depth within the patient's breast at which biopsy device (14) acquires one or more tissue samples after obturator (92) has been withdrawn from cannula (94) and needle (90) has been inserted in cannula (94). Exemplary depth stops (95) that may be used with biopsy system (10) are described in U.S. Pub. No. 2007/0255168, entitled \u201cGrid and Rotatable Cube Guide Localization Fixture for Biopsy Device,\u201d published Nov. 1, 2007, and incorporated by reference herein as mentioned previously., 73334=By way of example only, biopsy device (14) may be configured and operable in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pub.
