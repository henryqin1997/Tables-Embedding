In particular, it is contemplated that a radioactive material other than an iridium material may be used as a radiation source. It is further contemplated that many commercially available radially expandable medical devices such as wire baskets may be modified to attach a radiation source about the expandable portion thereof for providing a radiation treatment to a body passageway and, in particular, preventing intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle proliferation which causes stenosis or restenosis of a blood vessel passageway. Although described as being particularly applicable to the vascular system using well-known percutaneous insertion techniques, it is contemplated that the minimally invasive device is applicable for providing treatment to the pulmonary system as well as the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of the biliary and urinary system are also contemplated with expandable medical devices such as wire baskets, particularly adapted with the radiation source for treating the particular anatomical system. FIG. 11 depicts minimally invasive medical device 46, which represents yet another embodiment of the invention. The device includes expandable wire basket portion 47 and radiation source 48 in the",
