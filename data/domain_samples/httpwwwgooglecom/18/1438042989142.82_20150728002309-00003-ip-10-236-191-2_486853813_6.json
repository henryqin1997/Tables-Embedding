As a result, the set of subsequent ATM cells 24, 25 shown in FIG. 5 are received and rebuilt as conventional ATM cells 2. Then, either the end delimiter 27 is detected or the start delimiter 26 of the next set of subsequent ATM cells 24, 25 is detected. In both cases, the end of the current set of ATM cells 24, 25 is reached. In this case, the method shown in FIG. 7 has to be processed four times. In the first loop, the start delimiter 26 is detected and, therefore, the received current header portion 7 of the first ATM cell 24 of the set of subsequent ATM cells 24, 25 to be received is stored according to step 36. Then, this current header portion 7 and the current data portion 8 is received and used as conventional ATM cell 2 for further processing according to step 36. In the subsequent three loops, the previously stored header portion is used as the respective current header portions 7 of the ATM cells 25 according to step 38 and the previously stored header portion and the respective current data portion 8 of the",
