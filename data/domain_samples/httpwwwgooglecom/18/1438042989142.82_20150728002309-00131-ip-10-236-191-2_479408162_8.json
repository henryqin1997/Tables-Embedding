No. 6,113,002., 38371=In a preferred development of the invention, the jet or spray disk can be made from a halogen-free thermoplastic with a dimensional stability up to 100\ufffd C., preferably up to 120\ufffd C., e.g. of polyoxymethylene or polypropylene. Its modulus of elasticity is between 800 and 1600 N/mm , preferably at approximately 1200 N/mm , and is considered advantageous for the design and use of the jet disk in a shower device. These plastics can be produced with a very smooth surface, which makes it difficult for deposits to form and facilitates the removal thereof by a snapping round process according to the invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As a result of the jump processes, lime and other deposits at the jet disk holes 31, 35 are blown off and removed. Thus, in a preferred construction of the invention, a head shower forms the shower device 11 and has a flexible, press-in jet disk 28 with an outward curvature. The jet disk is mounted by a film hinge formed by a material weakening 29 in a flange 27 of a pipe section 23 in the head shower casing 12. As a result of the construction of the curvature and the mounting, by applying a pressing in force to the contact surface 32, the jet disk can be pressed inwards in a jump process. After removing the force, it jumps back automatically in a further jump process to the starting position and in each case the force maximum is passed. It is important for the course of the force curve to have at least four sections. At least two sections are provided for the movement process of the jet disk 28 on springing in and out. They are linked at the origin and at the end point of the maximum deflection and are interrupted by the snapping round point 40 and snapping back point 41. It is important that the force in the snapping in point 40 is above the force in the snapping back point 41. Despite the precise details concerning the force and",
