    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86613=Example 10A: The chlorination of the fatty acid and C36 dicarboxylic acid was carried out as follows. After the 500 mL reactor was cooled to room temperature, 87.8 g (0.31 mole) Pamak\ufffd-131 fatty acid mixture (Hercules Incorporated, Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.) and 353.1 g (0.62 mole) Unidyme\ufffd-14 C36 dicarboxylic acid (Union Camp Corp., Wayne, N.J., U.S.A.) were added to the reactor. At this point, the reactor was placed under a static nitrogen blanket instead of a nitrogen gas sweep, i.e., the nitrogen gas flow was stopped. The reactor containing the two liquid components was then heated using a recirculating mineral oil bath set at 70\ufffd C. After the temperature of the reactants had reached 65\ufffd C., 67.8 mL PCl3 (1.574 g/mL, B.P. 76\ufffd C., Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.A.) was loaded into the addition funnel and added to the mixture over a period of 30 minutes. vigorous evolution of HCl was noted, particularly at the beginning of the PCl3 addition, but little or no exotherm was measured. Fifteen minutes after the addition of PCl3 was complete, the stirrer was stopped. After ten minutes of settling, 29.9 g of phosphorous acids, a byproduct of the chorination reaction, were drained from the bottom of the reactor. Small amounts of phosphorous acids were removed each hour over the next four hours, with a total of 35.4 g phosphorous acids being removed. Finally, excess unreacted PCl3 was removed on a rotary evaporator (vacuum pump pressure, 60\ufffd C.) over a 2-hour period. 453.7 g of acid chloride reaction product were isolated, a yield of 97.9%. An I.R. spectrum for the isolated reaction product showed a characteristic acid chloride absorbance at 1800 cm-1., 71851=An evaluation as internal sizing agents of a 2-oxetanone ketene dimer size made from oleic acid (generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I), with a comparison to an AKD commercial size made from a mixture of palmitic and stearic acids (generally as described in Example 1), was carried out on a high speed commercial fine paper machine (3000 ft/min (914 m/min), 20 tons (18.2 mtonnes) of paper produced per hour, 15 lbs./1300 ft2 (6.8 kg/121 m2)). A typical forms bond paper making stock similar to that used in the Experimental Procedures I was used. Addition levels of the two internal sizing agents were adjusted to give comparable levels of HST sizing (20-30 seconds, 85% reflectance, Hercules Test Ink #2). No deposits were observed on the paper machine., 44494=Preferably the surface sized paper according to the invention is capable of performing effectively in tests that measure its convertibility on state-of-the-art converting equipment and its performance on high speed end-use machinery. In particular, the paper according to the invention, that can be made into a roll of continuous forms bond paper having a basis weight of from about 15 to 26 lbs./1300 ft2 (6.8 to 11.8 kg/121 m2), more specifically about 17 to 22 lbs./1300 ft2 (7.7 to 10 kg/121 m2), and that is surface sized at an addition rate of at least about 0.05 pounds/ton (0.025 kg/mtonne), is capable of running on the IBM Model 3800 high speed, continuous-forms laser printer without causing a rate of billowing in inches of increase per second\ufffd10,000 greater than about 10 to 20., 96764=In addition to the surface sizing agents utilized in the size press, an internal sizing agent was also used: alkenyl ketene dimer (as described above) was added at the wet end of the papermaking machine, at usage levels of 0.1-0.15 wt %, based on the weight of dry sized paper., 95964=The four ketene multimers were prepared from Pamak\ufffd-131 fatty acid and azelaic acid mixtures having the following molar ratios of fatty acid component to dicarboxylic acid component: 2.5:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4. The procedure used to make the ketene multimer mixtures was similar to that described in Example 10., 76724=Two samples of 2-oxetanone-based dimer sizing agents were prepared for evaluation as internal sizing agents respectively from oleic acid and Pamak\ufffd-1 fatty acid by known methods, generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. Sizing emulsions were prepared from both sizes. Forms bond paper samples internally sized respectively with the Pamak\ufffd-1 fatty acid-based dimer size and the oleic acid-based 2-oxetanone dimer sizing agent were made on a commercial fine paper machine (approximately 3000 ft/min (914 m/min), 16 lbs./1300 ft2 (7.3 kg/121 m2), 5 lbs./ton (2.5 kg/mtonne) alum, 10 lbs./ton (5 kg/mtonne) quaternary amine substituted starch). Forms bond paper sized with a commercial AKD (prepared from a mixture of palmitic acid and stearic acid) sizing emulsion was also made as a control. The addition level of each sizing agent (See Table 6) was adjusted to give comparable levels of HST sizing at the reel (70% reflectance, Hercules Test Ink #2)., 53222=A general procedure for preparation of a 2-oxetanone ketene product on a laboratory scale from a monocarboxylic fatty acid and a dicarboxylic acid, such as azelaic acid or a fatty acid dimer acid, is as follows. The mole ratio of monocarboxylic fatty acid component to dicarboxylic acid component is selected depending on whether a predominance of ketene dimer or a predominance of ketene multimer is desired. For ketene multimers with an average n of from about 1 to 6, a preferred mole ratio of monocarboxylic fatty acid to dicarboxylic acid is from about 1:1 to 1:4., 59648=A 35-minute roll of paper from each paper making condition was collected and converted on a commercial forms press to two boxes of standard 8 1/2\"\ufffd11\" (21.6 cm\ufffd27.9 cm) forms. Samples were also collected before and after each 35 minute roll for natural aged size testing, basis weight (20 lbs./1300 ft2 (9.1 kg/121 m2)), and smoothness testing., 56863=A sizing agent emulsion of a ketene multimer (or dimer) may be prepared by admixing 880 parts of water, 60 parts of cationic corn starch and 10 parts of sodium lignin sulfonate. The mixture is adjusted to pH of about 3.5 with sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture is heated at 90\ufffd-95\ufffd C. for about one hour. Water is then added to the mixture in an amount sufficient to provide a mixture of 1750 parts (total weight). About 240 parts of the ketene multimer (or dimer) is stirred into the mixture together with 2.4 parts of thiadiazine preservative. The resulting premix (at 65\ufffd C.) is homogenized in one pass through an homogenizer at 3000 p.s.i. The homogenized product is diluted with water to a ketene multimer (or dimer) solids content within the range of about 6% to about 30% to form a sizing agent emulsion; it should be understood that the precise solids content of the sizing agent emulsion is not critical., 54702=Confirmation that acid chlorides are formed in the reaction product made by this procedure may be obtained by IR determination of the presence of a characteristic acid chloride absorbance at 1800 cm-1., 97581=Three of the ketene multimers (2.5:1, 1:1, 1:2 fatty acid: diacid ratios) provided sizing differences, at a 0.005 wt % addition level, that were comparable to the alkenyl ketene dimer surface sizing agent control (at 0.005 wt %) and the styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer surface sizing agent control (at 0.05 wt %). The same three ketene multimers, at a 0.025 wt % usage level, provided sizing efficiencies that were comparable to the alkenyl ketene dimer sizing agent control (at 0.025 wt %) and styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer sizing agent (at 0.15 wt %). The ketene multimer with the 1:4 fatty acid to diacid ratio provided smaller, but still significant, increases in sizing efficiency at the reel., 65023=The materials tested gave a better balance of sizing and converting performance (less billowing at the same level of sizing) than either of the commercial ASA or AKD sizing agents used as controls. The best balance of sizing and handling performance was obtained with a 2-oxetanone dimer size prepared from Pamak\ufffd-1 fatty acid (a mixture comprised primarily of oleic and linoleic acid) and a 2-oxetanone multimer prepared from a 2.5:1 mixture of oleic acid and sebacic acid, both prepared generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. Both sizing agents gave levels of sizing comparable to that obtained with the ASA and AKD controls. Both sizing agents gave paper with better runnability on the IBM 3800 laser printer than the paper sized with either the ASA or AKD standards., 41531=The mole ratio of the fatty acid component to the dicarboxylic acid component in the reaction mixture of such components used to form the multimers is preferably from about 4:1 to about 1:5, more preferably from about 2.5:1 to about 1:4 and most preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:3. Representative examples of such surface sizing agents include 2-oxetanone multimers formed from a mixture of oleic acid and sebacic acid at a mole ratio of about 2.5:1, and 2-oxetanone multimers prepared from a mixture of Pamak\ufffd-1 fatty acid and azelaic acid at a mole ratio of about 2.5:1. Preferred examples are 2-oxetanone multimers prepared from mixtures of Pamak\ufffd-131 and azelaic acid having mole ratios of from about 1:1 to about 1:4., 74066=An evaluation as internal sizing agents of oleic acid 2-oxetanone ketene dimer size (prepared generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I), with a comparison with an AKD commercial standard size prepared from a mixture of palmitic and stearic acid (generally as described in Example 1) was carried out on a commercial paper machine producing a xerographic grade of paper (3100 ft/min (945 m/min) , 18 lbs./1300 ft2 (8.2 kg/921 m2)). As in Example 5, addition levels of each sizing agent were adjusted to give comparable levels of HST sizing after natural aging (100-200 seconds of HST sizing, 80% reflectance, Hercules Test Ink #2). No deposits were observed on the paper machine. The paper produced with oleic acid 2-oxetanone size ran without any jams or double feeds on a high speed IBM 3825 sheet fed copier (no double feeds in 14,250 sheets). Paper prepared with the AKD controls had a much higher rate of double feeds on the IBM 3825 (14 double feeds in 14,250 sheets)., 98307=The results for the first three ketene multimers (2.5:1, 1:1, 1:2 fatty acid (FA) to diacid (DA) ratios) indicated that at a given usage level, these ketene multimer surface sizing agents are 6-10 times more effective than a conventional surface sizing agent, the styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer, used as a control., 45349=Further, the preferred surface sized paper according to the invention, that can be made into sheets of 8 1/2\ufffd11 inch (21.6 cm\ufffd27.9 cm) reprographic cut paper having a basis weight of about 15-26 lbs./1300 ft2 (6.8-11.8 kg/121 m2) and is surface sized at an addition rate of at least about 0.05 pounds/ton (0.025 kg/mtonne), is capable of running on a high speed laser printer or copier without causing misfeeds or jams at a rate of 5 or more in 10,000. The preferred paper according to the invention, having a basis weight of about 15-26 lbs./1300 ft2 (6.8-11.8 kg/121 m2), also can be converted to a standard perforated continuous form on a Hamilton-Stevens continuous form press at a press speed of at least about 1775 feet per minute (541 m/min)., 75166=A 2-oxetanone dimer sizing agent was prepared for evaluation as an internal size from oleic acid by known methods, generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. A sizing emulsion was then prepared from the oleic acid-based size by known methods, generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. Copy paper internally sized with the oleic acid-based 2-oxetanone sizing emulsion was made on a commercial fine paper machine (3100 ft/min (945 m/min), 40 tons (36.4 mtonnes) of paper produced per hour, 20 lbs./1300 ft2 (9.1 kg/121 m2), 10% precipitated calcium carbonate, 1 lb. of sodium chloride/ton of paper (0.5 kg/mtonne) added at the size press). Copy paper sized with a standard AKD (prepared from a mixture of palmitic acid and stearic acid generally as described in Example 1) sizing emulsion was also made as a control. The addition level of each sizing agent was adjusted to give 50-100 seconds of HST sizing (1.4 lbs. (0.7 kg/mtonne) of standard commercial AKD, 1.9-2.1 lbs. (0.95-1.05 kg/mtonne) of oleic acid size per ton of paper, 80% reflectance, Hercules Test Ink #2)., 54934=Dehydrochlorination of the acid chlorides to form the desired 2-oxetanone ketene product is carried out in a reactor blanketed with nitrogen. About 1 part (by weight) triethylamine, base, typically representing a 5% molar excess of triethylamine, is added to about 2-7 parts (by weight) 1,2-dichloropropane solvent in the reactor with stirring, and both are heated to a temperature of about 30-40\ufffd C. About 1-3 parts of acid chloride reaction product in about one-half of that amount of 1,2-dichloropropane is added gradually to the reactor with stirring over about 40 minutes, while maintaining a temperature of about 40-45\ufffd C. Approximately two hours after the start of the addition of the acid chloride reaction product, completion of the dehydrochlorination reaction is confirmed with IR, and if the characteristic acid chloride absorbance is detected at 1800 cm-1, additional triethylamine may be added as necessary to complete the dehydrochlorination reaction., 69716=A series of Pamak\ufffd-1 fatty acid: azelaic acid 2-oxetanone multimers with fatty acid to dicarboxylic acid ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 3.5:1 were evaluated as internal sizes in a fourth set of experiments. These 2-oxetanone ketene multimers were prepared generally as described above in Experimental Procedures I. Paper for testing was again prepared on the pilot paper machine at Western Michigan University using the conditions described in the Experimental Procedures I. The performance parameters measured in these studies were: natural aged sizing efficiency and runnability on the IBM 3800 laser printer. Standard AKD and ASA sized paper were evaluated as controls. A summary of the results of these evaluations is given in Table 4., 46422=A further process according to the invention comprises running 8 1/2\ufffd11 inch (21.6 cm\ufffd27.9 cm) reprographic cut paper, having a basis weight of about 15-26 lbs./1300 ft2 (6.8-11.8 kg/121 m2), on a high speed, continuous laser printer or copier without causing misfeeds or jams at a rate of 5 or more in 10,000, preferably without causing misfeeds or jams at a rate of 1 or more in 10,000. By comparison, paper sized with standard AKD had a much higher rate of double feeds on an IBM 3825 high speed copier (14 double feeds in 14,250 sheets). In conventional copy-machine operation, 10 double feeds in 10,000 sheets is unacceptable. A machine manufacturer considers more than 1 double feed in 10,000 sheets to be unacceptable., 88400=The dehydrochlorination reaction was carried out as follows. After the 1 L reactor was cooled to room temperature, 440 mL 1,2-dichloropropane solvent (1.156 g/mL, B.P. 95-96\ufffd C., Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, N.Y., U.S.A.) and 115.2 mL (0.83 mole) triethylamine (0.726 g/mL, B.P. 88.8\ufffd C., Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.A.) were added to the reactor, the stirrer was started (150 r.p.m.) and the reactor contents were heated to 30\ufffd C. using a recirculating water bath. At this point, the nitrogen gas flow in the reactor was switched to a nitrogen blanket. A 235.4 g aliquot of acid chloride reaction product was then added to the addition funnel along with 110 mL 1,2-dichloropropane. The contents of the addition funnel were gradually added to the reactor over a period of 40 minutes. Stirrer speed, the temperature of the recirculating water bath, and the addition rate of the acid chloride reaction product were adjusted to control the exotherm and maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture between 40\ufffd-45\ufffd C. The stirrer speed was gradually increased from 150 r.p.m. to 400 r.p.m. over the course of the addition. Two hours after the start of the addition, the reaction was checked for acid chloride by I.R. Completion of the dehydrochlorination reaction is indicated when no acid chloride absorbance at 1800 cm-1 is observed. Additional triethylamine may be added to complete the reaction, as necessary., 85360=This Example describes the preparation of a mixture of 2-oxetanone multimer compounds from a mixture of fatty acids and a dicarboxylic acid at a mole ratio of 1:2 fatty acid to dicarboxylic acid. In Example 10A, the dicarboxylic acid was a C36 dicarboxylic acid, and in Example 10B, the dicarboxylic acid was azelaic acid., 24620=This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/601,113, filed Feb. 16, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,663, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/192,570, filed Feb. 7, 1994 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,685,815, issued Nov. 11, 1997., 47189=Another process according to the invention comprises converting the paper according to the invention into at least about 900 envelopes per minute, preferably at least about 1000 per minute., 93079=The dehydrochlorination reaction was carried out as follows. After the 1 L reactor was cooled to room temperature, 500 mL 1,2-dichloropropane solvent (1.156 g/mL, B.P. 95-96\ufffd C., Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, N.Y., U.S.A.) and 286 mL (2.05 mole) triethylamine (0.726 g/mL, B.P. 88.8\ufffd C., Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.A.) were added to the reactor, the stirrer was started (150 r.p.m.) and the reactor contents were heated to 40\ufffd C. using a recirculating water bath. At this point, the nitrogen gas flow was switched to a nitrogen blanket. A 280.8 g aliquot of acid chloride reaction product was then added to the addition funnel along with 133 mL 1,2-dichloropropane. The contents of the addition funnel were gradually added to the reactor over a period of 40 minutes. Stirrer speed, the temperature of the recirculating water bath, and the addition rate of the acid chloride reaction product were adjusted to control the exotherm and maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture between 40\ufffd-45\ufffd C. The stirrer speed was gradually increased from 150 r.p.m. to 400 r.p.m. over the course of the addition. Two hours after the start of the addition, the reaction was checked for acid chloride by I.R. Completion of the dehydrochlorination reaction is indicated when no acid chloride absorbance at 1800 cm-1 is observed, although acid anhydride absorbance at 1815 cm-1 can complicate this measurement. Additional triethylamine may be added to complete the reaction, as necessary., 105491=The ketene multimer was prepared from a reaction mixture containing Pamak\ufffd-131 fatty acids and azelaic acid in a 1:2 mole ratio. The procedure used to prepare the ketene multimer was similar to that described in Example 10., 82571=The papermaking procedures used to make paper for evaluation of surface sizing, toner adhesion and inkjet quality were generally similar to those described under Experimental Procedures I noted earlier. Paper was again prepared on the pilot paper machine at Western Michigan University. The paper had a basis weight of 20 lbs./1300 ft2 (9.1 kg/121 m2)., 46162=The invention also comprises the process of converting the paper according to the invention to a standard perforated continuous form on a continuous forms press at a press speed of from about 1300 to 2000 feet per minute (396 to 610 m/min)., 90901=Example 10B: The chlorination of the fatty acid and azelaic dicarboxylic acid was carried out as follows. After the 500 mL reactor was cooled to room temperature, 140.0 g (0.50 mole) Pamak\ufffd-131 fatty acid mixture (Hercules Incorporated, Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.) was added to the reactor and heated to a temperature of 70\ufffd C. At this point, the nitrogen gas flow in the reactor was switched to a nitrogen blanket. Next, 181 g (1.0 mole) 85% azelaic acid mixture, containing 15% other dicarboxylic acids of different chain lengths (E-1110 from Henkel Corporation's Emery Group, Gulph Mills, Pa., U.S.A.), were gradually introduced into the reactor with vigorous stirring (250 r.p.m.) over a three minute period. The solid dicarboxylic acid component formed a coarse dispersion with the liquid fatty acid component in the reactor, and the temperature dropped about 10\ufffd C. during the addition. After the temperature of the reactants reached 70\ufffd C., 108 mL PCl3 (1.574 g/mL, B.P. 76\ufffd C., Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.A.) was loaded into the addition funnel and added to the mixture over a period of 30 minutes. Vigorous evolution of HCl was noted, particularly at the beginning of the PCl3 addition, but little or no exotherm was measured. The dispersed dicarboxylic acid component dissolved during addition of the PCl3. Fifteen minutes after the addition of PCl3 was complete, the stirrer was stopped. After ten minutes of settling, 70.8 g phosphorous acids, a byproduct of the chorination reaction, were drained from the bottom of the reactor. Small amounts of phosphorous acids were removed each hour over the next three hours, with a total of 71.9 g phosphorous acids (104% of theoretical) being removed. Finally, excess unreacted PCl3 was removed on a rotary evaporator (vacuum pump pressure, 60\ufffd C.) over a 2-hour period. 349.6 g of acid chloride reaction product was isolated, a yield of 93%. An I.R. spectrum for the isolated reaction product showed a characteristic acid chloride absorbance at 1800 cm-1, with a small side band being observed at 1710 cm-1., 42277=For use as surface sizing agents for the more preferred alkaline fine paper, the mole ratio of the fatty acid component to the dicarboxylic acid component is preferably about 1:1 to about 1:5, more preferably about 1:1.5 to about 1:4, and most preferably about 1:2., 79456=A 2-oxetanone-based dimer sizing agent was prepared from oleic acid by known methods, generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. A sizing emulsion was then prepared for evaluation as an internal sizing agent from the oleic acid-based 2-oxetanone dimer sizing agent by known methods, generally as described above under Experimental Procedures I. Envelope paper internally sized with the oleic acid-based sizing emulsion and containing 16% precipitated calcium carbonate was made on a commercial fine paper machine in two basis weights, 20 lbs. per 1300 ft2 (9.1 kg/121 m2) and 24 lbs. per 1300 ft2 (10.9 kg/121 m2). Envelope paper internally sized with a standard commercial AKD (prepared from a mixture of palmitic acid and stearic acid) and a commercial surface sizing agent (0.5 lb./ton (0.25 kg/mtonne) Graphsize A) sizing emulsion was also made as a control. The addition level of each internal sizing agent was adjusted to give comparable levels of HST sizing at the reel (100-200 seconds, 80% reflectance, Hercules Test Ink #2).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is not intended that the Examples given here should be construed to limit the invention, but rather they are submitted to illustrate some of the specific embodiments of the invention. Various modifications and variations of the present invention can be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. Based on these results, ketene multimers are expected to be more efficient sizing agents than traditional polymeric surface sizing agents, without the toner adhesion problems associated with traditional ketene dimer sizing agents. Use of the ketene multimer as a surface sizing agent resulted in mixed but generally satisfactory toner adhesion, with very little difference in toner adhesion from that obtained with the untreated control. As expected, the polymeric (styrene/maleic acid copolymer) surface-sized paper provided good toner adhesion and the alkenyl ketene dimer surface-sized paper exhibited poorer toner adhesion. Increasing the level of internal size used in combination with the surface size tended to result in reduced toner adhesion. Results are summarized in Table 8 above, where photocopier toner adhesion values are reported in the last column. Toner adhesion on the sized paper was evaluated using an optical density method that measured the difference in optical density between black toner photocopied onto the front of the (uncreased) paper and the same black photocopied toner with a crack formed by creasing the paper (by folding and unfolding). Poor toner adhesion typically results in formation of a larger",
