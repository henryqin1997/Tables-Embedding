Many variations of the invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon review of this disclosure. Merely by way of example specific database relationships have been used for illustration, but the invention is not so limited. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents. ##SPC1## For most network configurations it will be useful to have multiple views of the network to represent functional groupings of network devices and to represent the network topology. Using the database model discussed above, one might want, for example, to depict devices in particular buildings, or a view that consists only of routers. Taking the example in FIG. 6A one might want to create a separate view for each subnet as well as separate views by type of device (routers, NFS servers, and print servers). A user would create these views one element at a time using a graphical user interface, which would then build the database elements discussed above. As an example, views grouping elements by function (software servers, routers, and print servers) and subnetwork(s) might be formed as shown in FIG. 6B. A high level view is shown in FIG. 6C. As shown therein, cloud icons represent the separate views that",
