    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. It should be understood that other types of systems could be utilized to control the current to the coils and hence the ion flux to provide the desired effect. For example, the system could be computer controlled, in which the coil power supplies could be controlled by a microcontroller (not shown) to which the cleaning could be accomplished via an iterative manner in which the walls are inspected on a periodic basis after application of the magnetic energy to the coils. Accordingly, the present invention utilizes a remote plasma source in conjunction with a DC magnetic field to concentrate plasma on certain areas of the plasma boundary and to inhibit the flow in other areas. Through this system a plasma reactor is provided in which ion distribution is modified to place the plasma energy in the appropriate location while also simultaneously diverting the plasma energy from the appropriate locations. In a preferred embodiment, this system is utilized to maximize cleaning efficiency by providing maximum plasma energy",
