    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82424=The SS7 database 30 contains call processing records relating to routing through the CCIS network. In the present embodiment, the database comprises a GTT translation table. For those GTT values that will be referred to the database 30, the table translates those GTT values into destination point codes in a manner similar to the translation in the STP. The tables in database 30, however, are more extensive and dynamic. For example, the table in database 30 may provide that one GTT translation varies as a function of time and/or day of the week. As a more specific example, a GTT might result in a translation for routing to ISCP 37 from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Mondays through Fridays and routing to SCP 27 at all other times., 67933=A detailed explanation of the SS7 protocol may be found in Bell Communications Research, \"Specification of Signaling System Number 7,\" Generic Requirements, GR-246-CORE, Issue 1, December 1994, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. A summary description of the most relevant aspects of SS7 appears below., 102905=The database 30 receives the TCAP query from the STP 15 and uses the global title value contained in that query to access the appropriate call processing record in its data tables. In the present example, assume that the caller has elected to use interexchange carrier A from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays and to use interexchange carrier B at other times, to take advantage of the lowest rate possible at different times. If the TCAP query message arrives at the SS7 database 30 within a time allotted to carrier A, then the database 30 translates the global title into the destination point code 255-201-104 for the end office 21 and returns that code together with a CIC code for carrier A to the STP 15. The STP 15 reformulates the IAM message to include the destination point code 255-201-104 and the CIC code for carrier A. The STP then forwards the IAM message, and call processing by the various network elements proceeds exactly as in the preceding example.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing has described what are considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the invention may be implemented in various forms and embodiments, and that it may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim all such modifications and variations which fall within the true scope of the invention. As another example, when a subscriber moves, rather than move call processing records from the ISCP of the former local exchange carrier to the ISCP of the local exchange carrier serving the customer's new residence, the dynamic signaling message routing of the present invention would route query messages from switching offices and an STP in the new local exchange carrier network to the ISCP of the former local exchange carrier. This could allow moving subscribers to effectively take customized telephone services, such as complex call screening lists, with them. One number follow-me type routing services, such as used for personal communications services, also would be portable from area to area and carrier to carrier. As another example, the dynamic signaling message routing capabilities also facilitate redundant implementation of the SCPs and ISCPs. If one fails, then only the data in the SS7 database needs to be modified to reroute query messages to a backup SCP or ISCP. For example,",
