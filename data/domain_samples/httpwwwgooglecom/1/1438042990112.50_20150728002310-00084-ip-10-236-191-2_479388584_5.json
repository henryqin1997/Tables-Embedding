Although this invention has been described in certain specific embodiments, many additional modifications and variations would be apparent to one skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that this invention may be practiced otherwise than is specifically described. Thus, the present embodiments of the invention should be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention to be indicated by the appended claims, their equivalents, and claims supported by this specification rather than the foregoing description. [0039] There are a number of possible configurations and the control thereof of coupling of light from a laser to the modulation unit and the light from the modulation unit to the optical output, some of which are describe above. These configurations compensate for errors in the fiber alignment and loosen the tolerances for the initial placement of parts. Additional configurations and controls to provide optimal coupling of the laser to the optical output are also described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/000,142 and 10/002,703, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and can be utilized to provide optimal coupling of the light from the laser to the optical output in accordance with the above",
