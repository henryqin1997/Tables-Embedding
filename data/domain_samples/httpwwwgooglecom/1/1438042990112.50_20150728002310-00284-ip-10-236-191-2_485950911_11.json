    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{185182=In some embodiments, the material forms slightly yellow network; includes a ratio (2:1 UV to thermal); has good mechanical properties; good adhesion; is highly chemical stability; and includes the following structure:, 178991=In some embodiments, the material can be mixed in a 2:1 ratio (UV to thermal); forms cloudy network (tetrol); has a high viscosity; forms a very strong adhesion; has very good mechanical properties; and includes the following structure:, 156467=In some embodiments, a PFPE epoxy-containing a PAG can be blended with between about 1 and about 5 mole % of a free radical photoinitiator such as, for example, 2,2-dimethoxyacetophenone, 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone, diethoxyacetophenone, combinations thereof, or the like. These materials, when blended with a PAG, form reactive cationic species which are the product of oxidation by the PAG when the free-radical initiators are activated with UV light, as partially described by Crivello et al. Macromolecules 2005, 38, 3584, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such cationic species can be capable of initiating epoxy polymerization and/or curing. The use of this method allows the PFPE diepoxy to be cured at a variety of different wavelengths., 114548=These fluoroelastomers include VITON\ufffd (DuPont Dow Elastomers, Wilmington, Del., United States of America) and Kel-F type polymers, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,408,878 to Unger et al. These commercially available polymers, however, have Mooney viscosities ranging from about 40 to 65 (ML 1+10 at 121\ufffd C.) giving them a tacky, gum-like viscosity. When cured, they become a stiff, opaque solid. As currently available, VITON\ufffd and Kel-F have limited utility for micro-scale molding. Curable species of similar compositions, but having lower viscosity and greater optical clarity, is needed in the art for the applications described herein. A lower viscosity (e.g., 2 to 32 (ML 1+10 at 121\ufffd C.)) or more preferably as low as 80 to 2000 cSt at 20\ufffd C., composition yields a pourable liquid with a more efficient cure., 69960=As would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) have been in use for over 25 years for many applications. Commercial PFPE materials are made by polymerization of perfluorinated monomers. The first member of this class was made by the cesium fluoride catalyzed polymerization of hexafluoropropene oxide (HFPO) yielding a series of branched polymers designated as KRYTOX\ufffd (DuPont, Wilmington, Del., United States of America). A similar polymer is produced by the UV catalyzed photo-oxidation of hexafluoropropene (FOMBLIN\ufffd Y) (Solvay Solexis, Brussels, Belgium). Further, a linear polymer (FOMBLIN\ufffd Z) (Solvay) is prepared by a similar process, but utilizing tetrafluoroethylene. Finally, a fourth polymer (DEMNUM\ufffd) (Daikin Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is produced by polymerization of tetrafluorooxetane followed by direct fluorination. Structures for these fluids are presented in Table I. Table II contains property data for some members of the PFPE class of lubricants. Likewise, the physical properties of functional PFPEs are provided in Table III. In addition to these commercially available PFPE fluids, a new series of structures are being prepared by direct fluorination technology. Representative structures of these new PFPE materials appear in Table IV. Of the abovementioned PFPE fluids, only KRYTOX\ufffd and FOMBLIN\ufffd Z have been extensively used in applications. See Jones. W. R. Jr., The Properties of Perfluoropolyethers Used for Space Applications, NASA Technical Memorandum 106275 (July 1993), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the use of such PFPE materials is provided in the presently disclosed subject matter., 150467=In some embodiments, a PFPE diepoxy can be cured through the use of photoacid generators (PAGs).

Specifically, for example, these photoacid generators can posses the following structure (Rhodorsil\u2122) 2074 (Rhodia, Inc):, 174709=In some embodiments, the material can be thermally cured in a two-component system, such as for example mixed in a 3:2 molar ratio, at about 100-about 130 degrees C.; forms tough, mechanically stable network; where the cured network is clear and colorless; and includes the following structure:, 183780=In some embodiments, the material includes ZDOL-TX, which can be mixed in a 1:1 ratio (epoxy to methacrylate); forms clear and yellow network; has strong adhesion properties; has good mechanical properties; and includes the following structure:, 136076=In some embodiments, articles and methods disclosed herein can be formed with materials that include materials end-capped with one or more aryl trifluorovinyl ether (TVE) group, as shown in the structure below. Examples of materials end-capped with a TVE group can be found in Macromolecules, 2003, 36, 9000, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These structures react in a 2+2 addition at about 150\ufffd C. to form perfluorocyclobutyl moieties. In some embodiments, Rf can be a PFPE chain. In some embodiments three or more TVE groups are present on a 3-armed PFPE polymer such that the material crosslinks into a network., 176158=In some embodiments, the material can be thermally cured in a two-component system, such as for example mixed in a 3:1 molar ratio, at about 100-about 130 degrees C.; forms mechanically stable network; where the cured network is clear and colorless; has high chemical stability; and includes the following structure:, 134277=According to some embodiments, articles and methods disclosed herein can be formed with materials that include phosphazene-containing polymers having the following structure.

The sheets were inserted into a two roll laminator having two 1\u2033 diameter rubber coated rollers 6\u2033 in length; one with a shore hardness of 30, and the other with a shore hardness of 70. The pattern on the laminate mold was facing the 30 durometer roller. The rollers were closed, thereby pinching the configured sheets at a pressure of 40 psig pneumaticaly driven by two steel cylinders of 1\u2033 diameter with 1 inch of the layers protruding beyond the exit side of the rollers. Approximately 1 mL of a UV-curable optical adhesive, Dymax 1180-M (DYMAX Corp. Torrington, Conn.), was placed between the two PET sheets at the nip point on the top of the rollers.
