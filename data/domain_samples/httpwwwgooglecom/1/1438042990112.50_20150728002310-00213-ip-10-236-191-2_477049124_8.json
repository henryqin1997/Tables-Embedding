    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 4 is a cross section showing how the height adjustment of the control ring 29 of the planet gear occurs. The representation of the planet gear corresponds in principle to that of FIG. 2. The cam disc 36 meshes with a set collar 42 via the toothed segment 41 and is rotatably supported in thechassis 1. Set collar 42 has an oblong groove or aperture 43 (not shown) into which a stopping nose 33 of the height adjustable control ring 29 locks, engages collar 42. The rotational movement of the cam disc 36 is transmitted to the stopping nose 33 via the set collar 42 and the operating element 43. Also, the planet wheels 26 are rotated via the clutch facing 30, to change the bell wheel 21 and the tumbler gear 4, which is affixed to the tumbler gear lever 22, to the desired mode of operation. The lever 27, is slidable moved by the threading motor 11, to adjust the height of the control ring 29 and change the clutch coupling. FIG. 3 shows the reversing of the rotational direction of the tumbler gear by means of a cam disc 36 driven by the threading motor 11. The tape 12 isdrawn out of the cassette 2 around the threading elements 8, 9 and 9a and placed around the head cylinder 16. The RI roll 10 urges the tape 12 onto the capstan shaft",
