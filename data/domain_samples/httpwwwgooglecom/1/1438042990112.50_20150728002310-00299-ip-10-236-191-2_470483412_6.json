Content data that is not available via interaction network 102 typically is not associated with an HTTP or FTP URL. Instead, cache manager 221 uniquely identifies a resource by employing a broadcast URL scheme such as the local identifier URL scheme (LID) (see Advanced Television Enhancement Forum (ATVEF) Enhanced Content Specification, 2000, http://www.atvef.com/library/ATVEF%20spec1\u20141a_Final.pdf) or DVB (see Digital Video Broadcasting Multimedia Home Platform, version 1.0.2, DVB BlueBook A057 Rev. 2, Feb. 26, 2002, http://www.mhp.org/technical_essen/pdf_and_other_files/a057r2.pdf). However, standard client software web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer do not support these URL types. The system described herein includes the translation of the broadcast URL for a received resource into a unique HTTP URL on client computer 110.}",

Since numerous modifications and variations will occur to those who review this disclosure, the system, method, and computer program product for collecting usage data to assist an advertiser with a targeted marketing activity is not limited to the exact construction and operation illustrated and disclosed herein. Accordingly, this disclosure intends all suitable modifications and equivalents to fall within the scope of the claims. [0049] Scheduling 267 periodically retrieves usage data from usage database 272 to help determine the schedule stored in broadcast schedule 275. [0048] Reporting 266 also sends similar reports upon request to advertiser 105 via Internet 104. If advertiser 105 and an operator of UBA server 260 cooperate, advertiser 105 may add a content category type to an advertisement. However, UBA server 260 will classify any advertisement not classified by advertiser 105. Advertiser 105 sends the resources to UBA server 260 via a secure connection and, alternatively, may have a contract with UBA server 260 to upload advertisements to the server. Advertiser 105 may request information related to the user group profiles however, the statistical information provided in response must not compromise the privacy of user 100. Advertiser",
