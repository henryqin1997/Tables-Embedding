For instance, the power source of the generator may not be the gasoline engine, or a fuel cell or the like may be used instead of the battery 10. Furthermore, although in the foregoing embodiments the battery 10 has been described as comprising two battery units, it is evident that another arrangement may be adopted. Moreover, the configuration of the changeover circuit 9 has been described by way of illustration, and a different configuration may be adopted. The power supply modes are not confined to the above-described four types, and a different arrangement may be provided. Additionally, the method of calculating torque and the method of determining the remaining amount of the battery are not restricted to those of the above-described embodiments, and conventionally known methods may be adopted. As is apparent from the foregoing description, in accordance with the present invention, in an electric motor vehicle in which a hybrid power source having a generator and a battery is mounted, the state of connection between the generator and the battery is switched over, as necessary, into parallel or series connection. Accordingly, it is possible to adopt a power supply mode optimally suited to the running condition persisting on each occasion, so that it is possible to compensate for the",
