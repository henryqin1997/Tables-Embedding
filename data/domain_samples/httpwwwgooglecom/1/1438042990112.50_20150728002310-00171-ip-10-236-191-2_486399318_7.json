The ratio by weight of the first component (polyol mixed with microspheres) to the second component (combination of the cross-linking element and the cross-linking agent) is desirably in the range of about 70% to 30% to about 65% to 35%. For producing the compressible layer 11, the weight ratio is desirably in the range of about 100:38 to 100:40. The blanket sleeve's desired characteristics of hardness, resilience, reboundability, solvent resistance, and mechanical characteristics can be tailored by changing the chemical structure of the two components.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A sleeve and/or cylinder with a layered structure of polyurethane material has been described together with methods for making same. However, these structures can also be composed only partially of this polyurethane material, in which case one of the layers 11 and 12 (for example the layer 11) is elastomeric natural rubber and the other layer (the layer 12) is of polyurethane material (or vice versa). The aforesaid method can be implemented automatically or largely automatically. However, it may be economically more desirable to effect the manual manipulation of the sleeve rather than machine handling of the sleeve, for surface grinding of the layers 11 and 12. Other variants of embodiments of the invention can be defined in the light of the present text. For example, instead of forming the polyurethane layers 11, 12 on the surface of cylindrical portion 6 to form a blanket sleeve 3, these polyurethane layers 11, 12 may just as easily be formed on the outer surface of a cylinder 2 and thus yield a blanket cylinder 1 as shown in FIG. 3. Additionally, the amount of time devoted to cross-linking following formation of the layers 11 and 12 can be reduced by placing the obtained product into an oven at a temperature not exceeding 120\ufffd C., or by accelerating the cross-linking reaction by subjecting the product to irradiation. By each of these means, the aforesaid cross-linking time of five hours",
