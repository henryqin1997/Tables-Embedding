Various modifications, changes, and variations apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement, operation, and details of the methods and systems of the present invention disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Likewise, because the graphical representations are all displayed within a single area of the user interface (the focus area), the user need not scan through an arrangement of icons on a desktop, as is typically the case in many conventional PC interfaces. The graphical representations may be displayed at a relatively high rate of speed, while still being within the user's image recognition threshold. Typically, the focused navigation technique of the claimed invention allows a user to more quickly and efficiently locate and select a desired option than conventional approaches. Because navigation is initiated by a single user action, the user need not repeatedly press a button to display each option, as is often the case with conventional television or ITV interfaces. This greatly increases navigation speed, reduces wear on the remote control, and reduces the likelihood of repetitive stress injury of the user's hand. In view of the foregoing, the present invention offers a number of",
