It is important to note that, although the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functional computer system, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the present invention are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the present invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal-bearing media utilized to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of signal-bearing media include, but are not limited to, recordable-type media such as floppy disks or CD-ROMs and transmission-type media such as analogue or digital communications links. Block 220 illustrates filtering the displayed sessions with the user's calendar stored at the user's identifier; and the process passes to block 222. Block 222 depicts detecting user selections of sessions. In addition to the personal exercise monitor determining suitable exercise sessions, the user may create their own sessions, or sessions may be downloaded from another source. In addition, a session may include control programs for a single exercise machines or for multiple exercise machines. Next, block 225 depicts adding the selected sessions and output preferences to the fitness goals",
