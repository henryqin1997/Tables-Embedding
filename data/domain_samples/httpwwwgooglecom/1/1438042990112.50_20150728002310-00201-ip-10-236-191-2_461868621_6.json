    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. As described above, this novel device locates the antenna such that it can receive as many broadcast signals as possible, and automatically controls coefficient values of the pre-distortion filter to compensate for signal degradation occurring due to incongruity of the antenna position according to the broadcast channels, thus making it possible to receive the broadcast signals for the respective channels in the best condition. In summary, the MPU 64 selects and stores an optimal filter parameter coefficient value for every received channel. While selecting a specific channel after channel search, the MPU 64 loads the stored filter parameter coefficient value and automatically controls the delay and gain of the pre-distortion filter 58, thereby compensating for signal degradation due to incongruity of the antenna position according to the channels. Meanwhile, when a certain channel is searched, the MPU 64 sequentially varies the filter parameter coefficients in steps 84 and 86. Whenever the filter parameter coefficients are varied, the MPU 64 stores in its internal memory the SNR value or the ratio of the main tap energy to other tap energies, provided from the synchronizer 60",
