Therefore, an open-circuit may be caused by a cold solder, or a short-circuit may be caused by a solder whisker. Further, since a typical printed circuit board has a low thermal resistance of about 110 degrees Celsius (\ufffd C.), the shunt resistor and the resistor member cannot be used under high temperature conditions, and cannot be used to detect a large current. For example, the shunt resistor and the resistor member cannot be used in an engine room, where the temperature increases up to 150\ufffd C., and cannot be used to detect the battery charging and discharging current, which reach about 1000 amperes (A). Furthermore, a detection circuit for detecting the current is constructed with multiple circuit elements mounted on the printed circuit board by the solder. Therefore, many manufacturing steps and cost are required to solder the circuit elements to the printed circuit board, and the problems due to the cold solder and the solder whisker may occur., 27345=This application is based on and incorporates herein by reference Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-213574 filed on Aug. 4, 2006.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Such changes and modifications are to be understood as being within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The current sensors described in the embodiments can be used to detect various types of electric current. For example, the current sensors may be used to detect an excitation current of an electric motor installed in an electric hybrid vehicle (EHV) and an electric vehicle (EV). The embodiment described above may be modified in various ways. For example, the busbar 11 may be made of one type of material. The first and second terminals 11 a, 11 b may be made of the same material as the shunt resistor 11 c. In such an approach, manufacturing steps can be reduced so that manufacturing cost can be reduced. For example, the entire busbar 11 may be made of copper alloy (e.g., brass). In this case, the busbar 11 may be provided with a temperature sensor for detecting a temperature of the busbar 11. The detected current may be corrected based on the detected temperature, because copper alloy has a relatively high temperature coefficient of resistance. Modifications According to the seventh embodiment, the first and second heat sinks 91 a, 91 b are provided near the shunt resistor 11 c. The heat generated by the shunt register 11 c is dissipated to the outside of the case body 12",
