No. 4,898,570 issued Feb. 6, 1990 to the assignee of the instant invention, and is known as shingle folding. In this folding method, the sheets of a packet are folded sequentially, offset from each other by about 20% of the length of a sheet of paper, and the sheets are then nested together following the folding process. The drawback to this method is a lack of speed. Because of the shingling of the collation, the speed of the collation going through the folder is reduced by almost 50%.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, as described in the specification and defined in the appended claims. Once the final collation 50 is assembled on the accumulator deck 30, it is ready for further processing, which includes feeding the collation 50 downstream toward an inserting machine (not shown) which will insert the collation 50 into a waiting envelope (not shown). The number of sheets in each of the sub-sets 24 and 26 can vary, but preferably the sub-sets 24 and 26 should contain roughly the same number of sheets. Of course it is possible to have the first sub-set 24 include the maximum number of sheets which can be handled by the folder 20, with the remaining sheets included in the second sub-set 26. The foregoing description relates to folding of the sub-sets 24 and 26 in half. It is clearly possible to employ other types of folding, such as z folding which results in the sub-sets 24 and 26 being folded into thirds. It should also be understood that the name/address sheet 40 can be located anywhere as long as its location is known, and that the sub-sets can be arranged in any desired fashion as long as the name/address portion of the name/address sheet winds up on the outside of the ultimate",
