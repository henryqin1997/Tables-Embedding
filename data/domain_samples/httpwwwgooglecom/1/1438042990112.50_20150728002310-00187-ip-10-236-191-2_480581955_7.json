The clock display 8 may be updated once per minute, while the date display 7 may be updated once per day at 12:00 A.M. The AM/PM indicator 9 is preferably in the illuminated state during the PM hours and is turned off during the AM hours. The month display 6 and calendar date displays 22 are updated once per month when microprocessor 100 determines a new month has started., 24922=This application is based on applicant's provisional application Ser. No. 60/009,395, filed Dec. 29, 1995., 42029=FIG. 2 illustrates an individual dispensing module corresponding to a single day of the week. In particular, a module of the top row in the calendar display is illustrated. As can be seen, the illustrated module includes a total of four (4) separate dispensing compartments or \"pill boxes\" corresponding to the four doses that many patients must take each day. For example, many medicine regimens require doses at 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM and 8:00 PM. Each dispensing compartment will be prefilled with the medication required at the corresponding time.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, modifications and variations thereto may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, a \"time delay/time reset\" switch can be included so the patient may be able to go off for the day and put entire machine on \"hold\" without losing memory. The design may also be adapted for quadraplegics with the doors opening from underneath instead of on top (medicine falls down into trough, e.g., straw-like apparatus). In addition, it should be understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be interchanged in whole or in part. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing description is by way of example only, and is not intended to be limitative of the invention. It should be understood that the dispensing unit of the invention can be used in conjunction with or controlled by a computer. For example, the video monitor 70 shown in the unit of FIG. 1A can function as a monitor screen for such a computer. This can permit the patient to engage in various computer-based therapies, such as cognitive therapy regimens, using the dispensing unit, or utilize the dispensing unit for virtually any other purpose for which a ciomputer can be employed. FIG. 1A illustrates an alternative embodiment that allows two-way",
