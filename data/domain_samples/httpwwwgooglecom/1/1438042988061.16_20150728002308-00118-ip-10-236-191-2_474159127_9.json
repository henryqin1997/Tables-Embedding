No. 3,988,255, Seiden, issued October 26th 1976), lanolin and oil-like lanolin derivatives, animal and vegetable triglycerides such as almond oil, peanut oil, wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, linseed oil, jojoba oil, oil of apricot pits, walnuts, palm nuts, pistachio nuts, sesame seeds, rapeseed, cade oil, corn oil, peach pit oil, poppyseed oil, pine oil, castor oil, soyabean oil, avocado oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, hazelnut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, and sunflower seed oil, and C1 -C24 esters of dimer and trimer acids such as diisopropyl dimerate, diisostearylmalate, diisostearyldimerate and triisostearyltrimerate., 69904=A number of additional optional materials can be added to the cleansing compositions each at a level of from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight. Such materials include proteins and polypeptides and derivatives thereof; water-soluble or solubilizable preservatives such as DMDM Hydantoin, Germall 115, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of hydroxybenzoic acid, EDTA, Euxyl (RTM) K400, natural preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate and bisabalol; sodium benzoate and 2-phenoxyethanol; other moisturizing agents such as hyaluronic acid, chitin, and starch-grafted sodium polyacrylates such as Sanwet (RTM) IM-1000, IM-1500 and IM-2500 available from Celanese Superabsorbent Materials, Portsmith, Va., USA and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,663; solvents; anti-bacterial agents such as Oxeco (phenoxy isopropanol); low temperature phase modifiers such as ammonium ion sources (e.g. NH4 Cl); viscosity control agents such as magnesium sulfate and other electrolytes; colouring agents; TiO2 and TiO2 -coated mica; perfumes and perfume solubilizers; and zeolites such as Valfour BV400 and derivatives thereof and Ca2+ /Mg2+ sequestrants such as polycarboxylates, amino polycarboxylates, polyphosphonates, amino polyphosphonates, EDTA etc and water softening agents such as sodium citrate. Water is also present at a level preferably of from about 15% to about 97.99%, preferably from about 40% to about 90%, more preferably at least about 65% by weight of the compositions herein., 64598=Additional polymeric thickening agents include acrylic acid/ethyl acrylate copolymers and the carboxyvinyl polymers sold by the B.F. Goodrich Company under the trade mark of Carbopol resins. These resins consist essentially of a colloidally water-soluble polyalkenyl polyether crosslinked polymer of acrylic acid crosslinked with from 0.75% to 2.00% of a crosslinking agent such as for example polyallyl sucrose or polyallyl pentaerythritol. Examples include Carbopol 934, Carbopol 940, Carbopol 950, Carbopol 980, Carbopol 951 and Carbopol 981. Carbopol 934 is a water-soluble polymer of acrylic acid crosslinked with about 1% of a polyallyl ether of sucrose having an average of about 5.8 alkyl groups for each sucrose molecule. Also suitable for use herein are hydrophobically-modified cross-linked polymers of acrylic acid having amphipathic properties available under the Trade Name Carbopol 1382, Carbopol 1342 and Pemulen TR-1 (CFTA Designation: Acrylates/10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer). A combination of the polyalkenyl polyether cross-linked acrylic acid polymer and hydrophobically modified cross-linked acrylic acid polymer is also suitable for use herein., 59429=The compositions of the invention may also include an insoluble perfume or cosmetic oil or wax or a mixture thereof at a level up to about 10%, preferably up to about 3% by weight wherein the oil or wax is insoluble in the sense of being insoluble in the product matrix at a temperature of 25\ufffd C. Addition of such oils or waxes can provide emolliency, mildness and rinsibility characteristics to personal cleansing compositions according to the invention. It is a feature of the invention, however, that compositions having excellent emolliency and mildness together with desirable physical attributes (clarity etc.) can be delivered which are essentially oil-free, ie which contain less than about 1%, preferably less than 0.5% by weight of an added oil phase. Physically, preferred compositions of this type take the form of an optically-clear solution or microemulsion. In compositions including an additional perfume or cosmetic oil or wax, preferably the weight ratio of oil-derived nonionic surfactant to added oil is at least about 1:2, more especially at least about 3:1., 31714=wherein the ratio of short chain alkyl sulphate to alkyl ethoxy sulphate is in the range of from about 1:3 to about 3:1, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2., 35945=As a further essential feature the compositions of the present invention comprise a mild surfactant system of water-soluble auxiliary surfactants. Mild surfactants suitable for inclusion in compositions according to the present invention generally have a lipophilic chain length of from about 12 to about 22 carbon atoms and can be selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants and mixtures thereof. The total level of auxiliary surfactant is preferably from about 3% to about 40%, more preferably from about 4% to about 20%, and especially from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The compositions preferably comprise a mixture of anionic with zwitterionic and/or amphoteric surfactants. The level of the individual auxiliary anionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactant components, where present, is in the range from about 1% to about 15%, and especially from about 2% to about 13% by weight of the composition, while the level of nonionic surfactant, where present, is in the range from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% to about 16%, more preferably from about 1% to about 12% by weight. The weight ratio of auxiliary anionic surfactant: zwitterionic and/or amphoteric surfactant is in the range from about 1:2 to about 6:1. Other suitable compositions within the scope of the invention comprise mixtures of anionic, zwitterionic and/for amphoteric surfactants with one or more nonionic surfactants. Preferred for use herein are soluble or dispersible nonionic surfactants selected from ethoxylated animal and vegetable oils and fats and mixtures thereof, sometimes referred to herein as \"oil-derived\" nonionic surfactants.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The products provide excellent in-use and efficacy benefits including mildness, skin conditioning, skin moisturising, good product stability, cleansing, lathering and excellent rinsibility. The compositions have a viscosity (Brookfield RVT DCP, 1 rpm with Cone CP41 or CP52, 25\ufffd C., neat) in the range of from 500 to 50,000 cps, preferably from 1,000 to 10,000 cps. Compositions I to XII are prepared by firstly dispersing the water-soluble or colloidally water-soluble polymeric rheology modifier in water at 25\ufffd C. either in a Tri-blender (RTM) or by extended stirring prior to neutralisation with NaOH or alternative base mixture and hydration. In examples II, IV and VI the mixture can be heated to about 50\ufffd C. to enhance dispersion efficiency. Next the solubilisation agent is added with further stirring. The surfactants and other skin care agents can then be added along with the remaining water-soluble, oil-insoluble ingredients. In compositions which comprise water-insoluble ingredients an oil phase B is formed from these oil-soluble ingredients which is then admixed with A at ambient temperature. The polymeric dispersion is then added to the ambient temperature mix and finally the remaining water, preservative, opacifier and perfume are added. ______________________________________I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII______________________________________Anionic 1 4.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 5.0 1.0 2.0 Anionic 2 10.0 -- -- -- 2.0 5.0 -- -- 3.0 2. 0 3.0 -- Anionic 3 -- --",
