    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Therefore, the present invention provides a laser driver which uses a current source with an essentially constant amplitude a.c. component to drive a laser diode in order to eliminate package parasitics due to bond wire reactance at high frequencies. Since the current to the laser diode D is derived from the common-emitter amplifier 24 operating as a current source, the effect of the reactance L is minimized as, regardless of frequency, the laser diode is driven by a constant amplitude a.c. component of the drive current. Thus the voltage divider effect of the reactance L is essentially eliminated, and the performance of the laser diode D is not degraded. As shown in FIG. 2 an input modulation signal is applied to an input RC impedance matching circuit 12 and AC coupled to the laser driver circuit 14 which is located on a circuit board 16. The laser diode D is situated in a package 18 and connected to the circuit board via bond wires. The bond wire interface between the circuit board 16 and the package 18 is indicated by a dotted line 20. The laser driver circuit 14 has an input common-base buffer amplifier 2 to which the input modulation signal is applied at the emitter. The collector of the buffer amplifier 22 is input to the base of a common-emitter amplifier 24 which is biased to operate in a current source mode. The collector",
