    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The film was stretched at ratio 2:1 in the length and 7.5:1 in the transverse direction. It was then taken through the line shown in FIG. 8. Temperature of the embossed roller was kept between the melting points of the two polymers, while the exact adjustment of this and the air jets were adjusted by experimenting and observing the results obtained. Flat threads of nylon 6 (1 part by weight) are coextruded in a 300 gr per sq m polypropylene (10 parts by weight) film wholly surrounded by the polypropylene. Distance from center to center of the threads: 0.8 mm. Thickness of the film: 300 gr per sq m. Melt flow index of polypropylene: 5 according to ASTM condition L. Melt flow index of nylon: adjusted to give distinct but flat filaments in the coextrusion. EXAMPLE as scrim reinforcement for turf and the like. as paper reinforcement, for filter material, as a layer or layers in carpet backing, for wiping cloth--alone or as a layer, for blankets, preferably in form of a laminate of several layers napped net, Further examples of suitable uses of the napped net according to the invention are as follows: In order to increase the tendency to form fibres by the dragging in molten state and to improve the look of the nap, the film used for the scrim production may with advantage be a slightly expanded (foamed) film.
