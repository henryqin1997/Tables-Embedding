Having thus described the invention, what is claimed is In a device of the class described, the combination with a shoe-sole formed of a plurality of superposed lifts, of a heel, a marginal band secured to one of said lifts and provided with a plurality of spaced depending spurs passing through the adiacent lifts, means for securing the marginal band in position on said lift, an engaging member secured to the upper lift of the sole, an attaching member extending through the heel and engaging the first-named member, a nut seated on each side of the marginal band between the depending spurs, and bolts having their threaded ends extending through the heel and engaging said nuts for securing the heel to the s oe. From the foregoing it is apparent that I produce a simple inexpensive device admirably adapted for the attainment of the ends in view, but it is to be understood that minor changes may be made in the details herein the invention. Provided upon and projecting outward or downward from the outer face of the ply 8 is a series of engaging pins or prongs l6, adapted to register with and enter suitable",
