This is a less than 10 ppm error that may be reduced by averaging; for example, averaging for 2.5 ms results in a less than approximately 2 ppm error. Thus the demod block of FIG. 7 achieves the accuracy required for inductive plethysmography. On the other hand, if the demod merely counted the number of oscillator cycles within a 0.5 ms sampling interval, then the random error would be one-half of an approximately 300 kHz period, or 1.67 \u03bcs every 0.5 ms, of about 3300 ppm. Such inaccuracies would totally hide both respiratory and cardiac inductive plethysmographic signals, which at most have an amplitude to 1000 ppm., 63611=(4) The '015 patent: U.S. Pat.

No. 4,834,109, issued May 30, 1989 and titled \u201cSingle Position Non-invasive Calibration Technique,\u201d discloses an improved method for calibrating inductive plethysmographic measurement of respiration volume by totaling, during a period of breathing, a plurality of values of a parameter indicative of the relative amplitude, for each breath, of uncalibrated rib cage and abdomen signals, and by dividing the average variability of the means of the total of the values of one of the rib cage and abdomen signals by the average variability of the mean of the total of the values of the other signal, the quotient being so derived represents a signal weighting factor for determining respiration volume., 104405=Next, necessary measurement accuracies may be determined from known electronic circuit laws combined with measured bodily displacements resulting from the physiological events being monitored. Measurement accuracies may also be simply determined from observation of particular measurement configuration. Using either approach, it has been determined that respiratory activity generally leads to frequency changes of 500-1000 ppm (parts per million). Cardiac activity generally leads to frequency changes of 50-100 ppm. Therefore, for monitoring both respiratory and cardiac activities, it is most preferably frequency measurements have an accuracy of less than 1-2 ppm, preferably less than 5 ppm, and less preferably less than 10 ppm (and at least less than 100 ppm)., 179076=FIGS. 8A-B illustrate two principal (and exemplary) embodiments for such local wireless transmission. In these figures, the osc, demod, and microp blocks have the similar meanings to these blocks in FIGS. 6A-C. The xmtr block is a RF transmitter; the rcvr block is an RF receiver; and arrows 70 represent wireless transmission between the xmtr and the rcvr between the monitoring garment and its microprocessor unit. Preferably, the transmissions are of very low power in an un-licensed band, for example, the bands near 900 MHz or 2.4 Ghz. For actual implementation, it is preferable that the xmtr and rcvr locks be implemented at least of single ICs, if not in a higher form of integration embedded in other ICs., 65143=(6) The '962 patent: U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,962, issued Oct. 18, 1988 and titled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Distinguishing Central Obstructive and Mixed Apneas by External Monitoring Devices Which Measure Rib Cage and Abdominal Compartmental Excursions During Respiration,\u201d discloses an apparatus and method for distinguishing between different types of apneic episodes. The method includes measuring a new index, Total Compartmental Displacement/Tidal Volume (TCD/VT), and measuring the phase relation between the abdominal and rib cage contributions to total respiration volume, wherein an episode is classified as central, obstructive or mixed based on the value of TCD/VT and the phase relation., 59927=This application claims the benefit of Provisional application Ser. No. 60/197,589, filed Apr. 17, 2000., 132375=A further data storage embodiment includes local, private wireless transmission of data from a microprocessor unit of a monitoring garment to a local receiver within a short distance, perhaps 10 to 1000 feet, of the individual being monitored. From the local receiver, the data may be stored at a local computer system, for example a PC-type computer, for periodic transmission to a central repository for access by health care providers. The periodic transmission may be via removable media a few times daily, as described above, or may be via standard or high speed access (DSL or cable modem) perhaps hourly. Alternatively, the central repository may be replaced by a local server PC-type computer accessed by health care providers. Although not changing transmitter duty cycles, local wireless transmission would eliminate access costs to public wireless facilities and may be of higher speed, and therefore, make wireless transmission of raw data a more attractive tradeoff. The embodiment would be appropriate for an individual ambulatory yet confined to a residence, or health care facility, or relatively small workplace. It may not be appropriate for individuals engaging in their normal daily activities., 143224=The monitoring garment 30 or 30 a may transmit data to the receiving unit at a rate ranging from approximately 1-1000 points/second (depending on the available sensors). Optionally, a one minute trend numerical value reduced from data processed waveforms is transmitted every five to ten minutes in which case the monitoring garment may transmit data at the rate ranging from approximately 1-1000 points/second only when an adverse or preprogrammed event occurs to thereby conserve the batteries powering the microprocessor unit 33 on the monitoring garment., 73965=(18) The '388 patent: U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,388, issued Jan. 18, 2000 and titled \u201cMethod for Analyzing Breath Waveforms as to Their Neuromuscular Respiratory Implications,\u201d discloses a method for measuring respiratory drive by determining a peak inspiratory flow and a peak inspiratory acceleration from a breath waveform derived from rib cage motion and abdominal motion measured by external respiratory measuring devices, such as those based on inductive plethysmography, the measured respiratory drive being usable to initiate inspiration by a mechanical ventilator and for determining an index describing a shape of the waveform for controlling a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) device., 67201=***(9) The '766 patent: U.S. Pat. No. 4,860,766, issued Aug. 29, 1989 and titled \u201cNoninvasive Method for Measuring and Monitoring Intrapleural Pressure in Newborns,\u201d discloses measuring intrapleural pressure of a newborn subject by detecting relative movement between adjacently-proximate cranial bones, preferably, using a surface inductive plethysmographic transducer secured on the subject's head across at least two adjacently-proximate cranial bones, and a method of calibrating such measurements by temporarily manually occluding the subject's nose or, if intubated, the endotracheal tube, to measure the airway pressure during such occlusion as the subject makes an inspiratory effort and comparing the measured pressure to the measured signal., 161371=Next, FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate possible functional distributions of electronic circuitry for processing the plethysmographic signals. With respect to FIGS. 6A-C, the functions of the osc (oscillator) block(s), the demod (demodulator) block(s) and the microp (microprocessor) block are substantially the same and will be described once with respect to FIG. 6A. First illustrated are three conductive loops coupled to a single or to individual oscillators. The oscillators are LC oscillators with a frequency responsive to variations in the loop inductance, and may be of any type known in the art. They preferably are of very low drift due to temperature and other compensations., 71892=(16) The '968 patent: U.S. Pat.
