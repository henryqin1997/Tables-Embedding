    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As the foregoing illustrates, the invention is directed to a device, namely a toroid, for selectively suppressing transients in medium and high voltage conductors in an industrial distribution network or electrical power system. It is understood that changes may be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concepts thereof. For example, the thickness of the toroid can vary, such as, for example, depending on the size of the conductor the toroid is to filter. Also, embodiments other than the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 can be used. Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the invention contained herein. In one embodiment, the first predetermined frequency range is greater than 60 Hz and the second predetermined frequency range is substantially 50-60 Hz. The selection of these frequency ranges allow a power signal operating around 50-60 Hz, such as those power signals in the United States and Europe, to be passed through a medium and high voltage conductor in an industrial distribution system or an electrical power system while impeding HF transients. FIG. 8 shows a method for filtering medium voltage and high voltage conductors. The method comprises generating a magnetic field using a toroid at step 900. Then, impeding signals in a first predetermined frequency range using the magnetic field at step 905 and passing signals in a second predetermined frequency range",
