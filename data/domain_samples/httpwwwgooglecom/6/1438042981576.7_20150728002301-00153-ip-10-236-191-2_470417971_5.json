A heat load 52 is provided adjacent the cold cylinder 12. That heat load may be an electronic detector or the like which must be cooled to a cryogenic temperature as a result of refrigeration developed at the cylinder 12. To provide heat input to the device 10, a heat source 54, which may be an open flame but is here shown by an arrow, is in heat exchange relation with the hot chamber 42 of cylinder 14. The heat source 54 may be at any relatively high temperature as, for example, 1000 F. and may continuously supply heat to the chamber 42 during operation. A heat exchanger 55 may be provided in association with the piping 50 to reject heat to ambient from the passing refrigerating fluid., 7830=Jan. 28, 1969' K. w.cowANs 3, 2, 7882=CRYOGENIC REFRIGERATOR ADAPTED T0 MINIATURIZATION Filed April 5. 1967 Fig. l., 29335=References Cited UNITED STATES PATENTS 3,074,244 1/1963 Malaker 626 3,128,605 4/1964 Malaker 626 3,145,527 8/1964 Morgenroth 626 3,147,600 9/1964 Malaker 626 3,355,882 12/1967 Kohler 626 WILLIAM J.
