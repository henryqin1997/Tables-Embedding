    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{125943=Rather than specifying the city, the system can display the POIs by their proximity to the current location of the vehicle. The GPS-based latitude and longitude estimates are compared to the Latitude/Longitude field of records in POIList table 1450, for POIs of the selected POI type. The in-vehicle system then displays the POIs in order of proximity to the current location rather than alphabetically., 200181=Referring still to FIG. 23B, in operation, when handset module 2360 is used as a normal cellular telephone, onboard computer 2310 passes data signals and audio signals between cellular phone module 2320 and handset module 2360. When the system operates in a driver information mode, onboard computer 2310 accepts and processes digital signals encoding a user's input on keypad 2364, and generates digital signals which control display 2362 to provide alphanumeric and iconic output on display 2362. Onboard computer 2310 thereby provides navigation and traffic information to the driver using display 2362., 221053=Referring still to FIGS. 26A-B, information pod 2600 is optionally coupled-to display 240 through a connector 2624. When information pod 2600 is connected to the display, additional information, such as detailed traffic information, are presented on the display to the driver. In alternative embodiments, information pod 2600 can also be coupled to other devices, such as a display, over an in-vehicle data bus into which the information pod is connected., 217347=In operation, a driver initiates an interaction with the system by pressing one of selector switches 2616. For instance, to request roadside assistance, the user presses the roadside assistance switch. The information pod establishes communication with a server system using cellular transceiver 2612. The information pod determines the location (and optionally the direction last traveled, or past locations of the vehicle) of the vehicle using GPS receiver 2610 and sends that information to over the communication channel to the server. At this point, the server system can dispatch assistance to the driver, or alternative, establish voice communication between the driver and an operator using the voice input/output module. A driver accesses police or concierge services in a similar manner. In this way, the police or concierge immediately knows where the driver is located. For instance, if the driver is looking for a particular restaurant, a concierge can provide verbal directions based on the vehicle's actual location., 71490=Processor 212 is also coupled to a static storage 222 which is a non-volatile storage used to store code and data for operation of the system. In particular, as is described further below, static storage 222 is used to store map-related information, such as main roads network 1000 (FIG. 10), which is used during route planning and guidance procedures executed on onboard computer 210. Static storage 222 is a removable 40 MB flash memory system which emulates a disk storage device. Alternative static storage devices can be used, including removable and non-removable disk storage devices and semiconductor memories., 141212=GPS location tracking and off-route detection (FIG. 17, lines 1707-1710), and, 151497=When the in-vehicle system detects that a vehicle is off the planned route, it executes a route replanning procedure (FIG. 18). The first step is to determine where the vehicle is traveling on the main road network 1000, which is stored in in-vehicle database 432., 93733=StreetRecord table 1160 is used to form completely specified street names in terms of base street names, optional prefixes and suffixes, and street types. For instance, \u201cNorth Main Blvd\u201d is represented by the base street name \u201cMain,\u201d the prefix/suffix combination \u201cNorth/-\u201d and the street type \u201cBlvd.\u201d A typical record 1162 in StreetRecord table 1160 includes a StreetName field 1164 that references the text form of the base street name stored in a StreetName table 1170, and an AffixType field 1166 that includes a representation of the prefix/suffix combination as an index to the predetermined set of prefix/suffix combinations and a text representation of the street type., 199568=Handset module 2360 also includes a keypad 2364, for instance, a keypad proving 10 numeric keys and several function-specific keys. The communication protocol used on data line 2321 provides for external signaling of information related to the buttons pressed by a user on keypad 2364., 172615=Referring to FIG. 20C, another alternative approach to updating the in-vehicle system is to use a wired telephone connection. In this approach, the in-vehicle system includes a moderate speed modem 2050 (e.g., a 56 kb/s modem) and a telephone connector. The owner provides a physical connection 2052 from the telephone connector to the public telephone network (PSTN) 340. The in-vehicle system places a telephone call to the server system, or another server used to provide data updates, and downloads the data at a moderate speed over the telephone connection., 125377=The operator can select a particular POI of the selected POI type in a number of ways. In a first way, the operator next selects a city in which to find the destination POI. Using POINameCity table 1430, the system displays a list of names, addresses and phone numbers of POIs of the selected type in the selected city. The operator then selects from the list of displayed POIS. The phone number can be useful, for instance, if the operator wants to call the destination, such as a restaurant, before deciding to travel to the destination., 121012=Route and spot map downloading (lines 1562-1563, FIG. 15B, line 1512, FIG. 15A), 125017=In specifying a destination by a point of interest (POI), the operator first selects from a list of types of points of interests. Examples of types of POIs include banking locations, gas stations, hospitals, and restaurants. Referring to FIG. 14, the list of valid types is obtained by the in-vehicle system from POITypes table 1420., 176342=Emergency and roadside assistance provides an operator of a vehicle with a way of contacting assistance and providing the location of the vehicle. Referring to FIG. 21A, in an operator initiated interaction, the operator selects the emergency and roadside assistance option on the user interface of the in-vehicle system. The vehicle places a cellular telephone call to the server system, or to another server that the in-vehicle system has been configured to call to handle such requests. When the call is established, the in-vehicle System establishes a data connection to the called server. The in-vehicle system transfers a unique identification of the vehicle to the server. The unique identification is used by the server to access information such as the make, model, and color of the vehicle, which may be useful to a dispatched service vehicle finding the operator's vehicle. The in-vehicle system also sends its estimated location, or raw GPS data, and most recent direction of travel based on its GPS measurements. The server system applies GPS correction data to the vehicle's estimated location or raw GPS data to determine a corrected location estimate. After the in-vehicle system transfers the data to the server, the operator can communicate with a telephone operator 2110 at the server using the telephone handset in the vehicle. This allows the operator to provide details that may be useful in dispatching assistance., 215813=Alternative related embodiments make use of printed maps or overlay displays individually, or in combination. Also, alternative embodiments provide traffic information to a driver without providing navigation or route-planning capabilities. Also, although display 2540 is illustrated as a separated device in FIG. 25, the display can alternatively be integrated in the handset, and overlays can be applied to the display on the handset., 132823=When the in-vehicle system establishes a communication session with the server system (line 1504-1510, FIG. 15A), it does so in two steps. First the in-vehicle system establishes a cellular telephone connection to the server system, and then it establishes a modulated data session on the cellular telephone connection., 220373=Information pod 2600 includes two status indicator lights. GPS status light 2625 indicates when the pod is receiving GPS information, and therefore when the pod can determine the its location. Cellular status light 2626 indicates when cellular transceiver 2612 is able to communicate with the cellular telephone system and can therefore contact the server system. These status lights indicate to the driver when the full services of the information pod are available. For instance, the driver may choose to wait for GPS status light 2625 to illuminate before requesting traffic information that relies on the unit's location., 184716=Server system 125 a includes a gateway system 2210 that is coupled to telephone interface 320. Gateway system 2210 is used to provide a communication gateway between vehicles 100 and server computers in server system 125 a, and implements a message routing function so that communication received from an in-vehicle system is directed to the appropriate server computer. Gateway system 2210 does not necessarily have to interpret the content of data passing between the server systems and is the vehicles., 68396=The in-vehicle system therefore uses a combination of main roads network 1000 that is preloaded into the vehicle and spot maps 900 that are downloaded to the vehicle along with planned route 800 to replan the route when the vehicle is detected to not be-following the planned route., 221563=An alternative embodiment of the information pod incorporates a small display, such as display 2540 shown in FIG. 25. Additionally, an overlay 2550 can be used over the display to augment the graphical information provided to the driver., 120666=Destination specification (line 1502, FIG. 15A), 188008=Server system 125 a also includes a remote configuration system 2230 that is coupled to LAN 2205, and that is also coupled to the Internet. Using the remote configuration system, users of the navigation system can modify their records in user profiles 2232 that are stored at the server system. A user's profile is downloaded by the server system to the in-vehicle system in that user's vehicle, or can alternatively be stored on the server system. Information in the user profiles can include various types of information, including stored destinations that the user can select from when specifying a destination to the in-vehicle system. For instance, a user can specify a list of frequent destinations over the Internet, and then later in the vehicle choose a particular destination in that list by selecting from a display of the list by the in-vehicle system., 214119=In a related approach, printed map 2510 includes multiple sheets. One sheet provides an overview, for example, showing only main roads. Detailed maps for portions of the main roads map show local streets. In specifying a location, the driver first finds the location on the main roads map and determines a general specification. Then, the driver consults one of the detailed maps to specify the precise location and more precise specification., 101704=Record 1352 in LinkShapePoint table 1350 includes a NumberShapePoints field 1354 and a NumberSidgns field 1356. For each shape point, record 1352 includes an encoding of the change in latitude and longitude from the previous shape point, or from the reference node for the first shape point. Record 1352 also includes Signlnformation 1360 describing the signs that would be seen by someone driving along the link., 68719=In an alternative version of the system, spot maps 900 can be used to augment main roads network 1000 to re-plan the route if the operator fails to follow the planned route during the initial portion of the trip., 199064=Handset module 2360 includes a display 2362. In this embodiment, display 2362 provides a grid of two lines of 8 character positions each, although larger or somewhat smaller displays, or bitmapped rather than character encoded displays can alternatively be used. Cellular phone module 2320 and handset module 2360 communicate over data line 2321 using a communication protocol that provides-for external control of display 2362., 186198=Navigation system 2250 implements the functionality of server system 125 as shown in FIG. 5. That is, it includes an interface to GPS receiver 325, and includes server map database 520, yellow pages database 522, and traffic database 524. Navigation system 2250 is coupled to map provider 2252, and a traffic information system 2254., 100791=Record 1332 in LinkSegments table 1330 includes a StreetName field 1334, which references a record in StreetRecord table 1160, and a reference node field 1336 and a non-reference node field 1338 which reference records 1312 and 1318 in MasterNode table 1310, respectively. Record 1332 also includes a ShapePointInfo field 1340 which references a record 1352 in a LinkShapePoint table 1350. The record referenced by ShapePointInfo field 1340 includes information related to the shape points on the link, as well as information related to signs on the link. Record 1332 also includes a Class field 1342, which encodes the road class of the is link, and an AddressRanges field 1344, which references two records in AddressRange table 1180, one for each side of the road., 187754=A news system 2270 provides a service which sends data to vehicles which corresponds to news stories that are of interest to a particular vehicle operators. The news stories are provided by an external news service 2272., 159659=Optionally, the average link speeds stored in the server system's traffic database 524 are downloaded and stored in a link speeds database 1910 in the in-vehicle system of each vehicle. This link speeds database is used, for instance, by the in-vehicle system when replanning a route bases on a shortest expected travel time., 210105=Another alternative embodiment provides the driver with the option of specifying that the remote server is to plan the route even though the route is within the region covered by regional map 2410 and could be planned by the in-vehicle system. For instance, the in-vehicle system may not have current traffic information and therefore would not necessarily plan the best route in view of actual traffic conditions. When the driver specifies that the remote server is to plan the route, the in-vehicle system uses regional map 2410 to validate the destination specification. Then, rather than planning the route, it contacts the remote server which computes the route based on information not available to the in-vehicle system, for example, based on up-to-date traffic information., 99815=Referring to FIG. 13B, several tables are used to represent the main roads network 1000. Records in these tables related to the representative link shown in FIG. 13A are illustrated in FIG. 13B. A MasterNode table 1310 includes one logically variable length record for each node in the network. A record 1312 which is associated with node i 1301 includes a Latitude/Longitude field 1314 that encodes the location of node i 1301. Record 1312 also includes a set of link fields 1316, one for each of the links joined at node i 1301. Each link field 1316 includes information related to allowable turns from that link onto other links at that node, and includes a reference to a record in a LinkSegments table 1330 associated with that link. For instance, the link field 1316 associated with link c 1307 references record 1332 in LinkSegments table 1330., 189998=A user also uses remote configuration system 2230 to input route planning requests. For instance, the user provides a destination specification to the remote configuration system and the server system downloads a planned route to the destination prior to the user entering the vehicle. The user can access the remote configuration system in a variety of ways, including over the Internet, and over a voice telephone connection interacting with an automatic speech recognition device at the server. In addition to specifying a destination, the user can also request notification of when he or she needs to start the trip in order to get to the destination at a particular time. The notification can be by telephone, pager, or using any of a variety of other notification methods., 156944=In order to build up link speed log 1920, the in-vehicle system tracks the vehicle's location on main roads network 1000 that is stored in in-vehicle database 432. Using the GPS location estimates it receives from its GPS receiver, the in-vehicle system detects when the vehicle is following a road segment (link) of the main roads network. The in-vehicle system records the time the vehicle takes to travel from one end to the other of the link and stores a reference to the link, the time of day, and the speed traveled along the link in the link speed log. As the vehicle travels over multiple links of the main roads network, a series of travel times is logged, each associated with a link that was traversed., 200877=Display 2362 provides a limited output capability, particularly compared to the capabilities of bitmapped graphical displays in other embodiments described above. Onboard computer 2310 provides navigation instructions to the driver on this limited display using an extended set of displayable symbols (i.e., glyphs, pictograms) that is includes arrows indicating different degrees of turns, such as 45, 90, and 135 turns in each direction, and 0 degree and 180 degree (U-turn) turns. An instruction such as \u201cturn right on Main Street in 0.5 miles\u201d is displayed using a right turn arrow symbol, the distance \u201c0.5,\u201d and the name of the cross street \u201cMain.\u201d Alternative approaches to presenting navigation instructions on the limited display can also be used., 184178=Referring to FIG. 22, an alternative server system 125 a provides the functionality of the server system 125 described above, and in addition provides an extensible architecture for providing other services to the vehicles. Server system 125 a includes multiple server computers coupled over a LAN 2205. Alternatively, the functionality of these server computers can be implemented on a smaller number of computers, or on a single computer that implements all their functions., 120820=Querying the server system (lines 1504-1510, FIG. 15A; lines 1552-1560, FIG. 15B), 95222=Referring to FIG. 12, a representative text table 1200 includes an index 1210 and a compressed text region 1220., 95375=A reference to a particular record is used as an offset to a record 1212 in index 1210. Record 1212 includes a starting field 1214 and a length field 1216. Compressed text 1220 includes the concatenation of all the text records, encoded as a sequence of 6-bit character representation. Starting field 1214 is the index of the starting 6-bit character of the record. In order for a procedure executing on onboard computer 210 to access the text string, the procedure first converts the index to the address of the starting 8-bit byte of storage, and then it unpacks the 6-bit character representation to form a standard 8-bit character representation of the record., 190803=A new service is added to server system 125 a by adding a server computer, updating gateway system 2210 so that communication for that service is routed to the new server computer, and updating the in-vehicle system by adding a corresponding software module to each of the in-vehicle systems. The in-vehicle systems are updated either over a cellular telephone connection, or over a physical connection, as described above (see Section 4)., 132181=Once the server system provides GPS correction data to the in-vehicle system, the in-vehicle system updates its starting location using the GPS correction data (line 1602, FIG. 16). For instance, if the GPS correction data is pseudorange correction data, the in-vehicle system provides the pseudorange correction data to its GPS receiver and receives the corrected position estimate from the GPS receiver. If the GPS correction data is offsets in latitude and longitude, the in-vehicle system applies these offsets to the estimated position output from its GPS receiver., 199901=Handset module 2360 also includes an audio input/output device 2366, for instance, a microphone and a speaker. Audio signals pass to and from audio input/output device 2366 and cellular phone module 2320 over audio line 2322., 208678=An alternative related embodiment relies on a regional map 2410 for autonomous operation, but does not include an in-vehicle database 432 that has map information. In such an embodiment, the in-vehicle system contracts a remote server for all route planning functions outside the area covered by regional map 2410, including validation of the specification of a destination. Several alternative server modes can be used. These include a fully automated server of the type described above. Alternatively, when a driver wants directions to a point outside the region covered by regional map 2410, he may contact a human operator at a remote server. The human operator inputs the destination specification into the automated route planning system at the remote server. The remote server then downloads the planned route and other information related to the planned route (e.g., a corridor map, points of interest along the route, route-specific advertising) to the in-vehicle system., 97133=Record 1432 in POINameCity table 1430 includes a Country field 1434, which references a record in Country table 1120 (FIG. 11), a CityState field 1436, which references a record in CityState table 1130, a POIName filed 1438, and an Offset field 1440, which references a record 1452 in a POIList table 1450 which is the first record in a range 1464 of records in POIList table 1450 associated with record 1432. An offset field 1440 of a record 1433 that immediately follows record 1432 in POINameCity table 1430 references a record 1466 that immediately follows range 1464 in POXList table 1450., 130195=The in-vehicle system sends to the server system either an estimate of its position, or sends raw GPS data from its GPS receiver from which the server system computes the vehicle's position (line 1503, FIG. 15A)., 196215=This version of the in-vehicle component of a driver information system makes use of commercially available cellular telephone modules, for example, modules available from JRC Canada Inc. or from Audiovox Inc. Referring to FIG. 23A, a standard arrangement of such modules includes a cellular telephone module 2320 that is connected to a handset module 2360 over a bidirectional data line 2321 and input and output audio lines 2322. Similar standard modular arrangements include a controller module coupled between the handset module and the telephone module., 187244=The in-vehicle systems in the vehicles include software modules that correspond to the services provided by the server system. For instance, communication sent from communication system 2260 to an in-vehicle system is received by a communication module that interprets the data and commands it receives. For instance, a message communication module displays paging or email messages on the display of the in-vehicle system, or alternatively plays them as synthesized speech messages., 67490=Referring back to FIG. 6, in this example, the operator fails to make the right turn from main road 628 onto main road 620, continuing instead on main road 628. Referring back to FIG. 10, the in-vehicle system determines that the vehicle is off-route at a point 1010, which corresponds to a point on a main road segment between nodes 732 and 722 when it should have been at a point on the link joining points 732 and 735. Using its main road network 1000, the in-vehicle system plans a corrected route indicated by the dashed line 1012. This re-planned route joins the originally planned route at point 725. Note that in replanning a route after an off-route condition occurs, the in-vehicle system does not necessarily have to contact the server system, relying instead on its main roads network 1000., 137014=Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, the server system downloads a route as a sequence of links joined by maneuver points, and downloads spot maps as small graphs around the starting location or the selected maneuver points (lines 1562-1563, FIG. 15B, line 1512, FIG. 15A) In order to reduce the download time needed, this data is represented as a compact data structure., 123039=Alternative sequences of field specifications can be used. In one sequence, the operator first selects a city from a scrolling list of cities in the current (country, state). Referring to FIG. 11, the list of valid states is obtained from CityState table 1130. After the operator selects a desired city, the in-vehicle system presents a scrolling list of valid streets names in that city. The list of valid street names is obtained using AddressCityState table 1100, and associated AddressStreet table 1150, StreetRecord table 1160, and StreetName table 1170. After the operator selects a desired street, the operator enters a street number. The in-vehicle system validates the number using AddressStreet table 1150 and AddressRange table 1180., 156290=In the first mode of traffic data collection, navigation application 412 in in-vehicle system 105 of a probe vehicle collects on an ongoing basis a history (a profile) of the speed that the vehicle travels on links of the main roads network (or equivalently the transit times on the links). The in-vehicle system collects the traffic profile data independently of the guidance function. That is, the vehicle does not have to be guided by the navigation system in order to collect traffic profile data. The navigation application stores the time of day and the speed traveled on each link in a link speed log 1920., 134568=Route planning at the server system (line 1561, FIG. 15B) uses well known route finding approaches. In particular, two instances of the well-known A* (\u201cA-Star\u201d) graph search algorithm are used in conjunction with road network 700 (FIG. 7). One instance of the A* algorithm starts at the starting location and one starts \u201cbackwards\u201d from the desired destination. The A* algorithm is a type of \u201cbest first\u201d search approach. At any point executing the algorithm, the actual distance along the graph from an initial node to a set of intermediate nodes has been computed. A lower bound (or in some versions of the algorithm, an estimate) of the distance from each of the intermediate nodes to the final node is added to the actual distance. The intermediate node with the lowest sum is extended. If the lower bounds are used, this algorithm produces the shortest path from the initial node to the final node. Using the two instances of the A* algorithm, a best path is chosen after there are intermediate nodes in common for the two instances of the algorithm., 211620=Alternative versions of the system include user customized databases that are provided to the user on a removable medium, or are downloaded directly into the in-vehicle system, for instance, over a telephone connection or over a high-speed data connection such as an infra-red link to a personal computer. For instance, in the hybrid system shown in FIG. 24, regional map 2410 would be customized for the user. In other embodiments of the system, a customized in-vehicle database (see, e.g., FIG. 2 in-vehicle database 432 in static storage 222) is stored on a removable device. These customized databases can use alternative types of removable media such as CD-ROM, solid-state memory cards, and magnetic disks. These databases are customized for a particular user, for example, to include the areas typically traveled by the user. Such a customized database can be provided to the user in a variety of ways, including by sending custom recorded media by mail or by downloading the data over the Internet and creating the removable medium on user's personal computer. In this way, the geographic area for which map data is stored in the vehicle can be tailored to the area typically traveled by a user. In addition, in the hybrid system shown in FIG. 24, the region for which complete map data is stored can be separately chosen from the region for which only main roads data is stored., 117888=Referring now to FIG. 18, the off-route routine first involves a dead-reckoning position correction procedure (lines 1802-1810). If for the direction of travel matches the planned route for an interval, for instance, of 75 feet after the difference between the position estimates was detected, then the dead reckoning position is updated to be the closest point along the planned route to the. (D)GPS position estimate (lines 1804-1805). In this way, if the deviation in position estimates is due to inaccurate tracking of the distance along the route, the location correction procedure should successfully overcome the error. If the deviation between the (D)GPS estimate and the dead-reckoning estimate is now less than the off-route tolerance, the in-vehicle system resumes the route following procedure (line 1808). If on the other hand, even the closest point on the planned route is still more than the off-route tolerance from the (D)GPS position, then the location correction procedure is not successful and a route replanning procedure is initiated., 205456=In FIG. 24, in-vehicle system 2400 has a regional map 2410 stored on a removable medium such as a CD-ROM. Regional maps 2410 are provided by, or derived from raw information provided by map provider 160. The regional maps include local roads (that is, the regional maps are not limited to main roads), but are limited in the geographic area covered. In contrast onboard computer 2420 also includes in-vehicle database 432 that includes main roads but not necessarily local roads. Since the regional maps are limited to a relatively small geographic area, detailed local road information can generally be included without exceeding the capacity of the storage devices. In alternative embodiments, the main roads data for a large area and the local road data from a smaller area can be distributed together on a single storage medium, and this data may be embedded in the in-vehicle system rather than provided on a removable storage medium., 152987=As in the server system based route planning approach, the in-vehicle system uses an A\u2032 algorithm to plan the route. The starting point is determined using the scanning of MasterNode table 1310, as described above. As intermediate nodes are considered in the A\u2032 search, the lower bound on the distance to the desired location is minimum over the maneuver and way points near the last detected maneuver point of the sum of the straight-line distance from the intermediate point to the maneuver or way point plus the previously calculated distance along the previously planned route from that maneuver or way point to the desired destination. In this way, the best point of rejoining the previously planned route is found., 92856=Each record in AddressStreet table 1150 is associated with a combination of a complete street name, and a range of valid street numbers for that street name. Multiple records in AddressStreet table 1150 can refer to the same street name in order to build up an entire range of valid street numbers. A typical record 1152 in AddressStreet table 1150 includes a Streetname field 1154 and an AddressRange field 1156. Streetname field 1154 references a record in a StreetRecord table 1160 that is used to form the text representation of the street name. AddressRange field 1156 references a record 1182 in AddressRange table 1180 that includes entries for the lowest 1184 and highest 1186 numerical values in a valid range of the street numbers for the associate street., 198079=Referring still to FIGS. 23A-B, cellular phone module 2320 includes a cellular transceiver 254 and an integrated or external cellular telephone antenna 255. In a standard configuration shown in FIG. 23A, cellular phone module 232 accepts digital information, such as digit dialing information, from handset module 2360 over data line 2321 and provides digital information, such as caller information, to handset module 2360 over data line 2321. Referring to FIG. 23B, in this embodiment, onboard computer 2310 provides digital information, such as dialing information or data for transmission to the server system, to cellular phone module 2320 and accepts digital information from cellular phone module 2320, such as map-related data. Cellular phone module 2320 also accepts and provides audio signals, typically speech signals, for telephone communication with the server system., 213100=An alternative version of the system makes use of a printed map to augment the user interface. The driver consults the map when interacting with the electronic system. Referring to FIG. 25, a user has a printed map 2510. In one use of the printed map, the map includes printed annotations, such as official road names, abbreviated names, numbers, or other codes for main roads, Cartesian coordinates along the horizontal and vertical edges of the map, and coded identifiers of is road segments. Rather than entering the street name and number of an address, for example, the driver looks up the general location on the map, and enters the specification (e.g., the Cartesian coordinates) of the destination. The user interface of the electronic system is greatly simplified. For example, in the system shown in FIG. 23, in which the input and output capabilities are limited to those available on a telephone handset, the coordinates of a destination can be quickly entered using the keyboard., 120949=Route planning (line 1561, FIG. 15B), 216352=Referring to FIGS. 26A-B, another alternative version of the system is self-contained in a handset-sized unit, an \u201cinformation pod\u201d 2600. This version of the system does not require significant integration with the vehicle since it does not use vehicle sensors, and it has integrated communication electronics. Information pod 2600 has an integrated GPS receiver 2610 and cellular transceiver 2612 and antenna 2613. Optionally, the information pod can be coupled to a cellular booster and external antenna to provide greater communication range than possible solely using the integrated cellular transceiver. Information pod 2600 has a voice input/output module 2614, including a microphone 2620 and a speaker 2622. Information pod 2600 also has selector switches 2616, including switches for accessing traffic information, police, roadside assistance, concierge, and personal information services., 91257=For the guidance phase, database 432 includes additional tables that the in-vehicle system uses to plan a route from a determined location (latitude and longitude) to a desired destination or an intermediate point on a previously planned route. For instance, the main roads network 1000 (FIG. 10) is stored in data tables in in-vehicle database 432., 203817=Referring still to FIG. 23B, onboard computer is optionally coupled to sensors 230 and to display 240. Sensors 230 provide information related to the distance and direction traveled by the vehicle. Display 230 provides graphical output instead of, or in addition to, that provided through display 2362 in handset 2360., 94906=Several tables shown in FIG. 11 store lists of text names. These include Country table 1120, StreetName table 1170, State table 1140, and CityState table 1130. In FIG. 11, references to records are shown as providing a direct access to the stored text representations., 206457=By including local road information on regional maps 2410, the in-vehicle system can, in certain situations, determine a route from a source to a destination locations without requiring the services of a server system. If the vehicle is within the boundaries of regional map 2410 and the user enters a destination that is also within the boundaries of regional map 2410, on-board computer 2420 computes the shortest path based on the data stored in regional map 2410. On-board computer 2410 does not have to make contact with server system 125 in order to determine the route to follow, but optionally does so to acquire traffic information which it then uses to determine the best route to follow., 35420=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/252,432, filed Feb. 18, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,707,421, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/104,275, filed Oct. 14, 1998, and which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/136,868, filed Aug. 19, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,694, which claimed the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/056,150, filed Aug. 19, 1997., 214589=Referring still to FIG. 25, a translucent overlay 2550 is placed over a display 2540. Display 2540 has limited resolution, for instance, being formed by an array of point LEDs that can be individually illuminated. Overlay 2550 has printed features that augment the point illuminations of the LEDs. In one alternative, overlay 2550 has a printed map showing the main roads in a region. The LEDs are then used to indicate a point on a main road, for instance, indicating a point of congestion on a highway. In another alternative, overlay 2550 does not necessarily show roads, but rather illustrates geographic areas, such as quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE) or boundaries of cities. The illumination of one or more points is used, for example, to indicate general regions of traffic congestion. The general location of the vehicle, or the destination of a route can also be indicated using such a overlay. In yet another alternative approach, the \u201coverlay\u201d may not be removable, for instance, being permanently attached to display 2540. Driver can have a variety of overlay maps. These overlay maps can correspond to printed maps which provide additional detail., 119000=Referring still to FIG. 18, the route replanning procedure involves first estimating the vehicle's location on main roads network 1000 (FIG. 10) that is stored in the vehicle. The GPS location estimate is used to find a link along which the vehicle is traveling (line 1811)., 201667=Onboard computer 2310 generates audio instructions which it passes to handset module 2360 over the audio path coupling the onboard computer and the handset module. Alternatively, the onboard computer can pass the audio instructions through an external speaker system, for example, through the vehicle's audio system. The audio signal can include spoken instructions, for example, using synthesized or recorded speech. In alternative embodiments, rather than sending a speech signal from computer 2310 to handset module 2360, handset module 2360 emits tones in response to digital signals passed from onboard computer 2310, or in response to audio signals synthesized by onboard computer 2310., 196821=Referring to FIG. 23B, in this version of the system, an onboard computer 2310 couples cellular phone module 2320 and handset module 2360. Onboard computer 2310 is configured such that the driver uses handset module 2360 to make and receive cellular phone calls essentially in the same way as he or she would using the handset module in the standard configuration shown in FIG. 23A. Additionally, onboard computer 2310 is configured to provide driver information services to the driver using handset module 2360 for the interface with the driver, and using cellular phone module 2320 for access to the server system using cellular telephone is communication. The system illustrated in FIG. 23B provides similar capabilities as those of the system shown in FIG. 2. In particular, onboard computer 2310 provides the navigation and control of user interface functionality provided by onboard computer 210 (FIG. 2). However, rather than using separate I/O devices 240 (FIG. 2) to provide input and output for the driver information system, onboard computer 2310 uses the input and output components of handset module 2360 instead., 99137=Additional tables in in-vehicle database 432 (FIG. 4) are used during the guidance phase when the vehicle is determined to be off route. In particular, these tables encode main roads network 1000 (FIG. 10). Referring to FIG. 13A, a representative link of main roads network 1000 joins a node i 1301 and a node j 1302. Link c 1307 joins nodes i 1301 and j 1302. Link c 1307 includes two shape points 1303 and 1303. Node i 1301 is also connected to links a 1305 and b 1306 and node j 1302 is also connected to links d 1308 and e 1309., 97894=Record 1452 in POIList table 1450 includes a StreetName field 1454, which references a record in StreetRecord table 1160, an Address field 1456 that encodes the street number associated with the address of the point of interest, a PhoneNumber field 1458 which encodes the telephone number of the point of interest, and a Latitude/Longitude field 1460 which encodes the latitude and longitude of the point of interest., 66497=The in-vehicle system also has a preloaded main roads network 1000, which is a stored version of the map that includes only main and larger roadways (i.e., it does not include residential roads). A portion of the main roads network 1000 is shown in FIG. 10. Main roads network 1000 has a similar form as the server's road is network 700 shown in FIG. 7, except that fewer links are included. For reference, the planned route 792 is illustrated by a dotted line., 160063=In the second mode of traffic data collection, the in-vehicle system makes use of information in its link speeds database 1910, which includes expected travel speeds for all the links in main roads network 100. Multiple travel times are stored for each link, for instance, to account for the variations due to morning and evening busy periods. For each link, the following information is recorded:, 94472=Referring back to record 1112 in AddressCityState table 1110, CityState field 1116 references a record 1132 in CityState table 1130. Record 1132 includes a City field 1134 that encodes the text representation of the name of the city, and a State field 1136 that references a record 1142 in a State table 1140 that encodes the name of the state., 186621=Another service provided by server system 125 a is implemented by a communication system 2260. Communication system 2260 is coupled to external communication systems, including an email system 2262 and a paging system 2264. These external communication systems forward messages addressed to particular vehicles to communication system 2260. Communication system 2260 requests from gateway system 2210 that a data communication channel be established with the particular vehicles, and then passes data and commands to the in-vehicle systems., 120740=Starting location determination (line 1503, FIG. 15A), 185304=The server computers include a navigation system 2250 on which the navigation application described above executes. When an in-vehicle system initiates a communication session with server system 125 a to request a route planning service, gateway system 2210 determines that the session should be connected to navigation system 2250 using information provided by the in-vehicle system in the communication session. For instance, the in-vehicle system identifies the navigation service in the initial portion of the data stream. Alternatively, different services implemented by server system 125 a have different telephone numbers that are assigned to telephone interface 320, and gateway system 2210 routes the communication to the appropriate server computer based on the number called by the in-vehicle system., 171525=Referring to FIG. 22B, a second approach to updating the in-vehicle system involves transferring data to the in-vehicle system over a high-speed (e.g., up to 1 Mb/s) data connection. The in-vehicle system includes a data interface 2020 that is connected to onboard computer 210 in in-vehicle system 105. A source of the update data is connected to the data interface. For instance, a high-speed connection 2010 can be connected to service equipment 2030 at a dealership or a service center which downloads the updated information using industry standard communication protocols, such as Ford's SCP or the SAE J1850 protocol. Alternatively, an owner of a vehicle can connect a personal computer 2031 (such as a laptop computer) to the in-vehicle system. Updates for the in-vehicle system would be obtained by the owner on a recorded medium 2040, such as a CD-ROM, or over the Internet. Connection 2011 between the personal computer and the in-vehicle system can use a wireless connection, such as an infra-red link., 151802=The in-vehicle system uses the GPS (or DGPS) based latitude and longitude estimates to search through the list of nodes in MasterNode table 1310. Sequential GPSbased position estimates, or the output of the magnetic compass, are used to determine a direction of travel along a link joining to adjacent nodes. This then determines which link in LinkSegments table 1330 the vehicle is traveling on, and the direction of travel along that link. The in-vehicle system then executes a shortest path search (e.g., an A* search) starting at that link to one of the maneuver or way points along the planned route. A number of points, or alternatively all points, on either side of the last maneuver point are used as points at which the replanned route can join up with the previously planned route. For instance, ten points before and after the last detected maneuver point can be used. Limiting the number of points can reduce the amount of computation (time and memory) required to replan the route. If there are fewer than ten remaining points, then the actual desired destination is one of the points that the replanned route can \u201cjoin\u201d to planned route., 157698=Occasionally, for example when vehicle leaves the main roads network, or periodically, such as daily, the in-vehicle system sends the logged profile information it has stored in link speed log 1920 to the server system over a data connection that the in-vehicle system initiates over a cellular telephone connection with the is server system. After it has sent the information, the in-vehicle system clears its link speed log., 204197=In FIG. 23B, onboard computer 2420 is shown directly connected to handset 2360, cellular phone module 2320, sensors 230, and display 240. In an alternative embodiment, some or all of these components communicate over a bus within the vehicle, or through in-vehicle radio-frequency communication. For instance, display 240 may be a general information display that is controlled via a standardized in-vehicle data bus. In other embodiments, onboard computer 2420 is coupled to additional in-vehicle devices, such as a vehicle diagnosis system, or a paging receiver, over a communication bus., 74515=Referring to FIGS. 2A-C, an integrated I/O device 241 includes display 242 and a set of four rocker switches that are part of input device 244. One rocker switch is dedicated to \u201cmenu\u201d and \u201ccancel\u201d inputs while the other three are reconfigurable. Referring to FIG. 2A, display 242 is at times used to display both text commands and graphical representations of commands. Referring to FIGS. 2B-C, display 242 is used at times to provide visual feedback to the operator when inputting information. FIG. 2B illustrates selection from a list and FIG. 2C illustrates spelled input in which the operator uses the rotary switch to select letters to spell an input word., 141323=Maneuver notification and detection (FIG. 17, lines 1712-1722)., 91647=Referring to FIG. 11, an AddressCityState table 1110 in in-vehicle database 432 includes a series of records that associate (Country,State,City) combinations with a series of (Street,Address Range) combinations. A typical record 1112 in AddressCityState table 1110 includes a Country field 1114 that references the name of a country in a Country table 1120. Country table 1120 holds the text representations of the names of known countries, such as \u201cUnited States\u201d or \u201cCanada.\u201d Record 1112 also has a CityState field 1116 which is a reference to a CityState table 1130 that is used to determine the text representation of a city and state in the country referenced by Country field 1114. Record 1112 also includes an AddressStreet field 1118 that references the first of a range of records 1159 in an AddressStreet table 1150. Directly after record 1112 in AddressCityState table 1110, a record 1113 includes an AddressStreet field 1119 that references the next record 1153 after range 1158, thereby defining the records in range 1158., 96115=Referring to FIG. 14, an additional set of tables supports entry of a destination in terms of a \u201cpoint of interest\u201d (POI). Points of interest are divided by type, such as \u201crestaurants,\u201d \u201cATM machines,\u201d and \u201cgas stations.\u201d A POIType table 1410 includes a sequence of records. A typical record 1412 in POIType table 1410 includes a Type field 1414 that references a record 1422 in a POITypes table 1420. Record 1422 is a text representation of the type of POI., 203359=Onboard computer 2310 optionally provides a speech recognition capability whereby the driver speaks commands into voice input/output device 2366 rather than entering them on keypad 2364. Onboard computer 2310 processes the spoken commands, or alternatively, passes the speech signal to a remote server that performs all or some of the speech recognition function and returns the result to the onboard computer., 204932=Another alternative version of the system makes use of a combination of autonomous and client/server operation. Referring to FIG. 24, a hybrid in-vehicle system 2400 includes an on-board computer 2420 coupled to a remote server system 125 through a communication system 250 over a wireless communication link of a cellular telephone system. As in the system shown in FIG. 1, server system 125 makes use of map information 360 provided by map provider 160., 96642=Record 1412 of POIType table 1410 includes an Offset field 1416 that references a first record 1432 of a range 1444 of records in a POINameCity table 1430. An Offset field 1417 of a record 1413 that immediately follows record 1412 in POIType table 1410 references a record 1446 in POINameCity table 1430 that immediately follows range 1444 of records in POIType table 1410.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. Other versions of this type of information pod provide route planning and limited navigation capabilities using speech recognition. For instance the driver speaks a desired destination. The speech is either processed in the information pod, or transmitted as it is spoken to the server, along with the GPS location of the vehicle. The server system then transmits the directions to the vehicle. An alternative embodiment of the information pod incorporates a small display, such as display 2540 shown in FIG. 25.
