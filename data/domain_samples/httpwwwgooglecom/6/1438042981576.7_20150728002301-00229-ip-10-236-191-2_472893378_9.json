In this method, equimolar aqueous solutions of the polymer and the drug were mixed at room temperature and then diluted further with water. Complexes of PEG-1500-DMOI with camptothecin were formed by each of these methods and studied by 2D-NMR. When the polymer-drug complex was formed in chloroform, the drug interacted exclusively with the pendant alkyl chains of the polymer. When the polymer-drug complex was formed by mixing in water, the drug interacted with the alkyl chains as well as the ethylene glycol moieties of the backbone., 87490=In other experiments using this encapsulation method, PEG-1500-DMOI was complexed with either camptothecin or etoposide by combining the polymer and drug in a 4:1 chloroform/methanol mixture, then evaporating the resulting mixture overnight at room temperature under vacuum. The residue was treated with 5 ml water and filtered to remove any uncomplexed camptothecin. The solution was then examined with UV spectroscopy to determine the amount of complexed drug. The loading was found to be 1.25% and 3.1% (w/w), respectively., 95803=In this single dose study, PEG-1500-DMOI-complexed neomycin B was found to inhibit HIV production at a concentration that is significantly lower (15 \u03bcM) than previously reported for the unencapsulated neomycin B (2,500-5,000 \u03bcM), an activity enhancement of at least 150-fold., 90646=Yanagida and colleagues reported that 25 \u03bcM of non-encapsulated kazugamycin blocks HIV-1 Rev function in CD4+HeLa cells, with decreased cell proliferation and necrosis occurring at 35 \u03bcM concentration (Zapp, Cell, 74:969-978, 1993). PEG-1500-DMOI-complexed kazugamycin A was found to abolish Rev function at much lower drug-equivalent concentrations (4.2 \u03bcm vs. 25 \u03bcm for free drug), and cell necrosis occurred at 20 \u03bcM, indicating a significant improvement in cell culture drug efficacy, as well as in cell culture therapeutic index due to encapsulation., 83756=Other polymers were prepared by the same procedure, using dimethyl-5-hydroxyisophthalate and dimethyl-5-butyloxyphthalate esters in place of the octyloxy compound, and/or tetraethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol (HEG), PEG-400 (n=9), PEG-600 (n=13), or PEG-900 (n=20) in place of the PEG-1500. Except for HEG, the value of n for the PEGs is an average value supplied by the vendor. Because of the polydispersity in the starting PEGs, the degree of polymerization (DP) of the final polymers is likely to show greater polydispersity than would be expected if a discrete PEG were used. The polydispersity of the starting PEGs can be minimized, if desired, for example, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) fractionation., 91228=In mammalian cell cultures, 1 mM extracellular unencapsulated thiostrepton has no detectable effect on cell growth or cell morphology. However, thiostrepton complexed with PEG-1500-DMOI repressed host cell translation at concentrations as low as 20 \u03bcM (drug-equivalent). At higher concentrations (e.g., 30 \u03bcM), loss of cell viability was seen. Host cell translation was monitored by the expression of inducible \u03b2-galactosidase activity; cell viability was monitored spectrophotometrically using XTT dye. Cell death at such low concentrations of encapsulated thiostrepton suggests a significant increase in intracellular drug concentration and disruption of peptide elongation., 75289=Complexes of the new polymers with drugs can be administered, for example, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as physiological saline, in combination with other drugs, and/or together with appropriate excipients. The complexes can, for example, be administered by injection, intravenously, intraarterially, subdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; or orally, buccally, nasally, transmucosally, in an ophthalmic preparation, or by inhalation, with a dosage ranging from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight every 8 to 120 hours, or according to the requirements of the particular drug. However, as is well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one patient depends upon many factors, including the patient's weight, body surface area, age, the particular compound to be administered, sex, time and route of administration, general health, and other drugs being administered concurrently. Also, because the polymers can hold both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs in their interiors until they are delivered into cells, and can aid the drugs in evading the metabolic (e.g., clearance) and immune systems, the dosages required may be less than the dosages required of traditional formulations. The effectiveness and/or bioavailability can be increased 1000-fold or more in some cases by the new polymers., 42011=This invention was made with Government support under National Institutes of Health Grant No. 9-R44-GM52363-02. The Government has certain rights in the invention., 84897=A solution of DCC (0.165 g, 0.8 mmole) in dry dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added dropwise to a solution of folic acid (0.3820 g, 0.8 mmole) in dry DMSO. The reaction was stirred at room temperature. A solution of a hydroxyl-terminal PEG-1500-DMOI prepared according to the procedure of Example 2 (6.80 g, 0.4 mmole) in dry DMSO was added dropwise to the DCC/folic acid mixture, and the resulting solution was stirred overnight. The DMSO was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in a 0.03 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The aqueous solution was then extracted with chloroform and cyclohexane, neutralized with aqueous hydrochloric acid, and dialyzed for one hour. The water was removed under reduced pressure and the product was dried in vacuo overnight. The resulting greenish-yellow powder was analyzed by carbon and proton NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, and confirmed to be the desired end-capped derivative., 88857=Neomycin, kazugamycin, thiostrepton, and erythromycin were complexed with the polymer at 1:1 molar ratio by mixing equimolar concentrated solutions of polymer and drug, followed by dilution in water. Inhibition of cellular HIV Rev function was examined in several cell lines for both the free drug and the polymer-drug complexes, as follows., 86061=Benzo[a]Pyrene (BP), a dye and potent carcinogen, was chosen as a hydrophobic model because BP encapsulation within aqueous micelles of the PEG-1500-DMOI polymer can be monitored by UV absorption spectroscopy. The amount of dye encapsulated in the micelles was readily determined by UV spectroscopy since an absorbance signal due to benzo[a]pyrene appeared in the 340-450 nm region only when the dye was solubilized within the aqueous micelle. Different concentrations of dye were prepared in dichloromethane and each was added to a constant amount of polymeric micelle solution (1 ml of 100 mg/ml). Polymer-dye complex films were cast on glass and dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. The films were then removed and redissolved in water by sonication at 35\ufffd C. for 10 minutes, and purified by filtration from excess dye. A homogenous, stable solution of the dye was formed at concentrations of more than 0.25 wt %, indicating partitioning of the dye into the micellar core. The maximum loading capacity of the dye was 0.88% (w/w). Benzo[a]pyrene complexes with PEG-1500 polymers were found to be stable for more than a month at room temperature. A partition coefficient of 5\ufffd104 was determined, indicating strong partitioning. Experiments with polymers formed with dimethyl-hydroxyisophthalate (DMI) or DMI linkers did not allow significant encapsulation of BP within their micelles., 41745=This invention claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/232,937, filed Sep. 15, 2000, incorporated by reference in its entirety., 91924=Neomycin B complexed with PEG-1500-DMOI was then tested for inhibition of Rev function in chronically infected U1 cells in a cell-cell infectivity assay of HIV replication. The results are shown in Table 1 below., 96098=In contrast, PEG-1500-DMOI-encapsulated erythromycin showed no significant differences from unencapsulated erythromycin, which is already highly membrane-permeable. Importantly, however, the erythromycin/polymer complex showed no cytotoxicity, suggesting that the cytotoxicity observed for the polymer-drug complexes of neomycin, thiostrepton, and kazugamycin was not caused by the polymer but by the increased intracellular drug concentration., 82931=A mixture of the dimethyl-5-octyloxyisophthalate ester prepared in Example 1 (15 mmole), PEG-1500 (n=34; 30 mmole), and dibutyltin diacetate (5% w/w) was stirred at 120-130\ufffd C. under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours. The mixture was then heated to 200\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. The reaction was allowed to continue for an additional 2 hours at 200\ufffd C. under reduced pressure (<1 mmHg). The crude product was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF), then precipitated with hexane. The product was dissolved in water and dialyzed (MW cutoff=1 kDa) to remove unreacted monomer units. Polymer yields were greater than 80%. The final product was characterized as dimethyl-end-capped 5-octyloxyisophthalate-PEG-1500 (PEG-500-DMOI) with greater than 99% purity by carbon and proton NMR, as well as by FTIR spectroscopy.}",

Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the new polymers can be used in any application that involves encapsulating compounds to improve their water solubility. Such compounds are not limited to drugs, but also include paints, dyes, cosmetic agents such as melanin, benzoyl peroxide, ultraviolet protection agents (e.g., sunscreens), insect repellants, and botulism toxin (e.g., for use in wrinkle reduction). Other Embodiments Equimolar amounts (i.e., 3 mmol) of dimethyl-5-[t-butoxy-dodecanyl ether]-isophthalate and polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500) in toluene (50 ml) were placed in a round-bottomed flask, and 50 mg of Candida Antartica Lipase (CAL) was added to the mixture. The flask was fitted with Dean-Stark apparatus and a needle was inserted for continuous bubbling of nitrogen (i.e., for methanol evaporation). The reaction mixture was gently stirred at 60\ufffd C. The reaction was monitored for the disappearance of the monomer using thin layer chromatography (TLC). After completion of the reaction (about three days), the reaction mixture was filtered to remove the enzyme, and the toluene was evaporated under vacuum. Water was added to the residue with stirring, and the mixture then filtered. The filtrate",
