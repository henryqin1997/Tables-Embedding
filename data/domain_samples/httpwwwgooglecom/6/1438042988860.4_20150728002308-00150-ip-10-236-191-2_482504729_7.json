No. 09/534,900 entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Assessing Hemodynamic Properties Within The Circulatory System Of A Living Subject\u201d filed Mar. 23, 2000, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/342,549 entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For The Noninvasive Determination Of Arterial Blood Pressure\u201d filed Jun. 29, 1999, both assigned to the Assignee hereof., 60223=The monitoring station 100 of FIG. 1 further includes a non-invasive blood pressure monitor 118 for monitoring the blood pressure of the subject. In the illustrated embodiment, the monitor 118 comprises a continuous non-invasive system adapted for use on a blood vessel. (e.g., radial artery) of the subject, such as the hemodynamic. parameter technique described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/534,900 entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Assessing Hemodynamic Properties Within The Circulatory System Of A Living Subject\u201d filed Mar. 23, 2000, and assigned to the assignee hereof, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This system uses a pressure transducer in conjunction with Doppler ultrasound to measure certain hemodynamic parameters associated with the circulatory system during controlled stenosis, from which a continuous and calibrated measurement of blood pressure is derived. Alternatively, other types of blood pressure monitoring devices may conceivably be used, such as the time-frequency waveform technique described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/342,549 entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For The Noninvasive Determination Of Arterial Blood Pressure\u201d filed Jun. 29, 1999, and assigned to the assignee hereof, which is also incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 66786=In the present embodiment, the pulse oximeter comprises a transmission-type finger clamp (FIG. 1b) which fits on the index finger of the subject during monitoring, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,724 entitled \u201cReusable Sensor Accessory Containing a Conformable Spring Activated Rubber Sleeved Clip,\u201d issued Sep. 22, 1998, assigned to Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc., and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It will be recognized, however, that other approaches and configurations may be substituted. For example, one alternative embodiment to the aforementioned finger clamp comprises a hand rest which includes a shaped enclosure into which the index finger of the subject is inserted when the subject's hand is lying upon the hand rest. The enclosure is equipped with the pulse oximetry components (e.g., light source and sensor) and shaped such that when the subject's index finger is positioned fully within the enclosure, the finger is automatically oriented in the proper location with respect to the source and sensor such that oximeter measurements may be obtained. This approach obviates having the subject or other individual clamp the oximeter probe onto and off of the subject's finger; rather, using the aforementioned alternate embodiment, the subject merely pushes their finger in the enclosure, and removes it therefrom when the measurement is completed. As yet another alternative, the source and sensor of the oximeter device may be moved automatically by the monitoring station 100 into the proper position (such as by using a small positioning motor) around the finger when the latter is inserted into the enclosure. Many other such variations are possible, such as taking the oximetry measurements from other locations of the body (e.g., earlobe, toes and the forehead)., 31903=This application is a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) of the U.S. patent application No. 09/625,677 of the same title filed Jul. 25, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 111933=Referring now to FIG. 12, the method of monitoring physiologic parameters according to the present invention is described. In the embodiment of FIG. 12, the method 1200 comprises measuring a first physiologic parameter from a blood vessel of the subject per step 1202; measuring a second physiologic parameter from the subject per step 1204; measuring a third physiologic parameter from the subject per step 1206; comparing data derived from the measurements of the first, second, and third physiologic parameters to predetermined values of those parameters, respectively (step 1208); and identifying when at least a portion of the data bears a predetermined relationship to at least one of the predetermined values (steps 1210, 1211, 1212). In the embodiment of FIG. 12, the first parameter measured comprises blood pressure, the second heart rate (as derived from ECG measurement), and the third the weight of the subject, although it will be recognized that different, fewer, or additional parameters may be measured. As previously described, the monitoring station is programmed with predetermined values or ranges of values acceptable for the given subject; these values may be either entered by the subject, entered remotely via a caregiver at a remote location using a communications terminal as in FIG. 9, or entered via a pre-programmed portable device such as discussed above. These values are compared to the measurements obtained from the subject via the foregoing apparatus, and the relationship between the measured data and acceptable values/ranges identified. The subject's caregiver is provided the results of this comparison via a communications channel per step 1213 so as to permit ongoing evaluation of the subject's condition from a remote location in real time per step 1214. The caregiver may then recommend and implement a course of treatment for the subject, and/or additional monitoring, via the aforementioned communications channel per step 1216., 110363=FIG. 10 illustrates a second embodiment of the system for exchanging information according to the invention. In this embodiment, the monitoring station 1002 is coupled to a packet switched digital data network 1004 such as the Internet via an access provider 1005. A local area network 1006 is also coupled to the digital data network 1004, the former comprising a plurality of different remote nodes 1008 and at least one server 1010 each operatively connected to the network 1006, although it will be appreciated that other configurations having more or less nodes, architectures, and/or servers may be employed consistent with the invention. Hence, the term \u201ccomputer network\u201d as used herein may include, but is not limited to, local-area networks (LAN), wide-area networks (WAN), intranets, the Internet, and may utilize any topology, protocol, or physical medium for communication including Ethernet, X.25, token ring, frame relay, ATM, SONET. Hence, as used herein, the term \u201ccomputer network\u201d is meant in its broadest sense to include any type of network capable of transmitting digital data between users. For example, the well known voice over internet protocol (VoIP), which utilizes an IP network and a series of interposed gateways to transfer information from the local loop of the subject to that of the remote station(s) as illustrated in FIG. 11, may be used to transfer voice data and other information if desired.}",
