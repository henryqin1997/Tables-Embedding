    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6343=Another embodiment of the tissue connector assembly is shown in FIG. 11, and generally indicated with reference numeral 1101. FIG. 11 shows the tissue connector assembly 1101 with a fastener 1300 in an open (deformed) position. The tissue connector assembly 1101 is similar to the tissue connector assembly 110, the major difference being the attachment of a multiple loop fastener 1300 to flexible member 118. The loops may be helical, spiral, or have other looping shapes, including variations in loop shape from loop-to-loop and changes in shape along the loop to aid in the clipping functions discussed subsequently. The loops may also have bends or turns at the wire 34 ends. FIG. 11 shows the tissue connector assembly 1101 with a fastener 1300 in an open (deformed) position. The fastener 1300 includes the restraining device 124 c comprising a coil 26 and a locking device 128 c. The transition from the distal end portion 106 a of restraining device 124 c is shown in FIG. 12D. Alternatively, the restraining device 124 a and locking device 128 a could be substituted for those in the embodiment of FIG. 11.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30609=The present application is a continuation-in-part of patent applications Ser. No. 09/090,305, filed Jun. 3, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,593 and Ser. No. 09/260,623, filed Mar. 1, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,613,059., 34200=Many factors contribute to the difficulty of performing arterial replacement or bypass grafting. See generally, Wylie, Edwin S. et al., Manual of Vascular Surgery, (Springer-Verlag New York), 1980. One such factor is that the tissues to be joined must be precisely aligned with respect to each other to ensure the integrity and patency of the anastomosis. If one of the tissues is affixed too close to its edge, the suture can rip through the tissue and impair both the tissue and the anastomosis. Another factor is that, even after the tissues are properly aligned, it is difficult and time consuming to pass the needle through the tissues, form the knot in the suture material, and ensure that the suture material does not become tangled. These difficulties are exacerbated by the small size of the artery and graft. The arteries subject to peripheral vascular and cardiovascular surgery typically range in diameter from several millimeters to several centimeters. A graft is typically about the same size as the artery to which it is being attached. Another factor contributing to the difficulty of such procedures is the limited time available to complete the procedure. The time the surgeon has to complete an arterial replacement or bypass graft is limited because there is no blood flowing through the artery while the procedure is being done. If blood flow is not promptly restored, sometimes in as little as thirty minutes, the tissue the artery supplies may experience significant damage, or even death (tissue necrosis). In addition, arterial replacement or bypass grafting is made more difficult by the need to accurately place and space many sutures to achieve a permanent hemostatic seal. Precise placement and spacing of sutures is also required to achieve an anastomosis with long-term patency., 115361=As before, it is noted that as the locking device 128 c is squeezed two steps are accomplished. The fastener 1301 is released from the locking device 128 c, thus allowing the coil 26 to uncompress and the wire 34 to move to its closed configuration, and the flexible member 118 is released from the fastener. Thus, in the embodiment shown, the locking device 128 c provides for simultaneous actuating closure of the fastener 1301 and release of the flexible member 118 and needle 116 from the fastener., 114362=A second stitch is then performed with the tissue connector assembly 1101, as shown in FIG. 14D. With both stitches threaded, the surgeon releases locking device 128 c. The multiple loop fastener 1301 assumes the shape of the double stitched fastener, and the needle 116 and flexible member 118 are removed. Specifically, a surgical instrument (e.g., needle holder) is used to radially squeeze locking device 128 c to release the locking device from the fastener 1301. Upon removal of the locking device 128 c, the coil 26 moves to its free uncompressed state which allows the wire 34 to return to its original undeformed closed position (FIG. 13A). As the wire 34 moves to the closed position the adjacent tissues of the graft vessel 12 and artery 14 are squeezed together to securely engage the graft vessel and artery (FIGS. 14C)., 38061=As explained above, anastomoses are commonly formed in open surgery by suturing together the tissues to be joined. However, one known system for applying a clip around tissues to be joined in an anastomosis is disclosed in a brochure entitled, \u201cVCS Clip Applier System\u201d, published in 1995 by Auto Suture Company, a Division of U.S. Surgical Corporation. A clip is applied by applying an instrument about the tissue in a nonpenetrating manner, i.e., the clip does not penetrate through the tissues, but rather is clamped down around the tissues. As previously explained, it is imperative in forming an anastomosis that tissues to be joined are properly aligned with respect to each other. The disclosed VCS clip applier has no means for positioning tissues. Before the clip can be applied, the tissues must first be properly positioned with respect to each other, for example by skewering the tissues with a needle as discussed above in common suturing techniques or with forceps to bring the tissues together. It is extremely difficult to perform such positioning techniques in minimally invasive procedures., 119447=Both of needles 116\u2033 and 116\u2033 are pulled to located fastener 1501 as shown in FIG. 17C. The multiple loop fastener 1501 assumes the shape of the double stitched fastener, and the needles 116 and flexible members 118 are removed. Specifically, a surgical instrument (e.g., needle holder) is used to radially squeeze locking device 128 c to release the locking device from the fastener 1501. Upon removal of the locking device 128 c, the coil 26 moves to its free uncompressed state which allows the wire 34 to return to its original undeformed closed position (FIG. 13A). As the wire 34 moves to the closed position the adjacent tissues of the graft vessel 12 and artery 14 are squeezed together to securely engage the graft vessel and artery (FIGS. 14C)., 118585=A second stitch is then performed with the tissue connector assembly 1502, as shown in FIG. 17B. The surgeon grasps the needle 116\u2033 with a needle holder (e.g., surgical pliers, forceps, or any other suitable instrument) and inserts the needle 116\u2033 through artery 14 near opening and in a direction from the exterior of the artery to the interior of the artery. The surgeon then releases the needle 116\u2033 and grasps a forward end of the needle which is now located inside the artery 14. The surgeon pulls needle 116\u2033 and a portion of the suture 118\u2033 into artery 14 and pierces an end margin of graft vessel 12. The surgeon then releases the needle 116\u2033 and grasps a forward end of the needle which is now located inside the graft vessel 14., 69550=It is to be understood that the fastener 10, 40, 41, 43, 1300 and other fasteners described herein may have undeformed or deformed configurations different than those shown herein without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, a locking clip (not shown) may also be attached to connect the ends of the fasteners of this invention when the fastener is in its closed position to prevent possible opening of the fastener over time. The locking clip may also be integrally formed with one end of the fastener., 102038=In addition, assemblies providing multiple loop fasteners, such as assemblies 1101 and 1502, allow for forming more than one stitch per fastener. Tissue secured with a multiple stitch, self-closing fastener has many advantages over conventional suture. For example, it allows for a greater are of tissue to be connected per time. In addition, multiple loop fasteners 1300 or 1500 are more rigid and can be formed to provide a greater closing force on the tissue than can be provided by conventional suture., 120367=As before, it is noted that as the locking device 128 c is squeezed two steps are accomplished. The fastener 1501 is released from the locking device 128 c, thus allowing the coil 26 to uncompress and the wire 34 to move to its closed configuration, and flexible members 118 are released from the fastener. Thus, in the embodiment shown, the locking device 128 c provides for simultaneous actuating closure of the fastener 1501 and release of the flexible member 118 and needle 116 from the fastener., 100293=As noted above, the tissue connector assemblies 1, 110, 1101, and 1502 of this invention have many uses. They may be especially useful in minimally invasive surgical procedures including creating an anastomosis between vascular graft 12 and artery 14 (FIGS. 2A-2C). The anastomosis may be used to replace or bypass a diseased, occluded or injured artery. A coronary bypass graft procedure requires that a source of arterial blood flow be prepared for subsequent bypass connection to a diseased artery. An arterial graft may be used to provide a source of blood flow, or a free graft may be used and connected at the proximal end to a source of blood flow. Preferably, the source of blood flow is one of any number of existing arteries which may be dissected in preparation for the bypass graft procedure. In many instances it is preferred to use the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) or the right internal mammary artery (RIMA), for example. Other vessels which may be used include the saphenous vein, gastroepiploic artery in the abdomen, radial artery, and other arteries harvested from the patient's body as well as synthetic graft materials, such as DACRON\ufffd or GORETEX\ufffd (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene). If a free graft vessel is used, the upstream end of the dissected vessel, which is the arterial blood source, will be secured to the aorta to provide the desired bypass blood flow, as is well known by those skilled in the art. The downstream end of the graft vessel is trimmed for attachment to an artery, such as the left anterior descending coronary (LAD). It is to be understood that the anastomosis may be formed in other vessels or tissue.}",

It is recognized that departures from the disclosed embodiment may be made within the scope of the invention and that obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. The full scope of the invention is set out in the claims that follow and their equivalents. Accordingly, the claims and specification should not be construed to unduly narrow the full scope of protection to which the invention is entitled. All references cited above are incorporated herein by reference. It will be observed from the foregoing that the tissue connector assemblies of the present invention have numerous advantages. Importantly, the assemblies are easier and faster to apply than conventional sutures which require tying multiple knots. The assemblies may be used in minimally invasive procedures including endoscopic procedures, and may be inserted single handedly. Although the suturing procedure has been described for an end-to-side anastomosis, it should be appreciated that the procedure is applicable to an end-to-end and side-to-side anastomosis, connecting various tissue structures including single and multiple tissue structures, and puncture sites, and connecting tissue to a prosthetic graft or valve, for example. As before, it is noted that as the locking device 128 c is squeezed two steps are accomplished. The fastener 1501 is released from the locking device 128 c, thus allowing the coil 26",
