No. 08/161,854 filed Dec. 6, 1993, abandoned., 29077=The address terminals 161, data terminals 171 and control terminals 181 seen in FIG. 1 are a simplified representation of the 68 pin PCMCIA standard interface which includes provision for 26 parallel address conductors (A0-A25), 16 parallel data conductors (D0-D15) and a remaining set of power and control conductors including power and ground connections and a collection of memory control signal connections (enable, select, wait, write, detect, etc.). The PCMCIA standard achieves interchangeability of cards of different functions by establishing standards for the physical card (dimensions and mechanical tolerances for the card and connectors), the card interface (pinout and signal definitions), and card software (which specifies the organization of data on the card and the record formats and protocols by which configuration information and data is exchanged with the host computer). Complete information which defines the PCMCIA standard is published by and available from the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association, 1030G East Duane Avenue, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94086. The present embodiment of invention conforms to the PC Card Standard Specification, Release 2.01, published in November, 1992., 32820=The smartcard I.C. includes its own processor 260 and non-volatile EEPROM memory circuits 257 which operate as a secret key information substorage system. The processor 260 within the smartcard I.C. 250 is programmed to store secret key codes within the EEPROM 257, but to thereafter prohibit the stored secret keys from being accessed by any external interrogation. The smartcard I.C. may be implemented with a number of available devices, including the ST16F48 CMSO MCU-based Safeguarded Smartcard IC, with 8k EEPROM, available for SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, a member of the SGS-Thomson ST16XYZ family of devices, as specified in the SGS-Thomson Data Book (April, 1993). The ST16F48 includes an 8-bit processor, 288 bytes of RAM scratchpad storage, an 8k byte EEPROM data memory which forms the secure substorage unit, and a 16k byte program storage read-only memory for storing processing routines, including routines for processing and validating key values supplied to and read from the smartcard I.C. via the UART 230.}",

Numerous modifications may be made to the methods and apparatus described without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. The DES and RSA Encryption schemes, as well as numerous other systems for the secure information transmission and retention are described in detail in Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C by Bruce Scheier, John Wiley & Sons (1994), ISBN 0471597562. The use of the detachable, password protected secure memory card contemplated by the present invention provides additional security by providing an improved key management mechanisms which requires that a would-be user of such a system have both physical possession of the memory card (which holds the needed key values) and knowledge of the password which permits the key values to be accessed. Alternatively, the smartcard I.C. may store one or more public key values such as the public key 435 which enables the host processor to send secure transmissions to a selected remote receiving computer in possession of the corresponding private key 460. In the same way, single key encryption mechanisms such as DES, and systems requiring the identification of remote senders using digital signature techniques can be readily implemented using the password protected secure memory card as the mechanism for storing the needed",
