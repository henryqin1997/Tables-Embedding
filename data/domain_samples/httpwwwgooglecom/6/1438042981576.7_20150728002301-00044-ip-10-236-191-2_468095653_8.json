Accordingly, the invention is only limited as set forth in the claims which follow. Reader synchronization may be done by wire or preferably using a self-synchronizing feature of the invention. If one interrogator is attempting to write to a tag, the modulation of the signal sent by that interrogator may cause interference with an adjacent interrogator. An integral part of the write cycle is to first read all data from the tag. During this reading time period, an adjacent interrogator can also read a tag if one is present, and consequently becomes synchronized automatically to the first interrogator. After both interrogators have acquired two frames of data from their respective tags, then both are ready to write and thus are in synchronization with each other. Time division multiplexing is used to separate the reader-to-tag communications from the tag-to-interrogator communications. Often, several or many interrogators must operate simultaneously in close proximity with one another. An example of such an installation is at a toll plaza on a toll road, tunnel, or bridge, where every lane may have an interrogator. In such installations, interrogators are synchronized so that the modulated signals produced by interrogators do not interfere with other interrogators reading data from other tags. Interference between interrogators while",
