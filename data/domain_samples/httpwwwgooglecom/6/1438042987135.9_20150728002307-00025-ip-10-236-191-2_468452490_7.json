Mud acid test-less than 4%, preferably less than 2%, acid solubility in 12-3 HCl-HF when tested for such solubility by API Recommended Practices for Testing Sand Used In Hydraulic Fracturing Operations, API RP 56, First edition, March, 1983. The sample being tested is held for one hour in the acid solution at room temperature, instead of 30 minutes at 65.6\ufffd C. as stated in the API procedure., 25532=The novolac epoxy resin used in developing this invention was an epoxy cresol novolac having the formula: ##STR2## wherein R' represents chlorohydrin, glycol, and/or polymeric ether moieties and was obtained from Ciba-Geigy Co. as ECN 1280 resin. The manufacturer's literature for this compound states that it is derived from orthocresolformaldehyde novolac reacted with epichlorohydrin to form a polyepoxide. Other properties of the resin are: molecular weight about 1170, epoxide equivalent weight 217-236, melting point 78\ufffd-99\ufffd C., melt viscosity 5000-15000 cps at 120\ufffd C., and epoxy functionality 4.1. The dust of this resin may be explosive, and appropriate safety precautions should be taken in handling it., 19020=(B) a coating surrounding the ceramic spheroids which coating comprises cured novolac epoxy resin containing less than one weight percent of fillers, such as minerals, which are soluble in aqueous 12:3 molar ratio HCl-HF solutions., 21541=Novolac epoxy resin compound contains less than 0.1% fillers which are soluble in 12:3 molar ratio HCl-HF., 26265=The fired ceramic spheroids may be made by a process comprising several steps. In the first step, binder, mineral particulate, water, and optionally alumina and/or silicon carbide (typically 0.1-50 and more usually 1-2 parts by weight SiC per 100 parts mineral particulate) are mixed and pelletized in order to form spheroid particles. Suitable mixing pelletizing apparatus are balling pans and machines known as mix pelletizers, such as the Littleford mixer and the Eirich machine., 34989=For a batch based on 300 g of 850/425 micrometer (20/40 mesh) fired ceramic spheroids, about 60 g of the above epoxy cresol novolac resin compound is added in equal aliquots of 30 g each. After the first aliquot of resin compound powder is added, the mixer speed is increased to number 2 on the Hobart machine, and two 1500W heat lamps, pointed at the inside of the mixer bowl, are turned on to raise temperature to approximately 130\ufffd-180\ufffd C. in the bowl. In about 2.0-10 minutes, the resin compound melts, flows around the spheroids, and coats them. Volatiles given off escape through an exhaust hood. Early in the coating period, the mass of spheroids and resin appear lumpy and tacky, but the end product is relatively free flowing. The second aliquot of resin compound is coated onto the spheroids in the same manner; however, the time required may be somewhat less. In addition, because of the greater surface area to be covered, smaller spheroids will require relatively more novolac epoxy resin compound on a weight ratio basis, and coarser spheroids will require less resin compound to attain desired coating thickness.}",

Various omissions, modifications and changes to the principles described herein may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention which is indicated by the following claims. ______________________________________ Novolac Coated Uncoated Spheroids Spheroids______________________________________Particle Size 850/425 micrometersSpecific Gravity 1.79 2.2Crush Resistance 1.2% 17%Mud Acid Resistance 1.6% 8%______________________________________ Data for one embodiment of the coated ceramic spheroids (made as described above with the fired ceramic spheroids and the epoxy cresol novolac compound described) and for uncoated fired ceramic spheroids is as follows: The coated spheroids are then removed from the mixer bowl and held at elevated temperature (e.g. 200\ufffd-250\ufffd C.) for about 1-1.5 hous, for example in an oven, to cure the resin coating. Longer cure times appear to yield product which is more resistant to weight loss from exposure to solvents such as toluene. For a batch based on 300 g of 850/425 micrometer (20/40 mesh) fired ceramic spheroids, about 60 g of the above epoxy cresol novolac resin compound is added in equal aliquots of 30 g each.
