Various modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. [0059] It has been stated that the semiconductor memory device incorporating the principles of this invention is such that the use of built-in ECC circuitry enables recovery or \u201crescue\u201d of data defects, in particular those occurring due to the quest for further reduction of power consumption. [0058] Additionally, DRAM cell arrays inherently call for execution of refresh operations with a certain time period or interval. To do this, DRAM chips are equipped with built-in refresh circuitry for automatically performing refresh operations by way of example\u2014in this case, no data will be read into the DQ buffer 5 during refresh operations. Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 4, the timing adjustment signal generator circuit 8 is kept inoperative in refresh cycles, resulting in halt or \u201cpause\u201d of the operation of ECC circuit 7. This in turn makes it possible to suppress or minimize waste power consumption. [0057] It must be noted that in a respective one of the above-stated embodiments, the ECC circuit 7 is preferably designed to",
