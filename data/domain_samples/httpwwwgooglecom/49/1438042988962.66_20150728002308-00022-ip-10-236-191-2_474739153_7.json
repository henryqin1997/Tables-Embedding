Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only in terms of the appended claims. It should be noted that the mini-spare takes the place of spare tire 14 e set forth in FIG. 1. In addition, the spare tire may also include a pressure sensing circuit such as that used in a typical rolling tire or a regular spare. The mini-spare is a lighter and more compact version of the regular spare tire. In step 364 a distance and speed warning is displayed in response to the distance and speed warning signal. The display may be displayed in a variety of manners set forth above such as on an LCD display, a navigation display, an LED display, warning chimes, or the like. When in step 360 the mini-spare distance threshold is not exceeded, step 358 is repeated. When the mini-spare threshold is exceeded a distance warning signal is generated in step 362. The distance warning signal may also be stored in the warning status memory. is the amount of time between the ith and (i\u22121)th measurement of vehicle speed. The distance traveled may also be obtained from odometer readings placed on the communication bus of the vehicle. where Di is the distance traveled from",
