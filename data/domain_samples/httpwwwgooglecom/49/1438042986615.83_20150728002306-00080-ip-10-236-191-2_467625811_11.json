    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{67014=Moreover, since the preformed unitary op tic array is comprised of a plurality of clad optical fiber strands disposed co-axially along their lengths each having two strand end faces, each optical fiber strand, upon illumination, is able to bring about and accomplish the following: (a) Individual formation of a single beam of light energy in a prechosen and restricted diameter (or cross-sectional breadth) which is limited and controlled directly only by the actual width size (diameter) of the optical fiber core contained within the cladding material comprising the strand; thus, as the core diameter of the optical fiber strand varies between about 1.0-50 micrometers, the comparable diameter or breadth of the individual beam of light energy resulting also will be varied from about 1.0-50 micrometers. The actual core size will be decided in advance and will accommodate the intended application or needs of the user. (b) Only those individual optical fiber strands comprising the unitary optic array which are actually illuminated by the broad shaft of light will provide an individual beam of light energy limited in cross-sectional breadth to a specific range. (c) Once an individual beam of light energy of limited size range is generated, the optical fiber strand will convey that generated light energy beam along its axial length to the other strand end face. (d) When the conveyed beam of light energy reaches the other (presumably the \u201cdistal\u201d) end face of the optical fiber strand, the individual beam of light energy will become discharged from the end face into the ambient environment as a size limited beam ranging typically from about 1-50 micrometers in breadth. (e) Depending upon the number of strand end faces actually illuminated at the \u201cproximal\u201d end surface of the unitary fiber optic array by the broad shaft of light, an equal number of micrometer-sized, individual beams of light energy will be concurrently generated and discharged from the \u201cdistal\u201d end surface of the unitary optic array. Thus, by carefully controlling the scope of illumination of the \u201cproximal\u201d optic surface by the broad shaft of light to only specifically chosen optical fiber strand end faces, the user can effect the controlled concurrent discharge of specifically positioned, multiple, individual beams of light energy each of which is limited in size to about 1.0-50 micrometers in breadth., 71245=As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the prepared fluid reaction mixture can be disposed directly upon and be held by the distal array end surface of the unitary optic array; or alternatively, the prepared fluid reaction mixture can be placed and contained on the surface of another discrete solid substrate in aligned position but at a fixed distance removed from the distal end surface of the unitary fiber optic array. However, regardless of the quantity of fluid reaction mixture actually disposed on the surface of the remote solid substrate or the distal array end surface, only the individual beams of light energy (limited in size to the 1.0-50 micrometer range) emanating as a patterned template from solely the precise positions of these four strand end faces\u2014S49, S51, S61 and S63\u2014will in this instance initiate photoactivation of the fluid reaction mixture; induce a photopolymerization of the fluid reactants; and cause a photodeposition upon the substrate of a three-dimensional polymer solid or gel. Thus, only those multiple individual beams of light energy discharged as a patterned template from these four optical fiber strands positions will effect photopolymerization and photodeposition; and the fabrication of nanometer or micrometer sized projections and cavities will occur at carefully controlled and precisely positioned points by the arranged silhouetted zones and the configured light energy zones provided by the patterned template and the fiber structure., 28566=As a concurrent but essentially unrelated series of developments, the use of optical fiber strands and fiber optic arrays, alone and in combination with light energy absorbing dyes, has rapidly evolved for imaging and biochemical, and chemical analytical determinations, particularly within the last decade. The use of optical fibers for such purposes and techniques is described by Milanovich et. al., \u201cNovel Optical Fiber Techniques For Medical Application\u201d, Proceedings of the SPIE 28th Annual International Technical Symposium On Optics And Electro-Optics, Volume 494, 1980; Seitz, W. R., \u201cChemical Sensors Based On Immobilized Indicators And Fiber Optics\u201d in C.R.C. Critical Reviews In Analytical Chemistry, Vol.19,1988, pp. 135-173; Wolfbeis, O. S., \u201cFiber optical Fluorosensors In Analytical Chemistry\u201d in Molecular Luminescence Spectroscopy, Methods And Applications (S. G. Schulman, editor), Wiley & Sons, New York (1988); Angel, S. M., Spectroscopy 2(4):38 (1987); and Walt et. al., \u201cChemical Sensors and Microinstrumentation\u201d, ACS Symposium Series, volume 403,1989, p. 252; Fiber Optical Chemical Sensors And Biosensors, (O. S. Wolfbeis, edition), CRC: Boca Raton, Fla., vol. 2, 1991, pp. 267-300; Biosensors With Fiber Optics, HUMANA, Clifton, N.J. 1991., 66180=It will be recognized and appreciated that as the broad shaft of light strikes each strand end face, the cladding surrounding each optical fiber of each strand allows only the individual optical fiber core (typically limited in diameter to a range of about 1.0-50 micrometers) to be illuminated by the totality of the light; and the cladding surrounding the core directly shields and effectively prevents each optical fiber strand end face from accepting light energy greater than about 1.0-50 micrometers in breadth due to the presence of the cladding material. Th us, each optical fiber strand end face comprising the optic end surface of the preformed unitary optic array individually creates and promulgates a single beam of light energy photons limited typically in breadth to a range from 1.0-50 micrometers., 122599=One can also photopolymerize a microstructure formed of polypyrrole on the distal end surface of a fiber optic array. The method of photopolymerization of pyrrole is based on the method reported by Segawa et. al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm. 1989, 132., 116971=A typical hydrophobic polymerization solution contained 500 \u03bcl (15-20% acryloxypropylmethyl siloxane; 80-85% dimethylsiloxane) copolymer [Gelest, Tullytown, Pa.], 30 mg benzoin ethyl ether [Aldrich] and 1000 \u03bcl of dichloromethane (Fisher). A typical hydrophilic polymerization solution contained 1 ml (5% ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 95% N-vinyl pyrrolidone) of monomer (Aldrich), 60 mg of benzoin ethyl ether, and 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7)., 60041=For purposes of clarity and ease of understanding, FIGS. 6-7 present a very limited and greatly reduced number of individually clad, optical fiber strands 102 present within the preformed optical array 104. A total of only 120 individually clad, fiber optical strands are seen to comprise the optical array 104 in greatly magnified and scale-exaggerated views. Moreover, the relationship of the optic array surface 112 (the intended distal end) with respect to the other optic array surface 114 (the intended proximal end) becomes simplified and more-readily appreciated when using this limited number of 120 optical fiber strands. In practice and reality, however, it is estimated that typically there are 2000-3000 optical fiber strands (commonly varying from about 1.0-5.0 micrometers in core breadth) in a conventional unitary fiber optic array which is often about 100 micrometers to about 1 centimeter in overall diameter. Thus the true total number of individually clad, optical strands forming the unitary imaging fiber optic array will typically be in the thousands and vary substantially with the cross-sectional breadth or diameter of each optical fiber core and the thickness of the cladding material employed when constructing the optical fiber strands themselves., 26756=Some reasonably defined and complex-patterned microstructures have been produced using differing techniques. For example, laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (\u201cLCVD\u201d) has been recently used to fabricate some complex well-defined microstructures [Wallenberger, F. T., Science 267: 1274-1275 (1995)]. Also, precision microstructures have been fabricated by the creation of hydrophobic templates from photoresists for the deposition of self-assembled monolayers (\u201cSAMs\u201d) on gold [Gorman et. al., Chem. Mater. 7:252-254 (1995); Singhvi et. al., Science 264:696-698 (1994)]. In addition, photoactivation techniques have also been used to fabricate some well-defined microstructures. As one representative example, photolithography has been used for information storage in photoconductive materials [Liu et. al. Science 261:897-899 (1993)]; in photoassembly of combinatorial libraries [Noble, D., Anal. Chem. 67:201A-204A (1995); Fodor et. al., Science 251: 767-773 (1991)]; and for site-selective covalent attachment of biomolecules [Yan et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115:814-816 (1993); Rozsnyai et. al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 31:759-761 (1992)]., 31274=Many of the recent improvements employing optical fiber sensors in both qualitative and quantitative analytical determinations concern the desirability of depositing and/or immobilizing various light absorbing dyes at the intended distal end of an imaging optical fiber. For this purpose, a variety of different optical fiber chemical sensors and methods have been reported for specific analytical determinations and applications such as pH measurement, oxygen detection, and carbon dioxide analyses.

The methodology can employ any source of light energy of determinable wavelength and intensity to provide a broad shaft of light; and provides masking means for converting the broad shaft of light energy into a prechosen photopattern of light energy rays having a fixed configuration. When employed with the unitary fiber optic array, the light energy ray photopattern provided by the masking means will generate not only multiple individual beams of light energy having a limited and prechosen breadth ranging from about 1.0-50 micrometers in size, but also cause the discharged multiple individual beams of light energy present an overall template of arranged silhouetted zones and configured light energy zones which will create a precisely defined patterned arrangement for the polymer microstructure to be fabricated., 72892=The present methodology intends that a fluid prepolymer reaction mixture be prepared that can be photocrosslinked to yield a resulting polymer product. At a minimum, the fluid prepolymer reaction mixture will comprise at least one photoinitiator; optionally one fluid solvent, organic and/or inorganic; and at least one chemical entity selected from the group consisting of monomers, dimers, oligomers, copolymers, and homopolymers that can be photocrosslinked into a solid, three-dimensional, polymeric product. When light energy of the appropriate wavelength and intensity (particularly in the form of a patterned template having arranged silhouetted zones and configured light energy zones) is directed to a quantity or aliquot of prepared fluid prepolymer reaction mixture disposed upon the surface of a solid substrate, a photoinitiated chemical reaction occurs within a set or fixed period of time. The photoinitiated chemical reaction causes a cross-linking effect among the reactants of the reaction mixture; and causes the fabrication and photodeposition of a three-dimensional polymer microstructure on the surface of the solid substrate. Moreover, the effect of the patterned template of arranged silhouetted zones and configured light energy zones causes the fabricated polymer microstructure to present one or more shaped polymeric projections having a breadth ranging from about 0.5-50 micrometers which correspond in shape to the configured light energy zones of the patterned template; and correspondingly, the fabricated polymer microstructure also presents one or more shaped cavities having a breadth ranging from about 0.1-50 micrometers which correspond in shape to the arranged silhouetted zones of the patterned template. After the precisely defined and micrometer-scale patterned polymer structure has been fabricated, the excess polymerization fluid is removed by rinsing the fabricated microstructure with a non-reactive liquid such as ethanol.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention is not to be restricted in form nor limited in scope except by the claims appended hereto. These experiments and empirical data have demonstrated the ability to fabricate micrometer-size polymer structures. These structures can be fabricated directly on optical imaging fibers as well as on other glass substrates, and the micrometer-size photopatterns are deposited with large, easily produced masks. The chosen patterns of polymer spots can be monodisperse and highly ordered. The approach is general for any photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer; and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic microstructures have been made with N-vinyl pyrrolidone, and a photopolymerizable polydimethylsiloxane, respectively. By decreasing the monomer or oligomer concentration, the polymerization time, or both, polymer spots smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm, but with the same center-to-center spacing, can be produced. Polymer microstructures with decreased polymer spacings could also be produced by using imaging fibers with smaller core diameters. Such arrays could have many uses because of their ease of fabrication, the diversity of polymer functionality, and their three-dimensional character. This last feature allows for high loadings of immobilized molecules, which was achieved by immobilizing fluorescent indicators in the polymer array for use as optical sensors. This polymeric microstructure array has the advantage that each polymer spot is not in contact with any other spots. Furthermore, each polymer spot of the array is connected to its own optical channel, allowing individual spots to be addressed with little or no",
