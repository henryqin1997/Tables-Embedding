Such properties are desirable in that many flexible packaging applications (i.e., food packaging) require optically clear and water resistant bonds. It is surmised that the adhesives dry-bond clarity may be, in part, also attributed to the laminating adhesives particle size distribution. A small average particle size distribution enhances the dispersions coalescing properties, during the laminating process, to form clear continuous films. Additionally, the dry-bond laminates have improved water resistant properties. It is surmised that some of these properties may be attributed to the isocyanurate functional groups which are known to have good resistance to chemical and thermal stresses. The properties of isocyanurate linkages are further described in \"Structural Adhesives--Chemistry and Technology\", S. R. Harthorn, Chapter 4, Pages 190-194, Plenum Press, N.Y., 1986.}",
