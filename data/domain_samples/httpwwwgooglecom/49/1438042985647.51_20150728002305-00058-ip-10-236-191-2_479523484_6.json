    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described using exemplary and preferred embodiments. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to these particular disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, the present invention is contemplated to encompass various modifications and similar arrangements The scope of the claims, therefore, should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to include all such modifications and similar arrangements. At the destination space, the process is reversed in order to determine whether a user attempting to access a message has authorization, that is, has the valid key. The key supplied by the user at the destination space must include information required by the labels that were used to create the token split at the origination space. This information may also take the form of a token split. Further, a biometric split may be required as part of the destination key, in order to provide a link between assigned identification data for the user and physical data collected from the user biometrically. The token split and the biometric split may be combined with other splits at the destination space to form the complete destination key. Once the key splits 32, 34, 36, 38 have been generated, they may be randomized together to produce the cryptographic key 62 for the communication. In performing each combination to generate the complete cryptographic key, a different variation of the text/key relation may be applied. The use of a",
