RSA keys are limited to 2048 bits in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of the system. The key size corresponds to the number of bits used to construct the digital key. The larger the key, the less chance that someone will ever be able to crack it, but the longer it will take to perform the decryption and encryption process.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention is described in some detail with specific reference to a single preferred embodiment and certain alternatives, there is no intent to limit the invention to that particular embodiment or those specific alternatives. Although examples have been presented using e-mail, for instance, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methodology of the present invention may be applied to different modes of electronic communication, including wireless communication. Thus, the true scope of the present invention is not limited to any one of the foregoing exemplary embodiments but is instead defined by the appended claims. Appended herewith as Appendix A are C/C++ source code listings providing further description of the present invention. A suitable development environment (e.g., compiler/linker) for compiling the code is available from a variety of compiler vendors, including Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. and Inprise Corporation (formally, Borland International, Inc.) of Scotts Valley, Calif. A set of comprehensive source listings for PGP 5.5.3i (Windows/Mac) is currently available on the Internet via FTP at ftp://ftp.no.pgpi.com/pub/pgp/5.5/win95nt/pgp553i-win95nt-src.zip (accessible from download page http://www.pgpi.com/download/#5.5i), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
