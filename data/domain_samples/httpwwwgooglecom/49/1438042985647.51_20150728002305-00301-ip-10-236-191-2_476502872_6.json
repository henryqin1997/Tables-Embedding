    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38399=For this example, implantation is followed by a Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) at about 1000 degrees Celsius for about 30 seconds to activate the implanted dopants. Frontend processing also changes the crystal lattice of the amorphous silicon layer into polysilicon. In another embodiment, the initial processing of IC 20 is configured to provide NMOS devices using conventional techniques. In still other embodiments, it is contemplated that IC 20 is formed by different frontend processes known to those skilled in the art., 59706=In one preferred embodiment, a thin film resist having a thickness no greater than about 2000 Angstroms is utilized as resist 382 of photoresist pattern 380. This thin resist architecture permits process 310 to approach the actual wavelength limitations of the lithography in defining the contact feature size resolution instead of the grosser limitations typically imposed by resist thickness-limited lithography. In one aspect of this embodiment, device features as small as 0.25 \u03bcm can be defined and etched. In another aspect of process 310, the metallic layer 390 may be added without significantly increasing cost or complexity., 37976=After these stages, implant screen oxide layer 60 is formed as illustrated in FIG. 1a, and implantation of n+ and p+ dopant is performed. For example, n+ implantation may be accomplished by implanting ionized As at 60 keV 2\ufffd1015 cm-2 ; and p+ implantation may be accomplished by implanting ionized BF2 at 50 keV 3\ufffd1015 cm-2 to form CMOS structures., 74589=Among the advantages of process 510 is the ability to maintain low gate electrode resistance with members 584, 586 despite diminishing gate dimensions. In one preferred embodiment of device 520, polysilicon layer members 542, 552 are about 2000 to 3000 Angstroms thick and corresponding recesses 549, 559 are each formed to be about 1000 Angstroms in depth. A gate sheet resistance of about 1 \u03a9/sq for gates 540, 550, requires a thickness of about 300, 600, 200 Angstroms in of Al, W or Cu, respectively, given the corresponding resistivity approximation for Al, W, Cu of 3, 6, and 2 \u03bc\u03a9cm. Thus, for this embodiment, a 1000 Angstrom recess 549, 559 filled with Al, W, or Cu will provide a sheet resistance of about 0.3, 0.6, or 0.2 \u03a9/sq, respectively.}",
