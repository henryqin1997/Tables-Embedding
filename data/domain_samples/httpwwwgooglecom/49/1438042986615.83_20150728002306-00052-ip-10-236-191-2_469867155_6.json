A coil annularly surrounds the slice, and is mounted in the housing on the inner wall thereof. Up and down vibrational movement of the assembly induces an electrical current in the surrounding coil., 30098=US-A-2003/0173725 discloses a vibration damping device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and is mounted as a beater in a known manner in an aircraft, in particular a helicopter. Such a device is not designed for use as an electromechanical generator for efficiently harvesting a high amount of electrical power from ambient vibrations, e.g. for powering wireless sensors.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other modifications and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. . It may be seen that the upper and lower springs 282,284 control the movement of the vibrating magnetic core assembly 250 so that substantially the entire interior volume 300 of the housing 204 is employed to accommodate the moving element to generate electrical power, thereby rendering the device efficient in power to size ratio. At its upper and lower limits, the vibrating magnetic core assembly 250 typically is spaced about 1 mm from the lid 294 and base 296 of the housing 204. FIGS. 5 and 6 , but when the electromagnetic generator 200 is subjected to a vibrational input the magnetic core assembly 250 vibrates about the central position and between the limits of the lower and upper positions shown in FIG. 4 showing the lower and upper positions, respectively, of the vibrating magnetic core assembly. The upper and lower springs 282,284 bias the magnetic core assembly 250 to the central position shown in FIG. 4 are schematic side sections through the electromechanical generator of FIGS. 5 and 6 or 3. A threaded hole 298 in the base 296 provided a screw fitting for screwing the electromagnetic generator 200 to a vibrating surface (not shown). FIG. 2 In this embodiment,",
