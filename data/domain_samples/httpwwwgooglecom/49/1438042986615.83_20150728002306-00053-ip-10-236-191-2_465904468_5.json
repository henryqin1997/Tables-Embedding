G = approximately 1/2 N1/2 The 7 \ufffd 7 Hadamard transform is shown in FIG. 14; the inverse of the transform S- 1 is diagrammed in FIG. 15 and the transpose of the inverse of the transform (S- 1)T is diagrammed in FIG. 16. The electron picture which was described in FIG. 6 and as it appears in the transform of FIG. 8 is now decoded. The Hadamard image information which has been stored in suitable storage means 40 is fed to inverse transform means 41 to compute the inverse transform in accordance with the relation S- 1 \ufffd Hadamard image \ufffd (S- 1)T = ([N + 1]/2)2 (Input). The inverse transform means may be a computer programmed with the inverse of the coding matrix. FIG. 17 diagrammatically shows this operation. First in a premultiplication step the inverse transform S- 1 is matrixmultiplied times the Hadamard image FIG. 17a. The intermediate product obtained is then post matrix-multiplied by the transpose of the inverse transform (S- 1)T In FIG. 17 b to provide a decoded output which is equal to ([N+ 1]/2) (input), where N is the number",
