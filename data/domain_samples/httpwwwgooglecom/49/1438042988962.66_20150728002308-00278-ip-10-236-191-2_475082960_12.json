    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36435=One key step in construction of the library of cDNAs encoding the variable region of mouse heavy chain genes is construction of an E. coli plasmid vector, designated pFHC. pFHC contains a \u201cframework\u201d gene, which can be any antibody heavy chain and serves as a site into which the amplified cloned gene product (genomic DNA or cDNA of antibody mRNAs) is introduced. pFHC is useful as a vector for this purpose because it contains RE1 and RE2 cloning sites. Other vectors which include a framework gene and other cloning sites can be used for this purpose as well. The framework gene includes a transcriptional promoter (e.g., a powerful promoter, such as a Moloney LTR (Mulligan, R. C., In Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression, New York Adacemic Press, p. 155 (1983)) and a C\u03bc chain transcriptional enhancer to increase the level of transcriptions from the promoter (Gillies, S. D., et al., Cell, 33:717 (1983), a cloning site containing RE1 and RE2; part of the C\u03bc heavy chain gene encoding secreted protein; and poly A addition and termination sequences (FIG. 3). The framework antibody gene vector of the present invention (pFHC) also includes a selectable marker (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene such as the neomycin resistance gene, neoR) for animal cells; sequences for bacterial replication (ori); and a selectable marker (e.g., the ampicillin resistance gene, AmpR) for bacterial cells. The framework gene can be of any origin (human, non-human), and can derive from any one of a number of existing DNAs encoding heavy chain immunoglobulins (Tucker, P. W., et al., Science, 206:1299 (1979); Honjo, T., et al., Cell, 18:559 (1979); Bothwell, A. L. M., et al., Cell, 24:625 (1981); Liu, A. Y, et al., Gene, 54:33 (1987); Kawakami, T., et al., Nuc. Acids. Res., 8:3933 (1980)). In this embodiment, the vector retains the introns between the CH1, hinge, CH2 and CH3 exons. The \u201cvariable region\u201d of the gene, which includes the V, D and J regions of the antibody heavy chain and which encodes the antigen binding site, is deleted and replaced with two consecutive restriction endonuclease cloning sites, RE1 and RE2. The restriction endonuclease site RE1 occurs just 3\u2032 to the LTR promoter and the restriction endonuclease site RE2 occurs within the constant region just 3\u2032 to the J region (see FIG. 3)., 47113=The library of immunoglobulin chain genes produced as described is subsequently introduced into a line of immortalized cultured animal cells, referred to as the \u201chost\u201d cells, in which the genes in the library are expressed. Particularly useful for this purpose are plasmacytoma cell lines or myeloma cell lines which have been shown to efficiently express and secrete introduced immunoglobulin genes (Morrison, S. L., et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 507:187 (1987); Kohler, G. and C. Milstein, Eur. J. Immunol., 6:511 (1976); Galfre and C. Milstein, Methods Enzymol., 73:3 (1981); Davis, A. C. and M. J. Shulman, Immunol. Today, 10:119 (1989)). For example, the J558L cell line can be cotransfected using electroporation or protoplast fusion (Morrison, S. L., et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 507:187 (1987)) and transfected cells selected on the basis of auxotrophic markers present on light and heavy chain libraries., 62771=One method of viral coating is as follows: A diverse library of bacteriophage \u03bb encoding parts of antibody molecules that are expressed in infected E. coli and which retain the ability to bind antigens is created, using known techniques (Orlandi, R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:3833 (1989); Huse, W. D., et al., Science, 246:1275 (1989); Better, M., et al., Science, 240:1041 (1988); Skerra, A. and A. Pluckthon, Science, 240:1038 (1988)). Bacteria infected with phage are embedded in a thin film of semisolid agar. Greater than 107 infected bacteria may be plated in the presence of an excess of uninfected bacteria in a volume of 1 ml of agar and spread over a 10 cm2 surface. The agar contains monovalent antibody \u201cA\u201d (Parham, P., In Handbook of Experimental Immunology: Immunochem., Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Cambridge, Mass., pp. 14.1-14.23 (1986)), which can bind the \u03bb coat proteins and which has been chemically coupled to monovalent antibody \u201cB\u201d, which can bind an epitope on all viral directed antibody molecules. Monovalent antibodies are used to prevent the crosslinking of viral particles. Upon lytic burst, progeny phage particles become effectively cross linked to the antibody molecule they encode. Because lysis occurs in semisolid medium, in which diffusion is slow, cross linking between a given phage and the antibody encoded by another phage is minimized. A nitrocellulose filter (or other protein binding filter) is prepared as an affinity matrix by adsorbing the desired antigen. The filter is then blocked so that no other proteins bind nonspecifically. The filter is overlayed upon the agar, and coated phage are allowed to bind to the antigen by way of their adherent antibody molecules. Filters are washed to remove nonspecifically bound phage. Specifically bound phage therefore represent phage encoding antibodies with the desired specificity. These can now be propagated by reinfection of bacteria., 14865=This application is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/997,195 filed Dec. 23, 1997 which is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/315,269 filed Sep. 29, 1994 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,225 which is a continuation or Ser. No. 07/919,730 filed Jul. 24, 1992 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,555, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/464,350 filed Jan. 11, 1990 now abandoned., 40478=Poly A+ mRNA from total mouse spleen is prepared according to published methods (Sambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). Production of antibody mRNA can first be stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Andersson, J. A., et al., J. Exp. Med., 145:1511 (1977)). First strand cDNA is prepared to this mRNA population using as primer an oligonucleotide, Z, which is complementary to C\u03bc in the CH1 region 3\u2032 to J. This primer is designated Z in FIG. 2. First strand cDNA is then elongated by the terminal transferase reaction with dCTP to form a poly dC tail (Sambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989))., 44244=For example, the library produced as described above is amplified again, using PCR under conditions of limiting nucleotide concentration. Such conditions are known to increase the infidelity of the polymerization and result in production of mutant products. Primers useful for this reaction are Primers C and D, as represented in FIGS. 2 and 3. Primer D derives from pFHC just 5\u2032 to RE1. The PCR product, after cleavage with RE1 and RE2, is recloned into the framework vector pFHC. To the extent that mutation affects codons of the antigen binding region, this procedure increases the diversity of the binding domains. For example, if the starter library has a complexity of 106 elements, and an average of one mutation is introduced per complementarity determining region, and it is assumed that the complementarity determining region is 40 amino acids in size and that any of six amino acid substitutions can occur at a mutated codon, the diversity of the library can be increased by a factor of about 40\ufffd6, or 240, for single amino acid changes and 240\ufffd240, or about 6\ufffd104, for double amino acid changes, yielding a final diversity of approximately 1011. This is considered to be in the range of the diversity of antibodies which animals produce (Tonegawa, S., Nature, 302:575 (1983)). Even greater diversity can be generated by the random combination of H and L chains, the result of co-expression in host cells (see below). It is, thus, theoretically possible to generate a more diverse antibody library in vitro than can be generated in vivo. This library of genes is called the \u201chigh diversity\u201d heavy chain library. It may be propagated indefinitely in E. coli. A high diversity light chain library can be prepared similarly., 70626=The constraints on RE1 are simple. It should be the sole cleavage site on the plasmid for its restriction endonuclease. The choice of RE1 can be made by computer based sequence analysis (Intelligenetics Suite, Release 5:35, Intelligenetics)., 39562=In this embodiment, non-immune mouse spleens are used as the starting material. mRNA is prepared directly from the spleen or from spleen processed in such a manner that it is enriched for resting B cells. Enrichment of tissue results in a more uniform representation of antibody diversity in the starting materials. Lymphocytes can be purified from spleen using ficoll gradients (Boyum, A., Scand. J. of Clinical Invest., 21:77 (1968)). B cells are separated from other cells (e.g., T cells) by panning with anti-IgM coated dishes (Wysocki, L. J. and V. L. Sato, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 75:2844 (1978)). Because activated cells express the IL-2 receptor but resting B cells do not, resting B cells can be separated yet further from activated cells by panning. Further purification by size fractionation on a Cell Sorter results in a fairly homogeneous population of resting B cells., 61699=Viral coating can be used as a means of identifying viruses encoding antigen-combining molecules. In this method, a viral vector is used to direct the synthesis of diverse antibody molecules. Upon lytic infection of host cells, and subsequent cell lysis, the virus becomes \u201ccoated\u201d with the antibody product it directs. That is, the antibody molecule becomes physically linked to the outside of a mature virus particle, which can direct its synthesis. Methods for viral coating are described below. Viruses coated by antibody can be physically selected on the basis of their affinity to antigen which is attached to a solid support. The number of particles which can be screened using this approach is well in excess of 109 and it is possible that 1011 different antibody genes could be screened in this manner. In one embodiment, an affinity matrix containing antigen used to purify those viruses encoding antibody molecules with affinity to antigen and which coat the surface of the virus which encodes those antibodies is used.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described specifically herein. Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed in the scope of the following claims. Equivalents The process of PCR cassette assembly is a method of constructing plasmid molecules (in this case the plasmid pFHC) from fragments of DNA of known nucleotide sequence. One first compiles a list of restriction endonucleases that do not cleave any of the fragments. Each fragment is then individually PCR amplified using synthesized oligonucleotide primers complementary to the terminal sequences of the fragment. These primers are synthesized to contain on their 5\u2032 ends restriction endonuclease cleavage sites from the compiled list. Thus, each PCR product can be so designed that each fragment can be assembled one by one into a larger plasmid structure by cleavage and ligation and transformation into E. coli. Using this method, it is also possible to make minor modifications to modify the terminal sequence of the fragment being amplified. This is done by altering the PCR primer slightly so that a mismatch occurs. In this way it is possible to amplify the C\u03bc gene starting precisely from the desired point in CH1 (as determined by oligo C above) and creating the RE2 endonuclease cleavage site. The choice for primer C puts a constraint on pFHC. In the example",
