It is a benzophenone containing a para-chlorophenyl group and a para-isopropyloxycarbonylisopropoxyphenyl group, both of which are substantially hydrophobic groups. Fenofibrate exhibits a melting point reported to be in the range of 79 to 82\ufffd C. (Physician's Desk Reference, 1999 Edition, page 477), which is above that of the symmetrically unsubstituted benzophenone with a reported melting point range of 48 to 51\ufffd C. but below that of the symmetrically substituted 4,4\u2032-dichlorobenzophenone with a reported range of 144 to 146\ufffd C. (Aldrich Chemical Co. catalog, 1999)., 169881=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y homogenizer operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 85\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 mm, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing the drug of size less than 1.0 micron in diameter is treated with a solution of bulking agents equivalent to 300 parts of sucrose plus 100 parts of sorbitol in additional aqueous carrier is then dried by freezing and lyophilization to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 172774=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0\ufffd1-0.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M 11.0 Y homogenizer operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 85\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 mm, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing drug of size less than 1.0 micron in diameter is treated with a cooled solution of 200 parts of trehalose plus 100 parts of PVP 17 as bulking agents in additional aqueous carrier and then dried by freezing and lyophilization or by spray drying to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 205095=An IDD-P\u2122 fenofibrate formulation prepared by a hot melt microfluidization process described herein under GMP conditions according to the method of Example 15 was dried by lyophilization and formulated into tablets containing 160 mg of fenofibrate. In the formulation, the IDD-P\u2122 fenofibrate was in the form of microfluidized microparticles stabilized by phospholipid LIPOID E80 and was prepared by microfluidization in the presence of sucrose and sorbitol. The oral bioavailability of the tableted IDD-P\u2122 fenofibrate formulation was tested in the fasting and fed states in a single dose pharmacokinetic study. The study consisted of the administration of a single IDD-P\u2122 fenofibrate tablet containing 160 mg of fenofibrate in 8 human subjects using a crossover design with randomized sequences. The fed condition was obtained with a high fat meal containing 1000 Kcal and 50 g fat. The blood samples were collected before and after each administration at various time points over 96 hours. The drug concentration in blood samples was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography by monitoring for the level of the metabolite, fenofibric acid. The bioavailability of the drug from a dosage form such as an orally administered composition of the drug is given by the accumulated amount of drug versus time detected in a patient, and is calculated as the area under the curve of a plot of fenofibric acid concentrations detected in blood versus time. The bioavailability (AUC0-\u221e4) data obtained under the fed and fasted conditions are presented in Table 7. The food effect is represented by the ratio of the AUC0-\u221e under fed and fasted conditions. The ratio of 95% (fasted/fed) demonstrates the essential absence of food effect on the bioavailability of IDD-P\u2122 fenofibrate. The ratio of the AUC0-\u221e under fasted/fed conditions is 1.07. Thus the bioavailability of microfluidized phospholipid stabilized microparticles of fenofibrate increases by less than 8% between fasted and fed conditions in this example., 176989=A mixture of 60 parts of a phospholipid as a surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 MM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated above the melting point of the drug during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained above the melting point of the drug to form a heated homogenate containing drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained at 4\ufffd C. to 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising particles containing the poorly water soluble drug is then dried by freezing and lyophilization to produce dried small particles containing the poorly water soluble drug., 75628=Examples of some preferred water-insoluble drugs include immunosuppressive and immunoactive agents, antiviral and antifungal agents, antineoplastic agents, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, anti-epileptics, anesthetics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotic agents, neuroleptic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytics, anticonvulsant agents, antagonists, neuron blocking agents, anticholinergic and cholinomimetic agents, antimuscarinic and muscarinic agents, antiadrenergic and antarrhythmics, antihypertensive agents, antineoplastic agents, hormones, and nutrients. A detailed description of these and other suitable drugs may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, 1990, Mack Publishing Co. Philadelphia, Pa. which is hereby incorporated by reference., 171374=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y homogenizer operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 85\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 mm, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing drug of size less than 1.0 micron in diameter is treated with 100 parts of sucrose plus 20 parts of glycerol as bulking agents, then dried to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 99898=As used herein, homogenization refers to the creation of a homogenate or uniform distribution of small particles containing drug in an aqueous carrier as a result of an energetic process being applied to an antecedent composition such as a mixture, admixture, blend, emulsion, suspension, dispersion or other composition of solids or solid particles or liquids or liquid particles or droplets comprising drug and one or more than one surface active substance in an aqueous carrier wherein the homogenate and the small particles produced are at least transiently stable toward phase separation into larger particles or droplets or non-uniform solid or liquid domains. Homogenization, particularly with respect to the formation of a heated suspension and a heated homogenate, can be achieved by input of mechanical energy such as by high shear mixing, ultra high shear mixing, high speed blending, microfluidization, and milling such as by dispersion milling, ball milling, attritor milling, vibrator milling, and media milling, or by application of sonic energy in the form of sonication. Preferably in the case of a mill being used in this process wherein the mill contains media or grinding media, such media is removed in a filtration or other suitable separation process to provide homogenized compositions of this invention. Homogenization is preferably achieved by passing an antecedent composition under high pressure, for example under more than 1000 psi, through a tiny orifice which can result in a decrease in the average diameter and an increase in the number and surface area of particles or droplets in the antecedent composition and produce small particles. A preferred homogenization method comprises passing an antecedent composition under high pressure through a tiny orifice and includes microfluidization, particularly with respect to homogenization to prepare a cooled dispersion of this invention., 164151=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 85\ufffd C. to 99\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing the drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger cooled by chilled water at 5\ufffd C. to 10\ufffd C. and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained at 4\ufffd C. to 13\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing fenofibrate of size less than 2.0 microns in diameter is then dried by freezing to about \u221240\ufffd C. and lyophilization under vacuum to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 165531=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 80\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing the drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 min, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing the drug are of a size less than 1.0 micron in diameter and are then dried by freezing and lyophilization under vacuum to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 175651=An admixture of a formulation comprising 60 parts of a hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (i.e., PHOSPHOLIPON 100H) as a surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, in 1400 parts of aqueous carrier (10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8) is heated to 85\ufffd C. and homogenized for 10 volume passes to form a heated homogenate containing drug containing the drug, cooled to room temperature according to method 1 to form a transiently stable cooled homogenate containing the drug, and then sonicated for 1 minute using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator Probe Sonicator from Fisher Scientific (10 s pulses at power level 5) to form a cooled dispersion. The mean particle diameter of the sonic ated material (cooled dispersion) is only slightly larger than that of the heated homogenate material, both being between 2-4 micrometers. Microscopically, the heated homogenate particles are non-crystalline while the cooled dispersion particles are crystalline. Importantly, while stirring induces significant particle growth in the cooled homogenate, stirring does not induce significant particle growth in the cooled dispersion. The cooled dispersion thus produced is more robust toward particle growth than the cooled homogenate., 47483=This claims the benefit of provisional application 60/198,579 filed on Apr. 20, 2000., 168363=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm.

After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 mm, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing the drug of size less than 1.0 micron in diameter is treated with a solution of 200 parts of sucrose plus 100 parts of sorbitol as bulking agents in additional aqueous carrier and is then dried by freezing in liquid nitrogen and lyophilization under vacuum to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 166904=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0 +/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer containing 240 parts of trehalose using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y homogenizer operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 85\ufffd C. to 95\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing the drug.

The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles containing drug of size less than 1.0 micron in diameter is then dried by freezing in liquid nitrogen and lyophilization under vacuum to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate., 79326=Non-limiting examples of representative poorly soluble drugs that melt without decomposition in admixtures, suspensions, dispersions, and

Drugs can be neutral species or basic or acidic as well as salts such as exist in the presence of an aqueous buffer., 85422=Examples of some suitable surface active substances that are useful in this invention include: (a) natural surfactants such as casein, gelatin, tragacanth, waxes, enteric resins, paraffin, acacia, gelatin, cholesterol esters and triglycerides, (b) nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, sorbitan esters, glycerol monostearate, polyethylene glycols, cetyl alcohol, cetostearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, poloxamers, polaxamines, methylcellulose, hydroxycellulose, hydroxy propylcellulose, hydroxy propylmethylcellulose, noncrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and synthetic phospholipids, (c) anionic surfactants such as potassium laurate, triethanolamine stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, alkyl polyoxyethylene sulfates, sodium alginate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl inosite, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and their salts), and negatively charged glyceryl esters, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and calcium carboxymethylcellulose, (d) cationic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium compounds, benzalkonium chloride, cetyltrimethylarnmonium bromide, chitosans and lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, (e) colloidal clays such as bentonite and veegum. A detailed description of these surfactants may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Lachman et al, 1986., 174282=A mixture of 60 parts of LIPOID E80 as the surface active substance and 200 parts of a poorly water soluble drug, fenofibrate, is homogeneously dispersed in 1440 parts of 10 mM pH 8.0+/\u22120.2 aqueous phosphate buffer containing 200 parts of sucrose and 100 parts of sorbitol using a ProScientific 400 high shear mixer at 2,000 to 3,600 rpm at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then heated to 95\ufffd C., 15\ufffd C. above the melting point of the drug, during continuous high shear mixing at 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The heated suspension is then recirculatively homogenized for 10 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidizer M110Y homogenizer operated at 3,400 to 3,600 psig while maintained at 80\ufffd C. to form a heated homogenate containing drug. After 10 passes, the heated homogenate is cooled by passage through a heat exchanger chilled with ice water, kept at 4\ufffd C. for 30 min, and the transiently stable cooled homogenate is further homogenized for 10 to 20 batch volume cycles or passes using a Microfluidics M110 EH homogenizer operated at 18,000 psig (peak) while maintained between 4\ufffd C. and 15\ufffd C. The resulting cooled dispersion comprising small particles of size less than 1.0 micrometers in diameter is then dried to produce dried small particles containing fenofibrate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover clinical study was performed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of fenofibric acid in blood in 24 healthy volunteers after single dose oral administration of a tablet formulation of this invention comprising phospholipid stabilized microparticles of fenofibrate. The fenofibrate tablet dosage form consisted of 160 mg of fenofibrate and was derived from a dried lyophilized powder of this invention that contained between 0.1% and 3% moisture, and that was obtained from a suspension of microparticles consisting of 10% fenofibrate, 3% LIPOID E80, 10% sucrose, and 5% sorbitol, and that was further blended with sucrose at 5% by weight of the powder plus magnesium stearate at 0.2% plus colloidal silica at 0.2%. The bioavailability of fenofibric acid from the formulation of this invention was compared relative to that of commercially available micronized fenofibrate (TRICOR\u2122) in a 200 mg capsule. Each dosage form was taken orally within 5 minutes after a low-fat test meal. The study was divided into 2 study periods, study period 1 and study period 2. At each period a single fenofibrate dose was administered to the subjects. There was a washout period of 10 days between the 2 administrations. Plasma samples were collected before each administration and during the 96 hours following each administration. Assay of fenofibric acid was performed with a validated analytical method (HPLC-UV) on the plasma samples. Relevant pharmacokinetic parameters were determined to evaluate the bioavailability of",
