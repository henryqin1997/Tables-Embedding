    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The heating element is activated. The operator pushes handle 29 which moves blocks 30 and 34 together on slides 25, 26 and 27, thereby moving the tubes across heating element 10. Block 34 strikes stopblock 28 first thereby causing the two blocks to become sufficiently disengaged so that block 35 moves on to stop against stopblock 28. This further movement by block 35 aligns slots 21 and 24 as the cut tube ends remain sealed by molten polymer against heating element 10. The operator immediately withdraws handle 29 to move block 35 which is connected to handle 29 and, by friction between the blocks through pressure exerted by a pin (not shown) on block 35, block 34 also. The blocks and the tube ends to be joined move back away from heating element 10. As the corner of block 35 leaves the edge of block 28, a spring (not shown) urges part 31 of block 35 to rotate slightly about bolt 33 toward block 34 so that slight compression is urged on the tube ends being joined as they slide off the edge of the heating element. Stop 38 on slide 25 terminates the motion of the blocks and handle. When using the heating element of the invention as the cutting means in the aforesaid sterile docking apparatus, a temperature of about 271\ufffd C. (520\ufffd F.) is preferably utilized. FIG. 4 shows a sterile connection apparatus",
