C. Arney et al. This work led to the development of a reactive ion etching (RIE) process for the fabrication of submicron, single crystal silicon, movable mechanical structures wherein the oxidation-isolation step described in the Arney et al publication was replaced with an SF6 isotropic release etch. This process, which allowed the release of wider structures, in the range of 1.0 \u03bcm, and deeper structures, in the range of 2-4 \u03bcm, is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/821,944, filed Jan. 16, 1992, assigned to the assignee of the present application. As there described, this dry etch process utilizes multiple masks to define structural elements and metal contacts and permitted definition of small, complex structures in single crystal silicon, and was easy to implement. However, the second lithography step was difficult to apply to deeper structures, particularly because of problems in aligning the second mask. Furthermore, that process relied upon the formation of a silicon dioxide layer on a single crystal silicon substrate, but since other materials such as GaAs or SiGe do not generate an oxide layer the way silicon does, the process could not be transferred to such other substrate materials., 31027=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/312,797 filed on Sep. 27, 1994, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/013,319, filed Feb. 4, 1993, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that numerous variations and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof, as set forth in the following claims: In summary, the present invention is directed to a silicon process for fabricating single crystal silicon MEM devices utilizing a single mask to define all components. The process is low temperature, self-aligned, and independent of crystal orientation, and relies on industry standard fabrication processes and tools. The process can be used to produce discrete devices on wafers, or can be used in combination with VLSI integrated circuit processes without major modification of the IC processes because of its low temperature requirements, simple design rules, and short process times. The low temperatures used in the present process do not adversely affect existing IC circuits, so MEM devices can be fabricated on completed IC wafers. The device of the invention has an important application as an accelerometer, while the process of the invention allows such devices to be incorporated in integrated circuits, for example, or fabricated on discrete wafers for use in a wide range of applications. The described tungsten process is provided to allow selective increases in the mass of the MEM device for accelerometer and other applications.
