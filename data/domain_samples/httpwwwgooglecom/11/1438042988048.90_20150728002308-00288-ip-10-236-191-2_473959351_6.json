The electronic scope 391A is the same as the electronic scope 133A shown, for example, in FIG. 19 wherein the LED's 392R, 392G and 392B are contained instead of the light guide 51 in the tip side. These LED's 392R, 392G and 392B are LED's emitting respectively lights with the wavelengths of red, green and blue so that a substantially white illuminating light can be emitted on the object side by making them simultaneously emit lights. The LED (represented by 392) is connected to the connector 394 through the line 393 so that, when the connector 394 is connected to the video processor 387, the LED 392 will be fed with an electric power and the CCD 49A will be connected to the signal processing part. The white lamp 382 may be used instead of the LED 292. The lamp 382 is fed through the line 383 with a lighting electric power from the current source 385 by connecting the connector 384 fitted to the line 383 to the connector receiver 386 connected with the current source 385. The others are of the same formation as the fiber scope 145 shown in FIG. 21.
