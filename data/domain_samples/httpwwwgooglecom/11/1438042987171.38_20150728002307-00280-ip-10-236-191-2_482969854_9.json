It is thus seen that the present invention provides a system which can provide a bird a combined exerciser, educator, feeder and toy in a single, simple structure. It also provides a bird toy that will educate a bird to exercise its beak by encouraging the bird to engage in hard work and by then rewarding it with a treat. Additionally, it provides a device which not only causes a bird to engage in hard work in the form of exercise of its jaws and beak, but which stimulates the bird to learn how best it can obtain the reward of a bird treat when playing with and exercising on the device. It also provides enjoyment to the possessor of the combined bird exerciser, educator, feeder and toy when watching a bird use the device. Finally, it provides such a combined bird exerciser, educator, feeder and toy system, which is simple in construction and design, and which is inexpensive to make.
