    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made to the bare die socket module of the invention, sockets formed therefrom and methods of making and practicing the invention as disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. It is particularly noted that with respect to numbers and dimensions of elements, the illustrated constructions of the various embodiments of the modular bare semiconductor die socket are not presented as a limiting list of features but as examples of the many embodiments of the invention. The socket 10 of the invention permits connection of bare semiconductor dice with very fine pitch bond pads to substrates, whereby short leads are used for improved performance. The semiconductor dice may be readily replaced without debonding of wires or other leads. Multiple semiconductor dice may be simultaneously connected to a substrate, and the apparatus permits high density \u201cstacking\u201d of a large number of dice. The socket uses leads which may be produced by well-developed technology, and is easily made in large quantity and at low cost. Following assembly of the modular socket 10 and attachment to a substrate 16, the modular socket, or portions thereof, may be \u201cglob-topped\u201d with insulative sealant material, typically a polymer. The plates 14A, 14B, 14C, 14D, etc. may be molded of a suitable insulative polymeric material, examples of",
