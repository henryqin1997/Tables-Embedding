No. 61/130,664 entitled \u201cCounterfeit Ballot Detection and Integrated Ballot Marking and Machine Confirmation System for Voters\u201d filed Jun. 2, 2008, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application also claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/125,947 entitled \u201cCounterfeit Ballot Detection and Integrated Ballot Marking Device and Machine Confirmation System for Voters\u201d filed Apr. 30, 2008., 110417=Ballot checking reduces and/or eliminates under and over voting and so may avoid or at least mitigate situations where the intent of the voter cannot be determined. However, where applicable law allows, under and over voting in cumulative voting contests may be adjusted and/or rectified when the ballot is counted by applying proportioning and/or normalizing rules to the votes actually cast, e.g., by adding or subtracting a proportionate weighted vote. Ballot checking may be preformed by a reader 1000 or by an other ballot reader such as a ballot imager based on commercial office imaging equipment., 104396=Simply put and by way of example, and only for ballots that are original and are not copies, because ballots that are copies are detected from anti-copy region 150 thereof and are not processed: Reader/imager 1010 reads/images the BID number 120 from a first ballot 100 of form A and signals same to processor 1050 which then provides the mark space template for ballots 100 of form A for reading/determining the marked voting selections from first ballot 100 read/imaged by optical reader 1010. The marked voting selections read/determined are then tabulated as votes by vote counter 1060. Next, reader/imager 1010 reads/images the BID number 120 from a second ballot 100 of form B and signals same to processor 1050 which then provides the mark space template for ballots 100 of form B for reading/determining the marked voting selections from second ballot 100 read/imaged by optical reader 1010, which read/determined marked voting selections are then tabulated as votes by vote counter 1060. Next, reader/imager 1010 reads/images the BID number 120 from a third ballot 100 of form C and signals same to processor 1050 which then provides the mark space template for ballots 100 of form C for reading/determining the marked voting selections from third ballot 100 read/imaged by optical reader 1010, which read/determined marked voting selections are then tabulated as votes by vote counter 1060. If the next ballot is of form B, for example, reader/imager 1010 reads/determines the BID number 120 from that ballot 100 of form B and signals same to processor 1050 which then provides the mark space template for ballots 100 of form B for reading/determining the marked voting selections from that ballot 100 read/imaged by optical reader 1010, which read/determined marked voting selections are then tabulated as votes by vote counter 1060, and so forth. The process repeats for each ballot read/imaged by reader 1000 wherein the template for each ballot is selected by processor 1050 responsive to the BID number 120 read/determined from that ballot, e.g., specifically responsive to the jurisdictional information defined in fields 121-127 of BID number 120., 97824=In a second embodiment of a reader 1010, optical reader device 1031 produces an image of ballot sheet 100, e.g., in a pixel image format, and processor 1050 processes the ballot image data to extract the ballot identifier BID 120 therefrom for selecting the appropriate template for determining the voting selections that are marked on ballot 100, and processes the ballot image data to extract fiducial marks 122 therefrom for determining the orientation of the ballot image for bringing the ballot image and the selected template into a corresponding orientation. Processor 1050 also processes the ballot image data to determine from the anti-copy regions 150 thereof whether the ballot 100 imaged is an original ballot or is a copy thereof, as described herein. Where the ballot identifier BID 120 is in an anti-copy region 150 of a sort that renders BID 120 unreadable, the inability to extract BID 120 from the ballot image may be sufficient basis for rejecting the ballot as a copy, subject to appropriate confirmation. If the ballot imaged is proper, the ballot image data is then processed in accordance with the selected template and the proper orientation to determine the voting selections marked thereon. If optical reader 1010 were to have two optical readers in this embodiment, both optical readers thereof would image the ballots for error reduction, i.e. would be for making redundant images for verifying the correctness of either image, and the voting selections thereon, against the other., 100525=Reader 1032 in the first embodiment above need not, but may, read portions of ballot 100 other than those containing valid mark spaces 112 according to the selected template corresponding to that ballot. The unnecessary portions of ballot 100 not containing valid mark spaces 112 or other data that need be determined may either not be read or may be read and then discarded while retaining the readings of mark spaces 112. In certain jurisdictions and in certain conventional ballot readers, only \u201cimages\u201d of the ballot form identity and mark space zones need be obtained and stored for tabulating and/or verifying voting, and such may merely be indications of time-coincidence between reference marks and voter marked marks indicating selections or may be indications that ones of mark spaces in predetermined grid positions have been marked. Standardized information, e.g., names of contests, names of candidates, and the like, are not read and/or are not stored, thereby reducing the amount of data that needed to be stored., 102830=As a result, ballots 100 placed into input container 1020 do not have to be pre-sorted to be of the same format or orientation, but may be of different formats and orientation because reader 1010 in cooperation with processor 1050 determines the proper template and orientation to be utilized for reading each ballot 100 according to its format. Specifically, because the information in fields 381-386 of each BID number 120 printed on each ballot 100 define the particular voting jurisdiction (e.g., state, county, municipality, precinct, ward and/or political party), they also define the form of ballot 100 for such jurisdiction. From the BID number 120 and fiducial marks 122 read by optical reader 1031, processor 1050 determines the jurisdiction and the ballot form therefor and supplies the template and orientation therefor for use in conjunction with the pattern of mark spaces 112 marked on ballot 100 for determining the voting selections made thereon. It is noted that orientation may be corrected by re-orienting (rotating) the ballot image so that it is correctly oriented relative to the selected ballot template, or by re-orienting (rotating) the selected ballot template so that it is correctly oriented relative to the ballot image. Further, data relating to anti-copy regions 150 is utilized to detect copied ballots from original ballots so that copied ballots are not read and are not counted., 118697=It is noted that the foregoing reading/imaging 321, 324, 325, 328, 329 of the BID and voting selections, the authenticating 322, 323 of the ballot, and the template selecting 326, 327, and/or the tabulating 330 and storing 332, may be performed in \u201creal-time\u201d as each ballot is read, i.e., the voting selections are read/decoded, stored 332 and tabulated 330 substantially contemporaneously with the ballot passing through reader 1010 and being authenticated 322, 323. Alternatively, the BID and voting selections read/imaged 321, 324, 328 may be stored as each ballot passes through reader 1010, and the authenticating 322, 323, template selecting 326, 327, the decoding/reading 324, 325, 328,329 of the stored BID and voting selections, and/or the tabulating 330 and storing 332 thereof may be performed after some or all of the ballots have passed through reader 1010, i.e. may be delayed in time., 111061=Reader 1000 utilized for ballot checking may also have a printer associated therewith for providing a tangible voting record, e.g., a printed receipt, for each voting session whether the receipt is collected or is available to the voter, as described in the Patents and Patent Publications referred to herein. Desirably, such printed receipt includes the complete BID 120 including the unique random portion 381 so that the vote may be tracked and verified either by election officials or where the voting results are available via an Internet and/or other posting including the BID. Preferably, the BID from the ballot read/imaged is printed on the receipt. If the receipt includes a record of the voter's voting selections, the receipt also provides an immediate confirmation that the ballot can be read and of the voting selections marked, whereby the voter may seek correction of any error and/or omission prior to voting (casting) his ballot., 172450=The arrangement of the present application may be operated in conjunction with various electronic voting machines, also referred to as electronic voting apparatus and/or as a direct recording electronic (DRE) voting apparatus. Examples of suitable voting apparatus, and features and methods employed therewith, are available from Avante International Technology, 70 Washington Road, Princeton, N.J.

Processor 1050 need process only the BID number 120 and the mark space 112 regions to select the corresponding ballot template and to verify that the proper number of mark spaces have been marked for each contest and/or question. The anti-copy detection function may be disabled, not provided, or allowed to operate, as may be desired., 171181=The arrangement of the present application may be operated in conjunction with various sheet reader/imager apparatus and methods, and marking sheets and/or ballots, suitable ones of which are available from Avante International Technology, 70 Washington Road, Princeton, N.J.

The processor 1050 may determine whether the ballot sheet 100 is an original ballot sheet 100 from an anti-copy feature 150 having a pattern of indicia that have a predetermined characteristic and that reproduce in a copy of the ballot sheet as having a substantially different characteristic. The anti-copy feature 150 of the ballot sheet 100 may include a hologram, a micro-embossed hologram, a photo-polymer hologram, a holographic diffractive region, a light diffractive region, a hologram with or without over printing, a diffractive optical variable image device (DOVID), a diffractive material, a light reflecting ink, a light absorbing ink, a color-shifting ink, a light reflecting tint, a light intensity responsive variable ink, a light intensity responsive variable tint, an embedded graphic, an embedded image, an embedded text, a line-screen pattern having a particular combination of line frequencies and/or print densities, a latent image, a line-screen pattern on a tinted or other background, a latent line-screen pattern image embedded in a different line-screen pattern, lines printed at one or more interference scanning frequencies, a laser moir\ufffd interference pattern, micro perforations, a hidden message, a hidden image, a number of generally parallel lines, a number of generally parallel lines of tint similar to that of the ballot sheet, or a combination of any or all of the foregoing. The optically readable markable ballot sheet 100 may have a fiducial mark 122 thereon, and the processor 1050 may decode from the image of the ballot sheet 100 the fiducial mark 122 for determining the orientation of the ballot sheet 100 and for aligning the selected template and the image of the ballot sheet 100. Processor 1050 may compare the mark spaces 112 decoded from the image of the ballot sheet 100 and the mark spaces 112 defined by the selected template for determining the completeness of the ballot sheet 100. Processor 1050 may determine whether the ballot sheet 100 is an original ballot sheet 100 may include: the processor 1050 counting from the image of the ballot sheet 100 the number of light pixels or the number of dark pixels or the numbers of light and dark pixels for the anti-copy feature 150; and the processor 1050 comparing the number of light pixels or the number of dark pixels or the numbers of light and dark pixels for the anti-copy feature 150 with a predetermined pixel count for the anti-copy feature 150 for the determining whether the ballot sheet 100 is an original ballot sheet 100. Processor 1050 may decode from the image of the ballot sheet 100 the mark spaces 112 in accordance with the selected template for recording the voting selections marked on the ballot sheet 100 and may comprise: the processor 1050 counting the number of light pixels and dark pixels for each mark space 112; the processor 1050 determining from the counts of light and dark pixels for each mark space 112 whether the mark space 112 therein is an unmarked outline or is marked as a voting selection; and the processor 1050 recording each determined marked voting selection., 99471=The BID number 120 read or determined from each ballot 100 or allot image should preferably include at least jurisdictional information fields, e.g., fields 381-386, which can be utilized by processor 1050 to identify and select the appropriate ballot template. The unique random number field, e.g., field 387, preferably should also be read or determined so that the unique random number portion of BID 120 can be associated with the stored voting selection information and be available for later verification of the ballot and/or of the correct reading thereof, as well as for the voter tracking his vote, e.g., via an Internet or other posting, if provided as described herein. Where BID 120 is on ballot 100 in two different forms, e.g., in machine-readable form and in human-readable form, reader 1000 may have the ability to read both forms of BID 120, e.g., a bar-code reader and an OCR reader, usually included in processor 1050., 96222=Two embodiments for a reader 1010 that does not require pre-sorting of ballots by jurisdiction and type and orientation are described. In a first, reader 1010 includes two optical devices 1031 and 1032 and a processor 1050 that cooperate for reading ballots 100 of different forms without the need to pre-sort the ballots into groups of like form. Specifically, optical device 1031 reads ballots 100 for reading the BID number 120 thereon, and optionally the fiducial marks 122 thereon, and communicates the BID number 120 and fiducial marks 122 to processor 1050. Reader 1031 need not read any other part of ballots 100. Processor 1050 is responsive to the BID number 120 and optional fiducial marks 122 read from each ballot 100 by optical reader device 1031 to identify and select the ballot template corresponding thereto, and to optionally determine the orientation thereof. Either reader 1031 or reader 1032, or both, may read the anti-copy regions 150 of ballot 100 for providing data from which processor 1050 can determine whether the ballot is an original ballot or is a copy thereof. If the ballot is determined to be original, optical reader device 1032 then reads ballots 100 for reading the mark spaces 112 thereon that have been marked for comparison in accordance with the ballot template selected by and the orientation determined by processor 1050., 109347=Reader 1000 in checking a ballot preferably signals or otherwise provides a notice or indication if a ballot is under voted (i.e. less than the required number of spaces have been marked for each contest/question) or is over voted (i.e. more than the required number of spaces have been marked for each contest/question, which may invalidate a vote in a contest/question or may invalidate an entire ballot) or is otherwise incorrectly marked. Ballot checking may be utilized with straight voting, ranked voting, and/or cumulative voting similarly, e.g., indicating if improper ranking has been marked and/or if the wrong number of cumulative votes have been marked. While such checking function advances the goal that ballots reflect voter intent, it can reduce but not eliminate under voting and over voting; however, it will at least give the voter an opportunity to correct such condition or to at least indicate an intentional \u201cno vote\u201d by marking a \u201cNo Vote\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d mark space 112 if such mark space is provided., 106866=In addition and optionally, processor 1050 may include optical character recognition (OCR) software to provide alphanumeric outputs of the information in the BID field read/imaged by reader 1010 and/or of write-in information in the write-in portions of the voting fields read/imaged according to the template selected by processor 1050. It is preferred that reader 1000 move ballots through transport path 1030 at the rate of at least about 10-12 inches per second (about 25-30 cm/sec.) so that ballots on either 8\ufffd\ufffd11 inch paper and/or on A4 paper may be read at a rate of at least about one ballot per second. It is also preferred that reader/imager 1010 have a resolution of at least about 100 dpi or greater, and it is desirable in some cases that reader 1000 provide dual-side document scanning. While 100 DPI is adequate for use with anti-copy features, a resolution of at least 200 DPI is typically employed.}",
