    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6534=U.S. Pat. No. 6,250,933, issued to Khoury et al. on Jun. 26, 2001, discloses a contact structure in which the contactors are produced on a semiconductor substrate or other dielectric by micro fabrication technology and in which each of the contactors is shaped like a bridge, with one or more angled portions supporting a horizontal contacting portion. Khoury's approach provides an array of all-metal contacts at semiconductor scales but provides a limited mount of wiping action when interfacing with metal pads because the contacting component is parallel to the metal pad. Khoury addresses the lack of wiping problem by adding asperities and making asymmetric structures to induce a wiping action. However, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that such approaches can provide a wiping distance of only 10% or less of the overall dimension of the contact which is often not enough for a satisfactory electrical connection. In addition, when contacting solder ball arrays, Khoury's approach requires the base surface of the solder balls to be physically contacted since the contacting surface is parallel to the solder ball array. Such contact can lead to damage on the base surface of the solder ball which in turn can lead to void formation during subsequent solder reflow as shown in FIG. 2C.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{57733=U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,065, issued to Smith et al. on Feb. 6, 2001, discloses small metal springs created by the inherent stress gradient in a thin metal film. Smith's approach provides an array of all-metal contacts at semiconductor scales. However, the metal springs point into the surface of the plane to be contacted and therefore is prone to damaging the solder balls when used to probe solder balls., 46438=This patent application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority from U.S. application Ser. No. 10/731,669, entitled \u201cConnector for Making Electrical Contact at Semiconductor Scales\u201d, filed by Dirk D. Brown, et al., on Dec. 8, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,244,125, which is related to concurrently filed and commonly assigned abandoned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/731,213 entitled \u201cMethod for Forming MEMS Grid Array Connector,\u201d of Dirk D. Brown et al. The aforementioned patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 56814=Connectors or interconnect systems for making electrical connection to semiconductor devices are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,356, issued to Eldridge et al. on Mar. 7, 2000, discloses an array of resilient contact structures that are mounted directly on the bonding pads of a semiconductor wafer. The contact structures are formed by attaching gold bond wires to the wafer, shaping the bond wires and then overcoating the bond wires to form composite contact elements. Although Eldridge discloses a approach for providing an array of all-metal contacts at semiconductor scales, the contact elements requires an expensive serial manufacturing process where the contact elements are formed one at a time. Also, the inherent pointy shape of the contact structures results in piercing action which is prone to damaging the contact point such as a solder ball when making contact.}",
