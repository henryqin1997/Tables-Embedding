An example of such a separation is the separation between an analogue (radio) and digital (microprocessor) part of the integrated circuit. FIGS. 41A and 41B In order to reduce cross talk between different elements on the silicon substrate it is necessary to make a physical separation between these elements. This separation could be done by total removal of the silicon creating a trench between these elements. This trench may be filled by any suitable material, such as epoxy 2042 or 2142 (in respectively) is created between different elements on the integrated circuit die.
