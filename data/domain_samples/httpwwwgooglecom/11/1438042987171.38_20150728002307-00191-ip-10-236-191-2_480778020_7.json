    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{351224=In the illustrative embodiment, each cathode strip 120A through 120E is made from a sheet of nickel wire mesh 156 coated with porous carbon material and granulated platinum or other catalysts 157 shown in FIG. 5A7 to form a cathode suitable for use in the discharging heads in the metal-air FCB system. Details of cathode construction are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,894,296 and 4,129,633, incorporated herein by reference. To form a current collection pathway, an electrical conductor 40 is soldered to the underlying wire mesh sheet of each cathode strip. As shown in FIG. 5A7, each electrical conductor 158 is passed through a hole 159 formed in the bottom surface of each channel 154 of the cathode support plate, and is connected to the input terminals of the cathode-anode output terminal configuration subsystem 132. As shown, each cathode strip is pressed into the lower portion of its channel 1564 in the cathode support plate 121 to secure the same therein. As shown in FIG. 5A7, the bottom surface of each channel has numerous perforations 160 formed therein to allow the free passage of oxygen to the cathode strip during the Discharge Mode. In the illustrative embodiment, electrolyte-impregnated strips 155A through 155E are placed over cathode strips 120A through 120E respectively, and is secured within the upper portions of the corresponding cathode supporting channels. As best shown in FIGS. 5A8, 5A13 and 5A14, when the cathode strips and thin electrolyte strip are mounted in their respective channels in the cathode support plate 121, the outer surface of each electrolyte-impregnated strip is disposed flush with the upper surface of the plate defining the channels., 147191=For example, in accordance with a first fabrication technique, a thin metal layer (e.g. nickel or brass) of about 1 to 10 microns thickness is applied to the surface of low-density plastic material (drawn and cut in the form of tape). The plastic material should be selected so that it is stable in the presence of an electrolyte such as KOH. The function of this thin metal layer is to provide efficient current collection at the anode surface. Thereafter, zinc powder is mixed with a binder material and then applied as a coating (e.g. about 10 to 1000 microns thick) upon the surface thin metal layer. The zinc layer should have a uniform porosity of about 50% to allow ions within the ionically-conducting medium (e.g. electrolyte) to flow with minimum electrical resistance between the current collecting elements of the cathode and anode structures., 65780=This is a Continuation-in-Part of: application Ser. No. 08/944,507 entitled \u201cHigh-Power Density Metal-Air Fuel Cell Battery System\u201d by Sadeg Faris, et al. filed Oct. 6, 1997, now U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described in detail the various aspects of the present invention described above, it is understood that modifications to the illustrative embodiments will readily occur to persons with ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. All such modifications and variations are deemed to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the accompanying Claims to Invention. The above-described FCB systems of the present invention can be used to power various types of electrical circuits, devices and systems, including, but not limited to, lawn mowers, stand-alone portable generators, vehicular systems, and a nominal 200kW discharging system. In embodiments where multiple cylindrical cathodes are mounted within an array-like structure, and each cathode support tube being synchronously driven by meshing gears and metal-fuel tape being transported over the surfaces thereof in accordance with a predefined tape pathway using a tape transport similar to the subsystem shown in FIG. 1, it is possible to generate very high electrical power output from physical structures occupying relatively small volumes of space, thereby providing numerous advantages over prior art FCB systems. One particular advantage in using a solid-state ionically-conducting belt like structure of the type-described above is that it provides \u201cfrictionless\u201d contact between transported metal-fuel tape and its rotating cylindrical cathode structure, thereby minimizing wear and tear of metal-fuel tape that is expected to be discharged and recharged over a large number",
