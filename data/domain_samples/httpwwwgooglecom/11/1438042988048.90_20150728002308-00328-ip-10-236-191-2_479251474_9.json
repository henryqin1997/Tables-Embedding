No. 5,836,586, which claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/034,058, filed on Jan. 8, 1997, all incorporated herein by reference., 109039=Alternatively, the player may be required to make a separate wager to be eligible for the jackpot/progressive bet that provides enhanced payoffs. FIG. 32 is an illustration of another progressive or jackpot aspect of the modified game of twenty-one designed for table play. For example, for separate wagers are available for the 17 bet. The player wins 5:1 if the dealer attains a 17 without an ace card dealt as the first card and the player made a wager on the main area of 17. The player wins 19:1 if the dealer attains a 17 with an ace card dealt as the first card, and the player made a wager on the ace area of 17. In addition, the player also wins enhanced odds if the dealer attains a 17 with a predetermined number/kind of cards, and the payer made a wager on the jackpot area of 17. For example, enhanced odds are provided, as described above, if the dealer attains a 17 with 5 or more cards (i.e., 5 card charley, and above), with cards of the same suit, and the like. Note that placement of separate wagers on separate areas (e.g., 17, 18 and/or the like) allows the player to be eligible for all enhanced payoffs with a single wager., 84880=FIG. 13 is an illustration of a seventh embodiment of the modified game of twenty-one designed for table play. In accordance with this seventh embodiment, the combined modified black jack wagers are placed in positions 17-18-20, and/or 19-21-bust that are disposed in the player position in a triangular orientation. Suitable odds may also be provided for this option of the modified black jack wager. Importantly, while this seventh embodiment combined different dealer outcomes, the player is still permitted to bet on one, a plurality or all possible dealer outcomes., 49613=This application is related to, and incorporates by reference, the following applications: provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/019,747, filed Jun. 14, 1996 entitled \"PICK 'EM POKER TOURNAMENT GAME AND INTERACTIVE NETWORK COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR IMPLEMENTING SAME\" and U.S. patent application Ser.
