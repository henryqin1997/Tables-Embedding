    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33458=The concept of recursive spatial-domain motion estimation, introduced by Netravali and Robbins, and described in U.S. Pat. 4,218,703, issued Aug. 19, 1980, converges upon explicit displacement estimates through the recursive updates of a steepest descent search. Thus, for each pixel in an image, an error function is defined as the squared difference between the desired pixel value and that of a displaced pixel in the previous frame. Thus, for a typical raster scan, an initial displacement is assigned based upon the value of one or more of the displacements which have already been computed for the neighboring pixels. If the error function at the present pixel is below a predetermined threshold, the method proceeds to the next pixel without modifying the displacement assigned in accordance with the neighboring pixels. Otherwise, the gradient of the error function is determined with respect to the displacement vector, and in an attempt to minimize the error function, the displacement vector is perturbed in a direction opposite to the gradient and in an amount proportional to its magnitude. The method thus uses this new value as the displacement value for the pixel and then proceeds to the next picture element., 64051=In yet another aspect of the invention, and as described the above-noted co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 740806, filed in the name of Henrique Malvar, on even date herewith, and assigned to the assignee of this invention, preprocessing techniques can be employed for improving even more upon the transform method described hereinabove, to substantially eliminate the block coding artifacts. In still another embodiment of the invention, the lossy compressor can be implemented using a short-space fourier transform, such as that described in U.S. application Ser. No. 713,478, filed on Mar. 19, 1985, for a Method and Apparatus for Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing Using a Short-Space Fourier Transform, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The disclosure and specification of the above identified United States patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Additions, subtractions, deletions, and other modifications of the preferred particular embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are within the scope of the following claims. The illustrated motion estimator can be implemented in hardware, in software, or in a combination thereof. Further, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the system controller 224 also prevents the displacement increment step size from being greater than a selected threshold, for example, greater than one pixel, and further prevents the maximum value of the displacement vector from being greater than a second selected threshold, for example greater than 71/2 pixels. In this manner, more control of the steepest descent process is available and singularities which prevent convergence can be avoided. and \"Gradient E\" represents the gradient of the present x or y error function, and \"Sign[\ufffd]\" equals \ufffd1 depending upon the sign of the argument. Equation 4, thus defined, provides a third method for an adaptive steepest descent approach. As noted above, however, the cutoff threshold value, T, is measured against the initial step size. Thus, the illustrated T can be defined as the product of a constant times the error gradient. R=[Gradient E(Vx i)]\ufffd[Sign[Gradient E(Vx i -1)]]+[Gradient E(Vy i)]\ufffd[Sign[Gradient E(Vy i-1)]] (new step size)=(old step size)\ufffd\u03b1 (Equation 3) ##EQU3## where According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the second method,",
