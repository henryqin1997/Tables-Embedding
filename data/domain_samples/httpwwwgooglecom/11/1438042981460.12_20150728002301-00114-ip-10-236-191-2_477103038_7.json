Since the walking cost can be obtained through processing which is almost the same as that for the \u201cpotential-basis label determination method,\u201d portions common between a program for the calculation of walking cost and a program for the label determination method can be programmed in the form of subroutines, which prevents a considerable increase in the size of the programs. Although the \u201croad-map-basis walking cost calculation\u201d requires a longer processing time as compared with the \u201cstraight-line-distance-basis walking cost calculation,\u201d the former is more advantageous in that the former can calculate walking cost accurately and can provide a user with a detailed route within each walking section. In the present invention, two methods are proposed in order to determine candidate entrance stations and candidate exit stations. In the method in which the \u201cstraight-line-distance-basis walking cost calculation\u201d is employed, candidate entrance stations and candidate exit stations are selected on the assumption that cost of each walking section is proportional to the straight-line distance between the start and end point of the section. In general, in a major city, roads intersect perpendicularly, and there is a possibly that at worst an error corresponding to the straight-line distance x {square root over (2)} (approximately 1.4) is produced. For example, when the maximum walking cost is designated to be 10 minutes, candidates stations",
