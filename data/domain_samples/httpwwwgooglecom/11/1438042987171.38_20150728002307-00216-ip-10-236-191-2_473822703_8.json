For example, the handle may be used for manipulating a forceps of a general nature such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,110 to Sanagi with the proximal end of the coil spring sheath abutting against plate 39 and the proximal end of the control being appropriately shaped and abutting against plate 40. The slide member 26 would be retracted to close the forcep cups and moved, or allowed to move, forwardly to open the cups. Thus the handle can be used to manipulate a core wire that is extended through a tubular member of a medical device and is longitudinally movable relative to at least a major portion of the length of the tubular member. Even though the main body has been described as being made of two sections, it can be made of a single top section without having a generally planar bottom surface, but still of a thickness many times smaller than the maximum transverse dimension which in turn is a number of times smaller than its length. Even though it is preferred and the invention has been described with the latch finger being integrally joined to the remainder of the main body, it is to be",
