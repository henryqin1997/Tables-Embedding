Another use of a hot or cold therapeutic pad is shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 whereby face mask 90 is presented. As shown, face or stress mask 90 consists of an outer cloth covering 91 with end flaps 92, 93 having hook and loop fasteners 94, 94' respectively affixed thereto. Mask 90 can be placed across the forehead and eye slot 95 allows the wearer to watch television or the like while mask 90 is worn. Mask 90 may be internally constructed similarly to therapeutic cylindrical pad 70 in FIG. 13 with a rubberized coating 96, a plastic envelope 97 and a liquid filled sponge 98 contained therein. FIG. 17 illustrates a side view of the device as shown in FIG. 16 illustrating the relative thinness of mask 90 which may be approximately one inch in thickness. Face mask 90 has been found to be useful in relieving headaches or facial aches or soreness which may develop proximate thereto. A similar construction without the eye slot 95 is seen in FIG. 18 having only one strap 101 attached to therapeutic liquid filled arm pad 100. Hook and loop fasteners 102 and 103 allow pad 100 to be attached around the neck, arm or leg of the person. Pad 100 includes an outer",
