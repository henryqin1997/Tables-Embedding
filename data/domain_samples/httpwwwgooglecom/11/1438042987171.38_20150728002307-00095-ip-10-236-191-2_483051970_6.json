No. 134,354, filed Mar. 27, 1980, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of my co-pending application, Ser. No. 88,344, filed Oct. 26, 1979, now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 31175=A typical polyolefin based conductive PTCR polymer formulation was prepared, having the following composition: 1633 g. (54 wt. percent) high density polyethylene (\"Marlex\" 6003 made by Phillips Petroleum), 1331 g. (44 wt. percent) carbon black (\"Furnex\" N765 made by Cities Sevices Co.) and 60.5 g. (2 wt. percent) anti oxidant (an oligomer of 4,4-thiobis(3-methyl-6-t-butyl phenol) with an average degree of polymerisation of 3 to 4, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,981). All materials were dried prior to compounding (50\ufffd C., 1 Torr for at least 16 hours). A Banbury mixer was preheated by fluxing high density polyethylene for 5 minutes. The composition ingredients were dry blended and introduced into the preheated, water cooled Banbury mixer. After mixing for 4.5 minutes in high gear, the composition was dumped, cooled to room temperature, granulated, and dried (50\ufffd C., 1 1 Torr, 16 hours).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing detailed description, it is evident that there are a number of changes, adaptations, and modifications of the present invention which come within the province of those skilled in the art. However, it is intended that all such variations not departing from the spirit of the invention, be considered as within the scope thereof as limited solely by the appended claims. FIG. 5 is a resistance versus temperature curve as discussed earlier showing the steep increase of conductive polymer resistivity with temperature. Specifically, the resistivity increases over four orders of magnitude in less than 10\ufffd C. The circuit is initially adjusted to display a set of digits which correspond to the cable's known length (in any unit of length desired) with no regions of elevated temperature. When a region of elevated temperature occurs, the proportional decrease of capacitance of the cable from the control end to the region of elevated temperature is displayed as a lesser set of digits which correspond to the location of the hot region. The cable of the instant invention may be described as comprising an infinite number of resistance (R) and capacitance (C) sections. The cable is connected as shown as the capacitance portion of a resistance (R)/capacitance (C) network of one half of a dual monostable multivibrator 40. The R/C time constant thus formed determines the length of time that the monostable multivibrator 40 is in its \"on\"",
