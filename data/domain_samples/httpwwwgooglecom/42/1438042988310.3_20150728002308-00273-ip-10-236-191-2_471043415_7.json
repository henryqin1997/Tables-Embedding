Because the user data capacity of one sector is 2048 user data bytes, this makes it possible to manage 2048\ufffd65,536=134,217,728 bytes or approximately 134 megabytes. This, however, is not enough. By using a 3-byte Physical ID Pid, however, it is possible to manage 224 =16,777,216 sectors, which means that 2048\ufffd16,777,216=34,359,738,368 bytes or approximately 34.36 gigabytes of user data can be managed., 59812=The constraints on sector size as they relate to compatibility with the sector format of read-only optical disc media are described below, noting first that the read-only optical disc media considered herein is a read-only Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) medium (DVD-ROM below). The data capacity of one recording sector on a DVD-ROM is 2048 bytes. Each sector also contains such control information as error correction code, synchronization signals, and a sector address signal in addition to data. The synchronous frame length in this sector format is 93 bytes, and each recording sector contains 26 contiguous synchronous frames of 93 bytes each. A synchronization mark is inserted at 93-byte intervals, i.e., the synchronous frame length, and the sector size is therefore 93\ufffd26=2418 bytes., 84310=Guard data as described above follows immediately after the postamble PA, and is followed by a buffer zone. It should be noted that a certain amount of fluctuation in the rotational speed of the spindle motor used in the device rotationally driving the optical disc cannot be avoided, and a certain amount of eccentricity resulting from mounting the optical disc to the spindle motor must also be considered as these can cause the time length of the sector to vary. A buffer zone is therefore inserted to provide the margin needed to absorb these changes in the time-based length of the sector. When the drive apparatus records to the optical disc, modulated data is recorded onto the optical disc at the channel clock frequency of the drive apparatus. In general, the tolerance for variations in spindle motor speed is within 1% of the target speed, and tolerance for variations in linear speed resulting from eccentric rotation of the optical disc is 0.5% of the spindle motor speed when linear speed is converted to spindle motor speed. The buffer zone must therefore be approximately 1.5% of the sector length (2697 bytes), or approximately 40 bytes, and 40 bytes is therefore allocated to the buffer zone in this embodiment. Note that writing data to the buffer zone is prohibited during recording. Data is also not read from the buffer zone during reproduction., 44630=It is also necessary to consider compatibility with the format used in read-only optical discs in digital video applications when devising the sector format for a rewritable optical disc. For example, if a sector format providing the greatest possible compatibility with read-only digital video discs (DVD) comprising 26 synchronous frames of 93 bytes each in one sector, i.e., 2418 bytes/sector, is to be achieved, it is at least necessary for each sector in the rewritable optical disc to be formatted with the ability to store 2418 bytes of user data in the data area with the sector length, including the header area, being an integer multiple of 93 bytes., 39120=A typical conventional method of compensating for the tracking offset that occurs in a push-pull tracking servo method is described in Japan Examined Patent Publication (kokoku) H7-46430 (1995-46430) and known as the so-called \"composite track wobbling\" method. This method continuously applies push-pull tracking servo control to an optical disc wherein a header area comprising a pit sequence offset laterally from a track center disposed to a particular place, and a data recording area comprising a preformed groove of a particular depth, are formed alternately along a predetermined track. Using the symmetry of the signal amplitude when the wobbling pit sequence is reproduced in the header area, the tracking servo is controlled so that the signal amplitude reproduced from the pit sequence wobbling laterally to the track center is the same on both sides of the track center to compensate for low frequency tracking offset., 37270=The format shown in FIG. 11C is that of a conventional optical disc as described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H7-110944 (1995-110944). This format uses an independent land and groove addressing scheme in which an independent address is assigned to each land track and each groove track using pre-embossed pits formed offset in a line parallel to the track such that the address signal pits for adjacent tracks will not overlap., 85697=A total physical sector size of (93\ufffdn) bytes where n is an integer is preferred because synchronization marks are inserted at 93-byte intervals. The minimum value of n must therefore be 27 or greater because (93\ufffdn) must be greater than 2418. However, because the ratio of redundancy to the data recording capacity rises if n is too great, n is defined as 29. The sector size is thus 93\ufffd29=2697 bytes., 34305=As described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H6-290465 (1994-290465) and Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H7-57302 (1995-57302), the transition point between alternating groove tracks and land tracks is detected in a SS-L/G format disc, and tracking servo polarity is changed at the detected transition point to track either the groove recording track or the land recording track., 72465=The VFO used in an optical disc medium according to the present invention is a pattern such as . . . 1000100010001 . . . . Note that this VFO pattern is different from the VFO pattern used in, for example, a standard ISO-13842 optical disc (an international standard for 130 mm optical discs, which uses a (1,7) modulation method), i.e., the highest recordable frequency pattern, . . . 101010 . . . , of the (1,7) modulation method. If this practice of using the highest recordable frequency pattern were followed, the VFO pattern in an optical disc according to the present invention would be . . . 1001001001 . . . because of the (8,16) modulation method used., 61753=The data recording density is determined by track pitch and linear recording density, as well as the redundancy of the sector format. The track pitch is 0.74 \u03bcm and the linear recording density is limited to a bit length of 0.4 \u03bcm or greater. While described in greater detail below, note that the track pitch is determined by limitations relating to tracking servo signal detection stability and crosstalk performance requirements, specifically the ability to suppress crosstalk from an adjacent track so that the data error rate remains below a particular level. The linear recording density is likewise determined based on the ability to suppress jitter in the signal reproduced from the recorded signal so that the reproduction error rate is suppressed below a particular level. Because of these limitations, the optimum value of n is 29 if a total per-disc recording capacity of 2.6 GB per side is to be achieved on a 120 mm diameter disc. The recording sector length is thus 2697 bytes., 83433=This 37,856-byte ECC block is then sliced into 91-byte segments and a 2-byte synchronization mark is inserted to the beginning of every 91st byte, thus growing the ECC block to 38,688 bytes. This total is then sliced into sixteen 2418-byte data unit B segments of 13 rows\ufffd186 bytes., 82675=The size of the data area is determined by the ability to record 2048 bytes of user data. Sixteen bytes of complementary data comprising a 4-byte data ID, 2-byte data ID error detection code (IED) 6-byte reserve (RSV) block, and a 4-byte error detection code (EDC) are added to each 2048-byte block of user data. This complementary data and the user data are then scrambled to generate a data unit A, which is thus 2064 bytes long., 36838=The format shown in FIG. 11B is that of a conventional optical disc as described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H6-176404 (1994-176404). This format uses a common land/groove addressing scheme. The pre-embossed pits of the address signal are formed at approximately the center of a land track and groove track pair such that both tracks can be addressed using the same single address signal pits., 32335=The single spiral land-groove format is shown in FIG. 10. In this format a single spiral is separated into plural groove recording tracks each equivalent to one circumference of the disc and plural land recording tracks each equivalent to one circumference of the disc where the land tracks are disposed between the groove tracks and the groove tracks and land tracks alternate from the beginning to the end of a single spiral formed on the disc. An optical disc formatted with a single spiral recording track with alternating contiguous groove recording tracks and land recording tracks as shown in FIG. 10 is described, for example, in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H4-38633 (1992-38633) and Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) H6-274896 (1994-274896)., 30992=A conventional optical disc formatted for land-groove recording is described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) S63-57859 (1988-57859) and shown in FIG. 9 by way of example only. As shown in FIG. 9, both groove 94 and land 95 are formed by means a guide channel cut into the surface of a disc substrate, and a recording layer 91 is then formed over the entire disc surface. Recording pits 92 are formed in the recording layer of both the groove 94 and land 95. The groove 94 and the land 95 each form a continuous recording track on the disc. Data recording and reproducing are accomplished with this optical disc by scanning the groove recording track or the land recording track with the focused laser beam spot 93 of the optical disc drive device. It should be noted that with this conventional land-groove recording track format the guide channel is formed as a single continuous spiral channel on the disc. The groove 94 and land 95 recording tracks are thus connected with each forming a single continuous spiral recording track, respectively., 86117=Using this sector size makes it possible to achieve format compatibility with DVD-ROM discs in which the synchronous frame length is 93 bytes. This is because while one sector of a DVD-ROM disc comprises 26 synchronous frames of 93 bytes each, or a total 2418 bytes, the user data capacity of the data area in an optical disc according to the present invention is 2418 bytes, and the sector length including the header area is an integer multiple of 93 bytes. Because the synchronization marks are also inserted every 93 bytes, an apparatus capable of reproducing a DVD-ROM disc can easily detect the 93-byte synchronous frames in the sector format of the invention using common reproduction circuitry., 61036=Because the synchronous frame length of a DVD-ROM is 93 bytes, the record sector length of an optical disc according to the present invention is (93\ufffdn) bytes. Error correction code and other data in a DVD-ROM is recorded in 2418-byte batches to the record sector. Furthermore, for the address management needed for the rewritable area, the record sector also comprises an additional header area to which is written the address information. This means that the integer n whereby the sector length including this new header area is determined is a value of 27 or greater because (93\ufffdn) must be greater than 2418. However, if n is unnecessarily great, the redundancy to data capacity ratio increases., 66426=The sector layout of an optical disc medium according to the first embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2 each 2697-byte sector comprises a 130-byte preformatted pit area comprising a 128-byte header area and a 2-byte mirror area comprising simply a mirror surface, and a 2567-byte data recording area for storing 2048 bytes of user data. The data recording area more specifically comprises a 10-byte gap area, 15-byte guard data area, 35-byte single frequency pattern area VFO3, 3-byte presync area, 2418-byte data area, a 1-byte postamble, 45-byte guard data area, and a 40-byte buffer zone. Sector length variations resulting from write clock or disc speed errors are compensated for using the buffer zone at the end of each sector., 62765=If the recording sector length is 2697 bytes there is no extra capacity for byte allocation to the various areas disposed in the sector. The conditions that must be satisfied in each of the sector subareas and the allocation satisfying these conditions and the overall constraints of the disc are described below. If extra byte capacity is available, it is easy to assign sufficient length to the header area, which is redundant, and thereby assure high reliability in address information reproduction. For the reasons described above, however, it is extremely difficult to manipulate the address signal placement to eliminate redundancy while also assuring reliability in an optical disc according to the preferred embodiment of the invention., 83735=As a result of this process, the sixteen 2048-byte user data blocks are converted to 2418-byte blocks containing ECC and other information. While not described above, data modulation is also accomplished during this process. If the data recording capacity of each sector is 2418 bytes, it is therefore possible to ensure a 2048 byte/sector user data recording capacity. The data area size is therefore 2418 bytes., 67209=To increase the user data capacity of the optical disc it is necessary to shorten the redundancy header area as much as possible while still ensuring the reliability of address reproduction. Furthermore, to maintain format compatibility with read-only optical discs, (93\ufffd3=) 279 bytes of the total 2697-byte sector length must be allocated to the areas required to enable data rewriting, including the header area, gap, guard data, VFO3, and buffer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. It is also possible to record within the limited byte capacity of the sector format an address signal containing sector address information that can be reproduced with practical reliability. Moreover, it is therefore also possible to easily assure sector address management compatibility in an apparatus for reproducing both rewritable optical disc media according to the present invention and read-only optical disc media. It is therefore possible to achieve a rewritable optical disc using a single spiral land-groove format whereby format compatibility with read-only optical disc media can be easily assured. As also described above, read-only optical disc media for read-only digital video applications use the same addressing method in which a sequential address number is assigned to the recording sectors in the sequence in which they are formed on the recording spiral. As a result, the same sector address management method can be used with such read-only optical disc media and the rewritable optical disc media according to the present invention. As described above, an optical disc according to the present invention comprises land",
