In a 4 oz wide-mouth jar with magnetic stirring bar was placed 1.9977 g of the calcined Al2 O3. While it was being stirred, 0.81 M Fe(NO3)3 solution in H2 O was added dropwise to incipient wetness. 0.6 mL was required. The wet powder was dried with stirring on a hot plate., 58569=Davison SMR-37-1534 SRA alumina is an \u03b1-boehmite with an average crystallite size of 15 angstroms, an average agglomerate size of 0.2 microns, and an average particle size of 15 microns., 65301=Examples 11-33 describe fibril synthesis runs. Table 1 summarizes experimental conditions and results. Unless otherwise stated, the fibril precursor was benzene as an approximately 9:1 hydrogen:benzene mixture, and gas flow rates were 300 mL/min for H2 and Art; 300 mL/min CO and 100 mL/min H2 for CO/H2; 300 mL/min Ar or H2 through benzene at 20\ufffd C. for Ar/C6 H6 or H2 /C6 H6 (approximately 9:1 volume ratio Ar or H2 /C6 H6). Air and hydrogen were always separated by a brief argon purge of the reactor. Experimental protocols were similar in each run, and are described in detail for Examples 11, 15 and 28., 49132=In one embodiment, the fibril is produced by contacting for a period of time from about 10 seconds to about 30 minutes and at a pressure of about one atmosphere, a suitable iron-containing particle with gaseous carbon monoxide at a temperature of about 1000\ufffd C., the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon monoxide to iron-containing particle being greater than about 1000:1. In another embodiment the fibril is produced by contacting for from about one minute to about five minutes and at a pressure of about one atmosphere, a suitable iron-containing particle with benzene (gaseous) in an approximately 9:1 hydrogen: benzene mixture at a temperature of about 1100\ufffd C., the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon-containing compound to iron-containing particle being greater than about 1000:1. In a preferred embodiment of this method, the iron-containing particle is supported on a chemically compatible, refractory support, as previously described. Preferably such refractory support is alumina., 19188=This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/978,634, filed Nov. 19, 1992, now abandoned, (refiled as continuation application Ser. No. 08/466,878, filed Jun. 6, 1955), which is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 07/593,319, filed Oct. 1, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,165,909, issued Nov. 24, 1992, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 06/871,676, filed Jun. 6, 1986, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 678,701, filed Dec. 6, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,230, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the present application., 64799=In a 4-in polymerization tube, 0.23 g of Davison SMR-37-1534 SRA alumina which had been calcined 2 h at 900\ufffd C. in air was evacuated and 2.0 mL freshly prepared Fe2 O3 sol (prepared as in Example 7) was added. The tube was vented and the sol id filtered out on an M-glass fritted filter. The cake was air-dried., 39235=Another method for producing an essential cylindrical, discrete carbon fibril according to this invention comprises contacting for an appropriate period of time and at a suitable pressure a catalyst, i.e. , a suitable discrete metal-containing particle, with a suitable precursor, i.e., a suitable gaseous, carbon-containing compound, at a temperature between about 850\ufffd C. and about 1200\ufffd C. The ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon-containing compound (precursor) to metal -containing particle (catalyst) is suitably at least about 100:1. A method for continuously producing carbon fibrils comprises continuously contacting for an appropriate period of time and at a suitable pressure, suitable discrete, metal-containing particles (catalyst), with a suitable gaseous, carbon-containing compound, (precursor), at a temperature between about 850\ufffd C. and about 1200\ufffd C., and recovering the fibrils so produced. In one embodiment, the fibrils may be recovered in association with the metal-containing particles. In another embodiment the fibrils may be separated and recovered from the particles, e.g., by extraction of the metal particles into 10% aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. The continuous contacting in one embodiment is effected by continuously introducing the precursor into a reaction zone containing the catalyst particles and continuously withdrawing the precursor from the reaction zone, e.g., a flow tower reactor with a packed bed or fluidized bed of catalyst. In ar,.ether embodiment, contacting is effected by continuously introducing the catalyst particles into a reaction zone containing the precursor and continuously withdrawing the catalyst from the reaction zone. In another embodiment, contacting is effected by continuously introducing both the catalyst particles and the precursor into a reaction zone and continuously withdrawing both from the reaction zone, e.g., a continuous cocurrent or countercurrent flow tower., 62365=A portion of Davison SMR-37-1534 SRA alumina powder was calcined 2 h in an air stream at 900\ufffd C. in a Vycor\ufffdtube. One gram of the product was placed in a capable 4-in polymerization tube and enough 1.6M Fe (NO3)3 solution was added to cover the alumina completely. The tube was capped and evacuated until bubbling ceased. It was vented and the excess liquid filtered off through an M glass fritted filter. The moist cake was calcined in a ceramic boat for 1 h in an air stream at 500\ufffd C., 59941=Into a 4 oz wide-mouth glass jar with a magnetic stirring bar was placed 10 g Davison SMR-37-1534 SRA alumina powder. To the stirred powder 0.81 M Fe(NO3)3 in H2 O was added dropwise to the point of incipient wetness. 4.1 mL was required., 45637=It is desirable that catalyst particles be of reasonably uniform diameter and that they be isolated from one another, or at least held together in only weakly bonded aggregates. The particles need not be in an active form before they enter the reactor, so long as they are readily activated through a suitable pretreatment or under reaction conditions. The choice of a particular series of pretreatment conditions depends on the specific catalyst and carbon-containing compound used, and may also depend on other reaction parameters outlined above. Exemplary pretreatment conditions are provided in the Examples which follow. The metal-containing particles may be precipitated as metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, carboxylates, nitrates, etc., for optimum physical form. Well-known colloidal techniques for precipitating and stabilizing uniform, very small particles are applicable. For example, the techniques described by Spiro et al. for precipitating hydrated ferric oxide into easily dispersible uniform spheres a few nanometers in diameter, are very suitable for catalyst preparation, J. Am. Chem. Soc.88(12):2721-2726(1966); 89(2):5555-5559 and 5559\u22675562(1967). These catalyst particles may be deposited on chemically compatible, refractory supports. Such supports must remain solid under reaction conditions, must not poison the catalyst, and must be easily separated if necessary from the product fibrils after they are formed. Alumina, carbon, quartz, silicates, and aluminum silicates such as mullite may be suitable support materials. For ease of removal, their preferred physical form is thin films or plates which can easily be moved into and out of the reactor. It is further contemplated that carbon fibers or preformed carbon fibrils may be suitable support material., 28748=The fibril of this invention may also be produced by contacting for an appropriate period of time and at a suitable pressure a suitable metal-containing particle with a suitable gaseous, carbon-containing compound, at a temperature between about 850\ufffd C. and about 1200\ufffd C., the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon-containing compound to metal-containing particle being at least about 100:1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations An epoxy resin system having 100 parts by weight DGEBA, 36 parts by weight DDS curing agent and 0.5 parts by weight BF3 MEA accelerator may be used to wet the mat prepared in example 36 and the resulting mass dried overnight at room temperature. Ten one-inch squares are cut from the dried mat and placed in a heated die. A composite is formed by hot-pressing for 3 hours at 100\ufffd C. The composite is removed from the disc and aired for 24 hours at 120\ufffd C. and 4 hours at 175\ufffd C. Example 37: Composite Preparation After 3 hours, the system is shut down and cooled and the ceramic filter is removed. The carbon fibrils are obtained matted to the filter. The fibrils may be scraped from the filter and used to form a composite. Gas flow through the reaction zone is 0.16 m/sec and the zone is approximately 10 meters long. The reaction may be terminated by the injection of cold (100\ufffd C.) gas. Product fibrils are collected on a porous ceramic filter and the effluent gas is recompressed to about 1.3 atmospheres. A small purge is taken from the effluent gas to balance unknown impurities formed in the reactor and contained in the feed CO. The stream passes through a KOH Bed (0.5m in diameter \ufffd2 m long) before the make-up CO is added. The stream then is divided; 9 g/second",
