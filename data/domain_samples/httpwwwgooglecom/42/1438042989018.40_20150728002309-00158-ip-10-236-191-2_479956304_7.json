Thus it is important to provide a scaleable web server (see for example, Goldszmidt, G. and Hunt, G. \u201cNet Dispatcher a TCP Connection Router\u201d IBM Research Report, 1997; and Dias, D. M., Kish, W., Mukheijee, R., and Tewari, R., \u201cA Scalable and Highly Available Web Server\u201d, Proc. 41st IEEE Computer Society Intl. Conf. (COMPCON) 1996, Technologies for the Information Superhighway, pp. 85-92, February 1996. One known method to provide load balancing in a scaleable web server is to use a so-called Network Dispatcher [see e.g., U.S. Pat No. 5,371,852, issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Attanasio et al., entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Making a Cluster of Computers Appear as a Single Host,\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and Attanasio, Clement R. and Smith, Stephen E., \u201cA Virtual Multi-Processor Implemented by an Encapsulated Cluster of Loosely Coupled Computers\u201d, IBM Research Report RC 18442, (1992). Here, only the address of the Network Dispatcher (ND) is given out to clients; and the Network Dispatcher distributes incoming requests among the nodes in the cluster (also called a virtual encapsulated cluster (VEC)), either in a round-robin manner, or based on the load on the nodes. In co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/861,749, filed May 22, 1997, entitled \u201cA Method for Local and Geographically Distributed Load Balancing Using A Generalized TCP Router\u201d, by Dias et al., which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, an example of a generalized Network Dispatcher is disclosed, that allows routing to nodes that may be located anywhere in a general inter-network., 54852=When the networks 1040 and 1010 are ATM networks, the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) can be used in accordance with the present invention. The NHRP allows the establishment of so-called shortcut connections between endpoints not belonging to same subnet, bypassing any intermediate NBMA (non-broadcast multiple access) attached routers (not shown). The standard NHRP components include an NHRP Client (NHC) and an NHRP Server (NHS)., 86817=When the primary ND-FE is repaired or recovers, as is conventional, it updates the network 1030 of its availability for routing. It will get cache updates from those FEs for which it is configured as a backup. As is conventional, as the network learns of the ND-FE's availability for routing, new connections will be routed to it automatically and packets for existing connections may be rerouted via the ND-FE without interruption to clients. The switch back to the primary ND-FE can be handled by standard protocols known in the art. Using Cache consistency protocols between the ND-FEs allows this invention to take advantage of the nature of packet switched networks., 52337=Unlike conventional network dispatchers or routers, the present invention can use topology, rate, link speed, and other information contained in the switch network to route client requests to the servers. For example, on a Switched network, such as ATM, routing protocols, such as the Private Network to Network Interface (PNNI) distribute a large amount information to the switches, that can be used by the ND-CE and/or ND-FE to select an appropriate route to the appropriate server. When utilizing such routing protocols, the ND-CE and ND-FE have access to a potentially wide variety of relevant information about other switches, links between them and devices, that can be used make improved server selections. Examples of such useful information include: the end-to-end delay (up to the server); the jitter (delay variation to get to the server); the throughput to/from a server (average, peak, burstiness); and the propagation delay. This allows for a configurable metric to be a criteria for selecting an optimal server. These decisions can be made in the ND-CE 1011, which can also forward to the ND-FE 1013, 1014 its decision criteria, such as weights and conditions under which the ND-FE may use the criteria. Thus, the ND-FE can independently allocate connection requests to servers using the existing switch connections it has established. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a part of the ND-FE, which is a client of the ND-CE, would preferably receive this information and direct its use in the ND-FE., 62264=FIG. 4 depicts an example of the ND-FE 1014 and a client 1021 of FIG. 1 merged, resulting in a merged client/ND-FE 4420. As depicted, when the client/ND-FE 4420 issues a new request, it goes immediately (4405) via the SWAN 1040 to the ND-CE 1011 which then returns (4415) the switched address of a selected server in the cluster 1005 to the client/ND-FE 4420. The ND-CE 1011 also forwards 4425 the request to the selected server 1005. After that initial exchange, all traffic for that connection is switched 4445 between client/ND-FE 4420 and selected server 1005 via the switched backbone 1040. Termination flows are similar to those discussed in FIG. 2., 83943=ND-FE's fail independently of the ND-CE. If an ND-FE fails, only those clients (1021, 1022, 1031, or 1032) that are connected through the failing ND-FE are affected. In FIG. 1, clients 1021 and 1022 are connected through ND-FE 1014 and clients 1032 and 1031 are connected through ND-FE 1013. If the ND-FE 1013 fails, only those clients (1032 and 1031) which are connected through the backbone 1030 could be affected. If the backbone network through which the clients request are being routed to this invention (routed backbone) has only a single ND-FE 1013 through which it can route, then the failure of that FE will permanently disconnect those clients. To protect against this single point of failure, a second ND-FE can be configured to attach to this routed backbone 1030. Typically however, the routed backbones such as the Internet, will have multiple routes available. When a client connects, the routing information available in the network can be used to configure which other ND-FEs (or routes) (in order of priority) could be selected if the ND-FE 1013 fails. The primary and secondary ND-FEs can be configured as such using the priority selection information. A cache consistency protocol can be maintained between the primary ND-FE and the next two most likely ND-FEs to keep the connection table synchronized with the active ND-FE. The cache consistency protocol sends TCP connection keys and an identifier of the selected server to the backup ND-CEs. When a backup ND-CE receives a TCP connection key, a short cut is assigned and an entry is made in its connection table. If no short cut exists between the backup ND-FE and the selected server, one is established. One skilled in the art can use the previously defined flows to delay establishing this connection until the first packet is received. In FIG. 1, consider ND-FE 1013 as a primary ND-FE and ND-FE 1014 as a backup. The ND-FE 1014 connection table includes entries for all the clients connected through the ND-FE 1013 for which it is configured as the alternate. When the primary ND-FE 1013 fails, the backbone will route the packets to the configured alternate ND-FE., 55658=Specific extensions must be added in an NHRP implementation since the client sees only one target IP address (the virtual encapsulated cluster (VEC) address) although there are several possible targets in the cluster of servers 1005. So NHC++ and NHS++ functions (described below) must be provided in this case. The number of required specific devices should be minimized, to be able to support any customer configuration. To get full advantage of the shortcut connection, a preferred embodiment puts the NHC++ client in an ingress router to the SWAN 1040 and the NHS++ function at least in the ND-CE 1011. All that is needed in the routers on the path from the WAN ingress NHC++ to the ND-CE/NHS++ is the support of NHS. Similarly, all that is needed in the routers on the path from ND-CE/NHS++ to the NHC++ in the target servers is the support of NHS (as will be described with reference to FIG. 7). Note that the enterprise router (the WAN egress one) need not have the NHS++ function., 55323=In this case, the ND-FE and the ND-CE may use a modified NHRP Client referenced as NHC++ (a standard NHC with additional functions that will be described below). In one embodiment, the ND-CE 1011 includes a modified NHRP Server referred to as NHS++ (a standard NHS with additional functions described below)., 83540=FIG. 1 also depicts the high availability features of the present invention. There can be one or more ND-CEs inside of switched network 1040. These CEs will use the same cache coherency protocol as described above to keep their internal tables synchronized. When an ND-CE fails, the ND-CE which takes over for it informs all of the ND-FEs that it is the new controlling ND-CE., 53900=Returning to FIG. 1, one or more clients 1021, 1022, are connected to the Switched Wide Area Network (SWAN) backbone 1040 via a routed backbone 1020 (also called routed network) and an Edge Switch/Network Dispatcher Forwarding Engine (ES/ND-FE) 1014. The Clients 1031, 1032 are connected to the SWAN backbone 1040 via the routed network 1030 and an ES/ND-FE 1013. The routed backbone (1020, 1030) is broadly defined as any backbone through which a client's request can be routed to the edge switch (1013 or 1014). A switched enterprise network 1010 is also connected to the SWAN backbone 1040, via a Switch 1012. A Network Dispatcher Control Engine, ND-CE 1011 is also connected to the SWAN backbone 1040. A cluster of servers 1005 is connected to the switched enterprise network 1010., 50003=1. In the client: so that a TCP connection is switched entirely from client to server. This approach, which is the most efficient, requires the clients to be directly connected to a switched network (1040 or 1010) (a more detailed example will be described with reference to FIG. 4). In general however, the Clients (1031, 1932, 1021, 1022) do not have to be directly connected via a switched network, they can be connected to the Internet using any technology., 59587=When the client 1021 terminates the connection to the server 1005, the ND-FE 2023 marks the connection for removal, and either: forwards (2025) a connection termination packet and any subsequent packet for that connection to the ND-CE 1011; or it forwards the connection termination packet to the server 1005, and after the connection has terminated, separately informs (2029) the ND-CE 1011 of the termination of the connection. When the connection termination packet and subsequent packets are being forwarded (2025) to the ND-CE 1011, the ND-CE 1011 marks the connection for removal, and forwards (2015) the packet to the associated server. The ND-CE 1011 removes the connection when it has been idle for an amount of time, which is preferably configurable. When the ND-FE 2023 separately informs (2029) the ND-CE 1011 of connection termination, the ND-CE 1011 will simply remove the connection from its connection table. Upon termination of a connection, the switched connection between the Edge switch 1014 and the server 1005 is kept so that additional connections directed to the same server from the same ND-FE 2023 will be able to reuse it. After a configurable period of time without any client connections requesting that server, the corresponding switch connection 2028 may be removed., 34419=ATM is well known in the art. By way of overview, ATM has its history based in the development of Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). ATM is a method of multiplexing and switching packets that has been chosen as the transmission mode of B-ISDN. ATM, a transfer mode for high-speed digital transmission uses a packet switching technology and has nothing to do with \u201casynchronous\u201d transmission (see e.g., \u201cPDH, Broadband ISDN, ATM and All That: A guide to Modern WAN Networking, and How It Evolved,\u201d by Paul Reilly, Silicon Graphics Inc. (Apr. 4, 1994), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. ATM packets are called cells, wherein each cell has a 5 byte header and 48 bytes of data. ATM packet switching differs from conventional packet switching in that ATM packets follow pre-established routes called virtual paths and virtual circuits. Although ATM is not dependent on any particular physical medium of transmission, when the medium of transmission is mainly optical fibers, the error and loss rate is very small and hence no retransmission is done. See e.g., \u201cAsynchronous Transfer Mode Tutorial,\u201d Northern Telecom, http:/www.webproforum.com/nortel2/index.html, (Jun. 10, 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 47903=FIG. 1 depicts an example of the present invention deployed in a switched Network including a switched technology. In general, a switched wide area network backbone 1040 is a conventional Wide Area Network (WAN) implemented with any switch technology, including but not limited to: Frame Relay; ATM; or X.25. Similarly, a switched enterprise network 1010 is a conventional enterprise network implemented with any switch technology such as Frame Relay, ATM, or X.25. As is conventional, a backbone network is any network that forms the central interconnect for an internet. A national backbone is generally a WAN; a corporate backbone is usually a LAN (local area network) or a set of LANs., 50533=2. At same location as the control engine: A set of clustered ND-FE and the ND-CE can be connected through a conventional switch fabric or an enterprise switch network 1010. This solution has the advantage of not changing the client and the WAN backbone. However, if the WAN backbone is a switched network 1040, this approach will not take full advantage of the switched WAN backbone 1040. Nevertheless, this approach still allows the distribution of the forwarding engine 1014, while taking advantage of the enterprise switched network 1010 (between the merged ND-FE/ND-CE and the servers 1005). An example of a merged ND-CE and ND-FE will be described with reference to FIG. 3., 58656=Returning to the connection setup, the ND-CE 1011 also forwards (2015) the initial client request to the server in the cluster 1005, via the switched network 1040, the switch 1012 and the switched enterprise network 1010. Once the ND-FE 2023 receives the selected server switched address, it will establish 2027 a switched connection 2028 to the selected server. If a switch connection already exists (2028), it will preferably reuse the existing (2028) connection instead of establishing (2027) a new one. After the connection is established (new or existing) the ND-FE 2023 will forward any subsequent packet 2036 of the client connection on the established switched connection 2028 to the server 1005, via switched network 1040, the switch 1012 and the switched network 1010., 56694=FIG. 2 shows an example of a logic flow to set up a switched path between a client and a server in accordance with the present invention. As depicted, a client 1021 issues a request 2035 to obtain TCP service from a cluster of servers 1005. The request 2035 eventually reaches an Edge switch 1014, on the border of the Switched Wide Area Network backbone 1040. The Edge Switch 1014 also contains a Network Dispatcher Forwarding Engine (ND-FE) 2023. The ND-FE 2023 performs a standard table lookup to determine whether or not the request is part of an existing connection. If the request is part of an existing connection, the ND-FE 2023 retrieves the corresponding switched connection and forwards (2028) the client request over the existing switched connection straight to a server in the cluster 1005 (via the switched network 1040, the switch 1012 and the switched enterprise network 1010). If there is no preexisting connection, the ND-FE 2023 forwards the client request 2025 to the Network Dispatcher Control Engine ND-CE 1011. The ND-CE 1011 selects a server in the cluster 1005 and returns (2026) the selected server's switched address to the ND-FE 2023. In addition, the ND-CE 1011, can forward to the ND-FE 2023 its decision criteria (such as weights) and the conditions under which the ND-FE 2023 may use these criteria. The ND-FE 2023 can use the criteria to independently allocate connection requests to servers 1005 using the existing switch connections it has established. The ND-CE 1011 preferably also gives the ND-FE 2023 information on how long it should retain switched paths to servers after they have become idle. This additional information can be sent using the same flow (2026), or separately (2029)., 43445=One embodiment of the present invention includes all the capabilities of existing TCP-connection routers, including high availability and fault tolerance. See for example, the commonly assigned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/929,409, entitled \u201cFault Tolerant Recoverable TCP/IP Connection Router,\u201d by Baskey et al., filed Sep. 15, 1997, IBM Docket No. YO997-232, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another embodiment includes one or more of the functions of existing TCP-connection type routers for feedback to balance the load across the cluster of servers., 48626=The present invention preferably includes well known network dispatcher (ND) logic, which is a software router of TCP connections which also supports load balancing across multiple TCP servers. Those skilled in the art will appreciate however that any TCP connection router and/or load balancing logic can be adaptable to the present invention. As depicted, the present invention includes two entities: a Network Dispatcher Control Engine (ND-CE) 1011; and a Network Dispatcher Forwarding Engine (ND-FE) 1013, 1014. The ND-CE 1011 is in charge of assigning a connection to a server 1005 and forwarding information about the assigned server and connection to the ND-FE 1013 or 1014. Each ND-FE 1013, 1014 applies the assignments received from the ND-CE 1011 to map a TCP connection onto a switched (for example ATM) connection. Ultimately, the ND-FE communicates a connection termination event back to the ND-CE 1011. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this method is independent of the protocol used to propagate the information between ND-CE 1011 and the ND-FE 1013, 1014, as well as independent of the physical locations of these functions., 38577=In that context, the IETF is considering various alternatives to take advantage of the simple/fast/efficient processing capabilities of ATM switches. What the various alternatives have in common is a dynamic scheme to simplify all intermediate hops (any hop but Client and Server) processing by replacing a routing decision based on an IP header, with a switching decision based on an ATM header. This means that, ultimately, only the endpoints (i.e., Clients and Servers) will process the IP packets (IP layer, TCP layer, etc.) while any other hop on the path between endpoints will switch ATM packets. Some of the alternatives are also considering a so-called \u201cshort-cut\u201d method, which is a mechanism to bypass some of the intermediate hops, when physical connectivity allows it. The solutions considered by the Internet community include: the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) (see e.g., \u201cNext Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)\u201d, The Internet Society, Network Working Group, RFC 2332 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety); the IPsilon IP Switching Protocols (IFMP and GSMP); Tag Switching; and IBM's Aggregate Route-based IP Switch (ARIS)., 63065=FIG. 5 depicts an example of a logic flow used at an ND-FE to select a server and select or setup a switched path to it. In step 5010, the ND-FE 2023 (FIG. 2) receives a client request. In step 5030, it performs a table lookup to determine whether there is an existing connection to which this request belongs. If there is an existing connection, in step 5170 it simply forwards the request over the associated switched connection. If in step 5030, there is no existing connection then in step 5060 the ND-FE 2023 checks whether is can select the destination server locally or whether it must go to the ND-CE 1011 (FIG. 2). This decision is preferably made using a configurable function and data provided by the ND-CE 1011 on a previous flow (2029\u2014described in FIG. 2). If the ND-FE 2023 can select the server locally, in step 5100 it selects a server. If in step 5060 the ND-FE 2023 cannot select the server locally, in step 5090, the ND-FE 2023 interrogates (2025 in FIG. 2) the ND-CE 1011 to obtain a server selection and a corresponding switched address. Once a server has been selected either locally, or by the ND-CE 1011, the process continues at step 5130. In step 5130, the ND-FE 2023 checks whether there is an existing switched connection to the selected server. If there is a switched connection, in step 5170, it forwards (2028 in FIG. 2) the request over the existing switched connection. If there is no existing switched connection to the selected server, in step 5160 the ND-FE sets up a switched connection to the selected server. When this is done, in step 5170 it forwards the client request over the new switched (2027 in FIG. 2) connection.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Now that the invention has been described by way of a preferred embodiment, with alternatives, it is understood that those skilled in the art, both now and in the future, may make various equivalents, improvements and enhancements that fall within the scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, these claims should be construed to maintain the proper protection for the invention first disclosed. The cache consistency protocol between the ND-FEs assures that the terminated active connections will be broadcast to ND-FEs that are backups. If the network is routing packets differently because of varying congestion conditions, a single client may appear to be active in two ND-FEs. At some point, the connection will be terminated and because each of those ND-FEs is a backup of the other, the termination will be replicated to the backup ND-FEs via the cache consistency protocol, causing the clients connection to be purged from the backup FEs. When the primary ND-FE is repaired or recovers, as is conventional, it updates the network 1030 of its availability for routing. It will get cache updates from those FEs for which it is configured as a backup. As is conventional, as the network learns of the ND-FE's availability for routing, new connections will be routed to it automatically and packets for existing connections may be rerouted via the ND-FE without interruption to clients. The switch back to the primary ND-FE can be handled by standard",
