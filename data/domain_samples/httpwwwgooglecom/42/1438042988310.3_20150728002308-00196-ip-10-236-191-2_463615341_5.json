Vhat I claim is A vise of the character described, comprising a body, a pair of jaws mounted on the body, and a gripping structure for each shoulders thereof and engaged by the said shoulders, whereby the said members are free to rotate on their own axes, but are securely held against accidentaldispla'cement. shaped in cross section and having at their upper and lower ends shaped shoulders overhangin the convex face of the member and having their opp'osmg faces undercut, all of the members except the outermost ones having arc-shaped grooves in their ends forming intermediate dove-tail tongues having concave faces, fitcorrespondingly v and in all these uses, automatically adjusts ting upon the adjacent members between the itself to take care of any irregularity in the article clamped. ' The invention has been illustrated as being applied to an ordinary vise but it is evident that it may be used on a. pipe vise or any other form of vise and if desired chucks for lat-hes as Well as other machinery of said javvs, each gripping structure consisting of a pluralit of elongated nested members, said mem ers each being arc-. This con-' struction holds the various members together in their proper central position while allowing a free rotary movement thereof for permitting automatic adjustment and, consemay be readily clamped With an even pressure over the clamped surface.",
