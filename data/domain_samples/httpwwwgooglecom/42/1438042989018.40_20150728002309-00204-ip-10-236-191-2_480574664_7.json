The higher his/her share of cash is in the payment combination, the higher the value of each unit of non-monetary currency may be. As shown in FIG. 4, non-monetary currency value growth, for example, may be 0.1% before achieving the coverage price and may change to 5% after the coverage price for the product is reached. The change in value for user 105 may be important. In the current example, the \u201cnon-monetary currency shopping value\u201d starts at $0.00177 (when $1 is paid in cash) and ends at $0.01489 (when $99 is paid in cash) which corresponds to a value increase for the user over 740% (all at the same price per point for the underlying reward program.)}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42049=To finance the rewards, reward program sponsors back up their non-monetary currency (program liability). Therefore every program sponsor attributes a backup value per non-monetary currency unit issued (e.g., US$0.01). Such backup values per non-monetary currency unit vary heavily among programs and typically depend on an enterprise's cost structure and/or general margin as well as an industry's competitive environment. For example, airline frequent flyer programs offer free seats for flights or upgrades as rewards. For such free seats, airlines only back up the variable cost. Since the airline industry's cost structure generates high fixed and low variable cost, the cost of such free seats are minimal compared to other programs. For example, if the participant of a frequent flyer program redeems 20,000 miles to purchase a flight having an average retail value of $400, the variable cost to the frequent flyer program might be around $50. Due to the great value for both airlines and customers, frequent flyer programs world-wide have been very successful. However, it has also led to a world wide frequent flyer program mileage liability of over 14 trillion miles by the end of 2004, making frequent flyer miles the biggest currency in the world. As a consequence, airlines face pressure on free seat availability while customers face devaluation of their mileage currency. In some situations, airlines offer non-flight rewards (products or services) to provide their customers alternative rewards. However, such alternative rewards are usually low-value mileage redemption opportunities. For example, an airline may offer a box of chocolates for 20,000 miles as a non-flight reward to its frequent flyer program participants. While the cost to the frequent flyer program facilitator is $50 for both the box of chocolates or the flight, the retail value to a customer for these two rewards differs substantially. The retail value to the program participant for a flight is $400 as compared to the $55 retail value for the box of chocolates.}",
