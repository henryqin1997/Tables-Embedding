    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by [0052] As described above, the glass spacer for an electron-beam emitting display device of the present invention is composed of non alkaline glass and is substantially free of the alkali metals. The glass spacer has almost the same linear expansion coefficient as that of soda-lime-silica glass which constitutes the front panel and the back panel of an electron-beam emitting display device. The glass spacer can provide a high-quality electron-beam emitting display device which is free of electric field breakage and damage due to difference of the thermal expansion between the glass spacer and the panels thereof. [0051] On the other hand, the samples of glass of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 each of which includes a larger amount of SiO2 than that of the present invention greatly differ from soda-lime-silica glass in the linear expansion coefficient and thus are unsuitable for the glass spacer of an electron-beam emitting display device. [0050] It is apparent from Table 2 that the non alkaline glass of the present invention including no alkali has about the same linear expansion coefficient as that of ordinary soda-lime-silica glass. 425 706 650 682 715 703 yield point [\ufffd C.] temperature [\ufffd C.] 330",
