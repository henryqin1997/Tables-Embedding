Traditional measurement techniques measure \u201chits\u201d or page views by firing off javascript calls (or the like) generally once per web page, or by processing server logs. The challenge with determining the level of user interaction with an interactive application such as video is that the majority of the interaction occurs within the client, whether it is a Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, Windows desktop, Mac application, peer-to-peer, or other video implementation. By combining user-driven event calls from the video player with logic to signal when the user is skipping or rewinding over particular segments of the video file or stream, it is possible to measure the actual \u201ccaptive\u201d viewing time that the user experiences with the video. Example code for performing this function for a Flash player is set forth below (\ufffd 2008 Visible Measures Corp.):, 17700=This application is based on and claims priority from Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The hardware and software systems in which the invention is illustrated are merely representative. The invention may be practiced, typically in software, on one or more machines. Generalizing, a machine typically comprises commodity hardware and software, storage (e.g., disks, disk arrays, and the like) and memory (RAM, ROM, and the like). The particular machines used in the network are not a limitation of the present invention. A given machine includes network interfaces and software to connect the machine to a network in the usual manner. The server may be part of a managed service (e.g., in an ASP model) using the illustrated set of machines, which are connected or connectable to one or more networks. More generally, the service is provided by an operator using a set of one or more computing-related entities (systems, machines, processes, programs, libraries, functions, or the like) that together facilitate or provide the inventive functionality described above. In a typical implementation, the service comprises a set of one or more computers. A representative machine is a network-based server running commodity (e.g. Pentium-class) hardware, an operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows, OS-X, or the like), an application runtime environment (e.g., Java, .ASP), and a set of applications or processes (e.g., Java applets or servlets, linkable libraries, native code, or the like, depending on platform), that provide the functionality of a given system or subsystem. As described, the service may be implemented in",
