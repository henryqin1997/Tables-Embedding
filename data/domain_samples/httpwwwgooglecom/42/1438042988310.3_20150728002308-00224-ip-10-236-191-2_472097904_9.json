    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{172110=[0268] The above experiment with colored polystyrene particles was repeated using the 1064 system and the results were reversed. The blue particle was preferentially moved. Similar results were obtained when the 1064 system was set at 150 mW rather than 2.5 W. This suggests that wavelength tuning could enhance the discrimination process., 41242=[0010] In 1987, Ashkin reported an experimental demonstration of optical trapping and manipulation of biological materials with a single beam gradient force optical trap system. Ashkin, et al., \u201cOptical Trapping and Manipulation of Viruses and Bacteria\u201d, Science, 20 March, 1987, Vol. 235, No. 4795, pp. 1517-1520. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,886, Ashkin et al., entitled \u201cNon-Destructive Optical Trap for Biological Particles and Method of Doing Same\u201d, reported successful trapping of biological particles in a single beam gradient force optical trap utilizing an infrared light source. The use of an infrared laser emitting coherent light in substantially infrared range of wavelengths, there stated to be 0.8 \u03bcm to 1.8 \u03bcm, was said to permit the biological materials to exhibit normal motility in continued reproductivity even after trapping for several life cycles in a laser power of 160 mW. The term \u201copticution\u201d has become known in the art to refer to optic radiation killing biological materials., 179865=[0286] Fluorescently labeled liposomes, approximately 0.2 micrometers in diameter, were obtained from a B-D Qtest Strep kit. Ten microliters was placed in a Rain-X coated slide and the 1064 system was used to generate an optical gradient field. A 15 mW 532 nm diode laser was also focused through the objective to visualize the liposome fluorescence. When a standing gradient field was projected onto the sample, fluorescence was more intense in this area. This suggests that the liposomes were moving towards the gradient field., 165336=[0246] Certain of the data reported herein were generated with the following setup. Optical gradient fields were generated using a Michelson interferometer and either a 150 mW, 812 nm laser (812 system) or a 2.5 W, 1064 nm laser (1064 system). The 812 system used a 100\ufffd (1.25 NA) oil immersion lens to focus the fringe pattern and to visualize the sample. The 1064 system used a 20\ufffd objective to focus the fringes and a 60\ufffd objective to visualize the sample. In general the sample cell was a coated microscope slide and/or coverslip that was sealed with Vaseline. Coverslip spacers controlled the height of the cell at approximately 150 micrometers, 172007=[0267] Separation By Wavelength Resonance (812 vs. 1064 nm), 146544=[0187] Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that approximately 8.4 million Americans alive today have a history of cancer, and that over 1.2 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in 2000. The NCI also estimates that since 1990 approximately 13 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, excluding noninvasive and squamous cell skin cancers. Optophoresis technology addresses some of the key unmet needs for better cancer screening, including: accurate, reproducible and standardized techniques that can detect, quantify and characterize disseminated cancer cells; highly specific and sensitive immunocytological techniques; faster speed of cell sorting; and techniques that can characterize and isolate viable cancer cells for further analysis., 171338=[0266] In another experiment, 1 micrometer latex beads labeled with biotin were used to determine changes in escape velocity when different ligands were attached. The biotin labeled beads were diluted 1/100 in PBS buffer. A 50 ul aliquot was incubated with an excess of streptavidin or 10 nanometer colloidal gold-streptavidin conjugate for 10 minutes. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS buffer. Measured escape velocities, using the 1064 system, were 5.3, 4.3 and 3.6 micrometers/second for biotin labeled beads, beads with streptavidin and beads with streptavidin-colloidal gold, respectively., 33155=[0005] Light has been used to sort and trap particles. One of the earliest workers in the field was Arthur Ashkin at Bell Laboratories, who used a laser for manipulating transparent, \u03bcm-size latex beads. Ashkin's U.S. Pat. No. 3,808,550 entitled \u201cApparatuses for Trapping and Accelerating Neutral Particles\u201d disclosed systems for trapping or containing particles through radiation pressure. Lasers generating coherent optical radiation were the preferred source of optical pressure. The use of optical radiation to trap small particles grew within the Ashkin Bell Labs group to the point that ultimately the Nobel Prize was awarded to researchers from that lab, including Steven Chu. See, e.g., Chu, S., \u201cLaser Trapping of Neutral Particles\u201d, Sci. Am., p. 71 (Feb. 1992), Chu, S., \u201cLaser Manipulation of Atoms and Particles\u201d, Science 253, pp. 861-866 (1991)., 184045=[0293] PMA was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. 3 mls of U937 cells grown in RPMI 1640 media with supplements were removed from the culture flask and 1 ml was placed into each of three eppendorf tubes. Cells from the first tube were pelleted for 4 minutes at 10,000 rpm and resuspended in 250 uL PBS/1% BSA buffer for escape velocity measurements. PMA was added to the remaining two tubes of U937 cells to a final concentration of 5 ug/mL. These tubes were vortexed and placed in a 37\ufffd C. water bath for either one hour or six hours. At the end of the time point, the tube was removed, cells were pelleted and then resuspended as described above and escape velocity measurements taken. The cells treated for 6 hours had a significantly higher escape velocity as compared to the untreated cells., 132336=[0162] The first setup is a moving fringe workstation for optophoresis experiments. A high power, 2.5 watt, Nd-YAG laser (A) is the near IR, 1064 nm wavelength, light source. The fringe pattern is produced by directing the collimated laser beam from the mirror (1) through the Michelson interferometer formed by the prism beam splitter (2) and the carefully aligned mirrors (3). A variable phase retarder (4) causes the fringe pattern to continuously move. This fringe pattern is directed by the periscope (5) through the telescope (5 a) and (5 b) to size the pattern to fill the back focal plane of the microscope objective, and then is directed by the dichroic beam splitter (6) through a 20\ufffd microscope objective (7) to produce an image of the moving fringe pattern in the fluidic chamber holding the sample to be sorted. A second, 60\ufffd microscope objective (8) images the flow cell onto a CCD camera to provide visualization of the sorting experiments. A fiber-optic illuminator (9) provides illumination, through the dichroic beam splitter (6), for the sample in the fluidic chamber. The fluidic chamber is positioned between the two microscope objectives by means of an XYZ-translation stage., 43628=[0012] Various measurements have been made of biological systems utilizing optical trapping and interferometric position monitoring with subnanometer resolution. Svoboda, Nature (London), 365, pp. 721-727 (1993). Yet others have proposed feedback based systems in which a tweezer trap is utilized. Molloy, et al., Biophys. J., 68, pp. 2985-3055 (1995)., 31644=[0004] Electromagnetic response properties of materials have been utilized for particle sorting and characterization. For example, dielectrophoretic separators utilize non-uniform DC or AC electric fields for separation of particles. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,200, Pethig et al., entitled \u201cApparatus for Separating By Dielectrophoresis\u201d. The application of dielectrophoresis to cell sorting has been attempted. In Becker (with Gascoyne) et al., PNAS USA, Vol. 92, pp. 860-864, Jan. 1995, Cell Biology, in the article entitled \u201cSeparation of Human Breast Cancer Cells from Blood by Differential Dielectric Affinity\u201d, the authors reported that the dielectric properties of diseased cells differed sufficiently to enable separation of the cancer cells from normal blood cells. The system balanced hydrodynamic and dielectrophoretic forces acting on cells within a dielectric affinity column containing a microelectrode array. More sophisticated separation systems have been implemented. See, e.g., Cheng, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,394, \u201cChannel-Less Separation of Bioparticles on a Bioelectronic Chip by Dielectrophoresis\u201d. Yet others have attempted to use electrostatic forces for separation of particles. See, e.g., Judy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,638, entitled \u201cSurface Field-Effect Device for Manipulation of Charged Species\u201d, and Washizu \u201cElectrostatic Manipulation of Biological Objects\u201d, Journal of Electrostatics, Vol. 25, No. 1, June 1990, pp. 109-103., 175203=[0277] One milliliter of the leukemia cell line U937 suspension was pelleted and resuspended in 100 microliters PBS containing 1% BSA. Equal volumes of U937 and a 1/200 dilution of red blood cells were mixed together and 10 microliters was placed on a CYTOP coated slide. Separate measurements with moving fringe fields showed that the escape velocity for U937 cells was significantly higher than the escape velocity for red blood cells, 60 and 23 micrometers/second, respectively. The 1064 system was used to generate optical gradient fields with a fringe period of approximately 30 micrometers and moving at 45 micrometers/second, an intermediate fringe velocity. As expected the U937 cells move with the fringes and the red blood cells do not. In one embodiment, the moving fringe may be reduced to a single peak. Preferably, the peak is in the form of a line. In operation, a slow sweep (i.e., at less than the escape velocity of the population of particles) is made across the region to be interrogated. This causes the particles to line up. Next, the fringe is moved quickly (i.e., at a speed greater than the escape velocity of at least some of the particle in the population), preferably in the direction opposite the slow sweep. This causes the selective separation of those particles having a higher escape velocity from those having a lower escape velocity. Optionally, the remaining line of particles may then be again interrogated at an intermediate fringe velocity. While this technique has general applicability to all of the applications and systems described herein, it has been successfully implemented for the separation of U937 cells from red blood cells., 177848=[0280] A 1/200 mixture of red blood cells and particles in PBS buffer, 1% BSA was added to an inlet reservoir and an equal volume of PBS buffer, 1% BSA was added to the other inlet reservoir. The gradient field was positioned in the crossbar of the \u201cH\u201d near the downstream junction. The 1064 system was fitted with a cylindrical lens to increase the aspect ratio of the gradient field. The resultant gradient field was approximately 40 micrometers wide by 80 micrometers long with a fringe period of 12 ums and moving at 30 micrometers/second., 45447=[0015] Yet others have utilized light intensity patterns for positioning materials. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,466, Burnes et al., entitled \u201cOptical Matter\u201d, arrays of extended crystalline and non-crystalline structures are created using light beams coupled to microscopic polarizable matter. The polarizable matter adopts the pattern of an applied, patterned light intensity distribution. See also, \u201cMatter Rides on Ripples of Lights\u201d, reporting on the Burns work in New Scientist, Nov. 18, 1989, No. 1691. Yet others have proposed methods for depositing atoms on a substrate utilizing a standing wave optical pattern. The system may be utilized to produce an array of structures by translating the standing wave pattern. See, Celotta et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,764, entitled \u201cMethod of Fabricating Laser Controlled Nanolithography\u201d., 29748=[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/845,245, filed Apr. 27, 2001, entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Use of Optical Forces for Identification, Characterization and/or Sorting of Particles\u201d, which is related to application Ser. No. 09/843,902, filed on Apr. 27, 2001, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Separating Micro-Particles\u201d, with named inventor Osman Kibar, which claims priority from provisional Application Serial No. 60/248,451, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Sorting Cells or Particles\u201d, filed Nov. 13, 2000. Those applications are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein., 40066=[0009] Early stable optical traps levitated particles with a vertical laser beam, balancing the upward scattering force against the downward gravitational force. The gradient force of the light served to keep the particle on the optical axis. See, e.g., Ashkin, \u201cOptical Levitation by Radiation Pressure\u201d, Appl. Phys. Lett., 19(6), pp. 283-285 (1971). In 1986, Ashkin disclosed a trap based upon a highly focused laser beam, as opposed to light propagating along an axis. The highly focused beam results in a small point in space having an extremely high intensity. The extreme focusing causes a large gradient force to pull the dielectric particle toward that point. Under certain conditions, the gradient force overcomes the scattering force, which would otherwise push the particle in the direction of the light out of the focal point. Typically, to realize such a high level of focusing, the laser beam is directed through a high numerical aperture microscope objective. This arrangement serves to enhance the relative contribution from the high numerical aperture illumination but decreases the effect of the scattering force., 180516=[0288] Polystyrene and silica particles were diluted in distilled water. As shown in the photographs of FIG. 34, a \u201cbefore\u201d image was captured using a CCD camera and Image Pro Express software. A moving optical gradient field generated by the 1064 system was scanned over the particles. Another image (an \u201cAfter\u201d image) was captured and the \u201cbefore\u201d image was subtracted. The resultant image (labeled \u201cDifference\u201d) clearly identifies that the polystyrene particle had moved., 44025=[0013] A number of workers have sought to distort or stretch biological materials. Ashkin in Nature (London), 330 pp. 769-771 (1987), utilized optical tweezers to distort the shape of red blood cells. Multiple optical tweezers have been utilized to form an assay to measure the shape recovery time of red blood cells. Bronkhorst, Biophys. J., 69, pp. 1666-1673 (1995). Kas, et al., has proposed an \u201coptical stretcher\u201d in U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,859 which suggests the use of a tunable laser to trap and deform cells between two counter-propagating beams generated by a laser. The system is utilized to detect single malignant cancer cells. Yet another assay proposed colliding two cells or particles under controlled conditions, termed the OPTCOL for optical collision. See, e.g., Mammer, Chem & Biol., 3, pp. 757, 763 (1996)., 47306=[0018] Others have attempted to combine microfabricated devices with optical systems. In \u201cA Microfabricated Device for Sizing and Sorting DNA Molecules\u201d, Chou, et al., PNAS USA, Vol. 96, pp. 11-13, Jan. 1999, Applied Physical Sciences, Biophysics, a microfabricated device is described for sizing and sorting microscopic objects based upon a measurement of fluorescent properties. The paper describes a system for determining the length of DNA by measuring the fluorescent properties, including the amount of intercalated fluorescent dye within the DNA. In \u201cA Microfabricated Fluorescence-Activated Cells Sorter\u201d, Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 17, Nov. 1999, pp. 1109-1111, a \u201cT\u201d microfabricated structure was used for cell sorting. The system utilized a detection window upstream of the \u201cT\u201d intersection and based upon the detected property, would sort particles within the system. A forward sorting system switched fluid flow based upon a detected event. In a reverse sorting mode, the fluid flow was set to route all particles to a waste collection, but upon detection of a collectible event, reversed the fluid flow until the particle was detected a second time, after which the particle was collected. Certain of these systems are described in Quake et al., PCT Publication WO 99/61888, entitled \u201cMicrofabricated Cell Sorter\u201d., 42286=[0011] The use of light to investigate biological materials has been utilized by a number of researchers. Internal cell manipulation in plant cells has been demonstrated. Ashkin, et al., PNAS USA, Vol. 86, 7914-7918 (1989). See also, the summary article by Ashkin, A., \u201cOptical Trapping and Manipulation of Neutral Particles Using Lasers\u201d, PNAS USA, Vol. 94, pp. 4853-4860, May 1997, Physics. Various mechanical and force measurements have been made including the measurement of torsional compliance of bacterial flagella by twisting a bacterium about a tethered flagellum. Block, S., et al., Nature (London), 338, pp. 514-518 (1989). Micromanipulation of particles has been demonstrated. For example, the use of optical tweezers in combination with a microbeam technique of pulsed laser cutting, sometimes also referred to as laser scissors or scalpel, for cutting moving cells and organelles was demonstrated. Seeger, et al., Cytometry, 12, pp. 497-504 (1991). Optical tweezers and scissors have been used in all-optical in vitro fertilization. Tadir, Y., Human Reproduction, 6, pp. 1011-1016 (1991). Various techniques have included the use of \u201chandles\u201d wherein a structure is attached to a biological material to aid in the trapping. See, e.g., Block, Nature (London), 348, pp. 348-352 (1990)., 173004=[0271] Using the 1064 system, the gradient force was focused into a diffuse spot approx. 15 micrometers in diameter. More generally, for all of the systems and applications described herein, a defocused beam, such as a defocused laser beam may be utilized. Preferably, the beam is defocused such that the spot or beam size is on the order of magnitude of the size of the particle. For cells, the size would be approximately 10 to 20 microns. The polystyene particle moved towards the gradient field while the silica particle moved away from it. This demonstrated that the suspending medium could be changed to optimize separation.}",

Therefore, the invention is not limited except in accordance with the following claims. [0293] PMA was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. 3 mls of U937 cells grown in RPMI 1640 media with supplements were removed from the culture flask and 1 ml was placed into each of three eppendorf tubes. Cells from the first tube were pelleted for 4 minutes at 10,000 rpm and resuspended in 250 uL PBS/1% BSA buffer for escape velocity measurements. PMA was added to the remaining two tubes of U937 cells to a final concentration of 5 ug/mL. These tubes were vortexed and placed in a 37\ufffd C. water bath for either one hour or six hours. At the end of the time point, the tube was removed, cells were pelleted and then resuspended as described above and escape velocity measurements taken. The cells treated for 6 hours had a significantly higher escape velocity as compared to the untreated cells. [0292] Separation of Treated and Untreated Leukemia Cells [0291]FIG. 35 shows a graph of percent of cells measured as a function of escape velocity (\u03bcm/second).",
