It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is used in either the detailed description or the claims, such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as \u201ccomprising\u201d is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim. At 420, thickness and/or uniformity determinations are made with respect to the various wafer portions mapped by respective grid blocks XY. At 430, a determination is made concerning whether all grid block measurements have been taken. If the determination at 430 is NO, then processing returns to 420. If the determination at 430 is YES, then at 440 the determined thickness and/or uniformity values are compared to acceptable thickness levels for the respective portions of the wafer. At 450, a determination is made concerning whether any unacceptable thickness and/or uniformity values exist. If the determination at 450 is NO, that all thickness and/or uniformity values are acceptable, then at 460",
