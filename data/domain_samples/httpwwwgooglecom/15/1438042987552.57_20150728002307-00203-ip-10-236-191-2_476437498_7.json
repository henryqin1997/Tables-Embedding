Thus, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the invention as described without departing from the scope of the claims set out below. Once the vascular graft has reached the desired level of cell density, a preservative may then be pumped into treatment chamber 14 or 46. Once the treatment chambers are filled with the preservative, the inlet ports and outlet ports of the chambers may be closed, again creating a sealed chamber which may then be used to store and/or ship the cultured and preserved vascular graft. Preferably, the preservative is a cryo-preservative so that the graft may be frozen in chamber 14 or 46. In this manner, sealed treatment chamber 14 or 46 may be used to sterilize, culture, store, and ship vascular grafts or other protheses. Seeding and culturing of the vascular graft in treatment chambers 14 and 46 is generally accomplished by known techniques, with the added benefits and advantages gained from the radial and/or shear stresses placed upon the vascular graft during growth. Examples of suitable seeding and culturing methods for the growth of three-dimensional cell cultures are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,480, which is incorporated herein by reference. The techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,480 for establishing a three-dimensional matrix, inoculating the",
