No. 4,313,734, Feb. 2, 1982, to Leuvering, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. For details and engineering principles involved in the synthesis of colored particle conjugates see Horisberger, Evaluation of Colloidal Gold as a Cytochromic Marker for Transmission and scanning Electron Microscopy, Biol.

Colloidal gold particles may be made by any conventional method, such as the methods outlined in G. Frens, 1973 Nature Physical Science, 241:20 (1973). Alternative methods may be described in U.S. Pat.

The number of particles typically ranges between about 1\ufffd109 and about 1\ufffd1013 particles, although fewer than about 1\ufffd109 particles may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the number of particles is about 1\ufffd1011 particles.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments, it is apparent that other embodiments and variations of the invention may be devised by others skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. The appended claims are intended to be construed to include all such embodiments and equivalent variations. After completion of the assay, the device was dismantled and the presence of a visible line at the site of the interfering agent immobilization zone was detected in samples that previously gave false positive results in other assays. This demonstrated that the interfering agent immobilization zone was binding to the mobile labeling reagent bound to an interfering agent. Heterophilic antibodies (IgM and IgG mediated) are known to produce false positive results in immunometric assays. To combat the false positive results in an hCG assay for urine, serum, or blood, an IgG blocking agent was immobilized on a membrane as an interfering agent immobilization zone to remove the heterophilic antibodies from the sample. The urine or serum solutions described above were individually applied to an assay device cassette where they came into contact with a sample receiving membrane. The sample then flowed though the sample receiving membrane to the analyte detection membrane where the sample rehydrated the mobile labeling reagent, a charcoal particle coupled to an F(ab)\u20322 mouse monoclonal antibody specific for beta-hCG.
