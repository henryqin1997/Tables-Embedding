    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{12707=Under these circumstances it is often necessary to fix together the vertebral levels, after having returned them towards their normal position if safely possible. For this purpose, it is known from, for example British Patent Specification Nos. 1241292; 2051581 and 2131300; U.S. Pat. No. 4,611,581 and European Patent Specification No. 0128058, to provide fixation implants, each of which comprises an elongate member and a plurality of devices for anchoring the elongate member to respective vertebrae. British Patent Specification No. 1241292 discloses an implant which is for use posteriorly and in which the elongate member is a rigid channel member formed at intervals therealong with bores for receiving respective bone hooks having threaded shanks for insertion through the bores to cooperate with nuts which urge the vertebrae towards the channel member. This system has a number of disadvantages, for example that the hooks, and thus their vertebrae, cannot be adjusted relative to each other along the member after fixation and that the hooks cannot be adjusted around the member. The implant disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,611,581 has similar disadvantages, except that adjustment of its bone screws, and thus their vertebrae, relative to each other along the member after fixation is possible, but to an extent limited by bridging portions among slots along the plate-form elongate member. Another implant, shown in FIG. 1 of British Patent Specification No. 2051581, is for use posteriorly and comprises as its elongate member a rigid rod having two hook-like devices connected to respective ends thereof which hook respectively over and under respective vertebrae. With the implant in position on the spine, the devices are adjustable only away from each other. Another of these implants, also shown in that Specification, is again for use posteriorly and comprises as its elongate member a rigid screw-threaded rod having hook-like devices connected thereto which hook respectively over and under respective vertebrae. Each device includes a channel-form base portion which receives the threaded rod and the channel of which incorporates a bore which houses a sleeve encircling the rod. The external diameter of the sleeve is greater than the width of the mouth of the channel, so that the sleeve and thus the rod cannot be displaced radially out of the channel. However, the sleeve can be removed longitudinally from the channel in one direction only, whereafter the rod can be removed radially out of the channel. A nut threaded onto the rod prevents the device from sliding in one direction along the rod and simultaneously obturates the outer end of the bore to prevent the sleeve from leaving the bore, provided that the device is adjacent the nut. This implant has the disadvantage that removal of a nut from among the nuts on the rod involves the disconnection of the hook-like devices between that nut and one end of the rod, as does insertion of an extra nut among the nuts on the rod. Moreover, the need to thread the nut along the rod results in the device being rather slow to assemble and can result in damage to soft tissue if carried out in situ. Another disadvantage is that, with the apparatus in situ, the hook part is not fixed by the apparatus against rotation about the rod and is fixed by the apparatus against movement along the rod in one direction only. Another known implant, but which is for use anteriorly, comprises a cable and several devices which are fixable in a substantially permanent manner to the cable at intervals therealong. These devices resemble bone screws in order that they may be able to be screwed into respective vertebrae. A third known implant, also for use anteriorly only, comprises a threaded rod, whilst its bone-screw-like devices incorporate rotatable nuts receiving the threaded rod and adjustable therealong by rotation, in order to allow in situ adjustment of the vertebral levels towards and away from each other.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The apparatus shown in FIGS. 1 to 4 can be used posteriorly, but with devices being identical to that shown in FIGS. 2 to 4, except that the shanks of the screws 5 are replaced by hooks hooked about the posterior elements of the vertebrae, either the laminae or transverse processes, so that the hook-like devices in this case can be adjusted towards and away from each other along a wire. If desired, there can be employed with the screws 5 respective toothed washers 23, as shown in FIG. 1, which engage in the bone of the vertebral bodies. In implantation, the lower ferrule 21, say, is brought into abutment against the head 10 of the lowest device 3. After clamping of the cable 20 to the devices 3, and with the ferrule 22 immediately above the uppermost device 3, the ferrule 22 and the cable 20 are transversely severed, such severing coincidentally clamping the lower piece of the ferrule 22 to the cable 20 to deter subsequent fraying of the upper cable end. In certain cases where the curvature of the spine is too great to permit use of a semi-rigid wire, in place of the wire 4 there can instead be employed, as shown in FIG. 5, a flexible cable 20, which is provided at its respective ends with fixed ferrules 21 each of an external diameter greater than the width of the slots",
