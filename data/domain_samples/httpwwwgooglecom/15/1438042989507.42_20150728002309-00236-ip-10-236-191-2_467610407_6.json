In yet another embodiment of the invention, as shown in FIG. 9, it is contemplated that modular display apparatus 78 is formed of component parts such as a back cover plate (not shown), panel support means 99 and signage panels which are substantially constructed of translucent material so as to enable the \"back lighting\" of the device by illumination means 97--comprising light box 101 with projection bulb 102 and projection aperture 103. In FIG. 10 signage panel 27b is shown secured in place and recessed against panel support means 20 while framed by the innermost sides of both elevated panel ridge 35 and overlay frame strut 18b. Overlay frame strut 18b is aligned with elevated ridge 35, to restrainably maintain signage panel 27b in place proximate to panel support means 20, at the innermost peripheral edge of overlay strut 18b. Optional back plate 40 is also shown in place behind panel support means 20, so as to nest in flange 22 thereof. In yet another embodiment of the invention a series of \"stepped\" or staggered positions for the displayed signage",
