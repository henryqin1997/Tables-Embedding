In particular, given that power and Q can often be interchanged when designing for a given oscillator phase noise specification, a better approach to implementing the VCO would be to use \u03bcmechanical resonators (with orders of magnitude higher Q than any other on-chip tank) to set the VCO frequency. In fact, with Q's as high as achievable via \u03bcmechanics, the basic design methodologies for oscillators must be re-evaluated. For example, in the case where the oscillator and its output buffer contribute phase noise according to Leeson's equation, where the 1/f2-to-white phase noise corner occurs at (fo/2Q)), a tank Q>1,500 is all that would be required to move the 1/f2-to-white phase noise corner close enough to the carrier that only white phase noise need be considered for CDMA cellular applications, where the phase noise power at frequency offsets from 285 kHz to 1515 kHz is most important. If only white noise is important, then only the output buffer noise need be minimized, and sustaining amplifier noise may not even be an issue. If so, the power requirement in the sustaining amplifier might be dictated solely by loop gain needs (rather than by phase noise needs), which for a \u03bcmechanical resonator-based VCO with Rx\u02dc40\u03a9, Lx\u02dc84 \u03bcH, and Cx\u02dc5 fF, might be less than 1 mW., 70014=FIG. 5a shows a perspective view schematic of a practical two-resonator micromechanical filter capable of operation in the HF to VHF range. As shown, the filter consists of two \u03bcmechanical clamped-clamped beam resonators with anchors 18 at their opposite ends, coupled mechanically by a soft coupling spring or beam 19, all suspended above a substrate (not shown). Conductive (polysilicon) strips 20, 22, 24, and 26 underlie each resonator by approximately 1000 \u212b (as also in FIGS. 6, 9 and 17 a), a center one 20 serving as a capacitive transducer input electrode positioned to induce resonator vibration in a direction perpendicular to the substrate, a center one 24 serving as an output electrode and the flanking ones 22 and 26 serving as tuning or frequency pulling electrodes capable of voltage-controlled tuning of resonator frequencies. The resonator-to-electrode gaps are determined by the thickness of a sacrificial oxide spacer during fabrication and can thus be made quite small (e.g., 0.1 \u03bcm or less) to maximize electromechanical coupling., 30639=This application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cDevice Including A Micromechanical Resonator Having An Operating Frequency And Method Of Extending Same\u201d filed Jan. 13, 2000 and having U.S. Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the best mode for carrying out the invention has been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention as defined by the following claims. Vibrating \u03bcmechanical resonators constitute the building blocks for a new integrated mechanical circuit technology in which high Q serves as a principal design parameter that enables more complex circuits. By combining the strengths of integrated \u03bcmechanical and transistor circuits, using both in massive quantities, previously unachievable functions become possible that enable transceiver architectures with projections for orders of magnitude performance gains. In particular, with the addition of high-Q \u03bcmechanical circuits, paradigm-shifting transceiver architectures that trade power for selectivity (i.e., Q) become possible, with the potential for substantial power savings and multi-band reconfigurability. SUMMARY High power handling micromechanical resonators may use alternative geometries (e.g., no longer flexural mode) and the use of alternative transduction (e.g., piezoelectric, magnetostrictive). The second method for upconversion, involves filtering the based band signal first, then upconverting. In this method, the baseband signal is again applied to the input electrode 20, but the dc-bias is applied to the input resonator, and the carrier signal to the output resonator. This way, the baseband signal is first filtered by the structure, then upconverted at the output via electromechanical amplitude modulation. Again, gain is possible in this configuration. There are two preferred methods",
