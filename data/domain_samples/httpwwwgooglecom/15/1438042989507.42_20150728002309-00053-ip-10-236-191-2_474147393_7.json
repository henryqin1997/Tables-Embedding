Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention and variations in the character of the disclosed or other embodiments, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to this description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments, or variations therein, as fall within the true scope of the invention. In another aspect, the bar code scanner methods disclosed above wherein multiple scan lines are employed provide other features of importance. The reliability of the decoding process can be enhanced by producing a composite signal from multiple simultaneous scans, where the effects of noise or defects can be minimized. Or, the increased scanning speed permitted by the use of no moving parts allows the multiple scans to be sequential, one line at a time, which allows the reflected light from the multiple scan lines to be separated when using only one photodetector; this arrangement permits scanning of multiple-row bar code symbols or the like. Although according to various features of the invention the scan generation may use oscillating mirrors, the embodiments of bar code scanner devices as with no moving parts as described above have several advantages for some purposes, when compared to scanners that use electromechanical",
