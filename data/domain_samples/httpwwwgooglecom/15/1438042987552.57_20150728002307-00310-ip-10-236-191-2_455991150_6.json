    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations During operation of the conveyor belt 10, the belt 16 may have a tendency to vibrate across its width, such as due to imperfections in the head pulley 12. Such vibration will cause varying forces to be applied to the blade tips 108. Accordingly, the cleaning apparatus 18 of the present invention allows each blade tip 108 to be independently movable with respect to the remaining blade tips 108. This occurs through rotation of the blade arms 100 about the longitudinal axis of the square-shaped bar 112 positioned within the suspension unit 90 (as depicted with reference to the arc identified by the letter \"x\" in FIG. 1) and by further rotation of the U-shaped bracket 34 about the longitudinal axis of the square-shaped member 68 positioned within the torsion unit 62 (as depicted with reference to the arc identified by the letter \"y\" in FIG. 1). Prior to operation, the cleaning apparatus 18 is adjusted such that the blade tip 108 rides slightly against the belt 16 of the conveyor belt 10, preferably at a location where the belt 16 makes contact with the head pulley 12 or any other pulley or roller associated with the conveyor belt 10, it only being necessary to assure that the blade tip 108 contacts the surface of the belt 16 at a location where the belt 16 is supported by such pulleys, rollers, etc. In addition, for maximum",
