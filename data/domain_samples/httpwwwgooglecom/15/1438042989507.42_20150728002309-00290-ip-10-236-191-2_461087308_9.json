Particle detection using HeNe lasers is shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,571,079, 4,594,715 and 4,798,465, and is also discussed in an article by R. G. Knollenberg entitled \"The Measurement of Particle Sizes Below 0.1 Micrometers\", Journal of Environmental Science, Jan.-Feb. 1985., 27162=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/607,289 filed Feb. 26, 1996 and is now U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,753.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, it is to be realized that this invention provides a novel device and method for intracavity detection of particles using optically pumped laser media. An added advantage of this invention is that optically pumped solid state laser media typically have much higher gain coefficients and smaller pump volumes than gas laser media. Thus, efficient operation can be realized with smaller laser mode sizes that are typical of shorter cavity spacings and shorter radius of curvature mirrors than with known gas laser systems. It is well established that laser cavities with short radius mirrors are less susceptible to perturbations than those with long radius mirrors. The light from optical pump source 19 may also be coupled from the optical pump source to lens 21 and laser medium 11 using optical coupling that includes fiber optics. As indicated in FIG. 8, lens 41 may be used to receive light from optical pump source 19 so that lens 41 focuses the light into the input end 43 of fiber optic coupler 45, with light from the output end 47 of coupler 45 being received at lens 21 in the same manner as described above with respect to FIG. 3, and, again, laser light from laser medium 11 is scattered at detecting region 29 within the resonant cavity in the same manner as described in connection with FIG. 3. As indicated in FIG. 7, mirror 15 can",
