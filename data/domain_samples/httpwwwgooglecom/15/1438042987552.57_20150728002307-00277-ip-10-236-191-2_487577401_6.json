With the power indicated, approximately a third of the surface area of the glass pane is completely cleared in less than 6 minutes, and the complete deicing of the glass pane is achieved at the end of 18 minutes. Compared to the glass pane according to the prior art heated over its whole surface (comparative example 2), the glass pane according to the invention enables a power gain of 30%. The glass pane covered with a layer of ice obtained under the conditions of comparative example 2 is placed at \u221220\ufffd C., and the 3 groups of wires are powered sequentially, the dissipated power being equal to 150 W. The first group (upper; relative area: 31%) is heated for 335 seconds, the second group (median; relative area 33%) for 357 seconds and the third group (lower; relative area: 36%) for 389 seconds. The glass pane of example 1 is used, modified in that it is provided with 21 heating strips connected in sevens to 3 separate electricity supplies connected to an electronic control box. The box is connected to an outside temperature measurement sensor (in the present case the temperature of the air is equal to that of the glass) and to 3 glass surface temperature measurement sensors, the letter being located on the face of the glass pane bearing the",
