For example, the peak reduction system and method of the present invention may also be advantageously employed in a multi-carrier cellular base station that is not necessarily a spread spectrum communication system. Accordingly, the described specific applications and environments for the peak reduction system and method of the present invention should not be viewed as in any sense limiting in nature and are merely illustrative of the present invention. A number of different embodiments of the present invention have been described in relation to the various figures. Nonetheless, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a variety of additional embodiments are possible within the teachings of the present invention. For example, a variety of specific circuits implementing specific algorithms may be provided employing the teachings of the present invention and limitations of space prevent an exhaustive list of all the possible circuit implementations or an enumeration of all possible algorithms. A variety of other possible modifications and additional embodiments are also clearly possible and fall within the",
