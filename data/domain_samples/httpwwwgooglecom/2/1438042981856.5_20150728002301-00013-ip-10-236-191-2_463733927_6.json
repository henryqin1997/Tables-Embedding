Therefore, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the appended claims and their equivalents. is a roll 100 of material from which lighting devices in accordance with the present invention can be made. As shown, the roll 100 includes at least one sheet of fabric 102 with a plurality of light emitting diodes 104 positioned therein. The roll 100 can be cut into portions of any size and shape, such as portions 106, 108 and 110 in order to create lighting devices in those shapes. In order to be able to cut the roll 100 into a variety of different shapes, the roll 100 can include redundant wiring between the plurality of light emitting diodes 104 such that regardless of the shape and size of the portions cut from the roll 100, the LEDs 104 within that portion will be electrically connected together. In this manner, in order to create the final lighting device, the ends of the cut portion are sealed, and a power source connector, such as a plug (not shown) is electrically connected to the plurality of electrically connected LEDs 104. In addition, a lighting control unit can be connected to the plurality of light emitting diodes 104,",
