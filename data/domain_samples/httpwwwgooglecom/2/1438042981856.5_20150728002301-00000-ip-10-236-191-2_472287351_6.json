Variations and modifications of the basic concept of the invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the arts of ultrasound imaging or computer graphics. All such variations and modifications are intended to be encompassed by the claims set forth hereinafter. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ultrasound imaging system has a plurality of different projection modes. For example, the projection may include maximum or minimum value pixels. Alternatively, a mode useful in imaging blood vessels may be selected wherein the pixel data is inverted and then the maximum values are projected onto the image plane. In accordance with a further mode, the ray-casting technique can be employed to provide a surface rendering. The projection technique is separately applied to the B-mode intensity data and to the color flow velocity or power data for the data volume of interest retrieved from the cine memory. Each pixel in the projected image includes the transformed intensity data and the transformed velocity or power data derived by projection onto a given image plane. In addition, at the time when the cine memory was frozen by the operator, the CPU 42 optionally stores the last frame from the XY memory 18 at multiple successive addresses in section 24B of cine memory 24. The projected image data for the first projected view angle is",
