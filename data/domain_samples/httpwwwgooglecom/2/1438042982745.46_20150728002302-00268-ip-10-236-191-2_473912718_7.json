This offset ensures that in use, the outer edges 390 a, 390 b of the carriage block 30 will not extend beyond the ends 2020, 2040 of the top plate 2000, even where the plate and carriage blocks are in the fully compressed configuration. Such an arrangement provides the advantage that it prevents any portion of the top plate 2000 from protruding either into or undesirably close to the adjacent disc space when the carriage blocks translate fully within their associated recesses.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{118894=The carriage blocks 300 a, 300 b, 300 c each may include one or more fastener holes 340 a, 340 b, 340 c configured to receive fasteners 44 to fix the carriage blocks to associated vertebrae. The track base 1000 may have first and second ends 1020, 1040 and may have a curved profile to allow the plate 228 to more closely match the contour of the patient's spine. The top plate 2000 may likewise have first and second ends 2020, 2040 and may have a curved profile that substantially matches that of the track base., 35996=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/932,392, filed Sep. 2, 2004, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/653,164, filed Sep. 3, 2003, the entire disclosure of each application is expressly incorporated by reference herein., 119581=The top plate 2000 may have a pair of lateral alignment flanges 1022, 1024 and at least one bore 2060 for receiving a holding fastener 400 for securing the top plate 2000 to the track base 1000. Any appropriate fastening means may be provided to fix the top plate to the track base, including but not limited to screws, rivets, press-fit, laser welding, brazing, or suitable adhesives. The alignment flanges 1022, 1024 may serve to align the top plate and track base, and to provide the plate 228 with increased strength in bending and torsion., 132048=The cam 1140 may be secured to the track base 1000 with a holding fastener 400 or any other appropriate fastening method. In one embodiment, the fastener may serve both to secure the cam 1140 to the track base 1000 and to provide a means of actuating the cam. Thus, the fastener 400 may have a recess suitable for receiving a driving and/or adjusting tool., 79929=The wedge angle \u03b1 may be formed with a variety of arrangements and/or techniques. First, the translating surfaces 18 a, 18 b and/or 20 a, 20 b could be machined to create the wedge angle \u03b1. Alternatively, the segments 33 a, 33 b could be bent and held at a certain distance that would create the wedge angle \u03b1, which would create the desired frictional fit between the carriage block 4 and the first plate segment 2 to achieve the desired control of movement between the carriage block 4 and the first plate segment 2 after implantation into the body. A preferred exemplary plate may require about 50 grams to about 1600 grams of force to move the carriage block 4 relative to the first plate segment. More specifically, an exemplary, illustrative plate for cervical applications may require about 50 grams to about 400 grams, and more preferably about 180 to about 220 grams. An exemplary, illustrative plate for lumbar and thorcolumbar applications may require about 100 grams to about 1600 grams, and more preferably about 400 grams to about 800 grams. The first plate segment 2 and carriage block 4 may also be designed so that the carriage block moves relatively freely with little or no friction., 120228=The top plate 2000 and track base 1000 may be assembled so as to retain the carriage blocks 300 a, 300 b, 300 c within associated recesses 1116 a, 1116 b, 1116 c so that the carriage blocks may slide within the recesses, thus providing the desired translation capability between the engaged vertebrae. The carriage blocks engage the respective recesses via reduced-size central portions 1350 a, 1350 b, 1350 c., 130529=The cam 1140 may also be used to induce a compression force between adjacent vertebrae to aid in seating a spinal fusion implant inserted therebetween. Thus, first and second carriage blocks 300 a, 300 b may be fixed to adjacent vertebrae with the cam 1140 in the unactuated position. Thereafter, the cam 1140 may be rotated to the actuated position, which may shift the first carriage block 300 a toward the second carriage block 300 b. This movement may cause the underlying vertebra to move with the first carriage block 300 a toward the second carriage block 300 b, thus reducing the space between the vertebrae and applying a compressive force between the vertebral end plates and a spinal fusion spacer placed therebetween., 91730=Further details and embodiments of appropriate fasteners, retention clips and bone fastener hole designs may be found in co-pending U.S. non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 10/653,164 entitled \u201cBone Plate with Captive Clips\u201d, by Duong, et al., filed Sep. 3, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference. It should be pointed out that while bone fastener holes 6, 8 have been described and illustrated as having a clip 38 to resist fastener back out, any number of well-known fastener holes and fasteners may be employed with bone plate 1, including bone fastener holes that are relatively smooth, partially or fully threaded, straight or conically shaped, elongated slots, with or without ramped surfaces to provide compression or combination holes that are both threaded and contain smooth ramped surfaces., 123789=The carriage block 300 may have compression and extension surfaces 392 a, 392 b configured to engage corresponding surfaces 1117 a, 1117 b of the associated recess 1116 formed in track base 1000. Thus configured, the connecting portions 350 of the carriage blocks 300 a, 300 b, 300 c may be received within the corresponding recesses 1116 a, 1116 b, 1116 c in the track base 1000 and may translate along the plate to provide the desired translation of adjacent vertebral bodies., 129677=Thus, prior to fixing the carriage blocks to the adjacent vertebrae, the cam 1140 may be rotated sufficiently to shift the adjacent carriage block 300 in a first direction toward the one of the walls 1117 b of the recess 1116, thus minimizing or eliminating the gap between the inside wall and the connecting portion 350 of the carriage block 300. Once the cam 1140 position is set, the carriage blocks 300 may then be fixed to the adjacent vertebrae to provide a translation plate having, if desired, a reduced translation length for each carriage block 300. This provides the benefit of allowing the surgeon to easily adjust the amount of translation desired for each level of fixation to suit the anatomy and physiology of the individual patient.}",
