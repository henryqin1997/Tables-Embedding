Although a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims. In the claims, means-plus-function clause are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures. Therefore, it is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications to the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments, are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein. While the present invention is described with respect to connection acceptance and scheduling, the combination of techniques of acceptance of connections and scheduling provides improved reliability in meeting the QoS requirements of a connection. Thus, the combination of aggregation of connection parameters in determining connection acceptance and the queuing scheduler of the present invention may be utilized to further improve the performance, efficiency",
