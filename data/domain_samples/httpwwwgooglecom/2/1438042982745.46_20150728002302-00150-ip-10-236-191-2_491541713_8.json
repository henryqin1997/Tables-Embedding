Of course, various changes, modifications and alterations in the teachings of the present invention may be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the intended spirit and scope thereof. Accordingly, an invention has been disclosed in terms of preferred embodiments thereof which fulfill each and every one of the objects of the present invention as set forth hereinabove and provides a new and useful optical 6D measurement system with two fan-shaped beams rotating around one axis of great novelty and utility. The calculations above have been made with the first fan-shaped beam including the center of the rotating cylinder and the second fan-shaped beam including the center of the origin which lies on the center of the rotating cylinder. It is obvious to anybody skilled in the art that other placements on the rotating cylinder for the two fan-shaped beams are possible as long as the second beam is skewed to the first beam. Ur =V1.sbsb.r, Sr =V1.sbsb.r \ufffdV2, Rr =U1 \ufffdSr and U0 =V1.sbsb.0, S0 =V1.sbsb.0, \ufffdV2.sbsb.0, R0 =U0 \ufffdS0 where A= Ur |Sr |Rr !* U0 |S0 |R0 !r, The rotation matrix can be determined by using the formula: V1 =V1.sbsb.r and V2 =V2.sbsb.r.",
