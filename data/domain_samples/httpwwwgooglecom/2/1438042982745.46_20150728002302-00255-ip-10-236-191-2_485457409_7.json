One embodiment of the method of decoding of the present invention that includes decryption is shown in FIG. 21. Note that each of the processing blocks in FIG. 21 are performed in the same manner as their similarly named counterparts in FIG. 16, with the exception of decryption processing block 2104. After error detection and correction, the data undergoes descryption (processing block 2104). The decryption processing 2104 is the inverse of the encryption applied in the method of encoding (FIG. 20). In one embodiment, the decryption process requires the use of the same key used during encryption. By using the same key, the original data is recreated., 170254=Where the method of encoding places multiple bits in each cell through the use of multiple spot sizes, the recovery process again preferably determines the centers of cells in a fashion described above but then determines not merely the presence of a spot at the cell's center but also the size of any spot present. In one embodiment, the size of a possible spot is preferably determined by first testing the center pixel of a cell (i.e., the pixel at the intersection of the lines through the column and row of the possible spot) to determine whether a spot exists. If a spot exists, this method of decoding then tests all contiguous pixels (i.e., pixels one pixel removed from the center pixel) and then, depending on the maximum size of possible spots, tests all pixels 2 pixels removed from the center pixel, and then retest pixels even further removed. This methodology can be applied to the datatile a portion of which is illustrated in FIG. 14. Cell 1409 contains a spot with a dark center and a gray border on all sides. The method first tests the center pixel, finding a dark spot. Depending on the printer/scanner resolution ratio, the method may continue to find dark pixels emanating out from the center pixel in the scanned image. Eventually, the method would encounter gray pixels. Having found both dark pixels at the center and gray pixels at the periphery, the method determines that the spot in cell 1409 represents the logical state expressed by a spot with a dark center and gray periphery. Spots such as those in cells 1402 and 1403 are determined by the dark pixels at the center and dark pixels on the periphery with the difference between the two spots determined by the number of pixels that are dark. Spots such as those in cells 1406 and 1407 are determined in a like fashion to the spots in cell 1402 and 1403 except that gray is found in the center and surrounding pixels. Adjustments obvious to those skilled in the art are made where the pixel determined to be at a possible spot's center is not in fact at the spot's exact center. For example, if the centroid pixel of a spot differs from the pixel determined to be at the intersection of the column and row containing the spot, the centroid pixel is used as the starting point instead of the pixel at the intersection., 152228=Having found the metasector (processing block 1702) the decoding process then finds the metasector markers, processing block 1703. In the preferred embodiment (as illustrated in FIG. 8 described above) the metasector includes 27 metasector markers, 9 columns of 3 evenly spaced markers, with one column of markers bordering each of the left and right sides of the metasector. In addition to having predetermined locations, the metasector markers of the preferred embodiment have a size predetermined to be different from the metasector data spots. The decoding process determines where the metasector markers should be and then confirms those locations or adjusts to the actual locations as necessary. Because the number of metasector markers and the number of cells between these markers is fixed in the preferred embodiment, this determination is straightforward (as described more fully below with reference to FIG. 18). Another embodiment of the invention provides for an abbreviated metasector, such as abbreviated metasector being warranted when, for example, customary practice of consumers limits the variety of formats actually used. The metasector format in the preferred embodiment expresses enough information to allow the main body of data to assume a vast variety of formats. Yet after considerable experimentation by consumers, it may be that only a relatively small number of such formats enters widespread use. These formats may be adequately captured by a much abbreviated metasector, that only permits these commonly used formats to be specified., 219267=FIG. 24 is a block diagram of a further embodiment of the method of transmitting digital data, one which includes facsimile transmission. The data source can be computer files or other digital data. It should be understood that the nature of computer files or other digital data is not limited in scope and can include any source described previously for other embodiments such as files that can be launched automatically or files associated with a particular application software that can be launched automatically. The method of decoding then provides for selection of format parameters, step 2401, and formatting, step 2402, these steps being the same as those described as steps 2201 and 2202, above., 133773=One embodiment would express different logical states for each cell by the placement of spots with different attributes. Depending on the embodiment, the attributes that could vary to express different logical states include spot size, spot color, ink type, and spot shape. In one such embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 13, each cell contains a spot. Each spot has one of two sizes. Markers 301, bordering the data cells, are 4 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. Each data cell contains one bit of information expressed by two logical states. A first logical state, exemplified by spot 1302, is expressed by a spot 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. A second logical state, exemplified by spot 1303, is expressed by a spot 1 pixel wide by 1 pixel high. In this fashion, each cell contains a spot of one of the two sizes. In instances where a self-clocking mechanism is called for, this embodiment would have the advantage of providing such a mechanism., 227649=Datatile 2502 in paper substrate 2501 would preferably include a computer file designed to be run automatically upon completion of the decoding process of the invention. The computer file could be composed using, for example, hypertext markup language (HTML). Datatile 2502, once scanned, produces an image 2504 on the computer display (e.g., 2504 represents a computer monitor with the image as the user would see it). Image 2504 has two primary components. First, image 2504 duplicates on the computer display the entry form appearing on paper substrate 2501. Datatile 2502 preferably contains or invokes word processing software allowing the reader to enter and edit through keyboard input the information needed to enter the context. Second, image 2504 contains at its bottom a series of \u201cicons\u201d, delineated areas of the display which, if the user selects by click of a mouse or otherwise, causes the computer to commence some further action. The datatile is encoded with digital data that includes means for navigating to the subsets of information indicated by each icon illustrated in image 2504. In the instance of image 2504, there are 4 icons. The first, labeled \u201cCONTEST RULES\u201d, will, when selected by the user, cause the computer to erase the current image on the display and in its stead produce an image of the contest rules. The second, labeled \u201cACME COMP. DEALERS\u201d, will, when selected by the user, cause the computer to erase the current image on the display and in its stead place an image of a list of Acme computer dealers on the display. The third, labeled \u201cFAX ENTRY FORM\u201d, will, when selected by the user, cause the computer to activate its fax/modem and send a facsimile transmission of an image of the entry form appearing on the display, as altered by the user with keyboard input. The fourth, labeled \u201cPRESIDENT'S VIDEO CLIP\u201d, will, when selected by the user, cause the computer to erase the current image on the display and in its stead commence a video clip on the display. Thus, FIG. 25 illustrates an embodiment including both automatic links to further sources of data and \u201creverse WYSIWYG\u201d\u2014i.e., instead of printing on paper the image appearing on a computer display (What You See Is What You Get), the image printed on paper appears on the computer's display. This feature is accomplished by virtue of the datatile being encoded with instructions such that displaying means will display an image comparable to the human readable information printed on substrate 2501., 208781=FIG. 22 is a block diagram illustrating a method of transmitting digital data. A data source provides computer files or other digital data. The method of transmitting digital data selects format parameters (step 2201) for the formatting 2202 of the computer files or other digital data. Formatting 2202 formats the computer files or other digital data into a series of digital data values and formats that series of digital data values into a series of cells where each cell contains at least one bit of information from the series of digital data values. Formatting 2202 is done in accordance with the format parameters selected in step 2201. In the preferred embodiment formatting 2202 includes defining a cell size (i.e., width and height), and a spot size (i.e., width and height), such sizes defined as pixels of the encoding device, whether a printer, a facsimile machine, a fax/modem using facsimile software, or some other encoding device. The dimensions of a cell in the preferred embodiment are at least as large as the corresponding dimensions of any spot that might occupy the cell. It should be understood that the details concerning the computer files or other digital data, selection of format parameters (step 2201), and formatting 2202 are generally the same as the method of encoding described and illustrated above, including as described by reference to FIG. 2., 211989=Once the formatted digital data is distributed, the recipient decodes that formatted digital data, step 2204. The details of the decoding are as described above in the method of decoding, including as illustrated in and described by reference to FIGS. 16, 17, 18, and 19. In the case of physical distribution and in the case of facsimile transmission to a facsimile machine, step 2204 of the preferred embodiment includes first scanning the digitally encoded substrate to produce an image which is then decoded. In the case of electronic distribution of the formatted digital data, step 2204 of the preferred embodiment does not require an initial scan because the digital data is already in electronic form. In any case, step 2204 of the preferred decodes the formatted digital data from an electronic image of that formatted digital data. A preferred embodiment of decoding step 2204 is that method described by reference to and illustrated in FIGS. 17, 18, and 19, and, where formatted digital data has been placed on a substrate, FIG. 16. The result derived from step 2204 is the original computer files or other digital data., 173877=FIG. 19 illustrates the recovery process as applied to a portion of an image of a digitally encoded substrate produced by one embodiment of the invention. It should be understood that FIG. 19 represents a substantially enlarged view for the purpose of illustrating the process. FIG. 19 references the following parts: columns 1901 of markers, the distance from markers to the closest possible spots 1902, spot 1903, cell 1904, center 1905 of the first marker, center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally, center 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically, line 1908 through the center of the top row of possible spots, line 1909 through the center of the second row of possible spots, line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots, line 1911 through the center of the third row of possible spots, and line 1912 through the center of the last column of possible spots. The substrate has markers located in the image of FIG. 19 in columns 1901 consisting of 4 markers at the right and left perimeters of the image. These markers have dimensions 3 printer pixels wide by 3 printer pixels high. The distance from markers to the closest possible spots 1902 equals 5. Each spot, such as spot 1903, in 3 printer pixels wide by 2 printer pixels high contained in a cell, such as cell 1904, which is 4 printer pixels wide by 3 printer pixels high. Each spot should be understood as occupying the precise center of its corresponding cell. Accordingly, each cell containing a spot has a blank border 0.5 printer pixels wide along the right, left, bottom, and top of the cell. Also, the lines through the centers of any rows or columns of possible spots are the same as the lines through the centers of any corresponding rows or columns of cells. The number of spots per segment, 15, is illustrated in FIG. 19 by the 15 cells, some with spots, some blank, located between the 2 columns of markers. There are 3 rows of possible spots between markers displaced vertically. The information concerning printer pixel sizes and distances, the number of rows between markers and the number of spots per segment is conveyed by the metasector of the preferred embodiment and is therefore known to the recovery process., 137506=FIG. 15 references markers 301, and spots 1502, 1503, 1504, and 1505. The elements in FIG. 15 are enlarged for purposes of illustration and explanation. While spots are considered in FIG. 15 to occupy the upper left corners of cells for illustration purposes, it should be understood that this is just one possible embodiment\u2014another embodiment, for example, places a spot in the center of cells. Markers 301 are 4 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. Each of the spots is 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. The first column is formatted to include cells that are 3 pixels wide and 4 pixels high and, accordingly, spots 1502 and 1503 are in cells 3 pixels wide and 4 pixels high. The second column is formatted to include cells that are 4 pixels wide by 4 pixels high and, accordingly, spot 1504 is in a cell 4 pixels wide by 4 pixels high. Because the first column has been formatted such that its width equals the width of any spot, a spot in the first column directly adjoins a spot in the same row in the second column, as illustrated by spots 1503 and 1504, which together appear to be one spot twice as wide as high, but are in fact two distinct spots. Because the second column has been formatted to be wider than any spot, any spots in the same row in the third column will not directly adjoin spots in the second column. Accordingly, spot 1504 does not directly adjoin spot 1505., 159292=The basic process for recovering data from cells is preferably the same whether the cells are contained in the metasector or in the main body of data. FIG. 18 illustrates this recovery process as applied to an image of a digitally encoded substrate produced by a preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in FIG. 8. The recovery process sequentially finds the point in each cell representing the center of where a spot might be printed and for each cell determines whether a spot exists at that location. In the first step, processing block 1801, the recovery process locates the first marker in the image of the metasector or the main body of data, as the case may be. The recovery process then locates the center at that first marker, processing block 1802. The recovery process then locates the center of the nearest marker displaced horizontally, preferably the marker to the immediate right, and the nearest marker displaced vertically, preferably the marker immediately down from the first marker, processing block 1803. The markers are found by first locating the topmost, leftmost marker. This is done by examining the region where the marker is expected, looking through vertical strips of pixels from right to left until all the vertical strips are \u201cwhite.\u201d This will determine whether the leftmost dark pixels in the marker are. Next, horizontal strips are examined from bottom to top, noting where all the strips turn white. This determines where the topmost dark pixels in the marker are. The precise center of the marker is then determined by finding all the contiguous dark pixels, and finding the centroid of this group of pixels. Once the top left marker is found, the top marker for the next column is determined in the preferred embodiment by moving the known displacement across the image, and finding the precise top of the marker by repeating the process described for finding the top of the top, left marker. Again, the precise center is found by finding the centroid of the contiguous dark pixels. The markers down the column are found by the preferred embodiment by progressing down the image from a previously determined marker, examining horizontal strips of pixels, and detecting when the combined intensities of the pixels in the strip dips significantly, as is characteristic when a new marker is encountered. In another embodiment, markers down are determined by first moving down a known displacement to determine the approximate location of the next marker, then searching for the centroid pixels of the marker., 145534=While the method of decoding is described above by reference to a single datatile, the preferred embodiment allows the same steps to be applied to each of a series of datatiles. In one such instance, multiple substrates contain, in the aggregate, more than one datatile while in a further instance, a single substrate contains multiple datatiles, as illustrated in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12. The method of decoding of the preferred embodiment applied to multiple datatiles first scans all datatiles and then applies all of the remaining steps (1602, 1603, and 1604) to each datatile before proceeding to the next datatile. Another embodiment applies all of the steps of FIG. 16 to each datatile before proceeding to the next datatile. A further embodiment applies each step to all datatiles before proceeding to the next step. With each possibility, an automatic document feeder attached to a scanner facilitates the creation of images which are then subject to the decoding process. It should be understood that the method of decoding can also be applied to multiple datatiles not encoded on substrates but, instead, are always in electronic form, as in the case of a facsimile transmission of datatiles from a fax/modem to a fax/modem. FIG. 17 illustrates the decoding process achieving a pyramid gain of knowledge according to the preferred embodiment. The process may be generally described as one in which the locations of metasector cells are determined, the information in the metasector cells is derived, the locations of cells in the main body of data are determined and the data in the cells of the main body of data is derived. The steps of determining the locations of cells in the main body of data and deriving the data from those cells is performed by using the information conveyed by the metasector cells. In the case of multiple datatiles forming one series of digital data values, the entire sequence of steps of FIG. 17 are preferably applied to one datatile before proceeding to the next datatile., 215871=If process step 2305 determines that the original digital data includes a computer file designed to be run automatically, step 2306 commences execution of that computer file. Execution of the computer file may also follow or precede the storing on the recipient computer's fixed disk other computer files contained within the datatile, possibly including files available for the automatically executed file. It should be understood that an application launched automatically may be stored and operated solely on the recipient's computer, or may be an application all or part of which involves establishing communication with other computers. Thus, for example, the application launched automatically may be a communications program that activates the recipient computer's modem to telephone a remote computer and establish a connection with that remote computer, and then turn control over to the recipient of the datatile for further action. As a further example, datatile contains both a computer file of a document and instructions to automatically print the document on the printer attached to the recipient's computer. Thus, the recipient gets a hardcopy printout of the underlying document through a minimum of effort., 161916=The recovery process then determines for each cell in between the first marker and the next nearest markers displaced vertically and horizontally the point in the cell representing the center of where a spot might be printed. The centers of spots locations are determined by locating the lines across the centers of the rows where spots might be printed in between the first marker and the next marker displaced vertically, processing block 1804, and then locating the lines down the centers of the columns where spots might be printed in between the first marker and the next marker displaced horizontally, processing block 1805. Each spot is preferably thought of as occupying the precise center of its corresponding cell. Accordingly, determining the lines across the centers of rows where spots might be printed equates to finding the lines through the centers of rows of cells. Likewise, determining lines down the centers of the columns where spots might be printed equates to finding the lines through the centers of columns of cells., 165730=For each further marker or set of markers, the recovery process repeats the process described and illustrated in steps 1801 through 1810. The recovery process first determines whether an additional marker exists, processing block 1811. The recovery process determines this by calculating the number of markers encountered, and comparing this number with the number of markers expected. The number of markers expected by the DEDS program is based on a calculation derived from the number of datasectors down, the number across, the number of spots across a single row in a single datasector, the number of rows of spots per marker, and the total size of the information in the printed pattern. If an additional marker exists, additional cells with data need processing to recover their data. The recovery process is repeated by first treating an adjacent marker as the primary marker of reference (described above as the first marker), processing block 1812, and then repeating steps 1801 through 1811. The preferable manner of choosing an adjacent marker is systematically. A preferred embodiment recovers an entire datasectors before moving on to the next datasector. A row of datasectors (i.e., all datasectors across a datatile) are recovered before moving to the next row of datasectors. Within a datasector, the markers are chosen in a similar fashion\u2014markers are sequentially chosen across an entire row, with rows sequentially chosen down the datasector., 124824=In a further embodiment of the method of encoding, the digitally encoded substrate contains at least one datatile where parts of the datatile are located in noncontiguous regions of the substrate instead of the whose datatile being located in one region of the substrate. The regions not occupied by parts of the datatile may contain other printable matter including human readable text or graphics, blank space, or parts or all of other datatiles. FIG. 10 illustrates an example of a substrate produced in accordance with this embodiment. This substrate contains parts of a single datatile, a landmark 801, a metasector 802, and a main body of data 1003. The substrate also contains human readable text 1004. Parts of the datatile are in noncontiguous regions of the substrate. Landmark 801 and metasector 802 are located together at the top of the substrate. Main body of data 1003 is divided into 2 parts, each of which is physically separate from each other and from landmark 801 and metasector 802. Human readable text 1004 occupies space between the noncontiguous parts of the datatile., 225862=In a further embodiment of the method of transmitting data, information recorded on a substrate includes digital data as well as human readable information where the digital data includes one or both of data needed to have the computer display appear the same or similar to the human readable information appearing on the substrate and data that causes information to appear on the computer display together with hyperlinks to further sources of information. FIG. 25 illustrates an example of a substrate and the process according to this embodiment. A paper substrate 2501 has printed upon it human readable text and graphics as well as encoded digital data. Paper substrate 2501 represents how the embodiment might be used for marketing purposes as in marketing flyers, advertising appearing in print media or other marketing materials. More particularly, the printed paper has three main components. First, at top, human readable text informs the reader of the purpose of the marketing material and the contents of the encoded digital data. Second, in the middle of paper substrate 2501, surrounded by a dashed line, an entry form prompts the reader for the information needed to enter a contest. Third, at the bottom, a datatile 2502 includes encoded digital data., 126006=In one embodiment of the method of encoding, the metasector contains information indicating or otherwise assisting in the determination of the location of the various parts of the main body of data 1003 while in a further embodiment, a part or parts of the main body of data 1003 contains information indicating or otherwise assisting in the determination of the location of the other parts of the main body of data 1003, while in a still further embodiment, the various parts of the main body of data 1003 are located without reference to information provided by either metasector 802 or other parts of the main body of data 1003. Of these various embodiments, the preferred method places in the metasector the location information for at least the first grouping of cells of the main body of data. If less than all location information is placed in the metasector, the preferred method would place in the main body of data's first grouping of cells the location information for at least the next grouping of cells. Determination of the landmark and metasector locations therefore facilitates determination of locations of a series of non-contiguous parts of the main body of data. Location of cells within non-contiguous parts of the main body of data is sided by another aspect of the invention\u2014i.e., the intermittent series of formattable markers. In some embodiments, the number and size of the separate parts of the main body of data 1003 are fixed by information contained in metasector 802 or other parts of the main body of data 1003. In other embodiments, the number and/or size of the separate parts of the main body of data 1003 are not fixed. The method of decoding continues searching for additional parts until no more are found, either because the entire substrate has been searched or because the succession of location references from part to subsequent part ceases., 176253=Having found the first marker, the recovery process finds the center of that first marker, here located at 1905. In the preferred embodiment, pixels are determined to be part of the marker by virtue of having a gray scale level below a threshold. The coordinates of the pixels contained in the marker are averaged after being weighted to determine the center of the marker. The recovery process then determines the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally and the center 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically through the process described above in steps 1802 and 1803 of FIG. 18., 222076=The image of formatted digital data having been sent by facsimile transmission, process step 2406 of the present embodiment then determines, at the recipient's end, whether the recipient receives facsimile transmissions by facsimile machine or, alternatively, through a fax/modem connected to a computer. If the recipient receives facsimile transmissions by fax machine, the formatted digital data as transmitted through the telephone line is printed by the facsimile machine, producing a digitally encoded substrate 2407. Digitally encoded substrate 2407 is then scanned, process step 2408, using a scanner connected to a computing device capable of producing an image in electronic form of the digitally encoded substrate 2407 (the scanner used for this purpose may include the fax machine itself where the fax machine first receives a transmission and prints the substrate and the recipient then feeds the substrate back through the fax machine sending an image of the substrate to a computer through the computer's fax/modem). The image of the digital data, whether produced by facsimile machine and scanned into electronic form or instead received by fax/modem directly in electronic form, is decoded in step 2409, such decoding being as described and illustrated above, including the method illustrated in and described by reference to FIGS. 16, 17, 18, and 19. In the present embodiment the result of the decoding process 2409 is the reconstruction of the original computer files or other digital data. In further embodiments, the result is the automatic launching of executable files or the automatic launching of an application software with the transmitted file loaded within that application software, if being understood that the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 24 involves additional means of transmitting digital data that does not in any way limit what can be done with that digital data once decoded., 162991=Having found the centers of possible spot locations in between the first marker and the next nearest markers, the recovery process determines whether each cell is \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d by determining whether a spot is present or absent at each of the possible spot locations, and accumulates these determinations. The recovery process accomplishes this subprocess by looping through a series of steps for each cell; processing block 1806 establishes the loop for each cell. For each cell, the recovery process determines whether a spot exists at the point representing the center of where a spot would be if printed, processing block 1807. The center is determined as the intersection of the central line through the column and the central line through the row containing any such spot. It should be understood that the preferred embodiment makes more than a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d determination of whether a spot exists at a particular pixel. The preferred embodiment determines the level of gray scale of the center pixel and, depending on the gray scale level, determines that the cell contains a spot, determines that the cell does not contain a spot, or determines the need for further processing if it is too close to call. If it is too close to call, information about whether surrounding dots or spots are present or absent may be used to settle whether the spot is to be considered on or off. If surrounding the region of a potential spot, the neighboring potential spots appear to be mostly present, the intensity of the region of the potential spot is generally depressed (i.e., darker). This is compensated for in the DEDS program by adding predetermined values to the intensity found in the region of the potential spot (i.e., the DEDS program assumes that the region of the potential spot is lighter than what was actually found in the image). If a spot is determined to be present in the cell the recovery process starts (or, in subsequent iterations, adds to) a series of digital data values with a value of 1, processing block 1808. If, alternatively, a spot is determined to be absent from the cell, the recovery process starts (or, in subsequent iterations, adds to) a series of digital data values with a value of 0, processing block 1809., 134756=In a further embodiment, each cell represents more than one bit where a plurality of bits are expressed by spots of different sizes and colors. FIG. 14 is an enlarged view of a substrate produced by such an embodiment containing markers 301 and cells 1402, 1403, 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407, 1408, and 1409. Markers 301 are of uniform size, 4 pixels wide by 3 pixels high, and color, black. FIG. 14 contains cells each of which represents 3 bits in a series of digital data values. Each cell has one of eight different logical states with one logical state expressed by the absence of a spot and each of the other logical states expressed by a spot with either a size or color different from a spot expressing any other logical state. Cell 1402 contains a black spot 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. Cell 1403 contains a black spot 2 pixels wide by 2 pixels high. Cell 1404 contains a black spot 1 pixel wide by 1 pixel high. Cell 1405 is blank. Cell 1406 contains a gray spot 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels high. Cell 1407 contains a gray spot 2 pixels wide by 2 pixels high. Cell 1408 contains a gray spot 1 pixel wide by 1 pixel high. Cell 1409 contains a black spot 1 pixel wide by 1 pixel high surrounded by a gray border 1 pixel wide on all sides. Hence, cells 1402, 1403, 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407, 1408, and 1409 are examples of each of the eight different logical states that a cell can express., 217129=If, alternatively, the datatile does not include a computer file designed to be launched automatically, the method of transmitting digital data determines whether the datatile contains files associated with a particular application (process step 2307). A file can be associated with a particular application when that file has been created by a particular application software or can be run by a particular application software. If the file is intended to be executed as input into an application, the appropriate application is also determined in Windows by the file name extension, along with standard mappings from extensions to applications (this mapping is stored in the win.ini file). For example, a file with the name \u201cletter.wri\u201d is typically assumed to be a Microsoft\ufffd Write document, as it ends with the extension \u201c.wri\u201d, and that is usually mapped in win.ini to Microsoft Write. Similar to the process for automatically executing a file, if a file is intended to be launched as part of an application, a flag in the header portion of the first datasector is set, with the setting preferably being selected by the user. For example, a word processing software package is an application software that creates files containing documents. If that document file is associated with the word processing software and if the word processing software is pre-installed, choosing to open the document file actually launches the word processing software and then loads (i.e., opens within the word processing software for further processing) the document file. If the datatile contains a file associated with a particular application, and if the recipient's computer has that particular application software pre-installed, and if the recipient chooses to launch the application software (process step 2308) then step 2309 commences execution of the application software and loads the associated file contained in the datatile. Alternatively, the recipient's computer produces the original computer files or other digital data for purposes such as being stored on the recipient computer's fixed disk., 211065=Step 2201 preferably selects format parameters optimal for the means of distribution used. The DEDS program source code stores the appropriate format parameters in lookup tables in the setdefs.c file. Transmission by facsimile machine typically requires larger spot and cell sizes than transmission by fax modem. Where the manner of distribution is more likely to introduce damage to the formatted digital data, format parameters should reflect larger spot and cell sizes than less damaging means of distribution. Distribution by printing and physical distribution may require larger or smaller spot and cell sizes than electronic distribution, depending on the printer/scanner combination, the electronic distribution method or other factors. Thus, the selection of format parameters allows flexibility to consider not only the manner of encoding and decoding but also the manner of distribution., 190428=It should be understood that determining the centers of rows of possible spots and the centers of columns of possible spots can also be determined not by reference to the image pixel/printer pixel ratio but by reference to the ratios determined by dividing the number of rows or columns, as the case may be, that a particular row or column is displaced from a first reference marker by the total rows or columns, as the case may be, between markers. This ratio for each row or column is then multiplied by the total image pixel distance between markers to determine the image pixel displacement of each row or column from the reference markers. This method of determining the center of each row and each column performs most efficiently with an embodiment where there is no distance between markers and the nearest cells\u2014i.e., the Marker to Spot parameter equals 0. For example, where the digitally encoded substrate is formatted and encoded such that there are 3 rows between markers (i.e., Rows per Marker equals 3), the total image pixel distance between the top of a first marker and the top of the next marker displaced vertically equals 21, the top of the first row of possible spots has the same vertical pixel coordinate as the top of the first marker, the image pixel distance between the top and bottom of each spot equals 6 and the vertical pixel image coordinate of the top of the first marker equals 156, the centers of each of the 3 rows can be determined by multiplying 21 by the ratios 0:3, 1:3, and 2:3, the products being 0, 7, and 14, and adding those products to 159 (the vertical pixel coordinate of the top of the first marker plus 50% of the image pixel distance from the top to the bottom of each spot). Thus, the centers of the 3 rows would be at vertical image pixel coordinates 159, 166 and 173., 220019=The present embodiment, contemplating transmission of digital data by facsimile transmission, then determines in step 2403 whether the person transmitting digital data transmits by facsimile machine or, alternatively, by fax/modem connected to a computer. If the transmission is by fax/modem, the digital data as formatted in step 2402 is transmitted over a telephone line consistent with the method of transmitting any computer generated image by fax/modem. If, alternatively, the person transmitting digital data uses a fax machine, the digital data formatted in step 2402 is printed onto a substrate, step 2404. That digitally encoded substrate is then processed in step 2405 through a facsimile machine, the processing comprehending those same substeps exercised in any facsimile machine transmission: feeding the document, in this instance the digitally encoded substrate, into the facsimile machine, entering the telephone number and causing the facsimile machine to dial the inputted number. Whether by facsimile machine or through a fax/modem, the transmission sent over a telephone line is fundamentally the same\u2014an image of a datatile one example of which is illustrated in FIG. 8. It should be noted, however, that minor differences might occur as a result of different format parameters. It should also be noted that a further embodiment comprehends, based on the sender's knowledge (or information available to the sender's computer), determined in advance or determined contemporaneously, of the recipient's currently activated equipment, the possibility of direct transmission of digital data from modem to modem. In those instances where possible and advantageous, this further embodiment employs direct modem to modem transmission in order to achieve transmission speeds faster than by facsimile transmission through a fax/modem. The digital data sent pursuant to this further embodiment is either the formatted digital data or the original computer files or other digital data., 227178=The reader of paper substrate 2501 may then process (step 2503) the datatile, it being understood that the reader may also proceed to enter the contest by manually completing the entry form as printed without use of a computer and without processing 2503 of the datatile. Processing 2503 includes the substeps of scanning, decoding and running of the datatile, which substeps are as further described and illustrated above., 187240=If, for example, the digitally encoded substrate was printed with a 300 dpi printer, scanned with a 600 dpi scanner, and the printer and scanning processes had no imperfections, the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots should be 16 image pixels to the right of the center 1905 of the first marker. Thus, if the horizontal image pixel coordinate of the center 1905 of the first marker is, for example, 110 image pixels to the right of the leftmost edge of the image produced by the scanner, the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots would have a horizontal image pixel coordinate of 126. The total distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally should be 144 image pixels, double the printer pixel distance of 72, because the scanned image should twice as large in pixels as the printout due to a scanner with twice the resolution. This distance of 144 image pixels is multiplied by the ratio 8:72 to determine the horizontal distance in image pixels from the center 1905 of the first marker to the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots. The product, 16 image pixels, is added to the horizontal image pixel coordinate of 110 of the center 1905 of the first marker to produce the horizontal image pixel coordinate of 126 for the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots. A similar methodology is employed to determine the lines through the centers of each subsequent column of possible spots., 37375=This application is related to patent application Ser. No. 09/382,173, titled Variable Formatting of Digital Data into a Pattern, filed Aug. 23, 1999, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,098,882, titled Variable Formatting of Digital Data into a Pattern, filed Aug. 23, 1999, which are both hereby incorporated by reference into this application., 210245=Formatted digital data is then distributed, step 2203. The manner of distribution may include any manner for the distribution of digital data in electronic or physical form. Embodiments of electronic distribution include facsimile, satellite transmission, telephonic transmission, cable transmission, and high speed line transmission (such as T1 or ISDN). Embodiments of physical distribution include postal delivery, hand delivery, courier or other contract delivery service as well as any other means for moving the digitally encoded substrate. In the case of physical distribution, the formatted digital data is first encoded onto a substrate, where the manner of producing the substrate is as described above, including as illustrated in and described by reference to FIG. 2., 144839=Decoding process 1602 of the preferred embodiment of the invention (FIG. 8, described above, illustrates a digitally encoded substrate produced by the preferred embodiment) takes advantage of the wealth of information provided in the encoding process. Decoding process 1602 of this preferred embodiment achieves a pyramid gain of knowledge: finding the landmark conveys knowledge on where to find the metasector, as well as its dimensions, the metasector conveys knowledge on where to find the main body of data and how precisely to extract data from that main body of data, and the main body of data conveys the underlying computer files or other digital data., 150692=The next step toward knowledge acquisition comprises locating the metasector (processing block 1702). As illustrated in FIG. 8, described more fully above, the metasector of the preferred embodiment is located at a predefined location relative to the landmark, that location being generally to the right of the landmark. Having already located the landmark, processing block 1701, the decoding process knows where the metasector should be in the image of the digitally encoded substrate. The decoding process determines the distance of the metasector from what it knows about the landmark. Once it determines the width and height of the landmark's horizontal and vertical bars in image pixels, it can calculate the ratio of image pixels to printed pixels in the \u201cbase\u201d case described earlier by reference to FIG. 8. This allows it to calculate the displacement in number of image pixels of the first column of metasector markers from the landmark, for the other columns of markers in the metasector, and the expected size and distances, in image pixels, of these markers and of the spots. The decoding process finds the metasector by finding the first column of metasector markers based on what is known about the location of the landmark in the image, the relative location of the metasector to the landmark in printed pixels and the ratio of image pixels to printed pixels. The decoding process preferably allows some degree of latitude in making this determination of location and dimensions., 179678=The recovery process determines the centers of subsequent rows of possible spots by reference to the relative printer pixels displacement from the top marker to the next marker displaced vertically. The recovery process first determines the printer pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center of each such subsequent row of possible spots. The recovery process determines this printer pixel distance by adding one-half the printer pixel spot height, the product of multiplying the printer pixel cell height by the number of rows down a particular row is from the top row, and subtracting one-half the printer pixel marker height. The recovery process would then determine the total printer pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically. This is here determined to be 9 by multiplying the number of rows of possible spots between markers of 3 by the cell height of 3. A ratio of printer pixels down for each row to the total printer pixels down between centers 1905 and 1907 is then computed. The recovery process then determines the image pixels down between the centers of the first marker and of the next marker displaced vertically, 1905 and 1907, respectively. For each row, the recovery process multiplies the printer pixel ratio for the row by the total image pixels between centers 1905 and 1907. The result is the image pixels down for the central line through each such subsequent row., 183606=Having determined the lines through the centers of the rows of possible spots, the recovery process determines the lines 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots. The line through the center of each column of possible spots is determined by reference to two factors, first, the ratio of the printer pixel distance of that column's central line from the center 1905 of the first marker to the printer pixel distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally, and second, the image pixel distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally. The recovery process determines the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots to be 8 printer pixels to the right of the center 1905 of the first marker. The recovery process makes this determination by using information conveyed in the metasector. The Marker Width parameter was set at 3, the Marker to Spot parameter was set at 5, and the Spot Width parameter was set at 3. Accordingly, the horizontal distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the line 1910 through the center of the first column should equal the sum of one-half the marker width, 3\ufffd0.5=1.5, the marker to spot distance of 5 and one-half of the spot width, 3\ufffd0.5=1.5. This sum equals 8. For each subsequent column, the recovery process adds to this printer pixel distance of 8 the product from multiplying the printer pixel cell width of 4 by the number of columns the subsequent column is displaced from the first column. The recovery process then computes the total distance in printer pixels from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally. This computation is performed by summing the following distances measured in printer pixels as communicated by the metasector: the distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center of the first spot, 8(8=0.5\ufffdprinter pixel marker width of 3+the distance from markers to the closest possible spots 1902 of 5+0.5\ufffdprinter pixel spot width of 3), the distance of 56 from line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots to the line 1912 through the center of the last column of possible spots (56=cell width of 4\ufffd14, the number of columns separating the centers of the first and last columns determined by subtracting 1 from the Spots per Segment of 15), and the distance from the center of the last spot to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally from the first marker of 8(8=0.5\ufffdprinter pixel marker width of 3+the distance from markers to the closest possible spots 1902 of 5+0.5\ufffdprinter pixel spot width of 3). This sum equals 72. The recovery process then determines the total distance in image pixels from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally. The lines through the centers of the columns of possible spots, in image pixels displaced from the center 1905 of the first marker, are then determined by multiplying this total distance in image pixels by the ratio of the printer pixels from the center 1905 of the first marker to the line through the center of each column of possible spots to the total printer pixel distance from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally., 165288=The next step, processing block 1810, determines whether to continue the loop. If all cells between the first marker and the next nearest markers have been tested for spots, the recovery process proceeds to processing block 1811. If cells remain to be tested for spots, the recovery process returns to the beginning of the loop at 1806, reiterating steps 1807 through 1810 for each cell., 155568=The penultimate step in knowledge acquisition involves locating the main body of data, processing block 1705. As illustrated in FIG. 8 described above, a preferred embodiment places the main body of data at a predefined location relative to the landmark and the metasector. The decoding process pursuant to this embodiment searches for a first marker of the main body of data at or near this predefined location in the image of the digitally encoded substrate., 139060=Formatted digital data produced by the invention must be decoded in order to reconstruct the original computer files or other digital data. The manner in which the preferred embodiment accomplishes the decoding is illustrated in FIGS. 16, 17, 18, and 19. FIGS. 16, 17, and 18 are block diagrams describing processes relating to decoding, while FIG. 19 is an enlarged portion of a digitally encoded substrate used to illustrate the steps diagrammed in FIG. 18. FIG. 16 describes the method of decoding\u2014i.e., the broad perspective of how a digitally encoded substrate is decoded. Included in the steps according to this broad perspective is step 1602, the decoding process. FIG. 17 describes the preferred embodiment of the decoding process. Included in the steps according to this preferred embodiment are steps 1704 and 1706, both of which involve decoding a grouping of contiguous cells. Decoding a grouping of contiguous cells involves a process of recovering digital data values from the grouping. FIG. 18 is a block diagram describing the preferred embodiment of this recovery process. Thus, FIG. 16, 17, and 18 should be understood as illustrating increasing detail of the manner in which the preferred embodiment reconstructs the original computer files or other digital data., 131194=FIG. 12 illustrates a digitally encoded substrate containing multiple datatiles, all produced by the DEDS program, all depicted at their actual, original size. The first two datatiles, 1201 and 1202, are intended to be decoded by using a fax machine as a scanner. The third datatile, 1203, is intended to be decoded by using a flatbed scanner with an optical resolution of no less than 300 dpi scanning 256 levels of gray scale. Datatiles 1201 and 1202 are two datatiles that together contain one computer file. Datatile 1203 contains one whole computer file. The one computer file contained in datatiles 1201 and 1202 contains 28,371 bytes of text while the one computer file contained in datatile 1203 contains 48,102 bytes of text., 213223=FIG. 23 illustrates in further detail the preferred embodiment of a method of transmitting digital data. The initial processes are similar to the steps illustrated in FIG. 22 and described above. The initial source of digital data is preferably computer files stored on the fixed disk drive of a personal computer, but could also be other sources of digital data such as a floppy disk, or another digitally encoded substrate. The computer files contemplated include data files not associated with any particular application software, data files associated with a particular application software, and executable files, i.e., files that perform functions once invoked. The method of transmitting digital data then provides for selection of format parameters, step 2301, and formatting, step 2302, these steps being the same as those described as steps 2201 and 2202, above., 37061=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/382,173, filing date Mar. 23, 1999 U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,427 which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/609,549 filing date Mar. 1, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,098,882., 156055=The final step in knowledge acquisition is decoding the main body of data, processing block 1706. The decoding process preferably accomplishes this by employing the same basic process used to decode the metasector, as illustrated in FIG. 18. The mechanics differ primarily to reflect the peculiarities of the main body of data relative to the metasector. In particular, the mechanisms of decoding the main body of data take advantage of the wealth of information provided in the metasector. While the metasector has preferably been encoded in a rigid or semi-rigid fashion with each metasector having the same or largely the same format as any other metasector produced by the method of encoding, the main body of data is preferably encoded in a user selectable format which can vary widely. For example, while every metasector is preferably encoded with cells of a constant or largely constant low resolution, the main body of data may be encoded with cells whose size can vary greatly among datatiles. The mechanics of the decoding process for the main body of knowledge considers the flexibility allowed by the method of encoding, with the details of the encoding process contained in the metasector and communicated by the pyramid gain of knowledge approach of the preferred embodiment. The manner in which the decoding process uses these details is illustrated in FIG. 19, and discussed below., 181244=If for example, the digitally encoded substrate was printed at 300 dpi and scanned at 600 dpi with no skew or imperfections, the line 1909 through the center of the second row of possible spots would be 5 image pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker. The line 1909 through the center of the second row of possible spots is 2.5 printer pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker. The recovery process determines this by adding 1 (one-half the printer pixel spot height of 2) plus 3 (printer pixel cell height of 3 multiplied by 1, the number of rows down from the first row to the second row), and then subtracting 1.5 (one-half the printer pixel marker height of 3). The total printer pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker to the center 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically equals 9, rows per marker of 3 multiplied by cell height of 3. These conclusions regarding printer pixels are inferred from information conveyed in the metasector and therefore known by the recovery process. The ratio of the printer pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker to the line 1909 through the center of the second row of possible spots to the total printer pixels down between the center 1905 of the first marker and center 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically equals 2.5:9. This ratio is then multiplied by the image pixels down between the centers 1905 of the first marker and 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically. The image pixels down between the centers 1905 of the first marker and 1907 of the next marker displaced vertically should equal 18 (a 600 dpi scan should produce a distance in image pixels double the printer pixels produced by a 300 dpi printer). Multiplying the ratio 2.5:9 by 18 image pixels results in a determination that the line 1909 through the center of the second row is 5 image pixels down from the center 1905 of the first marker. Thus, for example, if the center 1905 of the first marker has a vertical image pixel coordinate of 70 (i.e., 70 image pixels below the top edge of the image produced by the scanner), then the line 1909 through the center of the second row has a vertical image pixel coordinate of 75., 176914=Having determined the centers of three reference point markers, the recovery process of the preferred embodiment uses that information, as well as information conveyed by the metasector, to determine the lines through the centers of the columns and rows of possible spot locations. If an image has no skew, the line 1908 through the center of the top row of possible spots is determined to be one-half printer pixel higher than the vertical pixel coordinates of the center 1905 of the first marker and the center 1906 of the next marker displaced horizontally. This determination of the central line through the row is made due to a number of factors. First, the top of the first row of possible spots in FIG. 19 is known to be at the same location as the top of the highest markers in FIG. 19, this feature having been established as a convention of the preferred embodiment. Second, while the markers are known to be 3 printer pixels high any spots are known to be 2 printer pixels high\u2014both heights are conveyed by the metasector. The recovery process can accordingly infer that the vertical centers of any possible spots in the first row should be 1 printer pixel down from the tops of the spots (a spot height of 2 printer pixels divided in half) while the vertical centers of markers should be 1.50 printer pixels down from the tops of the markers (a marker height of 3 printer pixels divided in half). Because the tops of the spots are known to be at the same location as the top of the markers, the recovery process can accordingly infer that the vertical centers of the row of possible spots is 0.50 (i.e., 1.50-1.00) printer pixels higher than the markers' centers. Because the adjustment of one-half pixel is expressed in printer pixels and the vertical pixel coordinates of the marker centers 1905 and 1906 are expressed in image (e.g., scanner) pixels, and printer pixel size may differ from image pixel size, the adjustment of one-half must be first multiplied by the image to printer pixel ratio to determine the actual adjustment in image pixels., 204427=In a further embodiment, encryption and decryption may be integrated into the methods of encoding and decoding of the invention. FIG. 20 illustrates the method of encoding of this further embodiment. Note that in one embodiment of the method of encoding, this would occur after the compression of the digital data (processing block 2003). Note that each of the processing blocks in FIG. 20 are performed as their similarly named counterparts in FIG. 2, with the exception of encryption processing block 2004., 39936=One example of digital information being stored on paper is the use of bar codes. Because standard bar codes are one dimensional, they are severely limited in the number of bars that may be used to store digital information. The limits are somewhat greater in the case of two-dimensional bar codes but these limits are still far more restrictive than the theoretical limits of any particular printer, and bar codes are designed for use with specialized scanners. For more information on bar codes, see \u201cInformation Encoding with Two-Dimensional Bar Codes,\u201d authored by T. Pavlidis, J. Schwartz and Y. Wang, COMPUTER, June 1992., 200066=The above methodology can be applied to the enlarged portion of a digitally encoded substrate illustrated in FIG. 19. If, for example, the distance between the top of the first marker and the next marker displaced vertically equals 900 microns, that distance is divided by 3, the number of rows known to exist between markers, that number being known by virtue of being communicated in the metasector. The result, 300 microns, is multiplied by the number of rows that each row is down from the first row next to the first marker\u2014i.e., 0 for the first row, 300 microns for the second row, and 600 microns for the third row. If each spot is known to have a height of 200 microns, one-half of this height, i.e., 100 microns, is added to the products for each row to determine the distance that the lines through the centers of rows are from the top of the first marker. Accordingly, the line 1908 through the center of the first row of possible spots is 100 microns below the vertical coordinate for the top of the first marker. Line 1909 through the center of the second row of possible spots is 400 microns below the vertical coordinate of the top of the first marker. Line 1911 through the center of the third row of possible spots is 700 microns below the vertical coordinate of the top of the first marker., 214149=The formatted digital data is then distributed (step 2303). The recipient of the digitally encoded substrate then subjects the digitally encoded substrate to decoding process 2304. Decoding process 2304, comparable to step 2204 discussed above, is as described in detail and illustrated above., 201422=The embodiment then determines the lines through the centers of column of possible spots. Visual inspection through mechanical means should determine the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spos and the line 1912 through the center of the last column of possible spots. If, for example, the distance between lines 1910 and 1912 equals 5,600 microns, that distance is divided by 14, the number of known columns between markers, 15, less one. The result of that division, 400 microns, is multiplied by the number of columns that each column is horizontally displaced from the first column of possible spots. Accordingly, lines through the centers of the first five columns of possible spots, for example, are 0, 400, 800, 1,200, and 1,600 microns horizontally displaced from the line 1910 through the center of the first column of possible spots., 129720=FIG. 11 illustrates a digitally encoded substrate containing multiple datatiles, each originally produced by the DEDS program and then enlarged 250% in each dimension for illustration purposes. The first two datatiles, 1101 and 1102, were intended to be decoded by using a fax machine as a scanner. The third datatile, 1103, was intended to be decoded by using a flatbed scanner with an optical resolution of no less than 300 dpi scanning 256 levels of gray scale. Datatiles 1101 and 1102 are two datatiles that together contain one computer file. Datatile 1103 contains one whole computer file. The one computer file contained in datatiles 1101 and 1102 contains 1,866 bytes of text while the one computer file contained in datatile 1103 contains 3,112 bytes of text. While a flatbed 300 dpi scanner can successfully decode the originals (i.e., at their original size) of all three datatiles, 1101, 1102, and 1103, using a fax machine as a scanner, the invention can successfully decode only datatiles 1101 and 1102 (at their original size). Thus, FIG. 11 illustrates another feature of the invention\u2014the ability to convey a base amount of data to all recipients regardless of their scanners' capabilities by formatting at least one datatile using the lowest common denominator while providing significantly more data to those with more powerful scanners., 143420=The series of digital data values resulting from decoding process 1602 is then subjected to error correction and detection processing (processing block 1603). This step 1603 is the inverse of the error correction encoding which occurred during encoding (FIG. 2). The error detection and correction occurs by using the codewords with redundant parity bits added during encoding (FIG. 2) to correct errors which may have occurred. The error correction compensates for the loss of data due to damage to the paper or due to the failure to predict the cell location correctly. The errors may be attributed to staples, hole punches, folds, crumples, paper discolorations, technical problems, imperfections introduced in the scanning process or other imperfections.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be further understood that while the invention serves as a link between paper and the electronic world, the electronic connection can also be just a digital path to an analog source. For example, the digital data can include a way of navigating, a priori, through a voice mail system where the digital data includes a company's main telephone number, a directory of employees of a company, the particular telephone extensions for each of those employees and computer instructions to activate a calling device (such as a modem) place a telephone call to the company's main number and navigate through the company's voice mail system to the telephone of the employee selected by the user before the call is made. By decoding the digital data, activating the program contained in the digital data, and making a selection of employee, the user can avoid the usual time consuming method of navigating a company's voice mail system. The method is especially advantageous for subsequent calls to the same company because the digital data would presumably be stored on hard disk after decoding. Thus, the digital data serves as a link between two analog sources\u2014the user and the company employee. The linking of paper with the electronic world is preferably accomplished using the methods of encoding and decoding described above. These methods of encoding and decoding make the linking feasible due to many of the unique and advantageous",
