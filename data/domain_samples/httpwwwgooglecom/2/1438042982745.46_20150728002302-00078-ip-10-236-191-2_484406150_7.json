The flow rate of the sealing composition pumped into the zone to the flow rate of the well bore fluids pumped into the zone is controlled at a ratio in the range of from about 1:4 to about 4:1. As mentioned, the careful control of the opening or openings in the drill pipe and flow rates mentioned above results in the ability of the sealing composition to flow through the zone to be sealed with a minimum of mixing taking place whereby portions of the sealing composition are continuously converted to sealing masses as the sealing composition flows through the well bore and the zone to be sealed. The sealing masses are successively diverted into the permeable portions of the zone thereby allowing the hydrostatic pressure exerted in the zone to increase until all of the permeable portions in the zone are sealed., 28556=This is a divisional of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those which are inherent therein. While numerous changes to the methods can be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as defined by the appended claims. In a well being drilled with a non-aqueous drilling fluid, a fractured zone was encountered whereby about 20 barrels per hour of the drilling fluid were being lost. A water based sealing composition as described in Example 1 above was prepared. Equal portions of the composition were pumped down the drill pipe and down the annulus, each at a rate of about one barrel per minute. As the composition reacted with the non-aqueous based drilling fluid in the well bore, high viscosity resilient masses were formed which entered and sealed the fractured zone or zones through which the drilling fluid losses occurred whereupon drilling was resumed. EXAMPLE 4 A water based sealing composition of the present invention comprised of water present in an amount in the range of from about 30% to about 42%, an aqueous styrene/butadiene latex present in an amount in the range of from about 39% to about 47%, an alkyl quaternary ammonium bentonite clay present in an amount in the range of from about 16% to about 19%, sodium carbonate present in",
