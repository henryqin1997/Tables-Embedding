As with the first embodiment of the present invention, the mobile cellular unit is equipped with a handset 272, and has attached a voice recognition/activation device 274 and a hands-free microphone 276 to allow operation of the locating system with less driver distraction and safer vehicle operation. As with the locating system incorporating the first embodiment of the present invention, the in-vehicle locating system incorporating the second embodiment of the present invention utilizes the system identification number of the particular cellular system providing service, the cell identification number where the mobile cellular unit is receiving the overhead message, and the longitude and latitude coordinates of a particular cell transmitter site, all of which may be transmitted in the overhead message stream from a particular cell transmitter site. The particular map displayed depends upon the plug-in modem presently installed in the external memory port 256 connected to the microprocessor 250. Through use of the keyboard 262, the driver may select particular points of interest from the various directories contained in the plug-in modules. Various menu selections allow the driver to initiate calls to",
