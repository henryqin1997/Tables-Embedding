Generally, electric power supplied in a noncontact manner is very weak. Since the MONOS EEPROM requires very little electric power to rewrite data, even the data carrier having no battery can read and write data to and from the EEPROM. The MONOS EEPROM, which is a semiconductor memory element disclosed in many publications, is rewritten with a relatively small voltage and has an excellent service life in terms of data storage and repetitive rewrite operations. The details of the MONOS EEPROM are disclosed in, for example, IEEE Transactions on Electron Device, Vol. ED-30, No. 2, February 1983, p. 122, Semiconductor World, July 1989, p. 98, Semiconductor World, April 1991, p. 112, and Japanese Examined Patent Publication (B2) No. 358188. FIG. 2(a) is a sectional view showing an element of the MONOS EEPROM. A MONOS transistor serving as a main element of the EEPROM is formed on a p well that is formed in an area on the surface of an n-type semiconductor (silicon) substrate. The p well includes n+ drain and source electrodes. A gate of the MONOS transistor differs from that of a standard transistor. The gate has a 3-layer gate insulation film including a tunnel oxide film O1 deposited on the p well, a silicon nitride film N deposited on the film O1, and a top oxide film O2 deposited on the film N. The thickness of each of the layers is an important factor that determines the characteristics of the MONOS transistor. It is said that the transistor shows excellent performance as an EEPROM element when the thicknesses of the layers O1, N, and O2 are 2, 5, and 4 nanometers, respectively. On the gate insulation film, a polysilicon gate electrode M is formed. The p well, drain, and source of the MONOS transistor are provided with a first electrode P1, a second electrode P2, and a third electrode P3, respectively. These electrodes are connected to peripheral circuits, to form the EEPROM. To write data to the MONOS EEPROM, the gate electrode M is set to reference potential, and a write voltage of -8 to -11 V is applied to the first electrode P1. As a result, electrons move from the p well to the silicon nitride film N through the tunnel oxide film O1 and stay in the nitride film N and on an interface between the nitride film N and the top oxide film O2. This results in increasing the threshold voltage of the MONOS transistor, to make the transistor nonconductive. During the write operation, the potential of each of the other electrodes P2 and P3 is not important but is usually kept at the reference potential. To erase data, the first electrode P1 is set to the reference potential, and an erase voltage of -8 to -11 V is applied to the gate electrode M. As a result, the electrons in the gate insulation film move to the p well, to decrease the threshold voltage of the MONOS transistor. The transistor then shows depletion characteristics and becomes conductive. At this time, it is preferable to keep each of the other electrodes at the reference potential. Reading data from the MONOS EEPROM will be explained with reference to FIG. 2(b). The MONOS transistor is connected in series with a standard enhancement MOS transistor. The two transistors are simultaneously turned ON to divide a source voltage. At this time, the gate electrode M and second electrode P2 of the MONOS transistor and a gate G of the MOS transistor are connected to the reference potential. The first electrode P1 of the MONOS transistor and a source electrode P4 of the MOS transistor receive a source voltage of -2.5 to -6.5 V. The third electrode P3 of the MONOS transistor and a drain of the MOS transistor are connected to each other, to form a voltage dividing point. The voltage dividing point provides an output signal of level LOW when data is written to the MONOS transistor, and an output signal of level HIGH when no data is written. The write and erase voltages for the MONOS EEPROM explained above may differ from each other. Selecting the different voltages will change data erase and write periods, data storage characteristics, and a service life of the memory element., 34303=Japanese Examined Patent Publication Nos. 3-12353 and 63-25393, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 51-15947 and 57-32144, U.S. Pat. No. 3,964,024, etc., disclose methods for carrying out bidirectional noncontact data communication between a portable data carrier such as a card and fixed facilities., 36532=Among the prior arts, the Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 3-12353 discloses a data carrier that is capable of writing and reading data, provided that a distance between the data carrier and fixed facilities is less than several centimeters. Due to this short distance, electric power can be easily supplied from the fixed facilities to the data carrier. Generally, this type of product is distinguished from the data carrier and is called a noncontact memory card.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As explained above, the electromagnetic coupling data carrier 200 having no power source according to the present invention is capable of converting a change in the amplitude of an AC magnetic field containing electric power and data emitted from the fixed facilities 150 into a change in an internal AC voltage. Accordingly, the fixed facilities 150 can transmit binary data to the data carrier by superimposing the data on an AC magnetic field by amplitude modulation. The depth of amplitude modulation is restricted in a predetermined range, so that AC magnetic field frequencies can be continuously supplied to the data carrier 200. This results in stabilizing a clock signal in the data carrier 200 and correctly operating logic circuits in the data carrier. Not only data and clock signals but also control commands can be sent from the fixed facilities to the data carrier 200, to selectively operate the data carrier. This improves the functions of the data carrier. The embodiment of FIG. 8 has been explained. In an actual data carrier, a resistor connected in series with a rectifier has a function of converting a current into a voltage. Any element having such current-to-voltage conversion function is employable. For example, an inductance element will do. A plurality of rectifying diodes may be connected in series to use the parasitic resistance thereof. The best current-to-voltage conversion means is to use the zener voltage of a zener",
