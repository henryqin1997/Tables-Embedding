A common pixel type is the so-called 3T-pixel that includes a photosensitive element, a reset transistor in series with the photosensitive element and an amplifying transistor connected to the photosensitive element and the reset transistor (see e.g. O. Yadid-Pecht, IEEE Trans. Electr. Dev. 38(8), 1772 (1991)). In some applications, the reset transistor is configured so as to define a 3T-transistor with a logarithmic characteristic (see e.g. M. A. mahowald, SPIE Proceedings Vol. 1473, 52 (1991))., 65754=A thin silicon-oxide (641) thereafter is grown in the trench that is present in the silicon substrate (FIG. 6b). The oxide can have a thickness of about 20-25 nm and can be grown in a H2O/O2 environment at a temperature of about 1200-1250\ufffd C. in a classical oxidation furnace such as commercialized by the companies TEL or ASM. This step of growing a thin oxide layer can optionally be foregone by a step of growing a sacrificial oxide whereafter an HF-based etch (for example HF: H2O in a 1:100 ratio) of the sacrificial oxide can be executed. The step of growing the thin oxide layer of 20-25 nm is beneficial in reducing the dangling bonds and the plasma damage at the silicon surface. Typically the oxidation furnace during the growth of the thin oxide layer (641) is quickly ramping up to the temperature (1200-1250\ufffd C.) needed during this ramp up a low oxygen concentration is present in the environment in the furnace. Thereafter a steady state regime with a constant temperature (1200-1250\ufffd C.) in the presence of a H2O/O2 environment is installed. At the end of the heating cycle a N2 or He or another non-reactive environment is fed into the furnace. It is also possible to introduce Chlorine or Chlorine-containing molecules such as DCE or oxalylchloride in the furnace during the heating cycle. After this step of growing a thin oxide layer (641), a thick silicon-oxide (642) is deposited on the wafer. In order to avoid the problem of the difference in aspect ratio of the different structures present on the silicon wafer, the thick silicon-oxide is grown in a SACVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) or a HDP (High Density Plasma) system., 59001=Typical dimensions of the structures shown in FIG. 3 and in FIG. 4 in a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology are as follows. The height of the elevated portions (311) is about 0.3 \u03bcm; the depth of the well regions is about 0.7-1.0 \u03bcm. The size of the n-well regions (411-9) as shown in FIG. 4 can be about 2\ufffd2 \u03bcm or 4\ufffd4 \u03bcm or larger. The p-well region should contain at least an amplifying transistor in case an active pixel sensor is to be made and thereto the p-well region in-between two n-well area's may be as large as about 0.09-1.2 \u03bcm2 in the 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. Typical doping levels of the different regions are of the order of 1015-1017/cm3. The doping levels may also be lower, of the order of 5.104/cm3, or higher, of the order of 5.1017-1018/cm3. Thus according to this embodiment of the invention, use can be made of a first region of n-type conductivity, preferably of a doping level of charge carriers of the order of 1015-1017/cm3, and of a second region of p-type conductivity, preferably of a doping level of charge carriers of the order of 1015-1017/cm3 for making a detector for light. The first region according to this embodiment can be a n-well in the silicon substrate. The second region can be part of the substrate or can be an additional p-well in the substrate. The first and the second region according to this embodiment can have a depth of about 0.3 to 0.5 to 1 \u03bcm. Only the first region can have this depth, the second region being part of the substrate or having the same doping type but a different doping level than the substrate. The first region and the second region can be made by ion implantation or by diffusion of n-type, resp. p-type dopants, in the p\u2212-substrate or in another well in the substrate that was made in a foregoing manufacturing step., 31246=In a first aspect of the present invention a detector for electromagnetic radiation is disclosed. The detector can be part of an integrated circuit in a solid state (silicon) substrate. The detector can also be at least partly integrated in a solid state substrate, said substrate comprising a first region of a first conductivity and a second region of a second conductivity, said first region being adjacent to said second region, and said first and second region forming a detection junction, at least part of said detection junction being substantially orthogonal with respect to the plane of the surface of the substrate above said detection junction. At least part of said first region and the detection junction can be covered with a passivating layer, optionally defining a smooth interface with the first region. The passivating layer can be an insulating material or a semiconducting material. In a preferred embodiment, the passivating layer is an oxide layer. In these embodiments, the first region and the second region are located in the surface layers of the substrate. The second region may also be covered by the same or another passivating layer. In an embodiment of the invention, said passivating layer can be interrupted with at least one elevated portion of the substrate material, a contact area optionally being within the elevated portion. The region of the second conductivity type can surround the region of the first conductivity type entirely along its sides. According to an embodiment of this first aspect of the invention, use can be made of a first region of n-type conductivity, preferably of a doping level of charge carriers of the order of 1015-1016-1017/cm3, and of a second region of p-type conductivity, preferably of a doping level of charge carriers of the order of 1015-1016-1017/cm3 for making a detector for electromagnetic radiation. The doping levels may also be lower, of the order of 5.1014/cm3, or higher, of the order of 5.1017-1018/cm3. The first and the second region according to this embodiment can have a depth of about 0.3 to 0.5 to 1 \u03bcm. Also only the first region can have this depth, the second region being part of the substrate or having the same doping type but a different doping level than the substrate.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations At the end of the process the final structures on the silicon wafer can be heated in a N2/H2 (90:10) environment for a period of about 30-60 minutes. The presence of H2 molecules that can convert to H can contribute to a further passivation of dangling bonds. In a next step, the surface of the wafer is flattened by Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP). Thereafter the nitride layer (6222) is removed (see FIGS. 6c and 6 d). The nitride layer can be removed using a dry etching system, or using a wet etching system with H3PO4 and/or H2SO4 as etchants. In or on the oxide regions (6221), transistors can be defined. Upon the oxides a stack of metallization layers and intermetal dielectrica can be defined. A thin silicon-oxide (641) thereafter is grown in the trench that is present in the silicon substrate (FIG. 6b). The oxide can have a thickness of about 20-25 nm and can be grown in a H2O/O2 environment at a temperature of about 1200-1250\ufffd C. in a classical oxidation furnace such as commercialized by the companies TEL or ASM.
