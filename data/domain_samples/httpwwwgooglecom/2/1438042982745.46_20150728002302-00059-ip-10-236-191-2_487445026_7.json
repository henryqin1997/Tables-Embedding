Without processing, these output images cannot be printed on the A6 print paper. To cope with this situation, the present embodiment reduces (thinning processing) the image data to 662\ufffd496 dots in the case of 144 dpi, and to 1334\ufffd996 dots in the case of 288 dpi, so as to obtain an output image size of 11.7 cm\ufffd8.8 cm, which can be printed in the A6 print paper., 50914=An image sensed by a widely available digital camera generally has 640\ufffd480 dots in conformity to the VGA standard. For instance, in a case where image data having 640\ufffd480 dots is printed in a printable range (assuming 28 cm\ufffd19 cm) of an A4 print paper at resolution of 288 dpi, it is necessary to generate image data having more than 3100\ufffd2100 dots. In other words, the rate of magnification for the horizontal and vertical dots is nearly five times. However, if original image data is enlarged by far more than necessary and printed, image quality is deteriorated. Therefore, enlarging image data with a great magnification rate is not preferable., 39084=Furthermore, in a case where inputted image data is 1920\ufffd1440 dots and a detected print paper is size A6, and a selected template is size E (288 dpi), a magnification rate less than 1 is used to thin out the image data, then printing is performed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, to appraise the public of the scope of the present invention, the following claims are made. In addition to the above effect, according to the present invention, it is possible to print an image while controlling a setting that causes image quality deterioration. As has been described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to ensure printing the entire desired image. Although the print conditions available for manual setting are either resolution setting or size setting in the above-described embodiments, other setting may be provided, e.g., setting of magnification, image cutting such as trimming or the like. In short, anything related to the size of the image subjected to printing, which can be set by manual operation, may be set. Furthermore, the present invention also includes a case where, after the program codes read from the storage medium are written in a function expansion card which is inserted into the computer or in a memory provided in a function expansion unit which is connected to the computer, a CPU or the like contained in the function expansion card or unit performs a part or entire process in accordance with designations of the program codes and realizes functions of the above embodiments. Furthermore, besides aforesaid functions according",
