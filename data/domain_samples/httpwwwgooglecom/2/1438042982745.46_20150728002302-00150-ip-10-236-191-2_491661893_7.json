It is a heat-sterilized, water-insoluble, non-elastic, porous, pliable fine gelatin powder obtained from milling absorbable gelatin sponge which has been derived from purified porcine skin. The slurry of the present invention is obtained by blending Gelfoam powder with saline to obtain a 0.5-20 per cent solution by weight. Thrombin powder is added in the amount ranging from 1-20,000 units per milliliter of solution, preferably, 1,000 units per milliliter of solution. Preferably, calcium is added in the form of calcium gluconate, calcium chloride, calcium citrate or any other suitable calcium preparation in which case the slurry can be buffered. A calcium ion concentration ranging from approximately 1-500 milli-moles per milliliter of liquid is obtained. Preferably, a concentration of 8 milli-moles per milliliter is obtained by adding calcium chloride., 160872=Operation and use of the device 501 is similar to that described for the expansile device 301 except for the sealant introducer means in the device 501. As soon as it has been established that a good seal has been formed between the occlusion assembly 307 and the wall 103 adjacent the puncture the physician can introduce the solid sealant as hereinafter described and shown in FIG. 34A-C., 161680=While holding the handle 564 of sealant placement member 561, the physician inserts the distal extremity 563 thereof into the capsule 541 retained in the casing 536 in the chamber 527 of the second arm 526 of the adaptor 526. Pushing the placement member 561 in a distalward direction extrudes the sealant 542 out of the capsule 541, with the capsule 541 being retained in the casing 536, and out of the adaptor 521 into the first lumen 507 of the second elongate tubular member 503. Continued distal movement of the placement member 561, until the hub 564 thereof seats against the capsule 541, advances the compressed sealant 542 distally in the first lumen 507 and out of the first lumen 507 into the body proximal to the expansile member 309 and external to the lumen 104 of the vessel 107. The bevel on the tip 509 of the second elongate tubular member 503 permits easy, accurate and effective placement of the solid sealant 542 without buckling or folding of the same as shown in FIG. 34A-C., 167235=Operation and use of the device 601 is similar to that described for the expansile device 501 except as hereinafter described and shown in FIG. 36A-C. The first flexible elongate tubular member 302 carrying the expansile assembly 307 may be used initially with or without the second elongate tubular member 503 and the solid sealant introduction means 602 carried thereby. If used separately, as soon as it has been established that a good seal has been formed between the occlusion assembly 307 and the wall 103 adjacent the puncture and all other sheaths are removed the physician can introduce the solid sealant as hereinafter described., 178922=Another vascular closure device with which the Gelfoam slurry sealant, system and method may be utilized is designated by the trademark ANGIOSEAL, marketed by Sherwood, Davis and Geck of St. Louis, Mo. The device uses an introducer sheath to place an absorbable anchor 731 into the vessel 107 through the puncture 106 therein. The anchor 731 carries at least one, usually two, sutures 732 secured thereto, the sutures 732 being adapted to extend from the puncture 106 to outside the body along the tissue tract 106 associated therewith. During deployment, after the anchor 731 is placed intravascularly but before the sheath is removed from the tissue tract 106, a collagen plug 733 or sponge with a hole or lumen which has been threaded over the sutures 732 and engaged thereby is also deposited into the tissue tract 106. The suture 732 is adapted to be pulled proximally by the operator in order to pull the anchor 731 proximally into engagement with the wall 103 in the lumen 104 of the blood vessel 107 whereupon the sutures 732 are ligated over the collagen plug 733. Ligation pulls the collagen plug 733 distally so that it becomes firmly disposed adjacent the outer wall 103 of the vessel 107 and the sutures 732 thereby substantially occluding the puncture 106. As shown in FIGS. 40A-C, the remainder of the method of introducing the Gelfoam slurry sealant 723 is as hereinbefore described in conjunction with the PROSTAR device., 176333=As hereinbefore described, it should also be appreciated that the process for making the Gelfoam slurry biological sealant and the sealant system or, simply, the Gelfoam slurry hereinbefore described can be utilized in conjunction with other vascular closure devices. One such device is designated by the trademark PROSTAR and is marketed by Perclose, Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif. By the use of percutaneously inserted needles secured to sutures 721, the device percutaneously sutures a puncture 106 in a blood vessel wall 103 thereby occluding the puncture 106. The sutures 721 are tied and the tails 722 thereof extend proximally, out of the tissue tract 106 created at the time of the vascular access procedure and thence out of the body. It has been determined that in spite of using the PROSTAR device to seal a puncture, there is often continued bleeding from the puncture. It is, therefore, advantageous to supplement such a closure with gelatin slurry biological sealant. Accordingly, a Gelfoam slurry biological sealant system is provided as hereinbefore described. Use of the system in conjunction with the PROSTAR is as hereinafter described and shown in FIGS. 39A-C. The tails 722 of the sutures 721 extending proximally out of the body are threaded through the slot 702 in the distal end of the insertion catheter 701 and into the lumen 704 of the catheter 701 by applying pressure on the bevel 703 of the distal slot 702 with the tails 722. The tails 722 are then pulled proximally until they catch and become disposed in the eye 706 of the slot 702, exiting the lumen 704 of the injection catheter 701 thereat as shown in FIG. 39. The distal end of the injection catheter 701 is carefully advanced over the sutures 721 distally into and down the tissue tract 106 associated with the sutured puncture 106 until it is adjacent the vessel wall 103 and sutures 721. After blending the Gelfoam slurry sealant 723, the sealant 723 in the syringe 724 is sterilely deposited into the injection catheter 701, in which the suture tails 722 are partially disposed, as the catheter 701 is withdrawn, thus introducing the sealant 723 into the tract 106 proximal to the wall 103 of the blood vessel 107 and adjacent the tied sutures 721. The sealant 723 is then permitted to facilitate hemostasis for a predetermined period of time as hereinbefore described. Thereafter, the sealant 723 may be retained in the tissue tract 106, wherefrom it is reabsorbed over a period of time, or it may be removed therefrom. The remainder of the procedure is as hereinbefore described., 39174=This is a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. No. 09/126,963 filed Jul. 31, 1998 which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/972,383, filed Nov. 18, 1997 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,009 which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/798,870, filed Feb. 11, 1997 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,860 on Jul. 21, 1998., 168548=When the second elongate tubular member 503 is positioned as hereinbefore described, the tensioning device 335 may be applied to the first flexible elongate tubular member 302. As shown in FIG. 36A-C, this is accomplished by gently bending a portion of the second elongate tubular member 503 laterally so that the grasping members 351 of the grasping arms 352 of the tensioning device 335 are placed around and grasp the first flexible elongate tubular member 302 only.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Percutaneous methods are widespread techniques that offer less invasive, safer and more cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic access to organs of the human body. In order to fully realize the advantages of percutaneous access however, morbidity associated with access sites must be anticipated and prevented wherever possible. Indeed, advanced therapeutic interventions have led to a greater range of access site complications. A patient who suffers such complications must often undergo a more invasive procedure in order to prevent devastating injury to life or limb. Such procedures incur additional risks and costs. Effective percutaneous occlusion of a percutaneous vascular access site that proves to be otherwise difficult to manage is a major achievement. Without such treatment many of the advantages of percutaneous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are lost. Satisfactory solutions have heretofore been absent in the prior art. The device and method of the present invention obviate many of the morbid side effects associated with puncture sites hereinbefore described. As hereinbefore described, the system of the present invention is also readily adaptable to be used in conjunction with other vascular closure devices. A variation of the aforementioned devices includes a system marketed by Kensey Nash Corporation of Exton, Pa. This system comprises the use of the PROSTAR device followed by the insertion of a hemostatic plug which is formed with a lumen through which the suture tails can be extended so that, subsequently, the plug can be threaded",
