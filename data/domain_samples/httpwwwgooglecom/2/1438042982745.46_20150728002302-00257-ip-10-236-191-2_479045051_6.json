For example, there may be 20 neighbor pilots in the neighbor set, and a 60-chip window for each neighbor pilot. Accordingly, 1200 correlations should be performed. One can appreciate the importance of terminating the correlation for a particular chip offset at the early detection correlation length to reduce the time that radiotelephone 100 must wake up before monitoring the paging channel to search for and acquire the pilot channel having the greatest strength.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications and variations can be made in the method and apparatus of the present invention and in construction of this apparatus without departing from the scope or spirit of this invention. In summary, a method utilized by a wireless communication device configured in accordance with the present invention acquires a pilot signal in an efficient and reliable manner by dynamically adjusting the early detection threshold whenever the active pilot strength is sufficiently strong, and, moreover, employing the finger receivers to obtain reliable pilot signal strength measurements of the active and neighbor pilots. In the preferred embodiment, the greatest neighbor pilot strength must be at least 3 dB greater than the active pilot's strength. This margin ensures that handoffs will only be made to neighbor pilots that have a significantly stronger signal than the active pilot, and reduces the number of handoffs during pilot acquisition. Furthermore, it provides a preference for monitoring the active pilot even though a stronger neighbor pilot may exist. One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the margin can be set to values other than 3 dB. When the greatest neighbor pilot strength is not at least 3 dB greater than the active pilot's strength, no handoff is made. (Step 409.) When the greatest neighbor pilot strength is at least 3 dB greater than the active pilot's strength, a handoff is",
