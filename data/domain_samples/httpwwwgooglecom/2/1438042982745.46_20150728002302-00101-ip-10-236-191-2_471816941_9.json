    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{65142=The thermally sensitive composition used in the indicator devices of the invention may also comprise a toning agent, also known as an activator-toner or toner-accelerator. Such materials may advantageously perform as development accelerators, and may be included at various levels to optimize desired responses for particular applications. Combinations of toning agents are also useful. Examples of useful toning agents and toning agent combinations are described in, for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,123,282. Examples of useful toning agents include, for example, phthalimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, N-potassium-phthalimide, succinimide, N-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide, phthalazine, 1-(2H)-phthalazinone and 2-acetylphthalazinone., 64179=In accordance with a particular embodiment, a photothermographic composition incorporating photosensitive silver halide grains which have been chemically sensitized with a gold sensitizer is used in the thermally sensitive areas of the time and temperature integrating devices of the invention, such as described, e.g., in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/883,924 of Eshelman et al., filed Jun. 27, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Such gold sensitized photothermographic compositions have been found to be more sensitive, and more easily fogged in the absence of antifogging agents, than conventional photothermographic compositions, and accordingly more applicable to use in accordance with the instant invention. Gold sensitizers may be effective at very low levels, e.g. as low as 0.1 mg/m2, and levels of up to about 8.0 mg/m2 are preferred to provide optimum sensitivity., 30741=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/987,662, filed Dec. 9, 1997, abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 56579=A preferred concentration of photographic silver halide for use in the thermally sensitive areas of the time and temperature integrating devices in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention is within the range of 0.01 to 10 moles of photographic silver halide per mole of organic silver salt oxidizing agent (e.g., silver behenate) in the photothermographic material. Other photosensitive silver salts are useful in combination with the photographic silver halide if desired. Preferred photographic silver halides are silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromochloride, silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromoiodide, and mixtures of these silver halides. Very fine grain photographic silver halide is especially useful. The photographic silver halide can be prepared by any of the known procedures in the photographic art. Such procedures for forming photographic silver halides and forms of photographic silver halides are described in, for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029 and Research Disclosure, December 1978, Item No. 17643. Tabular grain photosensitive silver halide is also useful, as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,499. The photographic silver halide can be unwashed or washed, chemically sensitized, protected against the formation of fog, and stabilized against the loss of sensitivity during keeping as described in the above Research Disclosure publications. The silver halides can be prepared in situ as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,457,075, or prepared ex situ by methods known in the photographic art., 49623=The use of releasably attached time and temperature integrating devices are particularly applicable for use with photographic materials which typically may be packaged in multiple enclosures, as disclosed in copending, commonly assigned, U.S. application Ser. No. 08/987,561 filed Dec. 9, 1997 (Kodak Docket No. 76871), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Cartridges containing photographic film conventionally may be packaged in a cylindrical enclosure 50 comprising canister 51 and cap 52, which in turn may be packaged in an outer enclosure box 54, as shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b. In such application, a removably attached indicator device 53 may be conveniently attached to the cylindrical enclosure and the outer enclosure box may be fashioned to have a transparent or open section 55 through which the indicator device 53 may be viewed. In such instance, the thermal history of a particular photographic material unit may be easily monitored by distributors and consumers prior to purchase thereof, and the user may subsequently transfer the indicator device 53 to a photographic camera 56 as illustrated in FIG. 5c after the packaging enclosures are opened and the photographic material is loaded in a camera to continue monitoring thermal exposure during use of the photographic material. When the photographic material is subsequently unloaded from the camera, the indicator device may be retransferred to an enclosure for the material to maintain the thermal exposure record up to photographic processing., 79654=The chemical sensitization of the AgBr grains was carried out as specified in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/883,924 of Eshelman et al., filed Jun. 27, 1997, referenced above, using Na3Au(S2O3)2., 53558=In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermally sensitive image-forming area of the time and temperature integrating devices comprises at least one layer containing in reactive association in a binder, preferably a binder comprising hydroxyl groups, a light-sensitive photographic silver halide prepared in situ and/or ex situ in combination with the organic silver salt oxidizing agent and the reducing agent for the organic silver salt oxidizing agent. Such image-forming compositions are typically used in photothermographic imaging elements as described in the above cited thermographic imaging element references. References describing such components in the context of photothermographic imaging elements include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,457,075; 4,459,350; 4,264,725 and 4,741,992 and Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029., 52111=A variety of reducing agents are useful in the thermally sensitive composition. Examples of useful reducing agents include substituted phenols and naphthols, such as bis-beta-naphthols; polyhydroxybenzene compounds, such as hydroquinones, pyrogallols, catechols, gallic acid and derivatives thereof such as propyl gallate; aminophenols, such as 2,4-diaminophenols and methylaminophenols; ascorbic acid reducing agents, such as ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid ketals, ascorbic acid palmitate and other ascorbic acid derivatives; hydroxylamine reducing agents; 3-pyrazolidone reducing agents, such as 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone and 4-methyl-4-hydroxymethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone; and sulfonamidophenols and other organic reducing agents known to be useful in thermographic and photothermographic elements, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,508, U.S. Pat. No. 3,801,321 and Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029. Combinations of organic reducing agents are also useful in the thermally sensitive composition., 153213=All of the parts in this example were similar to part #17 of Example 1 (laydown of 2422 mg Ag/m2, no antifoggant and no sensitizing dye). The molar amounts of both developers was held constant throughout this experiment. The resulting photothermographic compositions were coated at a wet laydown of 121.4 g/m2 on a poly(ethyleneterephthylate) film support. The coatings were dried at a temperature up to 77\ufffd C. for 2 minutes in an air chamber. All the coatings had the same overcoat as that described in Example 1., 37432=The time and temperature integrating devices in accordance with the invention comprise a support having thereon a thermally sensitive image-forming area composition comprising a combination of (i) an organic silver salt oxidizing agent and (ii) a reducing agent for the organic silver salt oxidizing agent. Such thermally sensitive compositions in accordance with the time-temperature history indicators of the invention may comprise components of thermally sensitive compositions typically used in conventional thermally processable imaging elements. Such imaging elements, including films and papers, for producing images by thermal processing are well known. These elements include thermographic elements in which an image is formed by imagewise heating the element, as well as photothermographic elements in which an image is formed by imagewise exposure of the element to light followed by development by uniformly heating the element. Such imaging elements are described in, for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,080,254, 3,457,075 and 3,933,508. Research Disclosure is published by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., Dudley House, 12 North St., Emsworth, Hampshire P010 7DQ, England. The thermographic and photothermographic elements typically comprise essentially transparent thermally sensitive silver salt compositions coated on a support, which compositions form a visible image of increasing density with increasing thermal exposure., 60895=The thermally sensitive compositions as described can contain further addenda that are known to aid in formation of a useful image. The compositions can contain development modifiers that function as speed increasing compounds, sensitizing dyes, hardeners, antistatic agents, plasticizers and lubricants, coating aids, brighteners, absorbing and filter dyes, such as described in Research Disclosure, December 1978, Item No. 17643 and Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029. The components of the thermally sensitive composition can be in any location in the time and temperature integrating device that provides the desired visible density change. If desired, one or more of the components can be in one or more layers of the element. For example, in some cases, it is desirable to include certain percentages of the reducing agent, toner, stabilizer and/or other addenda in an overcoat layer over a photothermographic imaging layer of the element. This, in some cases, reduces migration of certain addenda in the layers of the element. It is necessary, however, that the components of the thermally sensitive imaging composition be \"in association\" with each other in order to produce the desired visible image density change. The term \"in association\" herein means that the components are in a location with respect to each other that enables the desired visible density change to be observed upon sufficient thermal exposure. The layers of the time and temperature integrating device may be coated on a support by coating procedures known in the photographic art, including dip coating, air knife coating, curtain coating or extrusion coating using hoppers. If desired, two or more layers may be coated simultaneously., 67918=A wide variety of materials can be used to prepare a backing layer that is compatible with elements comprising thermally sensitive compositions. The backing layer should not adversely affect sensitometric characteristics of the photothermographic element such as minimum density, maximum density and photographic speed. Useful backing layers include those comprised of poly(silicic acid) and a water-soluble hydroxyl containing monomer or polymer that is compatible with poly(silicic acid) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,828,971. A combination of poly(silicic acid) and poly(vinyl alcohol) is particularly useful. Other useful backing layers include those formed from polymethylmethacrylate, acrylamide polymers, cellulose acetate, crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol, terpolymers of acrylonitrile, vinylidene chloride, and 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-trimethylammonium methosulfate, crosslinked gelatin, polyesters and polyurethanes. Particularly preferred backing layers are described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,310,640 and 5,547,821, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Backing layers are preferably transparent and may contain organic or inorganic matte particles. The matte particles are preferably beads of poly(methylmethacrylate-co-ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate) with a particle size of 3 to 5 micrometers at a coverage of 25 mg/m2. An electroconductive layer may also be included, and may preferably comprise a colloidal gel of silver-doped vanadium pentoxide dispersed in a polymeric binder. An electroconductive backing layer may also be used comprising a polymeric binder, matte particles and electrically-conductive metal-containing particles dispersed in said binder in an amount sufficient to provide a surface resistivity of less than 5\ufffd1011 ohms/square., 45648=In one specific preferred embodiment, a time and temperature integrating indicator device in accordance with the invention is used to provide an indication of the cumulative thermal exposure to which a silver halide based photographic material has been subjected. Such photographic material may be, e.g., color negative, color positive, or color reversal films and papers or black and white films and papers. The indicator device may be conveniently applied to a conventional film cartridge, such as a 35 mm or an Advanced Photo System film cartridge, or to packaging of any of the various types of photographic materials, including packaging of single use cameras (also referred to as \"film with lens\"). As illustrated in FIGS. 3a-3d, in order for an indicator 31 to be visible when in use (e.g., when film 32 has been loaded in a photographic camera 33), it may be positioned on a film cartridge 30 so as to be aligned with camera 33 \"film type\" window 34 typically provided on camera backs, as disclosed in copending, commonly assigned, U.S. application Ser. No. 08/987,787 filed Dec. 9, 1997 (Kodak Docket No. 76872), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. As shown therein, indicating indicia in association with indicator device 31 provided on cartridge 30 such as \"OK\" as illustrated in FIGS. 3a and 3b may be simply obscured once the film in the cartridge has been exposed to an undesirable cumulative thermal exposure as illustrated in FIGS. 3c and 3d. It is a unique advantage of the invention that the thermographic or photothermographic film type indicators of the invention may be manufactured in very thin formats, e.g., less than 500 micrometers (more preferably less than 300 micrometers and even less than 150 micrometers) total thickness including support, which allows them to be positioned directly on the film cartridge without impeding the normal function of the film/camera system., 71167=Protective overcoats may be composed of hydrophilic colloids such as gelatin or poly(vinyl alcohol) but are preferably composed of poly(silicic acid) and a water-soluble hydroxyl-containing monomer or polymer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,992, issued May 3, 1988. Protective overcoats may also be provided in the form of pressure sensitive laminated films. Alternatively, two elements comprising thermally sensitive compositions coated on supports, at least one of which is transparent, may be laminated together to form a device comprising the thermally sensitive compositions sealed between the supports, or a single element comprising a transparent support may be folded and laminated to seal the thermally sensitive composition between the folded support., 81114=In the example, only the composition of the photothermographic layer was varied. The composition of the overcoat was constant as described above. The example demonstrates the effect of four factors, namely: level of gold chemical sensitizer for the AgBr grains 4.36, 6.57, 8.72 mg/m2 (0.405, 0.610, 0.810 mg/ft2 ); dry coverage 2153, 2422, 2691 mg/m2 (200, 225, 250 mg total Ag/ft2); antifoggant level 0, 67.9 mg/m2 (0, 6.31 mg/ft2); and sensitizing dye level 0, 6.03 mg/m2 (0, 0.56 mg/ft2). The layout of the example is shown in Table I., 72759=In accordance with a particular embodiment, time and temperature integrating devices may be designed for providing a visually observable indication of various ranges of cumulative thermal exposure as disclosed in copending, commonly assigned, U.S. application Ser. No. 08/987,559 filed Dec. 9, 1997 (Kodak Docket No. 76873), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Devices in accordance with such embodiment comprise at least two thermally sensitive image-forming areas of differing thermal sensitivity along with indicating indicia in association with the thermally sensitive image forming areas for indicating when each image forming area of the device has been exposed to predetermined cumulative thermal exposures. The two thermally sensitive image-forming areas of different thermal sensitivity may be formed by pre-exposing one of the areas to a controlled level of thermal exposure so as to require less subsequent thermal exposure than at least one other thermally sensitive image-forming area of the device to form an image of the same density. For image-forming areas comprising photothermographic compositions, the areas may be preconditioned with differential light exposures to differentially pre-activate the compositions. Alternatively, the at least two thermally sensitive image forming areas of different thermal sensitivity may comprise different chemical formulations which exhibit different thermal sensitivities. As illustrated in FIGS. 6a-6d, the areas of differing thermal sensitivity may be aligned in an indicator device to form a band 60 which progressively changes from one color or density level to another along the length of the band with increasing thermal exposure. FIG. 6a represents a device comprising areas 61 through 66 of differing thermal sensitivity in \"fresh\" state, having been exposed to no \"high temperature\" exposure, while FIGS. 6b-6d represent the same device upon \"high temperature\" exposures for extended periods of time. Markers adjacent to the band may provide status information such as \"FRESH\", \"OK\", and \"NO GOOD\". This would allow a user to judge the cumulative amount of thermal exposure that a product has been exposed to relative to the quality of the product. Differential pre-heating along the strip may be achieved by contact with multiple temperature controlled heat sources that are set at incrementally decreasing temperatures and shaped and positioned to generate the appropriate pre-heat pattern. Linear array thermal printing heads which are conventionally used in fax machines and thermal dye sublimation printers may be programmed to generate fine heat differentials on the order of 300 different temperatures per inch. This technique would produce a cumulative thermal exposure indicator that would show very fine incremental changes in cumulative heat.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the above examples, various thermally sensitive composition formulations are demonstrated to exhibit substantial density changes as a function of cumulative thermal exposure. Such compositions may be used to form or obscure indicating indicia in a time and temperature integrating indicator device in accordance with the invention. The invention has been described in detail, with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it should be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention. The above data demonstrates that devices in accordance with the invention may be formulated which result in greater density increases at higher relative humidities, and thus may function as integrated time, temperature and humidity exposure indicators.
