After the user sets the password, it is encrypted according to a pre-defined encryption algorithm to form a first acceptable code. The preferred embodiment of the subject invention utilizes an exclusive OR algorithm to encrypt password information, such as that described in Hummel, et al., \"Languages\" P.C. Magazine. Vol. 7, n. 1, p. 375 ff, Jan. 12, 1988. Other encryption algorithms may also be used as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The first acceptable code is stored in non-volatile memory.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described by way of a preferred embodiment and certain modifications and variations, other modifications and variations can also be used, the invention being defined by the appended claims. The preferred embodiments have thus been described. Substitutions and modifications, within the scope of the invention, will now be apparent to skilled practitioners in the art. For example, the value used to generate the secondary password and supplied to the manufacturer to obtain the alternate password could be a random number generated by the user's computer and displayed on the screen which remains valid from the point of a first failed attempted password until the entire boot up sequence is completed. Also each computer could be shipped from the factory with its own unique secondary password contained in memory. The manufacturer would retain a list of computer serial numbers and associated passwords. As such, the password based on information external to the computer may also include information stored or generated within the computer. By way of example, the password protection could be implemented by basing the alternate password on the actual date and not displaying the date, thus keeping the user from inferring that the password is based on date. In another scheme, password protection could be implemented by supplying several possible alternate passwords, e.g. to bracket one date or to include a default date. Furthermore, means other than interrupting boot up, e.g.",
