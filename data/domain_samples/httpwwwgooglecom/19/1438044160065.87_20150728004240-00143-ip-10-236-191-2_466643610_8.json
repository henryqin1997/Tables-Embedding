Although a preferred embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention. The other auxiliary structure 172 measures the deformation of the structure 122 and is necessary since, in the case in question, the movable beam 106 is continuous. This structure 172 comprises a lower arm 180 fixed to the lower arm of the C-shaped structure 122 and an upper arm 182 which carries a transducer 184 for detecting the deformation of the structure 122 so as to identify the zero position, when the punch 108 and the die 104 are in contact with each other, for the servosystem of each of the C-shaped structures 122. In the embodiment of FIGS. 7 to 9, each C-shaped structure 122 is also provided with auxiliary detection structures 170 and 172, both of which are C-shaped. The structure 170, which measures the relative displacement of the punch and the die, includes a lower arm 174 fixed to the lower beam 102 and an upper arm 176",
