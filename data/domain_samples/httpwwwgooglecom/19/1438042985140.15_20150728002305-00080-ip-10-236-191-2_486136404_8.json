    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that the implementation of other variations and modifications of the invention in its various aspects will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and that the invention is not limited by the specific embodiments described. For example, not all banks need be coupled to allow use for every type of data such as program, left data and right data. Instead, specific banks may be dedicated to specific data types if desired. It is therefore contemplated to cover by the present invention, any and all modifications, variations, or equivalents that fall within the spirit and scope of the basic underlying principles disclosed and claimed herein. Again, with this technique, program memory, left data memory and right data memory can occupy multiple 8K\ufffd8 banks (or any other suitable sizes) in the overall memory, and thus provide more efficient use of memory with different DSP applications for multiple DSPS. In addition, the host can have unlimited accesses to the DSP memories and thus provide a simple mechanism for download and reloading of memory content. Since there is another DSP and corresponding address and data buses, a 3 bit memory type identification (ID) data arrangement is used to specify the usage type of the memory bank. For example, a 000 may be used to indicate that the memory bank is for DSPA program memory and a 101 may be used to indicate that",
