    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The time-lagging stages 122 are connected to the input terminals 123 of a multiplexer 124 at whose output terminals 125 the random timing sequence T'u is delivered. A pseudo-random generator 113 or respectively 114 according to FIG. 7 is connected to the control input terminal 126 of the multiplexer 124. FIG. 9 shows an embodiment for a random cadence generator 119. The timing sequence Tu obtained in the frequency divider 32 is fed to n time-lagging stages 122 with differing delay periods \u03c4. FIG. 8 shows a modification of the system according to FIG. 1, in which a random cadence generator 119 is situated between the frequency divider 32 and the converter stage 31. To improve screen generation, a timing sequence T'u whose timing intervals are randomly generated, could also be applied instead of a superimposition of auxiliary values. A pseudo-random generator of this kind is described exhaustively in the periodical \"Electronics,\" of May 27th 1976, at page 107. The pseudo-random generator 113;114 substantially comprises an n-bit shift register 120 and a NOR feedback circuit 212. The input terminals 117;118 of the shift register 120 are acted upon by the timing sequences Tu and Tv, respectively. Depending on which of the output terminals of the shift register 120 are led back via the feedback circuit 121, a quasi-random sequence of output values which is repeated only within a considerable period, is generated at the output terminals",
