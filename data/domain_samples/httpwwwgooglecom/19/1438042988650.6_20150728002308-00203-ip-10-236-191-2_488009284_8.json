The redundant information enables regeneration of user data in the event that one of the array's member disks or the access path to it fails. A more detailed discussion of RAID systems is found in a book entitled, The RAIDBook: A Source Book for RAID Technology, published Jun. 9, 1993, by the RAID Advisory Board, Lino Lakes, Minn. Although a RAID system is exemplified in connection with the present invention, it is obvious that a non-RAID system is also equally applicable.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations What has been described above are the preferred embodiments of a method and apparatus for improving disk log write performance using distributed write operations across multiple disks in a disk array. It will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention is easily implemented utilizing any of a variety of software, firmware and/or hardware components existing in the art. Moreover, while the present invention has been described by reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent that other alternative embodiments and methods of implementation or modification may be employed without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. For the illustrated examples, log recovery for disk log 60 and disk staging log 65 is now complete to RLI 55. As such, referring again to FIG. 8, log manager 155 passes the recovered records (now found in RLI 55) back to the control of application 150 (RAID management System 16, FIG. 1) indicating that log recovery is complete and that application 150 may now proceed to effectuate the log changes noted in RLI 55 in order to place NVRAM map 45 back in a state that existed prior to the system error/failure that initiated the transaction log recovery process. Generally stated, this entire process of (i) finding the next consecutive record (identified by the next consecutive incremental sequence number), (ii) verifying the disk set identifier, and (iii) verifying the",
