Such variations and alternate embodiments are contemplated, and can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. The ordering of the rules may or may not be important. If each rule is strictly defined to partition the decision space into mutually exclusive subspaces, then the execution order does not matter. However, it is much easier to construct rules that overlap. For example, if the ICR systems detected one and only one string having a maximum confidence value less than the threshold both rules 1 and 3 would apply. Therefore, the designer must decide how that combination should be classified. In the described set of rules, this combination is viewed as a strong recognition that should be reinforced. Thus, rule 1 is executed prior to rule 3. In this particular set of fusion rules, rules 1, 2 and 5 identify combinations of ICR system outputs that tend to produce correct matches. Thus, the confidence values for fused strings selected in accordance with these rules are boosted. Conversely, rule 3 identifies a combination that tends to produce incorrect fused strings. Thus, their confidence values are reduced. Rule 4 tends to be ambiguous, and hence is reduced towards the value 0.5. The remaining cases",
