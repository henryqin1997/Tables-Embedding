    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40585=One coded speech frame thus consists of half of the 114 bits from 8 consecutive slots, that is 456 bits per 20 mS or 22.8 kilobits per second on average. A portion of the 456 bits represents perceptually important speech bits transmitted with a 2:1 redundancy for error protection. A rate 1/2 convolutional code is used for this purpose. After decoding, the 2:1 redundancy is removed for this portion of the bits and the decoded bitrate is then an average of 13 kilobits/second. The speech vocoder operates at the 13 KB/s rate, which provides good sound quality, even with non-speech input sounds such a background noise., 35349=Avoidance of very frequency selective duplexing filters also facilitates the construction of a terminal that operates in both U.S. and European PCS bands. Thus, it is even possible to conceive of a PCS/PSC terminal that is at home in both the U.S. PCS system, and European DCS1800 systems, thus avoiding loading the limited satellite capacity still further. For administrative reasons, such as billing the subscriber for services, such a terminal may be designed to store up to three sets of subscription data, for example a subscription with an operator of the U.S. PCS system, a subscription with a European DCS1800 or GSM system operator, and a subscription in the global satellite system. The GSM standard describes the facility to store subscription information including security and authentication keys external to the phone in a plug-in \"smart card\". One embodiment of the present invention can comprise using a smart card that not only contains alternative subscription information that is electronically read into the phone, but also a description of the alternative mode and therefore signal waveforms which the phone's signal processing will adopt when that subscription data is in use. For subscriber and retailing convenience however, the preferred embodiment is to adopt the same set of subscription data including telephone number and to ensure that that data will be accepted as valid in all systems when the subscriber is roaming between systems., 37686=FIG. 2 illustrates the TDMA transmission format employed in GSM at both 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands. A superframe comprises 4\ufffd26 TDMA frames. In every 26 successive TDMA frames, the first 12 carry traffic information. Frame 13 is idle and can be used by a mobile terminal to read identification data from nearby base stations. Frames 14-25 carry traffic information, and frame 26 carries one fourth of a Slow Associated Control Channel message (SACCH). Four such blocks of 26 frames are required to complete delivery of one SACCH message, while each group of 26 frames delivers traffic data representing six, 20 mS speech vocoder data blocks. Each 20 mS block of coded data representing a segment of the speech waveform is spread over eight consecutive TDMA frames in a process known as block-diagonal interleaving. Each 8-frame interleaved block is half-overlapped and merged with 4 frames of each of the adjacent speech blocks in order to fill each timeslot with bits that have come half from one speech frame and half from another. Each TDMA frame is then transmitted on a different frequency using frequency hopping to obtain the benefit known as interference averaging or interferer diversity., 32923=The duplex spacing between satellite uplink and downlink bands is seen to be somewhat larger. While this facilitates the construction of small, low-loss duplexers that would permit transmission and reception through the same antennas simultaneously, duplexers are still components that are preferably avoided by using the time-duplex method at least in the portable telephone terminal. Avoiding such highly frequency-selective components also facilitates the construction of a receiver that would embrace both the PCS receive band 1930-1970 MHz as well as the PSC receive band., 35022=In Europe, the PCS frequency bands that have been allocated are slightly lower in frequency than the PCS bands in the United States, and the duplex spacing is 95 MHz as opposed to 80 MHz. The European PCS system is known as DCS1800 and uses the 900 MHz GSM standard translated to the higher frequency bands., 22793=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/501,575, filed Jul. 12, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,957., 77973=FIG. 6 shows the correspondence between up and downlink frequencies and timeslots when using the invention disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/179,954, and the uplink comprises 4 timeslots on each of four 50 KHz channels in 1:1 association with 16 timeslots on one 200 KHz downlink channel. The incorporated invention provides a nominally constant time-duplex spacing between transmit and receive for all channels, which is useful in simplifying the design and operation of the mobile phone.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above invention use of dynamic TDMA slot allocation combined with demodulation and decoding that can automatically detect whether received information was intended or not and discard it or use it accordingly has many advantages as have been described in the above specification but which are meant to be exemplary and not limiting of the scope of the invention which is defined by the following claims. Orthogonal Frequency Hopping may be effected either by changing a frequency synthesizer for each mobile link from frame to frame, or alternately by the baseband hopping scheme of FIG. 16 in which the traffic stream for a particular mobile is switched from frame to frame to a different, fixed frequency carrier modulator by means of baseband hopping switch matrix 500. The inputs to switch matrix 500 are the data bursts for mobile links 1 to M for the same timeslot on M different carriers. Control signals from orthogonal frequency-hop generator 501 steer each traffic signal to a unique output corresponding to carrier frequencies 1 to M, but the steering effects a different mapping for each successive TDMA frame of 32 slots. The speech activity indication accompanying each data burst is also routed to the selected output. The outputs from other baseband hopping units 500 to 501 for different timeslots destined for the same carrier frequency but different timeslots are collected at the inputs of multiplexer 180a or 180b.
