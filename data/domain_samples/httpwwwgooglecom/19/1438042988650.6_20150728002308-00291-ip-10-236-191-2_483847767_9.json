USB defines a bus and protocols for the connection of computer peripherals to computers (and to each other). \u201cUniversal Serial Bus Specification\u201d, Compaq, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, Revision 1.1, Sep. 23, 1998, describes USB and its implementation and is incorporated herein by reference. Proposed and actual USB devices include keyboards, mice, telephones, digital cameras, modems, digital joysticks, CD-ROM drives, tape and floppy drives, digital scanners, printers, MPEG-2 video-base products, and data digitizers and other relatively low bandwidth devices. USB supports data rates of up to 12 Mbits/sec.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be evident that this disclosure is by way of example and that various changes may be made by adding, modifying or eliminating details without departing from the fair scope of the teaching contained in this disclosure. The invention is therefore not limited to particular details of this disclosure except to the extent that the following claims are necessarily so limited. It should also be noted that for KVM switches there is also a switched video path (not shown) between the computers and remote monitors (which may also include on-screen displays from the switch 10). Because of the high bandwidth requirements, video is typically directly switched with a crosspoint switch under the control of the controller 18. For the ease of understanding, the flow of data has been described as from the peripherals to the computers, but in the preferred embodiment, the flow of data is bidirectional. This is particularly important when using USB devices that are output or bidirectionally oriented (e.g., modem, printer, scanner, audio device). It should be noted that while the preferred embodiment uses a data bus as the switcher to move information between selected modules, it is also possible to connect the modules using a crosspoint switch, parallel address, shift registers or any other signal routing techniques known in the art. The peripheral interfaces translate the specific signals to a common \u201clanguage\u201d, a switcher routes the signals to the proper computer",
