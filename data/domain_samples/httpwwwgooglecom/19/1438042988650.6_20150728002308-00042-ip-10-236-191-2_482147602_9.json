    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17306=The value of including UV absorbing compounds in contact lenses and intraocular lenses (IOLs) has also been recognized. In a study done with pigmented rabbits by D. Pitts and M. Lattornal reported in Protection Against UVR Using the Vistacon UV/Bloc Soft Contact Lenses, International Contact Lens Clinic, Vol. 14, No. 1 pp. 22-29 (January 1987) results indicated that UV/Bloc lenses provided protection against ultraviolet radiation damage to the eye, whereas contact lenses without a UV absorber provided essentially no protection against UV damage. Furthermore, studies have shown that use of UV filtering IOLs versus use of IOLs without UV absorbers resulted in a decrease in the incidence of cystoid macular edema, see C. Kraff et al Effect of an Ultraviolet Filtering Intraocular Lens in Cystoid Macular Edema, Ophthalmology, Vol. 92, pp. 366-369. Unlike addition of UV absorbers in polymers in, for example, protective coatings to prevent polymer degradation, UV absorbers in contact lenses and IOLs are desired for protection of the eye rather than protection of the material forming the lens. However, the UV absorbers in the lenses will also help prevent degradation of the lenses., 18517=U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,304,895 and 4,390,676 issued to Loshaek, Dec. 8, 1981 and Dec. 28, 1983 respectively, disclose use of UV absorbers in lenses. In particular UV absorbing compounds which can be polymerized with the monomeric material used to form the lenses are disclosed. Specific UV absorbing compounds disclosed include 2-hydroxy-4-methacryloxy benzophenones and mixtures thereof., 16904=It has long been recognized that UV absorbers are necessary to prevent degradation in polymers exposed to UV radiation from sunlight or indoor exposure to fluorescent light. U.S. Pat. No. 3,433,539 issued to Skoultchi et al, Feb. 3, 1970, discloses derivatives of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzotriazoles and their copolymerization with known vinyl monomers for preventing UV degradation., 18919=U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,311 issued Jul. 9, 1985 to Beard et al discloses UV light absorbing polymer compositions of 2-hydroxy-5-acryloxy phenyl-2-H-benzotriazoles useful in a variety of organic polymers to provide UV absorption properties. The patent in particular discloses use of the compositions in IOLs and contact lenses., 15458=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/570,486 filed Aug. 21, 1990 now abandoned which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 198,904 filed May 26, 1988 now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A disc was cut from this rod; in its hydrated form it had a thickness of 1.19 mm. The UV spectrum of this copolymer disc was obtained as in Example 2 after hydration and extraction. At 400 mm the transmittance was found to be 1.4%. A hard, transparent rod was obtained that could be machined to an intraocular lens using techniques standard in the intraocular lens and contact lens industries. Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (having an ethylene glycol dimethacrylate content of 0.25%) 20.0 g was added to a treated clean, dry, 16\ufffd25 mm glass, Teflon screw top test tube, along with 0.681 g Compound [II] and 0.108 g USP 245. After degassing with Argon (10 min.) the tube was capped and placed in an oil bath at 55\ufffd C. for 16 hours and then at 80\ufffd C. for 24 hours. The rod was removed from the test tube and wrapped in paper wipe and heated to 110\ufffd C. for 6 hours after which the temperature was returned to room temperature without disturbing the rods. Copolymerization of Compound [II] with HEMA to Form a Rod EXAMPLE 4 The spectrum of the hydrated copolymer thus obtained is shown in FIG. 2. The transmittance at 400 nm is 23.0% for a disc having a thickness 1.1 mm. Compound [I] was prepared as described in Sustic, Zhang and Vogl, New 2(2-Hydroxyphenyl)2H-Benzotrizole Based Polymer Bound Ultraviolet Stabilizers, Polymer Preprints",
