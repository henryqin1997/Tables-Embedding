    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23017=Vacuum processing chambers are generally used for chemical vapor depositing (CVD) and etching of materials on substrates by supplying process gas to the vacuum chamber and application of a RF field to the gas. Examples of parallel plate, transformer coupled plasma (TCP, also called inductively coupled plasma or ICP), and electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) reactors are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,462; 4,948,458; and 5,200,232. The substrates are held in place within the vacuum chamber during processing by substrate holders. Conventional substrate holders include mechanical clamps and electrostatic clamps (ESC). Examples of mechanical clamps and ESC substrate holders are provided in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,029 and commonly owned U.S. application Ser. No. 08/401,524 filed on Mar. 10, 1995. Substrate holders in the form of an electrode can supply radiofrequency (RF) power into the chamber, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,618., 46675=In order to maintain temperature control of the gas distribution plate, the power to the RF antenna can be reduced to a suitable level such as below 1000 watts, preferably 750 to 950 watts. During oxide etching, the chamber pressure is typically below 300 mTorr, preferably 2-40 mTorr, the RF bias is \u22662200 watts, preferably 1200-2200 watts, and the He backpressure is 5-40 Torr, preferably 7-20 Torr. The process gas can include 10-200 sccm CHF3, 10-100 sccm C2 HF5 and/or 10-100 sccm C2 F6. In contrast, if the oxide etching is carried out at an RF antenna power of 1000 to 2000 watts unacceptable process drift can occur after consecutively etching less than 25 wafers. However, by maintaining the RF antenna power at a level below 1000 watts, the gas distribution plate will not heat up as much compared to a process wherein the RF antenna power is in the 1000 to 2000 watt range. Additionally, it has surprisingly and unexpectedly been found that by incorporating a heat transfer gas such as 50-400 sccm helium in the process gas passed through the gas distribution plate, it is possible to remove heat from the gas distribution plate. Helium gas is preferred as the heat transfer gas since it is a very efficient conductor of heat and does not take part in the chemical reaction of the plasma etching process. Further, the use of helium in the process gas can maintain the temperature of the gas distribution plate below a desired threshold temperature whether or not the RF antenna power is reduced below 1000 watts and with or without the use of additional temperature control measures., 30904=A vacuum processing chamber according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1. The vacuum processing chamber 10 includes a substrate holder 12 providing an RF bias to a substrate supported thereon and a mechanical clamp 14 for clamping the substrate while it is He backcooled. A source of energy for maintaining a high density (e.g. 1011 -1012 ions/cm3) plasma in the chamber such as an antenna 18 powered by a suitable RF source and suitable RF impedance matching circuitry inductively couples RF energy into the chamber 10 so as to provide a high density plasma. The chamber is evacuated by suitable vacuum pumping apparatus for maintaining the interior of the chamber at a desired pressure (e.g. below 50 mTorr, typically 1-20 mTorr). A dielectric window 20, e.g., quartz window, is provided between the antenna 18 and the interior of the processing chamber 10 and forms the vacuum wall at the top of the processing chamber 10. A gas distribution plate, commonly called a showerhead 22, is provided beneath the window 20 and includes a plurality of openings such as circular holes (not shown) for delivering process gas supplied by the gas supply 23 to the processing chamber 10. The gas distribution plate 22 can be temperature controlled by passing a heat transfer gas through the gas distribution plate. For example, the heat transfer gas can be added to the process gas and passed through the gas distribution plate along with the process gas. Alternatively, the heat transfer gas can be isolated from the process gas and simply supplied to a gap 25 between the window and the gas distribution plate with or without passing the heat transfer gas through the gas distribution plate and into the space between the gas distribution plate and the substrate., 30017=According to the invention, an inner chamber surface above the substrate is temperature controlled to overcome the process drift problem. The invention is especially useful for preventing process drift during etching of dielectric materials such as silicon dioxide (e.g., doped or undoped TEOS, BPSG, USG (undoped spinon-glass), thermal oxide, plasma oxide, etc.) typically overlying a conductive layer such as silicon, polysilicon, silicide, titanium nitride, aluminum or a non-conductive material such as silicon nitride. According to the invention, process drift can be avoided to such an extent that features (such as contact holes, vias, trenches, etc.) can be provided having dimensions of 0.5 \u03bcm and below and aspect ratios ranging from 2:1 to 7:1 can be consistently maintained from substrate to substrate during sequential batch processing of the substrates., 27246=Substrates which are etched in an oxide etching process generally include an underlayer, an oxide layer which is to be etched, and a photoresist layer formed on top of the oxide layer. The oxide layer may be one of SiO2, BPSG, PSG, or other oxide material. The underlayer may be Si, TiN, silicide, or other underlying layer or substrate material. The etch selectivity, which is the etch rate of the layer to be etched compared to the photoresist etch rate is preferably around 4:1 or higher. The etch selectivity of the oxide layer compared to the underlayer is preferably greater than the oxide: photoresist etch selectively, e.g., 40:1. These etch selectivities can change during consecutive processing of substrates due to the temperature increase of the processing chamber. For instance, when the chamber heats to above 80\ufffd C. during oxide etching, a reaction can occur wherein CF3 forms CF2 and HF with the CF2 leading to increased polymer deposition on the substrate being processed and causing process drift. The same problem may occur for other processes such as deposition reactions or resist stripping wherein chemical interactions with a masked layer cause polymer deposition. Such deposits are undesirable since they can lead to nonuniform processing of the wafers, a problem which worsens as more wafers are processed., 39760=During oxide etching, the chamber pressure is typically below 300 mTorr, preferably 2-40 mTorr, the antenna is powered at 200-2000 watts, preferably 400-1600 watts, the RF bias is \u22662200 watts, preferably 1200-2200 watts, and the He backpressure is 5-40 Torr, preferably 7-20 Torr. The process gas can include 10-200 sccm CHF3, 10-100 sccm C2 HF5 and/or 10-100 sccm C2 F6 and the heat transfer gas can comprise 50-400 sccm He., 46088=According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, reduction of process drift can advantageously be achieved with the foregoing apparatus as follows. In particular, inductive coupled plasma etching of an oxide layer can be achieved by use of low RF antenna power and/or addition of helium to the process gas delivered through the gas distribution plate. With this process, photoresist selectivity of over 4:1 and etching of sub-half micron vias within process window specifications and repeatable process performance of over 200 consecutive wafers can be achieved., 43827=Dielectric plates used as windows into the vacuum environment of a process chamber are subject to atmospheric pressure which increases as the size of the window increases, e.g., for a 40 cm diameter window the atmospheric pressure is about 104 Kg/m2. This means that on a typical window plate with unsupported diameter, \u03c6=40 cm, the inward force totals about 1200 Kg. Therefore, a high strength material is required, otherwise the window will be excessively thick, e.g. allowing for a 5X safety factor for ceramic, this requires about 2 cm thickness for a quartz window with \u03c6=40 cm. However, the thickness can be substantially reduced by using a high strength material such as aluminum nitride for the window. On the other hand, since process requirements may dictate that the inner surface of the chamber be composed of a process compatible material, for its chemical and/or physical properties, e.g. quartz, the gas distribution plate can be made of a relatively thin plate of quartz since the gas distribution plate need not support the force of the atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, quartz can be used for the gas distribution plate even though it has only moderate mechanical properties, extremely low thermal conductivity, and an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion. The material of the window can be selected based on vacuum compatibility, dielectric properties, relative process inertness, mechanical and thermal properties. For instance, aluminum nitride is fairly inert, has good dielectric properties (low dielectric constant and loss factor), has mechanical properties similar to alumina including thermal expansion and thermal capacity, but has thermal conductivity approximately five times greater than alumina, i.e. two orders of magnitude greater than that of quartz. Thus, an aluminum nitride window similar to that described for bulk quartz with \u03c6=40 cm, can be <1 cm thick and still support the vacuum force safely. Such a window will only support a temperature gradient of about 1\ufffd C. across it for each watt/cm2 dissipated, will have a rather short thermal time constant (seconds rather than minutes), and will therefore still be fairly good with regard to thermal shock., 34534=A process in accordance with the invention can be carried out as follows. An inductively coupled plasma reactor having a quartz window and alumina gas distribution plate, as shown in FIG. 1, can be operated by supplying the RF antenna with 13.56 MHz RF power, supplying the RF biasing electrode in the substrate support with 4 MHz. or 13.56 MHz RF power, and adding He gas to the process gas supplied to the gas distribution plate. After sequentially processing twenty-five wafers in the chamber, the inner surface of the gas distribution plate can be maintained below a threshold temperature such as below 120\ufffd C., preferably below 90\ufffd C. For oxide etching, the wafers can be processed by carrying out a 90 second oxide etch using 25 sccm C2 HF5 and 15 sccm CHF3 with 1100 watts applied to the antenna, 1300 watts applied to the bottom RF biasing electrode in the substrate support, a chamber pressure of 5 mTorr and the bottom electrode at -10\ufffd C. The oxide etch can be followed by a 10 seconds ashing step using 750 sccm O2 with 400 watts applied to the antenna and 100 watts applied to the RF biasing electrode and a chamber pressure of 15.5 mTorr followed by a second ashing step for 50 seconds using 750 sccm O2 with 400 watts applied to the antenna and 40 watts RF biasing power. Including transport and other overhead operations, the cycle time can be about 230 seconds per wafer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made, and equivalents employed, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In order to enhance the removal of heat from the gas distribution plate, the dielectric window can be made of a material having a higher heat conductivity than quartz, the material typically used for the dielectric window of aa inductively coupled reactor. For example, the dielectric window can be made of aluminum nitride which provides strength and cooling capabilities compared to quartz. Further, the gap between the dielectric window and the gas distribution plate can be reduced in size to improve the heat removal efficiency. For instance, the dielectric window and gas distribution plate can be made as a single piece such as by powder metallurgical techniques. Enhanced cooling could also be achieved by active cooling. For instance, a circulating cooled refrigerant could be passed in heat transfer contact with the antenna, dielectric window and/or gas distribution plate in order to remove heat from the gas distribution plate and maintain it at a low enough temperature. Depending on the process performed in the plasma reactor, gases other than helium could be used. For instance, hydrogen gas is a better conductor of heat than helium and thus could be used for maintaining",
