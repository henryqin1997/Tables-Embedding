FIG. 3 provides an outline of a specific system in which this wear leveling technique is employed. The memory controller 13 includes appropriate circuits 43 for interfacing with the computer system bus 15, a controller microprocessor 45, volatile buffer memory 47 for temporarily storing data being written to or read from the memory, and control logic circuitry 49. These circuit units are interconnected and under the control of the microprocessor 45. The control logic circuitry 49 includes the memory system address translation table 27\u2032, corresponding to the table 27 described with respect to FIG. 2. The EEPROM banks 11 are formed of a number of individual integrated circuit chips, such as circuit chips 51 and 53, which are connected to the controller logic 49 over circuits 55. The number of EEPROM circuit chips employed depends upon storage capacity desired for the memory system. Further details of the system illustrated in FIG. 3 can be had by reference to a co-pending patent application entitled \u201cDevice and Method for Controlling Solid-State Memory System\u201d, Ser. No. 07/736,733, filed Jul. 26, 1991, naming Robert D. Norman, Karl M. J. Lofgren, Jeffrey Donald Stai, Anil Gupta, and Sanjay Mehrotra as inventors.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the various aspects of the present invention have been described to its preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is entitled to protection within the full scope of the appended claims. Alternatively, a spare bank of EEPROM memory need not be designated for the wear leveling process, thus freeing up another bank for storing data. Data can simply be swapped between the banks experiencing the maximum and minimum cycles to-date, and the translation table 27\u2032 then being updated to redirect data accordingly. The controller buffer memory 47 can be used for temporary storage of data from the maximum and minimum use banks as data is being swapped between them. The count of the most heavily used bank is then remembered and used in the comparison step 35 when determining whether the imbalance is sufficient to justify the wear leveling process being performed. However, since the buffer memory 47 is usually preferred to be RAM, any power failure or significant power glitches occurring during the wear leveling process will cause data to be lost. The use of the spare bank in the manner described above will prevent such a data loss since the data of each block being swapped will remain in EEPROM memory at all times. Finally, as indicated by a step 101, the translation table 27\u2032 is updated so that blocks of data within the swapped banks are redirected to those new",
