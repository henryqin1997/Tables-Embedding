The present embodiments have been described as they could be implemented as a feature of a telephone messaging system such as Nortel Networks Corporations CallPilot (trademark of Nortel Networks Corporation) and as a server connected to a data network. Alternatively, the present invention could be embodied independently as a stand-alone telephone service, provided by a telephone operating company, provided by a company intranet or private network, or provided by a user's personal IVR service implemented on his PC. , there is illustrated a data communications network including a second embodiment of the present invention. The data network 50 includes a network server 52 providing a gateway between voice over IP services and the IP data network 50. In this embodiment, both the telephone user 54 and the computer user 56 are connected via a data network such as the Internet. The functions provided by the server are similar to those described herein above for the voice messaging system. FIG. 3 Referring to If the reply arrives during the time the telephone user is logged onto the voice messaging system 20, the instant messaging function 36 notifies the telephone user of the reply to the instant message.
