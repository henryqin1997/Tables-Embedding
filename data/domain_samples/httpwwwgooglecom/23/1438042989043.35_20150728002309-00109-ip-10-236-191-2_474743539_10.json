Lear, C. St. John, Method and Apparatus for Explaining Credit Scores, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/790,453 (Feb. 22, 2001) describe a Web site containing an array of informative resources including for-pay services and extranet functions to serve consumers and traditional players in the financial services industry, including financial counselors, mortgage brokers, direct lenders, large national credit issuers, and third-party credit report re-sellers, plus information seekers such as the press, consumer groups, and government agencies. A primary focus of the Flint et al. invention is to educate consumers, consumer groups, and the consumer press by offering them access to the exceptionally high-quality information, both general and personal, about the practices of collection, storing, reporting, and evaluating consumer credit data., 61381=An exemplary Web-based score explanation service requires, for example, only the credit bureau identifier, credit score, and up to four reason codes as input. In contrast, the invention herein discloses an algorithm that is used to provide an explanation of the primary factors influencing the score based upon a rich data feed. This algorithm can be enhanced depending upon the amount of input data available, although the use of an enhanced algorithm is optional and not considered to be a key element of the subject invention. The actual explanations may be selected as appropriate for the application to which the invention is put. Typical explanations are those described in A. Flint, D. Lear, C. S. John, Method and Apparatus for Explaining Credit Scores, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/790,453 (Feb. 22, 2001).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the Claims included below. The algorithm described herein would work for any score, which can then be computed in a reasonably fast manner by application of the invention herein thereto. This includes neural networks and regression trees. Generality In the preferred embodiment, the total number of Areas for Improvement could be just about any number between five and 80. However, showing the customer the typical top four is presently preferred. The total number is preferably significantly more than four, i.e. five is too small. Twenty is presently preferred. This means that the five categories mentioned above in connection with the Fair Isaac site should be expanded to about twenty. The original 80 prediction characteristics should be put into about twenty categories. Number of Areas for Improvement The presently preferred embodiment of the herein disclosed invention requires a rich data feed, i.e. the values of the z*'s. However, the values of the x*'s are not needed, unless they are the same as the z*'s. Rich Data Feed The above formula for Ik takes into account automatically and precisely the",
