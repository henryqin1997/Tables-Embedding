For example, in determining the values of the a and b factors, two specific voltages, 1 and 2.718 volts were used. However, it is expressly contemplated by the invention that any two values of AGC voltage could be appropriately used according to the teachings of the invention without departing from its scope. Therefore, the illustrated embodiment must be read only as an example which has been set forth for the purposes of clarity and not as a limitation of the invention as defined in the following claims. It is to be expressly understood that while the channels have been described as amplifiers 72, each comprising a cascaded series of amplifiers 70, each channel could as well comprise a single amplifier 70. The log linear relationship of the gain and controlling PIN diode resistance allows the cascade of amplifiers to be treated in the same way as a single amplifier 70 would be treated by the method of the invention. It should be apparent from the above description of the computer implementation of the method of the invention that the gains of the channels of the amplifiers can be calibrated and slaved to a master channel automaticaly without the use of any additional test equipment. If a multi-channel amplifier system is carried",
