For example, the deflation rate parameter could be established by means of discrete circuit components rather than by means of a programmed system processor as in the illustrated embodiment. The deflation rate could also be established by averaging or by other techniques that make use of measurements made over two or more prior measurement cycles. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments illustrated and described, and the true scope and spirit of the invention are to be determined by reference to the following claims. where the above values are expressed in mm/second. Block 230 also calculates the new pump-up and hold-in pressures as indicated from the corresponding values used in the preceding measurement cycle, and then returns control to block 220 in FIG. 4. ______________________________________Preceding CurrentDeflation Rate Deflation Rate______________________________________9 58 47 46 35 34 33 22 2______________________________________ All errors, other than those tested for in blocks 222 and 226, will cause the new deflation rate, pump-up and hold-in parameters to be calculated as indicated in block 230. Such \"other errors\" include an error in the determination of pulse rate. Block 230 determines the deflation rate for the current measurement cycle based upon the deflation rate for the preceding measurement cycle,",
