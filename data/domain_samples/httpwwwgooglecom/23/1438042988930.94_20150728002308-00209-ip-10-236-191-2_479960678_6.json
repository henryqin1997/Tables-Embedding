    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0045] The scope of the present invention is defined by the following claims. [0044] Having thus described a preferred embodiment of the Method and Apparatus for Efficient Selection and Acquisition of a Wireless Communications System, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain advantages of the within described system have been achieved. For example, it should be apparent that the use of priority data increases the likelihood that a successful system acquisition/registration will occur early in the system acquisition process. It should also be appreciated that various modifications, adaptations, and alternative embodiments thereof may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention. [0043] After the group of selected systems is reprioritized, the mobile station 2 attempts to acquire and register with a wireless communications system. In Step 204, the system having highest level of priority is selected from the group of wireless communications systems. In a preferred embodiment, this system has a relatively high desirability level (as determined by the PRL) and there is a relatively high likelihood that the acquisition/registration attempt will be successful and the system will be useable. An attempt is made to acquire and register with the selected system in Step 206. If the acquisition/registration attempt is successful, Step 208, then the selected system is used by the mobile station 2 for wireless communications. If the acquisition/registration",
