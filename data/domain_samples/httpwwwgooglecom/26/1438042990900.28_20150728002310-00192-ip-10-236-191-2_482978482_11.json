One of such inorganic materials or mixtures of two or more of such inorganic materials are employed as a means to deliver fragrances in a controlled manner. The carrier particles typically have a mean particle size of from about 0.1 to about 1150 microns. In one embodiment, the carrier particles have a mean particle size of from about 1 to about 100 microns, and more specifically from about 5 to about 60 microns., 94098=Where the perfume is to be adsorbed onto the porous inorganic carrier particle, the perfume raw materials or mixtures of perfume raw materials may be selected according to the description provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,419 issued Sep. 21, 1999, to Barket, Jr., et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. Release requires movement of the perfume out of the particle pores with subsequent partitioning into the air around the candle., 114454=30 g of Paraffin Wax (Crafty Candles, melting point 55-60 degrees Centigrade) was melted and placed into a cylindrical mold. 0.3 g of perfume loaded porous inorganic carrier particles (85 wt % zeolite 13X, 15 wt % Golden Eye perfume oil) is desired in the final candle product. Confirmation that 0.1173 g of a braided wick (BW-1 from Crafty Candles, 5.9 cm total braided wick length that is exposed to wax) is sufficient to ensure complete burning of the candle was calculated in the manner outlined below (assumes a 13:1 wick surface area to particle surface area for complete burning)., 26914=This is a continuation of International Application PCT/US02/28321, with an international filing date of Sep. 6, 2002, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60,317,613, filed Sep. 6, 2001., 82787=As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,138, issued Mar. 19, 1996 to Bacon and Trinh, incorporated herein by reference, the ClogP of an active is a reference to the \u201ccalculated\u201d octanol/water partitioning coefficient of the active and serves as a measure of the hydrophobicity of the perfume active. The ClogP of an active can be calculated according to the methods quoted in \u201cThe Hydrophobic Fragmental Constant\u201d R. F. Rekker, Elsevier, Oxford or Chem. Rev, Vol. 71, No. 5, 1971, C. Hansch and A. I. Leo, or by using a ClogP program from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. Such a program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The \u201ccalculated logP\u201d (ClogP) can be determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (cf., A. Leo in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor, and C. A. Ramsden, Eds. p 295, Pergamon Press, 1990). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each compound and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding., 108243=Wick materials can also be comprised of non-cotton materials, such as silica gel, mixtures of granular powders, mixtures of edible powders (U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,877, Schuppan, Aug. 8, 2000), or polymeric matrices (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,919,423, Requejo, et al., Jul. 6, 1999, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,231, Zaunbrecher, et al. Jan. 11, 2000) all of which are incorporated herein by reference. A polymeric matrix can be selected from the class of thermoplastic resins that can be formed into fibers by processes such as extrusion or compression molding. Obviously, it is preferred that the polymer comprises chemicals that do not convert into noxious vapors under combustion conditions. Such fiber-forming processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,065,502, 3,351,695, 3,577,588, 4,134,714, Driskill, Jan. 16, 1979, U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,409, Miller et al., Nov. 24, 1981, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,798, Chambon, et al., Jun. 14, 1994, all incorporated herein by reference. Suitable polymers include hydrocarbyl polyolefinic derivatives such as low and high density polyethylene, polypropene, polybutene, polystyrene, and the like. Others include polyvinyl acetate, and acrylate resins such as polymethyl acrylate, polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, and poly(ethylacrylate/ethylene). Thermoset resins can also be used. Other components can be included in the wick composition such as stearic acid, polyoxyalkene glycol, and the like. Cellulosic (beta-glucosidic polysaccharides) filler ingredients obtained from vegetable sources such as cotton, linen, ayon, flax, hemp, jute, wood pulp, cellulose, and mixtures thereof, can be added as well., 83917=The boiling points of many perfume ingredients are given in, e.g., \u201cPerfume and Flavor Chemicals (Aroma Chemicals),\u201d Steffen Arctander, published by the author, 1969, incorporated herein by reference. Other boiling point values can be obtained from different chemistry handbooks and data bases, such as the Beilstein Handbook, Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, and the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. When a boiling point is given only at a different pressure, usually lower pressure than the normal pressure of 760 mm Hg, the boiling point at normal pressure can be approximately estimated by using boiling point-pressure monographs, such as those given in \u201cThe Chemist's Companion,\u201d A. J. Gordon and R. A. Ford, John Wiley & Sons Publishers, 1972, pp. 30-36. The boiling point values can also be estimated via a computer program that is described in \u201cDevelopment of a Quantitative Structure\u2014Property Relationship Model for Estimating Normal Boiling Points of Small Multifunctional Organic Molecules\u201d, David T. Stanton, Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, Vol. 40, No. 1, 2000, pp. 81-90., 116824=Optionally, the perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particle can be further provided with a barrier, for example to control release of the perfume active and/or to achieve better burning of the candle. Specifically, the perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particles may be further processed with barrier technologies such as encapsulation or coating to control the release of the perfume active, or to achieve better burning of the candle by insulating the inorganic carrier from the wick. Non-limiting examples of processes which can be used to encapsulate the perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particles include: spray drying, freeze drying, vacuum drying, extrusion, coacervation, interfacial polymerization, prilling, or other microencapsulation processes known in the art. The encapsulated perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particles are then dispersed within the candle manufacturing material. Non-limiting examples of materials suitable for use as a barrier include, but are not limited to, water soluble copolymers such as hydroxylalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, gelatin (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,681,089 and 3,681,248 and WO 9828396 A1), polyacrylates, quaternary ammonium salts, acrylic resins, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydrocarbon waxes (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,919,441, Marier et al., Apr. 24, 1990, U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,603, Tsaur et al., Sep. 21, 1993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,155, Behan et al., Feb. 9, 1993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,223, Behan et al., Mar. 19, 1996, EP Nos. 382 464A, 478 326A, 346 034A), urea-formaldehyde resin, polycaprolactone melt, lactic acid, modified starches (U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,852, Brenner et al., Jul. 27, 1976 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,354,559, Morehouse, Oct. 11, 1994), gums, and hydrolysable polymers., 135322=0.48 g of Golden Eye perfume oil was added drop-wise to 90.20 g powdered Paraffin wax (Crafty Candles) under high agitation in a conventional kitchen blender. 5.0 g of the powder was then compressed into a cylindrical tablet using Instron 5569 (serial C2545, 50 kN load cell, serial no. UK187) using 500 lbf compression force for a 25 mm diameter cylindrical die., 113241=The total wick surface area will depend on the wick material used (e.g. the number of fiber strands used to form a wick). The wick surface area of interest is the total surface area of the fibers. Measurement of surface area of fibers is well known by such techniques as nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BET Surface area via physisorption) (Blair and McElroy, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 20:2955-2967, 1976). Although nitrogen adsorption/desorption is one of the most important methods for measuring the surface area of fibrous materials, the measured value is attributed mainly to the external surface of bundled fibers whereas it is well known that the internal surface area is also important for wicking. Kaewprasit, et al. (Journal of Cotton Science, 2:164-173, 1998) describe a technique for total surface area measurement, using adsorption of methylene blue. The authors show that the total surface area of cotton fibers is in the range 30 to 55 square meters per gram (where 6 different types of cotton fibers were evaluated)., 110509=Incorporation of inorganic materials into the candle manufacturing material may influence the size of the wick. Typically, sintering, or melting of inorganic materials onto the wick undesirably reduces the venturi effect of \u201cwicking\u201d wax, because the materials effectively reduce the surface area of the wick. In the case of a braided cotton wick, the ratio of the surface area of wick to quantity of inorganic carrier incorporated into the candle influences the burning rate and, thus, burning time for the candle. When the wick is contained within a portion of a candle manufacturing material comprising the perfume-loaded inorganic carrier particles dispersed throughout, problems caused by sintering of inorganic particles onto the wick can be avoided by controlling the ratio of the total surface area of the wick to the total surface area of the perfume-loaded inorganic carrier particles therein, such that enough of the wick surface is left to sufficiently propagate the flame despite some accumulation of unburned carrier particle residue on the wick. The suitable ratio of wick surface area to total surface area of perfume-loaded inorganic carrier particles is from about 5:1 to about 100:1 or more specifically from about 10:1 to about 20:1., 107411=Generally, zeolites useful in the candles and methods of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,419 issued Sep. 21, 1999, to Barket, Jr. et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. The zeolite materials useful in the practice of this invention are commercially available., 86253=Pro-fragrances for use in the compositions of the present invention are suitably described in the following: U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,468, Suffis et al., issued Jan. 3, 1995; U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,852, Suffis et al., issued May 6, 1997; U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,122, Sivik et al., issued Jan. 20, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,918, Sivik et al., issued Feb. 10, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,202, Waite et al., issued Feb. 24, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,435, Hartman et al., issued Apr. 25, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,827, Sivik, issued May 26, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,835, Severns et al., issued Nov. 3, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,752, Morelli et al., issued Jul. 6, 1999; WO 00/02986 published Jan. 20, 2000, Busch et al.; and WO 01/04248 published Jan. 18, 2001, Busch et al., all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 109920=The transport of melted wax can be enhanced by one or more capillary grooves extending axially along the surface of the wick filament. Stiffening agents can also be added to the wick filaments to maintain wick rigidity and to avoid the wick material drowning in a pool of wax as the candle bums. Such stiffening agents are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,940,233, Fox, et al., Feb. 24, 1976, and are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the wick can be constructed of a single strand of tufted wire coil having a polymeric coating described above., 92488=In addition to inorganic carrier materials, organic materials that can be used as perfume carriers may be manufactured into microcapsules via a variety of processes (e.g. interfacial polymerization, coacervation, emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization, spray drying, freeze drying, fluid bed drying) with a variety of starting materials such as polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycols. U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,688, issued May 12, 1992 to Michael describes the microencapsulation of perfume materials using coacervation processes, and is incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,375, issued to Ness et al., teaches perfume absorbed within organic polymer particles, specifically, highly hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols., 115643=Available Surface Area of Cotton Fibers=0.1173 g\ufffd30 m2/g=3.5 m2, 135806=7.8 g of the perfume-loaded agglomerated powder was also added to 142.6 g of powdered paraffin wax (Crafty Candles) and mixed in a conventional kitchen blender. 5.0 g of the mixed powder was compressed into a cylinder using Instron 5569 (serial C2545, 50 kN load cell, serial no. UK187) using 500 lbf compression force for a 25 mm diameter cylindrical die. A hole was drilled through the center of the candle to place a wick. The neat odor of both of the perfume-loaded agglomerate candles was similar in character to candles made with perfume oil. However, the intensity of odor of the perfume-loaded agglomerate candles was significantly lower than that of the perfume oil candles. Odor longevity testing showed perfume-loaded agglomerated powder candles maintained a higher odor intensity for a longer period of time than the perfume oil candles, when the candles were used solely for decorative purposes. Burning of candles yielded a low flame height, which eventually went out after 0.75-1 hour of burning (20-30% of candle burned).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A candle comprising an inner layer of high melting paraffin wax and an outer layer of low melting perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particles containing fatty acid (alternatively can be a low melting wax containing perfume loaded porous inorganic carrier and perfume) was prepared. Upon burning this dual layer candle, no premature deflagration of the wick is observed, and full fragrance character can be detected. The inner wax begins to melt, and heat conduction begins to melt the outer fatty acid layer. Upon melting, the fatty acid layer drips to the bottom of the candle as the fatty acid melt has low viscosity at its melt point, eliminating \u201cwicking\u201d of the perfume-loaded porous inorganic carrier particles.
