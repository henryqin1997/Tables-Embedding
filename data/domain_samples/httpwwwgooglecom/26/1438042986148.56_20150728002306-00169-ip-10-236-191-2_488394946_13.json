The 1:1 imaging optics 21 are followed by a color unit 26, which divides the white light incident thereon into its red, green and blue components, with the green color component, as viewed in FIG. 1, passing through the color unit 26 to the left and impinging on a light modulator 27 arranged there, and the red and blue components each being deflected perpendicular to the drawing plane (once into the drawing plane and once out of the drawing plane) and impinging on correspondingly provided light modulators (not shown). Each of said light modulators 27 is a tilting mirror matrix 28 with a cover glass 29 applied thereon.}",

In this case, an extremely compact projection arrangement is provided, using which, preferably, 1:1 imaging of an image generated on a light modulator or of the imaging area of said light modulator may be realized., 30121=In a preferred embodiment of the projection arrangement according to the invention, the imaging optics are provided as 1:1 imaging optics. This has the advantageous effect that a small image having the same size as the imaging area of the light modulator may be generated by means of the imaging optics. Also, in 1:1 imaging optics, the imaging properties of the curved mirror are particularly good., 40204=If the imaging optics are 1:1 imaging optics or also reducing imaging optics, the real intermediate image generated is very small, allowing the lens diameter of the lenses in the projection unit to be kept small, too. Advantageously, this leads to a very compact light projection unit.}",
