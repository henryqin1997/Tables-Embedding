In an alternative embodiment, several hundred of such inventory tracking devices can be used with a remote video display and computer printout device in a warehouse allowing a manager to constantly monitor the number of items in stock, and coordinate his reorder schedules for the various items. Each morning a computer printout device can deliver to the manager a document reflecting which items need to be reordered, and how many of each item need to be reordered to avoid the depletion of the warehouse's supplies. Further, a computer printer can be used in conjunction with the present invention to generate the actual reorder requests and directly mail such to the supplier without human intervention. As shown in FIG. 6, set means 14 (as shown in FIGS. 1 through 5) is eliminated and replaced by set means 90 which is activated by switch 92. Set means 90 serves to load the contents of counter 2 into memory 12. In operation, set means 4 operates to advance the value of counter 2. When the value of counter 2, shown on display 6, reaches the amount which has been determined to be the critical reorder number, switch 92 is activated which causes set means 90 to load the",
