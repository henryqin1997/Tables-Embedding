If the ACC service has been activated, the collected digits as well as the calling party telephone number are provided 62 to the adjunct processor. Again, as referenced above, the collected digits are intended to correspond to the telephone number of the called party and should be distinguished from any digits which may have been entered by the calling party and collected by the central office switch during the ACC activation procedure. All of these entered digits are stored in the IAM. Thereafter, the subscriber's telephone line must be monitored either by the adjunct processing means 40, the central office switch 30 or any other suitable component to detect an idle condition. Once detected, various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. For example, in one embodiment, a call may be originated 64 from the adjunct processor to the subscriber whereupon a message may be played 66 by the adjunct processor 40 to the subscriber advising of the need to call back the calling party who has activated the ACC service. Similarly, in yet another alternative embodiment, a three-way call is automatically originated 68 from the adjunct processor 40 to the called party 38",
