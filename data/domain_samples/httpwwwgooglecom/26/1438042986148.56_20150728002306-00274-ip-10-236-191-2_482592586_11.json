The venue employee waves the card in front of the short-range reader 1727 at the venue terminal 1726 and this will retrieve any outstanding claims without data input, thereby increasing the convenience for both parties. For this feature to work most efficiently, the claim information downloaded by the venue claims terminal 1726 should desirably include the card ID of the recipient (when there is one), so that the central system only needs to be queried in the case that there are no matches for that ID., 228876=[0128] Another example of a marketing campaign might be a reward point program that allows participating end users to accumulate reward points which can be redeemed for various rewards may be created using \u201cinternal initiation via end user event\u201d as the WHO block and \u201congoing event\u201d as the WHEN block, combined with a WHAT functional block designed to handle accumulation of reward points and, e.g., transmission of point balances and available rewards to an end user. In such a program, exemplary events triggering accumulation of points might include an end user completing a purchase transaction, a new end user registering, and completion of an opt-in marketing survey. It is contemplated that venues, third-party marketers and/or the administrator could all list rewards in the system, and for venues and third-party marketers, it may be desirable to have a monthly fee associated with posting a reward. The system may be configured to permit a venue or third-party marketer creating a reward to supply information such as that shown in the exemplary screen view 1500 of FIG. 15, and the system may use that information to select the appropriate functional blocks for constructing the campaign (rather than the venue or third-party marketer having to do so). As shown in FIG. 15, such exemplary information might include: program name (internal name for reward), reward name (name of the reward as it will appear in the rewards listings), reward description (description of the reward as it will appear in the listings), reward offered by whom, reward offered by logo (can be uploaded), reward first posting date (if the administrator is approving rewards, it is desirable for this date to be at least a week in advance of the present date), reward closing date, category class (from encoded list set by administrator), company class (from encoded list set by administrator), points to redeem the reward, and how the reward will be serviced. With regard to how the reward will be serviced, the system may support the following exemplary options: (1) to treat the reward points as a special transaction credit to the user and debit to the party offering the reward, wherein that credit can be bounded to a venue or an administrator \u201clocked\u201d product; (2) to connect the user to an external URL for redemption, wherein the end user's transaction ID can be forwarded to this URL and the system can support validation querying through an XML/SOAP API or similar protocol; in this case the party offering the reward will be responsible for reward redemption; or (3) send the user a reward coupon to their preset messaging address (it is desirable that this information NOT be passed on to the venue or third-party marketer), wherein each coupon has a unique ID associated with it, and the agent providing the reward may access/print an alphabetized list of IDs through its respective interface., 249712=[0146] Further functional protections for end users may be inherent in the setup and operation of the system, e.g., if a user does not sign up for or carry their RFID card 1721 with them, they will not be visible to the system (although other methods may be provided for \u201clogging in\u201d, e.g., by having a bartender swipe the RFID card 1721 at a venue claims terminal); in addition, the card may have information providing multiple ways for a user who has signed up for the service to toggle this feature on and off, e.g., an SMS number to which a user can send a message from the phone indicated as his or her phone messaging address, which would trigger an SMS reply showing the changed status of the service; or alternatively, the WAP end user menu may be configured to allow an end user to turn on and off location services; or alternatively, the web end user menu may be configured to allow an end user to turn on and off location services., 120910=[0001] This application claims priority to copending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/423,846, filed on Nov. 5, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 203808=[0106] In a system consistent with the present invention, other system users (primarily end users) are able to look up venue records both for information purposes and as part of the purchasing process (as described hereinabove). The system supports both a string matching quick search, and more precise searching in which search strings are tied to a specific field in the venue listing (as shown in the exemplary screen view 1100 of FIG. 11). As well, several views of the search results may be available, e.g.: alphabetical, by user rating, showing live events (if any) and showing specials (if any). Some of the fields associated with a venue may comprise user-generated content, e.g.: overall rating and the number of raters., 291164=[0169] An exemplary browse venue directory menu may provide the following selectable options: initiate purchase, rate this venue (only available to registered users; on a scale of 1-5), and provide feedback about this venue. Venue directory functionality may include using a search field to enter the name of a venue or city, selecting a city from a city list, or clicking on a location on a map graphic (e.g., as shown in the exemplary screen view 2610 of FIG. 26a). Once a city is selected, a map of the city may be displayed, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2620 of FIG. 26b, from which a user may select a venue or a region or neighborhood (for larger metropolitan areas, wherein a user would next be shown a map of the region or neighborhood from which a venue may be selected, e.g., as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2630 of FIG. 26c). Alternatively, a user may select a venue list by category (e.g., pub, bar, restaurant, club, late-night, top rated: top 5% for city, gay/lesbian). A venue list is then shown, including brief descriptions of the venues, as well as detailed venue information. This may be shown, for example, using symbols next to the name of the venue indicating certain information, e.g.: top rated (top 5% of ratings for the city), restaurant/dining, pub, bar or club, open late, gay/lesbian/bisexual, as well as drink (and/or food) menu/pricing for the selected venue. A user-selectable button or other feature is desirably located on the venue information screen, as well, so that a user may initiate a basic purchase., 248595=[0145] The use of RFID in a system consistent with the invention can also enable location-based services, by combining the networked venue claims terminals 1726 with RFID technology installed in participating venues. The configuration of such services includes the RFID reader 1723 positioned near the door of the venue, which notes the entrance and exit of end users who are both carrying their RFID card 1721 and who have agreed to participate in location-based services. The RFID reader 1723 relays (e.g., via Bluetooth) this information to the venue claims terminal 1726, where it is further relayed to the central server (not shown), establishing a complete \u201cmap\u201d of which individuals are in which venues in real or near-real time. To protect user data privacy, the system may be configured so as not to store such information permanently and/or to overwrite or erase location data relating to an individual when the RFID sensor 1723 reads the card ID for the second time, indicating the individual has left the establishment., 221785=[0123] An encoded form is a form accessed via a unique URL that the system provides. The encoding should be used to dynamically create new tables in the database that will enrich the information associated with various users. The encoding process may be expanded to include error-checking parameters associated with each form item. The form may include the following exemplary fields: general information (e.g., form title, which can be used as the database table label; co-sponsor logo; and number of questions) and information per question (e.g., question label, which may be used as the table column label; text of question; and answer encoding type with accompanying text, such as single answer-number, single answer-text string, and encoded list providing number of items and item labels). Exemplary screens for designing a survey 1200, 1300 are illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13, and fields specified may include both general information and information per question. General information might include, e.g.: survey title (can be used as database table label), date survey goes out, date survey will be closed, rewards points (per question or for the survey as a whole), target specific user profile (otherwise survey will go to all users who have opted in), survey text (to go in the email asking the end user to respond), number of prizes (0 if none; any other value causes the system to select this number of end users who have completed the survey as winners); and cosponsor logo. Information per question might include, e.g.: question label (used as table column label), text of question, and answer encoding type (e.g., single answer-number, single answer-text string, and encoded list (provide number of items and item labels). By providing the foregoing information, the survey text may automatically be flowed into the encoded form design template and can be assigned its own unique URL, and an end user might see the survey as shown in the exemplary screen view 1400 of FIG. 14. Because of the tight encoding associated with surveys, each survey can be described as a new data table (or the extension of an existing data table) in the database. This new table will be dynamically linked to the existing user profile tables in order to expand the number of fields associated with each user. In addition, new table column headings may become available in the list of parameters used in future profile construction and data searching/mining/analysis operations (described in further detail hereinbelow)., 202426=[0105] It should be recognized that a listing should typically not become active (and be publicly available) until the system administrator approves the venue's initial registration. After this initial approval, a venue can access and change venue modifiable items at any time via the venue web interface (this process is described in further detail hereinbelow). As illustrated in the exemplary screen views 900, 1000 of FIGS. 9 and 10, items in the venue listing may include, e.g.: venue name, address, telephone, email (if any), nearest subway or bus stop (if any), website URL (if any), hours of operation, brief description, venue category information, products/pricing schedule (some may be preset and locked by administrator), daily event information (e.g., drink specials/happy hour, events schedules), cover charge (if any), and admissions/other policies (21+ etc). Venue category information may be selected from lists preset by the administrator, and may include, e.g., type (club, bar, restaurant), typical patron type (frat boy, pretty girl), events types (live music, DJs), and awards (Michelin stars, reviews). It should be noted that, for certain fields, it may be desirable that only the system administrator be able to modify certain fields in the venue directory, e.g., the brief description of the venue., 288324=[0166] Exemplary main menu options, in one embodiment of the invention, are: home (for login and registration, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2300 of FIG. 23), account, browse venue directory, make a remote purchase, unredeemed claims, friends, and rewards program., 293345=[0172] An exemplary friends menu may provide the following selectable options: instant reciprocity settings, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2700 of FIG. 27 (which may include, e.g., select/replace my favorite venue and/or product), \u201chint-hint\u201d submenu (wherein the user broadcasts a message to someone else to purchase something for him/her), and a friends list submenu. The \u201chint-hint\u201d submenu provides options to add, delete and modify an event, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2800 of FIG. 28, which may comprise the following five exemplary fields: type (birthday, anniversary, custom text), reminder message, selected venue and product (automatically fills in instant reciprocity values), recipients, and send date (with an option to make it recurring). Alternatively, a hint-hint screen may appear as shown in the exemplary screen view 2810 of FIG. 28a. As shown in FIG. 29, an exemplary screen view 2900 comprises a list of scheduled events. The friends list submenu may comprise the following options: settings and view friends list. Settings for the friends list may include making the user's profile public/private (when a user adds friends or imports, the system looks for messaging address matches with other system users, and if it finds a match and the profile is public, the friend record will be replaced by a pointer to the friend's, i.e., the other user's, information, thereby allowing for dynamic reflection of changes) and whether to automatically add anyone who purchases a product for the user to his friends list. The view friends list functions (as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 3000 of FIG. 30) may include add a friend (with fields for name, one or two messaging addresses, with the primary address indicated, and venue/drink they like), import addresses from external address book (e.g., Microsoft Entourage or Outlook, wherein fields needed by the system are extracted, i.e., name, messaging addresses, cell phone, secondary email), delete a friend, and making, editing, and deleting groups of friends. In addition to manual entry of information into the friends list, a drag-and-drop interface may be provided for adding single or multiple entries to the friends list from other software packages, e.g., Microsoft Entourage or Outlook. At a minimum, it is contemplated that the following exemplary fields would be part of each entry in the friends list: first name, last name, email messaging address and/or phone messaging address. Additional functionality may be provided at the friends list menu, such as a graphic of a map with dots plotted thereon in each city, country, region, or neighborhood where the user has a friend or group member, along with the display of a list of all friends and groups, as shown in the exemplary screen view 2710 of FIG. 27a. Other functionality may include a feature for locating a friend who is at a venue (by using RFID find-a-friend to bring up a list of all friends found and then viewing a plot of them on a global map). An exemplary displayed list of friends and/or groups is shown in the exemplary screen view 2720 of FIG. 27b. From the friends list, the user may select a friend and then perform functions such as seeing their location and instant reciprocity information (if the user has permission to do so), initiating a purchase for the friend (including pre-population of fields to the extent possible), editing the listing for that friend, requesting permission to see their location/instant reciprocity information, and deleting the friend from the list. From the groups list, the user may initiate a group purchase (including pre-population of fields to the extent possible), edit the group (i.e., add/delete members), or delete the group. Other friends functionality may include changing sharing/permissions settings (e.g., automatically granting permission to anyone who has made a purchase for the user, or making the user visible, i.e., granting permission to all users in the system), approving or rejecting pending permission approvals, turning all approvals on/off, and turning an individual approval on/off., 289693=[0168] An exemplary account menu may provide the following selectable options: profile and payment. The profile submenu, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2400 of FIG. 24, provides the following selectable options: name, user ID, password, WAP client PIN, and phone/email messaging addresses. Multiple messaging addresses may be specified, and one should desirably be a valid phone or email messaging address, the primary address for receiving claims, and a preferred address may be marked as such. The payment submenu shows current balances and provides the following selectable options: add/delete payment information, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2500 of FIG. 25 (e.g., credit card; up to 2 may be specified, with primary indicated, wherein each payment type has a pin # used as a confirmation and to access), purchase more credits, set up automatic debit (on/off, recharge to b when balance goes below c, or automatically charge d each month to primary payment type), and transaction history, as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2600 of FIG. 26 (e.g., last 50 purchases, unsent claims, recurring claims). The transaction history selection may further provide options to repeat this purchase or make this purchase recurring, or modify (can only be done if claim is unsent or recurring), edit, or cancel a purchase. An alternative transaction history screen view 2, 255586=[0152] It is contemplated that a system administrator controls the structure and operating parameters of the system as well as daily system operation and management. For day-to-day system operations, the system administrator may access most functionality directly through a web interface. The interface may be organized into five main categories (as illustrated in the exemplary screen views 1800, 1900 of FIGS. 18 and 19): account (which includes editing/deleting current administrators, and name and password, and adding a new administrator), system setup, user management, marketing/mining, and system management., 335422=[0237] Alternatively, the aforesaid functional components may be embodied by a plurality of separate computer processes (e.g., generated via dBase\u2122, Xbase\u2122, MS Access\u2122 or other \u201cflat file\u201d type database management systems or products) running on IBM-type, Intel Pentium\u2122 or RISC microprocessor-based personal computers networked together via conventional networking hardware and software and including such other additional conventional hardware and software as may be necessary to permit these functional components to achieve the stated functionalities. In this alternative configuration, since such personal computers typically may be unable to run full-scale relational database engines of the types presented above, a non-relational flat file \u201ctable\u201d (not shown) may be included in at least one of the networked personal computers to represent at least portions of data stored by a system according to the present invention. These personal computers may run the Unix, Microsoft Windows NT/2000\u2122 or Windows 95/98/NT/ME/CE/2000/XP\u2122 operating systems. The aforesaid functional components of a system according to the present invention may also comprise a combination of the above two configurations (e.g., by computer program processes running on a combination of personal computers, RISC systems, mainframes, symmetric or parallel computer systems, and/or other appropriate hardware and software, networked together via appropriate wide- and local-area network hardware and software)., 288653=[0167] In embodiments of the present invention requiring user registration, the home menu may only support end users who have previously registered in the system. In this scenario, unregistered users and recipients of drinks may be guided to a link where they can \u201ctake a tour of the system\u201d or register (both touring and registration may first require that a user certifies he or she is of legal drinking age in an alcoholic beverage implementation of the present invention, using an interface such as that illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2310 of FIG. 23a). Also, new promotions, announcements, advertisements, and other information may be displayed at this menu. Cookies may be used to permit registered users to skip the home page entirely and bookmark subpages. Appropriate functionality may be provided for users who have forgotten their userID and/or password, wherein the system looks up the user by primary messaging address and sends a new password to that account, 245336=[0143]FIG. 17b illustrates an exemplary system 1720 for RFID implementation for a single venue, in one embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the system includes a venue claims terminal 1726 (described in further detail hereinbelow) and a remotely located RFID reader 1723 having an antenna 1722. Bluetooth interfaces 1724, 1725 are provided for both the venue claims terminal 1726 and RFID reader 1723, so that these devices can wirelessly communicate with one another. The RFID reader 1723 and/or antenna 1722 may be placed near a doorway at the venue, so as to capture the comings and goings of end users carrying RFID cards 1721. In this scenario, after reading the cards 1721 of people coming in and going out, the RFID reader 1723 then transmits that information to the venue claims terminal 1726, e.g., using a Bluetooth connection. The venue claims terminal 1726 in turn can then upload or download this information to the central system (not shown), as needed. It is contemplated that an additional RFID reader 1728 and antenna 1727 having an extremely short range may further be supplied to the venue claims terminal 1726, e.g., to permit a patron to hand his or her RFID card to the bartender, who can wave it in front of the additional RFID reader 1728 to retrieve the patron's claim or to charge to the patron's card by using it as a proxy for his or her stored credit card or other payment method. Passive RFID cards 1721 would need to be distributed to end users, which may be facilitated, e.g., through various promotions, such that the RFID card 1721 acts as a token that identifies the user to the system. The user may have to enter a number printed on the card to \u201cactivate\u201d it and/or specify user preferences (e.g., whether the user wants the card to be useable with the \u201cfind a friend\u201d feature). This number, which is then read from the card, can then be linked to a particular user. In certain embodiments, data could also be written to the card, although only being able to read data from the card is sufficient to take advantage of basic RFID functionality., 333915=[0236] Clients may include mobile and non-mobile devices. Mobile devices that may be employed in the present invention include personal digital assistant (PDA) style computers, e.g., as manufactured by Palm, Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif., and other computers running the Palm\u2122 operating system, Windows CE\u2122 handheld computers, or other handheld computers (possibly including a wireless modem), as well as wireless or cellular telephones (including GSM phones, J2ME and WAP-enabled phones, Internet-enabled phones and data-capable smart phones, e.g., the iMODE phone available from NTT Docomo of Tokyo, Japan), one- and two-way paging and messaging devices, laptop computers, etc. Other telephonic network technologies that may be used as potential service channels in a system consistent with the invention include \u201c2.5G\u201d cellular network technologies such as GPRS and EDGE, as well as \u201c3G\u201d technologies such as CDMA1\ufffdRTT and WCDMA2000. Although mobile devices are preferred, traditionally non-mobile communications devices are also contemplated by the invention, including personal computers, Internet appliances, set-top boxes, landline telephones, etc. Clients may also comprise a PC that supports Apple Macintosh\u2122, Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/ME/CE/2000/XP\u2122, a UNIX Motif workstation platform, or other computer capable of TCP/IP or other network-based interaction. In one embodiment, no software other than a web browser may be required on the client platform., 226072=[0127] The system may alternatively or additionally be configured such that a user creating a marketing campaign provides information to the system by following a series of prompts or using pre-built campaign templates provided by the administrator, whereby the system determines the appropriate selection of functional blocks and automatically creates the marketing campaign. For example, information for which the campaign creator might be prompted to create an exemplary \u201cpush\u201d campaign (as illustrated in the pre-built templates of the exemplary screen views 1600, 1700 of FIGS. 16 and 17) might include: campaign name (internal name for the campaign), target parameters (sets the parameters describing the target recipients), get estimate (provides estimate of the cost of campaign based on current statistics; result may vary from the estimate, especially in the case of a time differential between campaign creation and launch), set campaign cap (caps the price spent on campaign), set delivery date, set ongoing/one-time (if ongoing will set schedule of frequency), campaign type (plain text or html email/messaging, or both), campaign category\u2014coupon or message, campaign text (fields for designing the campaign; these obey the limits, such as number of text characters, for the type selected above; a designer is able to cut and paste HTML and graphics into an HTML email text field), show preview (shows preview of campaign, including administrative wrapper that goes around all items), and how the campaign results will be processed. With regard to the method of processing the campaign results, the system may support the following exemplary options: set return address for response (can be URL), and no return address (response information included in message body as link or other). The system then takes all of the entered information, determines the appropriate functional blocks and values, and creates an appropriate campaign comprising of a set of functional blocks. For example, a template might be permitted for a venue to \u201cpush message (event notification) to recent patrons (last 30 days)\u201d. In this scenario, the template would automatically set the WHO to internal initiation via profile construction, selecting those patrons who have redeemed a claim at the venue in the last 30 days. The WHEN would automatically be set to one-time, but might still prompt for the date the message goes out. The WHAT block would automatically be set to 1-way broadcast. It should be noted that, although the template may automatically make block selections and preset some of the values for variables associated with the blocks, other items, such as the message text, may still need to be filled out by the agent selecting the template., 256260=[0153] System setup may include features for a system administrator to establish the system's initial structure and operating parameters, and once the system is operating, most of these settings will not be able to be changed. Exemplary features (as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2000 of FIG. 20) include: interface, design of user registrations, design of distributed directory listing, and system parameters. The system interface may have an editable style sheet, color palette and logo area, and options may be provided for editing the style sheet, color palette, and logo (including uploading a new logo and choice of placement). Design of user registrations may include functionality for the administrator to construct registrations for each user type by selecting from a list of supported fields. In the case of the end user, there may be two registrations, one to use the system and a separate registration for the rewards program. Custom fields may also be supported. In addition to selecting and ordering the fields, the administrator may provide the following exemplary information for each field: whether the field is required on registration; for numeric fields, minimum and maximum values (if any), for text fields, minimum and maximum number of characters, and for encoded fields, and number of responses and labels. For the design of distributed directory listing, the administrator may construct a directory listing by selecting fields from a list. Venue items in the listing may automatically be included in the venue registration. The system may also support custom listing fields. The following exemplary information may be provided for each item selected: if not implicit, the user type who can modify this field; certain fields associated with encoded responses that may require the administrator to set the number of encoded responses and attach labels to the responses; for custom fields, the administrator may have to supply the field name, the data type and associated encodings if any; whether the field will be preset with a response, and if preset, whether it is locked; whether the item is required or not; and an important part of this process will be structuring the fields describing the products that can be purchased through the system. The administrator may encode the product subcategories. When a slot for a product is added to the listing, the administrator can attach it to a particular subcategory or let a venue put a product of any type into the field. System parameters (which may be subdivided into general, campaign, purchase, and account parameters) may also be set by the administrator. For example, general parameters might include countries banned from participating in the system. Campaign parameters might include the total number of open campaigns allowed, the days in advance all campaigns must be scheduled (so that the system administrator can receive each campaign mailing in advance of the community), and for each user group (venue, member, third-party marketer), the number of campaigns allowed per individual, the base cost per person per campaign for MMS, SMS, and e-mail, and the additional cost per variable for MMS, SMS, and e-mail. Purchase parameters might include the surcharge per transaction, the length of time in days before an open claim is closed (90 days), the number of days before a claim is closed to send reminder notice (i.e., 0 days means no notice will be sent), and the number of bad transactions (or bad cards) before an end user is banned from the system. Purchase parameters may also include, for those users who are new (e.g., in the first month of service), a cap on the user's first transaction, a cap on any single transaction thereafter, and a cap for total purchases in a 48-hour period; and for users who do not store cards on file but have made a purchase that cleared more than a month ago, and a cap for any single transaction, a cap for total purchases in a 48-hour period; and for those users who have stored cards on file and made a purchase with the currently stored card more than a month ago, a cap for any single transaction and a cap for total purchases in a 48-hour period. Account parameters may include, for each user group (venue, member, third-party marketer), the registration fee (if any), monthly fee (if any), the frequency of account reconciliation (probably every 2 weeks), the minimum value of an account balance to lead to a transaction, the maximum coupon debit allowed (coupons may be good for up to, e.g., a maximum of 90 days), and the maximum outstanding account balance (wherein, when exceeded, either immediate reconciliation or a freeze on account might occur)., 209176=[0112] As the exemplary screen view 1710 of FIG. 17a illustrates, the campaign manager may be embodied as a graphical \u201cdigital dashboard\u201d through which system agents can view, search and edit campaigns, as well as create and schedule new campaigns. A campaign may be created from scratch using functional campaign blocks, by specifying the three primary traits: identify WHO the campaign will be directed at, define WHEN the campaign or campaign elements will launch and be in effect; and construct the WHAT of the campaign. In the exemplary screen view 1710, the campaign creator has already set the WHO and WHEN blocks of the campaign and is now working on detailing a WHAT block (circled):, 261007=[0154] User management functionality may include the following exemplary features for interacting with system users (as illustrated in the exemplary screen view 2100 of FIG. 21): manage approvals (an interface allowing the administrator to review and grant/deny items for approval that can be viewed by category/type, e.g., venue/third-party marketer registration, push campaigns, rewards, closing of accounts), manage accounts (an interface allowing the administrator to manually activate/freeze/close a user's account, wherein a deactivated account will fail at login; in addition, there may be a list of banned messaging addresses, wherein if the address corresponds with a user account, the account is automatically frozen), and communications (an interface allowing the administrator to select user group or subset category to deliver a message to, wherein messages are be processed to the default messaging contact address associated with the user record)., 287687=[0165] A menu of exemplary features is illustrated in the exemplary screen views 2300-3000 of FIGS. 23 through 30. It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that not all features will be available on all clients, and some features are conditional on the basis of such criteria as whether the user is registered and logged in (or using the system anonymously), whether the user currently has open claims in the system, and whether the user has entered information required to activate some of the more advanced functionality (as discussed in further detail hereinbelow)., 262020=[0155] Marketing and mining functionality may include the following exemplary tools for marketing to users and mining system data (as illustrated in the exemplary screen views 1200-1600 of FIGS. 12 through 16): promotions (including an itemized list of promotions, wherein the user can view active or all, and can modify a service that has not been delivered, delete/cancel a service that has not been delivered, user the service as a template for new, and view summary statistics for services that have been delivered), create a new promotion as either a push campaign (specifying a coupon, message and/or survey) or a reward system, and data mining (including capabilities to view/search data, export data, and perform analysis and mining (described in further detail hereinbelow).}",

Thus, the present invention is intended to cover all such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and broad scope of the invention. [0240] A system consistent with the present invention may interact with established payment networks, e.g., the Automated Clearing House (ACH) to provide payment options such as ACH debits, credit or procurement card payments, and/or paper checks. Paper checks may be generated internally or by an external software module, wherein an output file in a format capable of being read by the external module may be generated. Payment by a payer system user using a credit or procurement card may also be effected, to be processed by Internet or other means. In this scenario, additional security levels may be included, e.g., for initiating credit card payments (along with a dollar amount limit) and approving credit card payments, and such appropriate credit card payment processing functionality as may be appropriate may be included, as well. [0239] In one embodiment, source code may be written in an object-oriented programming language using relational databases. Such an embodiment may include the use of programming languages such as C++ and toolsets such",
