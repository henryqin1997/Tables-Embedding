Many other applications and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent in light of this disclosure and the following claims [0130] In another aspect of the present invention, a multi-module switch can act as a principal switch, with the primary blade performing Domain_ID assignment for the multi-module switch and for other external switches. The multi-module switch can also operate as non-principal switch, with the primary blade requesting a Domain_ID assignment on behalf of the multi-module switch and informing the other modules of the assignment. [0129] In one aspect of the present invention, Domain_ID may be dynamically assigned. [0128] When the local switch domain is rejected in step S1104, the switch module operates with the EBP local switch Domain_ID and in step S1105, the switch module isolates external E-Ports. [0127] In step S1103, the switch module sends DIA information to external E-Port ISLs to notify neighboring switches as specified in FC-SW-2. [0126] Turning in detail to FIG. 11, in step S1101, a non-primary blade moves to Domain_ID assignment. The non-primary blade waits for an EBP indicating that the local switch Domain_ID is either accepted in step S1102 or rejected in steps S1104. When the local switch domain is",
