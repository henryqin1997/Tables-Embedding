It has been found that a membrane with a thickness of 0.05 inches (0.127 cm), and a porosity of 50 \u03bcm or less, preferably of approximately 10 \u03bcm, provides very good empirical test results. More specifically, tests were performed using a membrane of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene with an average porosity of 10 \u03bcm and a thickness of 0.05 inches (0.127 cm), manufactured by Interflo, Inc., material part number 38-244-2B, lot number 071797. The membrane was injection molded and had the configuration shown in FIG. 2, with the addition of four additional screw holes (not shown), two of which were located so as to be aligned with corresponding holes on opposite sides of first and second ends 31 and 32 of housing 6. (The purpose of the four screw holes is to fasten the assembly to a printed circuit board.), 14519=This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/958,160 which was filed on Oct. 28, 1997, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that still further changes and modifications in the actual concepts described herein can readily be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. The above description of this invention is directed primarily to the preferred embodiments, and specifically to preferred embodiments used to detect carbon dioxide. Further modifications are also possible in alternative embodiments without departing form the inventive concept. Thus, for example, an NDIR gas analyzer could include two windows, the second window thermally isolating the source from the waveguide, so long as a sufficient temperature gradient is still created between gas within the waveguide and gas within the diffusion space. Another example of a further modification is to use a non-linear optical path, such as an optical path described in either of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,060,508 and 5,341,214. The diffusion-type NDIR gas analyzer 200 of FIG. 5 is another preferred embodiment of the invention. The FIG. 5 embodiment has a housing 201 in which a specularly reflective waveguide 202 is formed. The housing 201 may be made of any suitable material including metal or plastic. In one embodiment, the housing 201 is constructed of gold plated plastic to enhance reflectivity and transmission of light through the waveguide. The waveguide forms an optical path from the infrared source 203 through the waveguide 202 to",
