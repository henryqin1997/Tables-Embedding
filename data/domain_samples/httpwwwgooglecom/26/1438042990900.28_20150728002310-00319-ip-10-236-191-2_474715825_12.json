Of these, DRGs 148, 415, 416 (sepsis), 475, and 483 represented nearly fifty percent of the records. See the \u201cDRG Guide,\u201d 1997 Ed., Medicode, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah 1996., 104348=As a result, the selection vectors that select one type of septic shock over another type also correspond to different treatment costs. It was found during the validation procedure that the first selection vector (containing patient condition codes for septic shock or toxic shock) was associated with an increase in treatment costs of about $2000 on average over the cost of care for sepsis. The remaining eight septic shock selection vectors all similarly predicted a large increase in treatment costs over the cost for simple sepsis., 47001=A \u201cpatient condition code\u201d refers to a code employed to specify a patient condition for entry in an electronic discharge record. The code may take the form of a text string or a numerical string or other appropriate format. Patient condition codes are typically specified by a government agency or other large organization. Often, such codes are provided for the purpose of calculating or determining a reimbursement level to a health care organization for a particular patient. Examples of patient condition codes include DRG codes, ICCS codes, ICD-8 codes, ICD-9 codes, ICD-10 codes, CPT-4 codes, etc. The ICD-9 codes are presented in \u201cICD-9.CM,\u201d Fifth Edition, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1996) and CPT-4 codes are presented in \u201cAMA Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology CPT 97,\u201d CPT Intellectual Property Series, Chicago, Ill., 1996, both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 70587=After the selection vectors have been selected based upon the analysis of the clinical data and the corresponding discharge records, those selection vectors should be validated by a statistically rigorous process. See step 211. Many such processes are known in the art. Generally, they will include a statistically significant sample of data unrelated to the data employed to generate the selection vectors. Examples of suitable validation techniques include analysis of variance, linear regression, logistic regression, probit and tobit modeling, CART (classification and regression trees), neural network techniques, entropy mini-max, and SMILES. The entropy mini-max process is described in Christensen, Ronald, \u201cEntropy Minimax Multivariate Statistical Modeling-I: Theory,\u201d pages 231-277, and the SMILES process is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/784,206, filed on Jan. 15, 1997, naming Minor et al. as inventors, and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PREDICTING THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES,\u201d both of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. After the selection vector at issue has been validated, the process 200 is completed at a stopping point 213., 124606=The coefficients have units of US dollars. Thus, if the selection vector is present in a record, $1955 will be subtracted from the cost of treating the patient. If the hospital is located in the Northeastern part of the country, the associated term of the expression contributes $3406.37 to the cost of treating the patient. In the case of a complete blood count laboratory test performed once, the average cost of treating a patient increases by $1001.97. When the complete blood count test is performed twice, the average cost jumps by $2003.94, and so on., 33420=All risk adjustment tools model some combination of demographic and/or health status data. See \u201cRisk Adjustment\u201d by C. Lee and D. Rogal, produced for The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, March 1997. Demographic models generally include some or all of the following variables: age, sex, family status, geographic location, and welfare status. Measures of health status can include survey data of health, diagnoses, and data reflecting prior utilization. Health status models may include demographic variables as predictors of health., 68105=In a preferred embodiment, the selection vectors are generated after all patient condition codes in the electronic discharge records are ranked according to frequency of occurrence. The ranked list is then analyzed (automatically or manually) with physician guidelines available in the field. To generate vectors for sepsis or septic shock, one can employ guidelines provided in Bone et al., \u201cAmerican College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference: Definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of innovative therapies in sepsis,\u201d Critical Care Medicine, 864-874, June 1992. The patient condition codes comprising the selection vectors can be generated from the list of codes in the clinical sample with the aid of a statistical technique such as analysis of variance, linear regression, logistic regression, CART (classification and regression trees), neural network techniques, entropy mini-max, and SMILES (similarity-metric least squares)., 100810=The selection vectors were validated by applying them to a very large data set of discharge records 311 which included records for both patients with and without septic shock (e.g. patients admitted for heart disease, abortions, and other condition unrelated to sepsis). In fact, data set 311 included 27 percent of all hospital admissions in the US for the year 1995 (corresponding to millions of hospital admissions). From this large data set, 1000 discharge records were selected for each month of 1995. These 12 sets of 1000 records each (subset 313) were selected by matching the selection vectors within group 309 to the records of data set 311. Thus, it was believed that the records within subset 313 were limited to records for patients that had septic shock.}",
