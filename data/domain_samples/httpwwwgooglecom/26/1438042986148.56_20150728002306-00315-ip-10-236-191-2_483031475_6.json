In particular and without limitation, terms such as inside, outside, right, left, etc. and derivatives thereof have been used for purposes of clarity in describing the invention only and it is to be understood that particular orientations will depend on upon the use of the invention in a particular circumstance. Moreover, certain modifications or alternatives may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon reading of this specification, all of which are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. FIG. 3 illustrates a passive antenna 50 retained within a block of styrene foam 51 although of course any shape may be utilized which does not interfere with the operation or ease of placement of the antenna. Utilization of a single piece or block of foam, and the encapsulation of the antenna in the foam as the foam is formed or made, ensures protection of the antenna from the elements since there is no adhesive sealant involved. Additionally, such an embodiment results in a simpler and therefore less expensive construction, as the encapsulation can occur during the manufacture of the foam. Turning now to FIG. 2, another embodiment is seen. The antenna 40",
