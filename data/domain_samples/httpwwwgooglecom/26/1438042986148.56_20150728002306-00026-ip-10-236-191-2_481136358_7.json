    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, while there have been described what are presently believed to be the preferred embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that various changes and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it is intended to claim all such changes and modifications which fall within the scope of the invention. The warp yarns in the outer ply which are floating over 3 picks, are raised from the fabric, forming a filamentous velour surface. Longitudinal compliance on the order of 25-50% can be achieved by this method. The prosthesis is heat-set on mandrels of the final desired inside diameter. Typically, the outside diameter of the mandrel is equal to the diameter of the final prostheses. The tubing is woven to be 5-15% over-size so that it can be mounted onto a mandrel and shrink fitted to an exact diameter. Heat-setting can take place in a steam heated autoclave at about 250\ufffd F. for about 5-10 minutes or in a convection oven at 250-400\ufffd F. for about 10-30 minutes. Subsequent to weaving the prosthesis, the material is scoured in a basic solution of warm water (e.g., 150\ufffd F.) and cleaning detergent. It is then rinsed to remove the cleaning agents. The scouring process allows the woven tubing to fully retract by relieving the stress induced by weaving the elastomeric warp yarns in a stressed state.",
