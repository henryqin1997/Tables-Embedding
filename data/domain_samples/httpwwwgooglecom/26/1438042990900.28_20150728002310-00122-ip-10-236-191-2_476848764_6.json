Variations from the embodiment can be made by one skilled in the art without varying from the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. For example, the device described and shown can be used for direct illumination of a sign, which can be made sufficiently translucent to provide al illuminated sign. With a back light illuminating structure in accordance with the invention now small signs can be provided with a \"halo\" effect. A uniform illumination, temperature and moisture tolerant sign illuminator is obtained which is easier to install by a user or installer. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 support brackets 6 support the light diffusing plate 5 and its light reflector 4 so as to keep the outside or back surface of plate 5 flush with the back edge of sign 1. The frequency or spacing between fibers 3 is determined by the size and shape of, and the desired intensity of light from, the signs or letters or logos 1 pertaining to a specific application. The fibers 3 penetrate through the reflective layer 4 to partially imbed in the light diffusing layer 5 where the luminous end of the fibers 3 will be facing out towards the outside or front surface 11 as seen in FIG. 3. The light fibers 3 can be held in",
