The radio transmission system according to claim 1 adapted to accomplish transmission from a multichannel transmitter to groups of one-channel receivers each receiver group adapted to one channel particular to that group, comprising transmitting means providing a transmitted signal which includes at least two voice message single sideband channel signals, and one unmodulated auxiliary frequency signal for simultaneous transmission to at least two receiver groups, said channels chosen out of a number of channels, said message signals being transmitted",
