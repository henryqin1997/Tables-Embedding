It is appreciated the skilled person will be able to provide numerous modifications and variations within the scope of the present invention upon consideration of the detailed description and the accompanying drawings. The present invention is defined by the following claims. FIG. 6 shows a system 750 including three chips 751, 752 and 753 each having ISP capability daisy chained in accordance with the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, the pins of chips 751-753 are connected in common. Likewise, the SCLK and mode pins of each chip 751-753 are connected in common. The SDI and SDO pins of each chip are, however, connected in a daisy chain fashion. Yet, this configuration does not restrict the same in-system programming to be applied to all three chips 751-753 simultaneously. In order to program chip 752, for example, the ISP is placed in logic low, thereby placing all three chips 751-753 in ISP mode. However, the FLOWTHRU command is shifted into both the command registers of chips 751 and 753 to allow in-system programming to be applied only to chip 752. Since the instruction-based state machine has only three states 401, 402 and 403, and programming in the ISP mode is accomplished using commands of an instruction set, programming is much more structured and simplified over the prior art, which",
