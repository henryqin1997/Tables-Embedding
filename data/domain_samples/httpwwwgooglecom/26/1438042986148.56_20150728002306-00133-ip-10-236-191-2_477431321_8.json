Other variations are possible. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be determined not by the embodiments illustrated above, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. Thus, a system and methods for managing a fleet of vehicles has been shown that allows multiple geographically dispersed locations to monitor and track vehicle service status, including generating a prediction of vehicle availability. In a preferred embodiment, local communications terminal 103 reviews service event notifications 220 for vehicles whose number of repair/service actions exceed a pre-defined threshold (block 385). If the repair threshold has been exceeded, then regional communications terminal provides multiple breakdown advisory 215 as described above for block 387. In a preferred embodiment, the pre-defined threshold for multiple breakdown advisory is two service event notifications 220 within the last sixty-day period. If the threshold is exceeded, multiple breakdown advisory 215 provides the user the option of retrieving and displaying or printing the service event notifications 220 associated with the vehicle. In a preferred embodiment, regional communications terminal 102 determines if the repair/service action has not occurred by the time specified by availability prediction 260. Specifically, if the repair/service action is not accomplished within 24 hours of",
