The cooled mixture was filtered and the solvent removed in vacuo, and the residue was triturated with three 100 mL portions of hot hexane, three 100 mL portions of hot ethyl acetate, then taken up in 100 mL chloroform and filtered. Removal of solvent gave a solid that was recrystallized from a mixture of 15 mL methyl alcohol and 7 mL of an 85:15 (v/v) solution of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate. The resulting solid was dried at 0.1 mm Hg to give 0.43 g of the desired cryptand., 134277=Crosslinked Cuprophan\u2122 membranes were immersed in a solution of 120 g 70% HDA in 2.0 L deionized water in a 4L beaker at room temperature for 105 minutes. Care was taken to remove trapped air bubbles by swirling the sheets with a glass rod. The sheets were removed from the beaker and rinsed five times with 2000 mL deionized water to wash off excess HDA, then soaked in deionized water. (At this stage, the sheets can be immediately used in the next step. Alternatively, the sheets can be stored overnight in deionized water/acid bath (1 mL 12 N HCl in 2 L deionized water).), 203848=After solvent was stripped, approximately 1 g of a yellow tacky oil was obtained. To the oil were added 60 ml chloroform and 20 ml brine, and this combination was mixed. The organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate. Stripping the solvent gave 0.85 g of oily product. This was purified first by flash chromatography through a 2 cm\ufffd6 cm column of aluminum oxide powder (using 70 ml methylene chloride as the eluting solvent) to leave 0.65 g of product. This material was then carefully passed through a second column of aluminum oxide using a 1:2 mixture of methylene chloride/hexanes to give 370 mg (46%) of essentially pure product, a sticky yellow powder., 121662=The solution was reduced and the residue was chromatographically separated on neutral deactivated alumina. The diiodo starting material was first eluted with CH2 Cl2. Next, the product was eluted with 5% ethanol in CH2 Cl2. Finally, 5% acetic acid in ethanol was used to remove any FCCC-acid on the column. Alternatively, crude FCCC-ester can be recrystallized by dissolving in hot methanol and adding a 5:1 mixture of cyclohexane and ethyl acetate, from which solid FCCC-ester is obtained. In this procedure, column chromatography is not necessary., 212324=An infrared spectrum of the functionalized polymer film was acquired to confirm the reaction (i.e., the disappearance of the 1720 cm-1 absorbance characteristic of the COOH group). Gel permeation chromatography of the polymer showed that the molecular weight was essentially unchanged from that of the PVC-COOH starting material (i.e., 160,000 to 220,000 depending on the PVC-COOH lot)., 130108=Alternatively, partially hydrolyzed azlactone-functionalized HPPE membrane was added to 50 mL methylene chloride containing 10 mL DIC, 480 mg HOBt, and 1 mL DIEA. The flask was gently agitated on a rotary mixer for about six hours, after which time the membrane was removed and washed extensively with methylene chloride. Regeneration of azlactone functionality was confirmed by the presence of a peak at 1823 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum, 114752=The residual oil was chromatographically separated on silica gel (using 4:1 heptane-ethyl acetate) to the two products. Yield of ethyl-5-methyl-2-furoate was 5.12 g. H1 NMR (CDCl3): d 1.38 (t, 3H, CH3); d 2.40 (s, 3H, CH3); d 4.38 (q, 2H, CH2); d 6.11 (d, 1H, Ar--H); d 7.07 (d, 1H, Ar--H)., 193231=This method is a standard Knoevenagel condensation on the 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde of Example 29 and is based on the methods of Balaiah et al., Proc. Indian Acad Sci., 16A, 68-82 (1942) (Chem. Abs., 37, 1429 (1943)); Borsche et al., Chem. Ber., 85, 198-202 (1952); Fukui et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 35, 1321-23 (1962)., 138214=For the potassium sensor tests, GaN LEDs 110 from Nichia Chemical Industries, Tokushima, Japan, or Toyoda Gosei Co., Ltd (under the brand name Ledtronics\u2122) were amplitude modulated at a 30 kHz carrier frequency, a burst duration of 0.2 seconds, a repetition rate of 5 sec, and an average output power of 2.5 mW. The light was focused, passed through a bandpass excitation filter 112 (390 nm\ufffd25 nm; %T=52%; out-of-band blocking =0.001%T; available from SpectroFilm; Woburn, Mass.), and refocused into a fiber optic cable 114. At the distal end of the cable was a CDI S400 optical head 116. A randomized fiber bundle 118 returned the modulated fluorescent return to a bandpass emission filter 120 (475\ufffd35 nm; %T=64%; out-of-band blocking =0.001%T) such as is available from SpectroFilm. The filtered optical signal was then focused onto the active region of an OPTO-8\u2122 photomultiplier tube detector 122 or a S1337-33-BR\u2122 photodiode detector (both available from Hamamatsu Corp.; Bridgewater, N.J.). A small fraction of the excitation fibers 124 were directly routed to the detector assembly and attenuated with a neutral density filter 126 to provide a reference optical signal from the LED., 36306=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/521,869 filed Aug. 31, 1995, now abandoned, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/140,257 filed Oct. 21, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,743., 180998=A solution of 1.2 g 6,7-bis(2-iodoethoxy)-3- 2\"-(5\"-carboethoxy)furyl!coumarin (from Example 4), 0.4197 g 1,4,10-trioxa-7,13-diazacylopentadecane, and 1.019 g Na2 CO3 in 160 mL acetonitrile was stirred and refluxed under nitrogen for 36 days. The cooled mixture was filtered and the solvent removed in vacuo, and the residue was triturated with three 100 mL portions hot hexane, three 100 mL portions hot ethyl acetate, then taken up in 100 mL chloroform and filtered. Removal of solvent gave a solid that was recrystallized from a mixture of 15 mL and 7 mL of an 85:15 (v/v) solution of cyclo-hexane/ethyl acetate. The resulting solid was dried at 0.1 mm Hg to give 0.49 g of the desired cryptand., 133742=Frames were placed on all eight plates and clamped so that the crosslinking solution could be poured on the sheets and retained. The solution was poured onto each plate (about 100 mL) to crosslink for 50-60 minutes. The plate was gently swirled three times in this period to ensure that fresh solution came in contact with the Cuprophan\u2122 sheet. Thereafter, the Cuprophan\u2122 membranes were cut along the frame and rinsed three times with 2000 mL deionized water., 114320=The procedure of Tsuboi et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 60, 1907-12 (1987), was used to oxidize ethyl sorbate by selenium dioxide to give a mixture of ethyl-t-methyl-2-furoate and ethyl-5-methyl-2-selenophenecarboxylate., 53873=In one embodiment, the present invention teaches a class of coumarocryptands. The coumaro 2.2.2!-cryptand ionophore is, in the absence of Pb+2 or Ba+2, highly selective for K+, while coumarocryptands with different size cryptand cages are highly selective for other mono- and divalent cations. For example, the coumaro 2.2.1!-cryptand is highly selective for Na+ in aqueous solutions having clinically relevant levels of K+ and Ca2+. Advantageously, the 2.2.2! coumarocryptands of the present invention maintain high selectivity for K+ when used in aqueous media (that is, the K+ /Na+ complexation ratio is at least 20:1.) When the cryptand portion of the ionophore of the present invention complexes with a cation, the optical properties of the ionophore change in such a way that the concentration of cations in a particular sample can be determined by fluorometric analysis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, substituent groups and their position on the coumarin ring have been chosen so as to ensure that the excitation (i.e., absorption) maximum of the ionophore of the present invention is centered at a wavelength greater than 380 nm. This allows the ionophore of the present invention to be used with solid state light sources such as, for example, blue LEDs and lasers. Substituent groups and their positions are also preferably chosen to keep the emission wavelength below 500 nm, thereby preserving ionophore response for this class of indicators. Finally, substituent groups and their positions are preferably chosen to provide the option for colvalent attachment to substrates. Preferably, the substrate to which the indicator is attached is chosen to support uniform and reproducible ionophore response and to minimize the effect of physiological pH changes on ionophore response.}",

The sensors displayed good stability over a period of about five hours. The intensity produced by the 9 mM solution decreased slightly (i.e., approximately 5 counts) over the course of the testing, but this was believed to be due to dilution of this solution by the 3 mM solution with which it was alternated. Without using an intermediate wash bath between blood solution changes, the response time (95%) when going from a K+ ! of 3 to 9 mm was about 40 seconds and about 65 seconds when going from 9 to 3 mM. To alternate the two K+ ! solutions, initial sensor intensities were obtained with the 3 mM solution, and the test loop was emptied before the 9 mM solution was introduced directly. When this process was reversed, the test loop was rinsed with a wash solution of blood with K+ !=3 mM to prevent contamination of the 3 mM test solution. (This washing process caused the sensor to be exposed to air between blood solution changes, which resulted in an increase in the sensor response time. It was found that hydrating the sensor in a HEPES buffer solution containing",
