At the same time the microprocessor 22' detects tuning of the control circuit. As soon as it detects that the control circuit is tuned for the first time, the microprocessor 22 reduces the entered setpoint according to the value of reduction and performs further control of the cutting procedure as a function of the reduced setpoint. In this way not only is the cutting procedure optimized but also control of the HF instrument is substantially improved during commencement of the cut. Prior to starting up the HF instrument for cutting the first means of adjustment 23' is used to choose a setpoint for the DC voltage between electrodes 16 and 18 as detected by the discharge detector circuit 20. In addition, a percentage is entered in the microprocessor 22' representing the value of reduction, by means of the second adjustment means 23\". The following describes the function of the electric surgical HF instrument shown in FIG. 2 to the extent that it differs from the HF instrument shown in FIG. 1. The electric surgical HF instrument shown in FIG. 2 differs from the HF instrument shown in of FIG. 1 merely by a microprocessor 22' taking the place of a threshold switch. Microprocessor: 22'--for",
