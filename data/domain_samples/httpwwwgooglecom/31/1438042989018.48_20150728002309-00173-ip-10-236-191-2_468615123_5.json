The apparatus 10 is generally intended to be used in an operating room. A similar system is disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/523,611 filed May 11, 1990 entitled \"Image-Directed Robotic System For Precise Robotic Surgery Including Redundant Consistency Checking\" now U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,401 assigned to the same assignee as herein which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The coarse motion manipulator 12 generally comprises three links or sections; first link 16, second link 18, and third link 20. In the embodiment shown, the first link 16 is movably mounted on a base having a rail system 22. In a preferred embodiment, the base 22 would be stationarily positioned on a floor of an operating room to stationarily position the positioning apparatus 10 during a surgical operation. Alternatively, the base 22 could be fixed to an operating table. In the embodiment shown, the base 22 comprises two rails 24 and two end blocks 26 at opposite ends of the rails 24. The first link 16 has a main block 27 with rail channels 28 that the rails 24 pass through such that the first link 16 can ride along the base 22 along a linear path or axis as shown by arrow A. A suitable manual position lock (not shown) is provided on the block 27 to selectively stationarily position or lock the first link at a selected position on the base 22. The end blocks 26 establish a limited range of motion for the first link 16 on the base. The first link 16 also comprises a second rail system 30 stationarily connected to the block 27. The second rail system 30 generally comprises two rails 32, two end blocks 34, and beam 35 that connects the rail system to the block 27. As can be seen in FIG. 1A, the second rail system 30 is generally perpendicular to the first rail system 22 and moves with the block 27 as it moves along the first rail system 22., 16728=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/223,969 filed Apr. 6, 1994 which is a divisional application of application Ser. No. 08/147,008 filed Nov. 2, 1993, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/714,816 filed Jun. 13, 1991; abandoned., 58565=Referring also to FIG. 2, there is shown one embodiment of a system 120 incorporating the apparatus 10 shown in FIG. 1. The system 120 generally comprises the apparatus 10, a sensor 122, a computer 124, an audio system 126, and a visual display 128. The beacons 112 (see FIG. 1) on the end section 94 are connected to the computer 124 by electrical cable 130. The computer 124 sends signals to the beacons 112 such that they are activated in predetermined patterns of time and frequency. In an alternate embodiment different beacon colors could be used to distinguish the beacons from each other, thus permitting all beacon positions to be measured simultaneously. The sensor 122, in the embodiment shown, is an optical sensor that can digitize optical information and transmit the information via cable 132 to the computer 124. In a preferred embodiment, the sensor 122 is an OPTOTRAK 3D digitizer. OPTOTRAK is a trademark of Northern Digital Corporation. The sensor 122 uses three CCD linescan cameras 134 to track the active LED beacons. This system is fast, accurate, much less readily confused by stray light than similar lateral-cell based devices, and unlike electromagnetic field 6D sensors, is unaffected by metal in the operating theatre. The sensor 122 has been found capable of producing 1000 3D positions per second to an accuracy of about \ufffd0.1 mm and of returning up to eight 6D positions with an additional time of about 10 ms beyond the 3D sampling time. The computer 124, in the embodiment shown, can calculate the positions of the end section 94 based upon the light from the beacons 112 sensed at the sensor 122. The audio system 126 is connected to the computer 124 and has a speaker 136 and an input 138 for use with a voice recognition system in the computer. The speaker 136 may be used to output computer-generated synthetic speech, prerecorded voice messages, or simple tonal or other audio cues. However, the audio system 126 need not be provided. The visual display 128 is connected to the computer 124 and is used to display information to the surgeons. The display 128 can be located in any suitable location in the operation room.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Let it be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the appended claims. The surgeon can also use this instrument tracking capability to designate particular anatomical features to the computer or to designate modifications in his surgical plan. The computer can then use this information to modify the graphics display provided to the surgeon, to modify the parameters or algorithms selected for image processing, or in control of additional manipulation aids or system used in surgery. For example, the surgeon may indicate a few points on a blood vessel, bile duct, or other anatomical feature that he wishes to inspect. The computer can then scan the camera over the indicated path while the surgeon devotes his whole attention to the display. Furthermore, the computer can use the designation information to customize image processing algorithms to enhance what the surgeon sees. Clearly, the system described above can be modified for use with surgical instruments other than cameras. For example, a pair of remote-center-of-motion manipulation aids may be used to assist laparoscopic alignment of two anatomical features (e.g., the several ends of a blood vessel or duct) that must be precisely aligned for",
