    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64731=Referring to FIG. 3, the zipper 22 includes a male track and a female track. The male track includes a male profile 24 and a first depending fin or flange 26 extending downward from the male profile 24. Likewise, the female track includes a female profile 28 and a second depending fin or flange 30 extending downward from the female profile 28. The first and second fins 26 and 30 are thermally fused to inner surfaces of the respective first and second body panels 12 and 14. Alternatively, the zipper 22 may be extruded with the body panels 12 and 14 such that the first fin 26 is integrally formed with the first body panel 12 and the second fin 30 is integrally formed with the second body panel 14. To provide a hermetic seal for the contents of the bag, the first and second fins 26 and 30 may be joined to each other at their lowermost ends along a line of weakness to effectively create a single tamper-evident continuous fin. If the fins are joined to each other, they must be separated from each other along the line of weakness in order to gain access to the contents of the bag. Further information concerning the joined fins may be obtained from U.S. application Ser. No. 08/950,535 filed Oct. 15, 1997 and entitled \u201cReclosable Fastener Strip With Tamper Evident Feature,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 72828=Referring to FIGS. 7a-d, there is shown a tamper-evident feature in the form of a removable stepped retaining element 70 removably attached to the bag body panel 12 just below the zipper 22 at the closed position of the slider. The stepped element 70 may be attached to the bag body panel 12 by a peel seal or other weak adhesive that allows the stepped element 70 to be peeled or pried away as shown in FIGS. 7b and 7 d. The stepped element 70 forms one or more steps 72 having respective sloped surfaces. The sloped surfaces of the respective steps 72 may be inclined such that each step 72 gradually increases in thickness in a direction approaching the end stop 34. To engage one of the steps 72, the slider 32 includes at least one inwardly extending shoulder 73 that is contoured to form a protrusion or bump 74. The protrusion 74 may be located anywhere along the shoulder 73. Further details concerning the contoured shoulder 73 may be obtained from U.S. application Ser. No. 08/938,047 filed Apr. 26, 1997, entitled \u201cHigh-Strength Slider for a Reclosable Bag,\u201d and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. When the slider 32 is in the closed position, the protrusion 74 on the slider shoulder 73 engages a raised edge 76 (FIG. 7a) on one of the steps 72., 67198=Opposite ends of the zipper 22 are provided with end termination clamps 34. Each end clamp 34 includes a strap member that wraps over the top of the zipper 22. To mount the strap to the zipper 22, one end of the strap is provided with a rivet-like member that is adapted to penetrate through the bag material and into a cooperating opening at the other end of the strap. The end clamps 34 perform the dual function of stops for the ends of the zipper 22 to prevent the slider 32 from going past the end of the zipper 22 and, in addition, they hold the male and female profiles 24 and 28 together to resist stresses applied to the profiles during normal use of the plastic bag. Further details concerning the construction and operation of the slider 32 and the end clamps 34 may be obtained from U.S. Pat. No. 5,067,208 to Herrington, Jr. et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The end terminations 34 are merely illustrative and may take other forms known in the art, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,482,375; 5,448,807; 5,442,837; 5,405,478; 5,161,286; 5,131,121; and 5,088,971 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/698,923 filed Aug. 16, 1996 and entitled \u201cEnd Posts for Plastic Zipper,\u201d all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 43078=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/861,351, filed May 18, 2001, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/309,465, filed May 11, 1999, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,286,999 on Sep. 11, 2001., 87229=Referring to FIGS. 16a-d, there is shown a tamper-evident feature in the form of a U-shaped rigid or semi-rigid retaining element 160 extending through slots 162 in the slider 32 and dug into the zipper 22 (see FIG. 16c) when the slider 32 is in the closed position. The U-shaped element 160 may be composed of metal or plastic. The slider 32 includes a transverse member 163 and a pair of side walls 164 and 165 extending downward from opposing longitudinal sides of the transverse member 163. The transverse member 163 rides along the upper portion of the zipper 22. The side wall 164 includes a leg 166 and a hinged wing 167. After the slider 32 is installed on the zipper 22, the wing 167 encompasses and is latched to the leg 166. The side wall 165 includes a leg and a hinged wing akin to the respective leg 166 and wing 167 of the side wall 164. The slots 162 are formed by a small gap separating the wing 167 20 from the leg 166. Further details concerning the construction of the slider 32 may be obtained from U.S. application Ser. No. 08/938,047 filed Apr. 26, 1997, entitled \u201cHigh-Strength Slider for a Reclosable Bag,\u201d and already incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims. Unlike the tamper-evident features in FIGS. 4a-d through 16 a-d, the tamper-evident features in FIGS. 17a-c, 18, 19 a-b, and 20 a-b do not rely upon preventing movement of the slider 32 away from its closed position. Rather, the tamper-evident features in FIGS. 17a-c, 18, 19 a-b, and 20 a-b rely upon securing the bag mouth in a folded position and would still be effective in the absence of the slider 32 and the zipper 22. Therefore, unlike the other tamper-evident features, the tamper-evident features in FIGS. 17a-c, 18, 19 a-b, and 20 a-b may be applied to virtually any type of bag. If, however, a slider bag is employed, it is contemplated that the tamper-evident features of FIGS. 4a-d through 16 a-d can be combined with the tamper-evident features in FIGS. 17a-c, 18, 19 a-b, and 20 a-b so as to both secure the bag mouth in a folded position and prevent movement of the slider away from its closed position until the appropriate tamper-evident feature",
