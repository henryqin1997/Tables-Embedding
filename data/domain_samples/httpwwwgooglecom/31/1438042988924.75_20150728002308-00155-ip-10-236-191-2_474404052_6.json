The node diffusion region 38 and supporting PFETs are shielded by the photoresist layer 42. A heavier N+ implant 44 optionally may be done at this point to increase the N+ concentration in the bitline diffusion region, in order to facilitate the use of tungsten studs as low resistance bitline contacts. This heavier N+ doping preferably is performed to a concentration of about 5\ufffd1019 to about 1\ufffd1021cm\u22123., 31560=As shown in FIG. 4, at this point in the process, both the node 38 and bitline 40 N+ diffusions are accomplished by N+ implanting 39. This implant is relatively light and is designed to produce an N+ surface concentration in the range of about 5\ufffd1018 to 5\ufffd1019cm\u22123. The light implant is needed to satisfy the relatively low doping concentration requirement for the node diffusion, which is one of the prerequisites for low junction leakage. At a subsequent point in the process, as discussed below, a heavier N+ implant may optionally be made only into the bitline diffusion side.}",

Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to this description, or may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. FIG. 9 is an illustration of the variation in threshold voltage (Vt) over the range of variation of the channel length of the array MOSFET. Note that the MOSFET containing the bitline halo produces a much smaller variation in Vt. For the MOSFET with the bitline halo, the threshold voltage may actually \u201cbump-up\u201d slightly before the onset of strong drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL). As the channel length is reduced, the halo occupies a larger fraction of the channel, thus increasing the average doping concentration over the channel. The distribution of the halo is designed such that the channel doping adjacent the node diffusion is less than what is required for the standard MOSFET, over the entire range of channel length variation. FIG. 8 is a modeled lateral channel doping profile going from bitline to node diffusions, near the top silicon surface under the gate conductor. Note that the profile is",
