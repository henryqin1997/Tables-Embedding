    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{41023=One known method for alleviating the reliability and traffic problems in a self-routing network is discussed in the report entitled, \"Development of a Voice Funnel System\", Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc., Report No. 4098, August, 1979, pages III-29 through III-76, which discloses the use of an extra stage of banyan switching nodes at the input of a self-routing network in an attempt to resolve the previously mentioned problems. The report proposes that this extra stage of switching be identical to other stages of the network and be utilized by adding an extra bit of addressing to the address field of each packet being routed through the switching network. This extra stage of switching would precede stage 1 of the shown in FIG. 1. The extra address bit would be controlled by hardware or software external to the switching network and would determine the route through the switching network. The hardware or software would use this bit so as to avoid a node which was failing or experiencing heavy traffic., 62358=Output control 803 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 11. Control circuit 1100 responds to requests from input controls 800, 802, 805, and 806, which are transmitted via cables 809, 822, 817, and 820. If flip-flop 1101 is set, control circuit 1100 responds to the request by transmitting a grant signal back to the requesting input control via one of the above mentioned cables. After acknowledging the request, control circuit 1100 conditions data selector 1103 to select the data conductor from the appropriate cable 809, 822, 817, or 820. Control circuit 1100 transmits the appropriate control information to data selector 1103 via cable 1108. Data selector 1103 transfers the data information received on the selected input terminal to conductor 1107. Tri-state device 1102 takes the information on conductor 1107 and transmits this data via link 203-0 to input circuit 1105, which is part of switching node 204-0. Control circuit 1100 controls the output of tri-state device 1102 via conductor 1109., 60611=Address rotation circuit 906 is illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 10. The purpose of circuit 906 is to rotate the address field to the left one bit such that the most significant bit becomes the least significant bit. The rotation is necessary because each input control decodes only the most significant bit. Shift registers 1000 and 1003 are one bit registers, data selector 1002 is used to select either the output of register 1000 or register 1003, and control circuit 1009 controls the operation of the address rotation circuit. When control circuit 1009 receives the start of packet signal from controller 904 via conductor 919, it transmits a clock signal to register 1000 via conductor 1007, and to register 1003 via conductor 1005. This clock signal is derived from the signal received from system clock 261 via conductor 1010. Control circuit 1009 conditions data selector 1002 via conductor 1008 to select register 1003's output to be transmitted on conductor 918. Control circuit 1009 then counts the number of bits that are being transmitted via conductor 918; when the most significant bit of the network address field is contained within register 1003, control circuit 1009 ceases to transmit the clock signal to register 1003 via conductor 1005, and conditions data selector 1002 to select the output of register 1000. Control circuit 1009 then waits until the remaining bits of the network address field have been transmitted via conductor 918. At this point in time, control circuit 1009 commences to send clock signals to register 1003, and conditions data selector 1002 to select the output of register 1003. This operation results in the most significant bit of the network address field being rotated., 39100=Self-routing packet switching networks such as those using banyan switching nodes communicate packets on the basis of address information contained within the packets. One such switching network is disclosed in the application of J. S. Turner, Case 8, Ser. No. 393,112, which was filed on June 25, 1982, and allowed on July 23, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,512,011, and assigned to same assignee as this application, and is illustrated in FIG. 1. In the latter figure, there is only one unique route between each input and output pair of the network. For example, there is only one path between trunk controller 100-0 and trunk controller 112-0. This path is via nodes 102-0, 104-0, 106-0, 108-0, 110-0 and links 101-0, 103-0, 105-0, 107-0, 109-0, and 111-1. Node 102-0 is responsive to address information within the packet to route the packet to node 104-0, and subsequent nodes in the previously described path are responsive to the address information to properly route the packet until it is received by trunk controller 112-0. In addition, trunk controller 100-0 shares a portion of this path to trunk controller 112-0 with trunk controller 100-2 since trunk controller 100-2 only has one path to trunk controller 112-0, and this path is via nodes 102-2, 104-2, 106-2, 108-0, and 110-0. These two paths initially meet at node 108-0 which can have a maximum of 16 trunk controllers attempting to transmit information to one of four trunk controllers attached to nodes 110-0 or 110-1. When such an unbalanced traffic condition occurs, the traffic capacity is limited to the maximum traffic capacity of node 108-0. It is important to realize that the traffic concentration can be even higher on node 106-0 than previously described. In addition, to the problems of unbalanced traffic, if node 108-0 fails, then a large number of trunk controllers cannot communicate with certain other trunk controllers., 63382=The operation of output control 803 as shown in FIG. 11 will be explained in greater detail by considering the previous example of input control 800 transmitting a packet of data to output control 803 via cable 809. When input control 800 transmits the request signal via conductor 826, control circuit 1100 transmits the grant signal to input control 800 via conductor 827 if link 203-0 is not being used by one of the other input control circuits and the output of flip-flop 1101 is set. Assuming that flip-flop 1101 was set, control circuit 1100 transmits the grant signal to input control 800 and conditions data selector 1103 via cable 1108 to select the data being transmitted on conductor 825 and retransmit this data on conductor 1107. In addition, control circuit 1100 enables the tri-state device 1102 to transfer the information on conductor 1107 to link 203-0.}",

In particular, one skilled in the art could foresee the use of a selection flip-flop in place of the random number generator utilized in FIG. 8. The operation of output control 803 as shown in FIG. 11 will be explained in greater detail by considering the previous example of input control 800 transmitting a packet of data to output control 803 via cable 809.
