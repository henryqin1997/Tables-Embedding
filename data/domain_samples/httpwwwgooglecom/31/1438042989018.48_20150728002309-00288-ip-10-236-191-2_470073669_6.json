No. 4,396,604, issued on Aug. 2, 1983 to Mitra, and is incorporated herein by reference. Mitra discloses a simethicone antacid lozenge, and a batch method of combining simethicone, an antiflatulent, with an antacid, in a lozenge of hard candy in a manner by which the simethicone retains its antiflatulent properties. The Mitra simethicone lozenge, as disclosed, describes the composition as containing from 55-90% of sucrose solids and 10-45% of corn syrup with the simethicone; noncariogenic candy compositions with the simethicone; and candy compositions containing sugar alcohols with the simethicone., 18325=U.S. Pat. No. 4,425,332, issued on Jan. 10, 1984 to James, and is incorporated herein by reference. James discloses that oral antacid compositions usually have the salts, hydroxides, or carbonates of aluminum, calcium, or magnesium as active antacid ingredients., 18968=U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,023, issued on Mar. 20, 1990 to Botzolakis et al., is incorporated by reference. Botzolakis discloses the masking of hygroscopic malflavored drugs by a wet granulation process followed by drying which coats the drug particles with silicon dioxide to mask unpleasant tastes., 24437=The lozenge formed by this process, by weight, is about 15-30% by weight antacid, about 38.5-46.5% by weight sucrose, about 31.5%-38.5% by weight corn syrup, about 0.20-4% concentrated flavorings and colorants, and up to 2.0% propylene glycol, glycerine, or a mixture of glycerine and propylene glycol., 15686=This application is a continuation application from our earlier application, Ser. No. 08/069,133, filed May 28, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,354., 16281=A wide variety of conditions, such as stress, poor dietary habits, and chemical or drug stimulation, can result in the overproduction and accumulation of acidic substances in the gastrointestinal tract. These acidic substances can concentrate particularly in the stomach and esophagus causing physical discomfort, often serious. .This condition may pose long-term deleterious physiological effects such as the onset of ulcerous conditions. An excellent summary of the effects of acid on the gastrointestinal tract is provided by W. Ganet, \"Antacid Products\", Handbook of Nonprescription Drugs, Sixth Edition, 1982, Chapter 3, pages 19-27., 19916=U.S. Pat. No. 4,163,777 issued Aug. 7, 1979, also to Mitra. Mitra '777 discloses an antacid-containing matrix formed by compression which is said to be slowly-dissolving, and a method of treating patients using the slowly-dissolving lozenge composition. The lozenge is formed from a matrix including a sugar or sugar alcohol; a gel-forming swelling agent; and a water-insoluble lipid material.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Lozenges according to the present invention containing 600 milligrams of calcium carbonate were compared to two calcium carbonate tablets containing 500 mg each for the effect of esophageal and gastric pH. Six volunteer patients suffering from acid indigestion and heartburn were intubated with antimony pH probes positioned in the stomach and the esophagus. After consuming an acid-inducing meal, the patients were given one of the antacid lozenges according to the present invention, and pH was measured over time. The experiment was repeated, using 2 calcium carbonate tablets of 500 mg calcium carbonate each, and taking pH readings over time. Finally, the experiment was conducted with a placebo, taking pH readings over time. The results indicated that 1 lozenge raised the pH in the esophagus and stomach in an amount equivalent to 2 500 milligram calcium carbonate tablets. See FIG. 1. In the Esophagus, total time at low pH was less for the lozenge than for the 2 calcium carbonate tablets, indicating superior effectiveness. Taste testing confirmed that the lozenge was extremely palatable. Experimental Testing The procedure of Example 1 was followed, with the exception that the second cooking temperature was 150\ufffd C. Example 2 The lozenges formed by this process were found to weigh 2.56 grams and contain 600 mg of calcium carbonate. Testing revealed the lozenge to have an actual acid neutralizing capacity of about 11.6 mEq and remained stable under",
