That is, after the player initially selects a masked award from each group, e.g., groups \u201cA\u201d through \u201cD\u201d of FIG. 3A, the game displays the total, such as the 1150 credits of FIG. 4, in the total credit indicator 60. The game then enables the player to change a selection of one of the groups and updates the change in the total credit indicator 60. The player can then selectively change back to the original selection or once again select another masked award. The game enables a plurality of award changes and preferably enables three., 37721=[0007] Gaming machines also currently exist with bonus rounds in which the game selects or determines the player's award. PCT application PCT/AU97/00121 entitled, Slot Machine Game with Roaming Wild Card, having a publication date of Sep. 4, 1997, discloses an example. In this invention, a slot machine having a video display contains a plurality of rotatable reels with game symbols. When the player receives a triggering symbol or combination, the game produces a bonus symbol. The bonus symbol moves from game symbol to game symbol temporarily changing the game symbol to a bonus symbol. If the change results in a winning combination, the player receives an award., 76457=[0068] In the optimization embodiment illustrated by FIG. 8, the game also contains a selectable credit indicator 62, which discloses that each group has the awards of: 10 credits; 50 credits; 300 credits; 500 credits; and 750 credits. With these awards, the player knows that one 10 credit, two 50 credits, and one 750 credits yield 860 total credits, as does one 10 credit, one 50 credit, one 300 credit and one 500 credit. The player also knows the difference between the first total award of 1310 and the second total award of 860 is 450 credits. This decrease could be from a change from 750 credits to 300 credits or from a change from 500 credits to 50 credits., 69535=[0060] The selectable credit indicator 62 also aids the player when determining whether to make a change or an attempt to optimize with a final, irreversible selection. If the player knows from the selectable credit indicator that the ultimate award is, e.g., 3000 (4\ufffd750) and that the average award is, e.g., 1288 (4\ufffd((10+50+300+500+750)/5)), then if the total credit indicator 60 currently displays 410 credits, then the player should opt to employ the final change or optimization attempt because it will likely increase the total. If the total credit indicator 60 currently displays 2500 credits, then the player should opt not to employ the final change without other information., 35257=[0002] This application is related to the following copending commonly owned application: \u201cGAMING DEVICE HAVING VALUE SELECTION BONUS,\u201d Ser. No. 10/306,295, Attorney Docket No. 0112300-1176., 79408=[0079] As illustrated in FIG. 10, the player's final selection paid off as the change from the \u201cCCC\u201d to the \u201cCCCCC\u201d converted a 10 credit to a 750 credit. The game removed the selection indicator from the \u201cCCC\u201d and placed it on the \u201cCCCCC\u201d. The selectable credit indicator 62 and the current credit indicator 64 indicate that the player currently has selected one 50 credit, one 500 credit and two 750 credits. The total credit indicator 60 updates and displays a total credit of 2050. Since no changes of optimization opportunities remain, the bonus round preferably automatically ends, and the game updates the player's credit display 16, accordingly. The game can, at this point, alternatively reveal or not reveal each award, as illustrated by FIG. 3B., 78718=[0078] At this point, the player has one selection remaining, which means that the game provides no further selections to undo an undesirable selection. The player can determine the average (calculated above), which is 1288. The player's total, 1310, is slightly above the average, so the odds dictate to forgo the final selection. The game provides a suitable \u201ccollect\u201d input device (not shown) as is well known in the art, should the player decide to keep the current credit selection. The player knows, from the indicators that three 750's remain, and for excitement and enjoyment, decides to take the slight risk and make the final selection., 36946=[0006] In the above game, the controller of the gaming device randomly places a predetermined number of masked awards and terminators in the pattern at the beginning of the bonus round and maintains the positioning until the bonus round terminates. When the player selects a masked award, the player receives the value of the award, and the game typically displays a message that the player may continue and enables the player to select another masked award. The player then selects another masked award, and the process continues until the player selects a masked terminator. European Patent Application No. EP 0 945 837 A2 filed on Mar. 18, 1999 and assigned on its face to WMS Gaming, Inc. discloses a bonus round of this type., 72847=[0064] If, in the example wherein the selectable credit indicator 62 discloses that each group has the awards of: 10 credits; 50 credits; 300 credits; 500 credits; and 750 credits and the total credit indicator 60 discloses a total credit of 1150 credits, the current credit indicator serves another purpose, namely, to distinguish between two or more possibilities. One 50 credit, two 300 credits and one 500 credit yield a total of 1150 credits. Two 50 credits, one 300 credit and one 750 credit also yield 1150 credits. Likewise, one 300 credit and three 500 credits total 1800 credits, as does one 50 credit, two 500 credits and one 750 credit., 34913=[0001] This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/684,605, filed Oct. 6, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,141., 78016=[0077] Referring now to FIG. 9, knowing now that the \u201cBBBBB\u201d contains a 750 and that the 450 credits can be retrieved, the player reselects the \u201cBBBBB\u201d. FIG. 9 illustrates that the game removed the selection indicator from the previously selected \u201cBBB\u201d and replaced it on the \u201cBBBBB\u201d. The figure also illustrates the update back to the original total of 1310 credits in the total credit indicator 60. In the optimization embodiment further illustrated by FIG. 9, the game also contains a selectable credit indicator 62 and the current credit indicator 64, which automatically discloses the information calculated by the player in FIG. 8., 74403=[0066] Referring to FIGS. 3A, 7, 8, 9 and 10, an example of the present invention is illustrated using each of the different optimization embodiments. The game preferably only employs one embodiment, however for illustration purposes, the following example illustrates all three. In FIG. 3A, the game displays four rows 52 through 58 each having five selectable similarly masked awards. The game directs the player to select a masked award from each row through a suitable audio and/or video prompt such as the message 59. FIG. 7 illustrates that the game has placed a selection indicator, e.g., the \u201cX\u201d, on the awards of the player's first selections, namely, the \u201cAA\u201d from the row 52, the \u201cBBBBB\u201d from the row 54, the \u201cCCC\u201d from the row 56 and the \u201cDDDD\u201d from the row 58. A total credit indicator 60 comprises one optimization embodiment and shows a total of 1310 credits.}",

The game removed the selection indicator from the \u201cCCC\u201d and placed it on the \u201cCCCCC\u201d.
