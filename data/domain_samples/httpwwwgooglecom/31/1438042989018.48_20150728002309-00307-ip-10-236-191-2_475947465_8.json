    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20502=In line with the efforts to develop such a desirable adsorbent, there have been proposed various adsorbents, including an immune adsorbent comprising protein A fixed to an insoluble carrier [see Terman D. S. et al, J. Immunol., 124, 795 (1980); New England J. Med., 305, 1195 (1981)], an acrylic acid ester type porous resin [for example, XAD-7 supplied by Rohm and Haas Co., U.S.A.; see Agishi T., Zinko Zoki, 9, 264 (1980)] and a cation exchange member, such as carboxymethyl cellulose [Johnson L. D. et al, Can. J. Biochem. 42, 795 (1964)]. These adsorbents have, however, various problems which limit their applications. The immune adsorbent comprising protein A fixed to an insoluble carrier has a specific adsorbing capacity for an immunoglobulin and/or immune complexes, but, since protein A is a biologically active protein derived from yellow staphylococcus, this immune adsorbent is disadvantageous in that the starting material is difficult to obtain and the manufacturing cost is high. Furthermore, since the adsorbent is unstable, deactivation thereof is readily caused by the handling at the fixing step or during the storage after the fixing step. Moreover, when this immune adsorbent is used in the state where it is kept in contact with the body fluid, there is a risk of trouble occurring through the elution of protein A. Still further, it is very difficult to sterilize this immune adsorbent while preventing deactivation. The acrylic acid ester type porous resin and the cation exchange member such as carboxymethyl cellulose are insufficient in adsorbing capacity and adsorption specificity. Moreover, since they even adsorb albumin from the body fluid, an abnormal change in the osmotic pressure is caused and they cannot be used safely as a curing means., 22300=With a view to obviating the above drawbacks, it was proposed in European Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. 56 977, which was published on Aug. 4, 1982, to use an adsorbing material for an autoantibody and/or immune complexes, which comprises (a) an insoluble carrier and (b) an organic low molecular weight compound containing a hydrophobic compound having a solubility of not more than 100 millimoles in one dl of a physiological saline solution at 25\ufffd C., said organic low molecular weight compound being fixed to the insoluble carrier. The organic low molecular weight compound has a special chemical structure which permits the compound to exhibit specific chemical interaction with the substances to be adsorbed. According to the disclosure, the adsorbent is capable of adsorbing an autoantibody and/or immune complexes at a high selectivity and high efficiency with minimal disadvantageous concurrent adsorption of useful substances. Further, according to the disclosure, it can be safely employed and readily sterilized thereby to render it suitable for the purification of body fluid. Investigations have been made on the adsorbing materials, as disclosed in the above-mentioned European Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. 56977, which exhibit specific interaction with the substances to be adsorbed. Such investigations have led to the present invention. Hence, the present invention relates to an improvement of the adsorbent as disclosed in European Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. 56977., 31648=The negative charge-producing member to be employed in the present invention has no carbon atom or 1 to 5 carbon atoms. It may comprise a group such as a carboxyl group, sulfo group, phosphono group, arsono group, phosphinico group, selenino group or the like and produces a negative charge in a body fluid such as blood. It is preferred that the molecular weight of the negative charge-producing member may be 10,000 or less, especially 1000 or less. As the suitable negative charge-producing member, there may be mentioned, for example, aliphatic amino acids such as glycine, alanine and aspartic acid, fatty acids such as \u03b3-amino-n-butyric acid and \u03b5-amino-caproic acid, sulfamic acid, taurine and carbamyl phosphate., 37578=As mentioned hereinbefore, it is preferred that the respective molecular weight of the hydrophobic member and negative charge-producing member to be employed in the present invention do not exceed 10,000, especially do not exceed 1000, to avoid the unfavorable antigenicity that may occur when they are detached and leaked into the body fluid, such as blood., 39401=In the case of a particulate carrier, it is preferred that the average particle size thereof be in the range of 25 to 2,500 microns, especially 50 to 1500 microns. The specific surface area of the carrier may be preferably 5 m2 /g or more, more preferably 55 m2 /g or more, in the dry state., 53007=Various organic compounds, as indicated in Table 1, each having 2 or more negative charge-producing members and also having 6 or more carbon atoms were bonded to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (a CNBr-activated agarose gel, having an average particle diameter of 60 to 140 microns and a molecular weight exclusion limit of 2\ufffd1077, which is manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Co., Sweden) by the customary method as will be explained below to obtain adsorbents for which the ratio of ##EQU6## is 2 or more.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The adsorption test was carried out in the same manner as in Example 3. The plasma of a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis used in the test had a rheumatoid factor titer of 320 (latex test) and 2,560 (RAHA test), an immune complex concentration (based on the determination of immunoglobulin G) of 43 mg/dl, an immunoglobulin G concentration of 1,300 mg/dl and a fibrinogen concentration of 230 mg/dl. After adsorption, the rheumatoid factor titer was decreased to 40 (latex test) and to 160 (RAHA test), and the immune complex concentration was decreased to 8 mg/dl. The immunoglobulin G concentration and the fibrinogen concentration were slightly decreased to 1,200 mg/dl and 200 mg/dl, respectively. The gel as obtained in Example 2 was used as a carrier. After activation with epichlorohydrin, poly-L-phenylalanine (number of carbon atoms in the hydrophobic member: 270-540, number of negative charges: 1) and taurine (number of carbon atoms: 2, number of negative charges: 1) were bonded simultaneously to the carrier. There was obtained an adsorbent for which the ratio of the effective number of negative charges to the number of hydrophobic members was 2.5 and in which the total amount of the poly-L-phenyl-alanine and taurine bonded to the carrier was 4 mg/ml of the gel. EXAMPLE 4 From the figures, it is seen that the adsorbents having both a hydrophobic member and a negative charge-producing member on the surface have a high",
