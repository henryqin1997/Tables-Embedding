    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31133=Infrared heaters are well known and have been used for many years in various heating applications. Heating with infrared energy is often more efficient than convective forced air heating systems for several reasons. First, convection heating involves a gas (typically air) or liquid that transfers heat from one solid body to another. Because most convection heating uses air as the medium for transferring the heat, convection can only be controlled by air temperature and air speed. In contrast, infrared heating (which includes waves having wavelengths between about 0.75 microns to about 1000 microns) only heats objects and does not heat the air in space that it travels through. Air, the medium for convective heat, is a poor absorber of infrared heat, thus infrared heat can be transmitted long distances with minimum loss of energy to air. When infrared energy is directed onto an object (such as a person), the energy is converted into heat. The heated object then becomes a heat source that transfers heat into the air surrounding the object., 52121=Reflective cover 46 may be made of sheet metal or other sheet material that is stamped, bent or otherwise formed and assembled into the desired shape. Reflective cover 46 may also be made of ceramic or other insulated and/or reflective materials such as, for example, a molded member that includes ceramic fiber and a binder. One example molded material that may be especially useful as a reflective cover is disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0049575, which is incorporated herein by reference., 32218=Because infrared waves travel in a straight line at the speed of light, they can be directed in a specific direction toward a specific object. The distance infrared waves travel is dependent on the type of infrared source and the power of the infrared source. The wavelength of the infrared waves may influence the depth of penetration of the infrared waves into the objects. Infrared waves are typically divided into short, medium and long waves through the infrared wavelength spectrum of about 0.75 to 1000 \u03bcm. Short infrared waves generally have the deepest penetration capabilities while long infrared waves have the least penetration capabilities. Infrared heaters may include infrared elements that produce a single or multiple wavelengths depending on the application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention should not be considered limited to the particular examples or materials described above, but rather should be understood to cover all aspects of the invention as fairly set out in the attached claims. Various modifications, equivalent processes, as well as numerous structures to which the present invention may be applicable will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art to which the present invention is directed upon review of the instant specification. Another aspect of the invention relates to a heated patio furniture set that includes a table, at least one chair, and an umbrella. The umbrella may include a plurality of radially extending support members, webbing extending between the radially extending support members, and an infrared heating element secured to at least one of the radially extending supports in a generally downward facing direction to direct infrared waves toward the table and chairs. The patio furniture may include a material that absorbs at least some of the infrared waves and is heated as a result of the absorption. Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of heating objects in proximity to a patio umbrella using an infrared heating element. The method may includes the steps of opening the umbrella, supporting the infrared heating element with the umbrella, orienting the infrared heating elements in a generally downward direction, and directing infrared waves from the infrared heating",
