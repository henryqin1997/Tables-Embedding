No. 07/515,836, filed Apr. 27, 1990 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention which is incorporated by reference herein. In this call routing technique an interrogation exchange receives incoming calls for a mobile station and requests information from the home exchange as to where to route the call. Before returning this information to the interrogation exchange, the home exchange requests the exchange(s) where the mobile is believed to be currently located to page the mobile. Upon reception of a page response from the paged mobile, and after possible voice channel designation, the present location of the mobile is reported to the home exchange. The home exchange then informs the interrogation exchange of the mobile's present location for routing and completion of the call., 60166=Referring to FIG. 4 which illustrates multi-exchange paging in a routing system, if the mobile station 12 cannot be found in the first visited exchange in which paging is initiated, multi-exchange paging can continue paging the mobile in other exchanges where the mobile station 12 could be believed to be, for example, in the visited exchange 2, designated by reference numeral 24. Such a routing system is the subject of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/515,836, filed Apr. 27, 1990, assigned to the assignee of the present invention herein and incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description shows only certain particular embodiments of the present invention. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that many modifications and variations may be made without departing substantially from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be clearly understood that the form of the invention described herein is exemplary only and is not intended as a limitation on the scope of the invention. Finally, statistics on the number of page requests and the number of sent page requests based upon origin can be analyzed and used to determine priority of paging, especially in multiple operator environments. Operator commands could be used to specify the number of page repeats and the priority for different page requests and different operators. In order to control enhanced incidence of paging in multiple-exchange paging it is useful to provide certain limitations on paging requests. If paging is requested in several exchanges, the system provides information and the paging request so paging is performed with maximum efficiency of system resources. In order to accomplish this goal there are a number of things to consider. First, the purpose of the paging request must be considered. If the page is being sent to where the system believes the mobile station is actually located, paging could have the highest priority and an unanswered page may be repeated in a paging area within or outside the exchange area.
