Data is routed from one network device to another through the access devices 81-85 and 90 and the backbone LAN 80, when necessary. The access device 81 is designated a root device. Communications flowing coward the root are considered to flow downstream. Communications flowing away from the root are considered to flow upstream. Each access device contains a table having entries for each network device in one of that access device's upstream paths. The table also has an entry identifying the next access device in the downstream path. Further detail regarding wireless spanning tree data flow can be found in U.S. Pat.

At a block 351 upon binding and possibly periodically, the source peripheral LAN device sends an indication of its current battery parameters to the destination peripheral LAN device at block 353. This indication may be each of the parameters or may be an averaged indication of all of the parameters together. At a block 355, upon receipt, the destination peripheral LAN device 355 stores the battery parameters (or indication) at block 357. Finally, at a block 358, upon receiving a transmission from the source device, based on range determinations and the stored battery parameters, the destination terminal identifies the subsequent data rate (and possibly power level) at block 359. Thereafter, the new data rate and power level are communicated to the source device either explicitly or implicitly for future communications at block 361.
