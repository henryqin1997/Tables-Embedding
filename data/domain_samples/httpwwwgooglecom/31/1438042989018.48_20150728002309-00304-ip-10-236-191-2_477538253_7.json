Continuing to refer to FIG. 5, user interface 170 is connected to receive the logical keycodes from logical keypad device driver 166 and the logical display keycode from logical LCD device driver 158. User interface 170 is operable to determine, based upon the received logical keycodes from the LCD and keypad drivers, what user function is selected by a user and at what location a cursor is located regardless of whether a selection is made. Similarly, physical keypad device driver 162 is connected to receive from keypad 150 signals corresponding to a depression of a key 152. The received signals are then translated to physical keycodes by physical keypad device driver 162. Logical keypad device driver is connected to receive the physical keycodes from physical keypad device driver 162 and to map the physical keycode into a logical keycode associated with a software controlled user feature. FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of the physical and logical LCD and keypad drivers in relation to an",
