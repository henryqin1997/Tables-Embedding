    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the above-described embodiments, the light receiving devices are disposed in the space above the upper surface of the reticle 8, but the stray light can be effectively prevented by the aforedescribed light intercepting means even if the light receiving devices are disposed in the space below the underside of the reticle 8 (the surface which is adjacent to the stage 9). In the first embodiment, the light intercepting frame 10 is provided as light intercepting means for preventing the stray light, whereas in the present embodiment, light intercepting film 200 endowed with a characteristic capable of sufficiently absorbing the wavelength of the light beam 2 is provided on that end surface of the reticle 8 which is opposed to the light receiving devices. Thereby, the creation of stray light entering the light receiving devices can be prevented as shown in FIG. 4. The light intercepting film 200 may be applied to the end surface of the reticle 8, or may be stuck to or deposited by evaporation on the end surface of the reticle 8. A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. FIG. 3 schematically shows the construction of a foreign particle inspection apparatus according to the present embodiment, and FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the apparatus of FIG. 3. In these figures, members similar to those in FIG. 1 are given",
