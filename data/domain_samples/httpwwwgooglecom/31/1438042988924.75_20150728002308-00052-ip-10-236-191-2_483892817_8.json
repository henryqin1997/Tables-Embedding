Further, the first and second flexible members are divided into one and the other halves so that the one and the other halves of the flexible members are arranged so as to extend in the abovementioned phantom plane and so as to sandwich the first and second coils and the magnetic circuits. Accordingly, compared with the previously developed pickup system in which the coils and the magnetic circuits are arranged so as to be stacked in the direction of the optical axis of the objective lens, the pickup system according to the present invention is small in size in the direction of the optical axis of the objective lens. As a result, the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus of the pickup system can be made thin. The same vibration-proofing effect as that obtained by using the junction member as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 can be obtained even in the case where such a junction member as shown in FIGS. 6 through 9 is employed. As described above in detail, the pickup system according to the present invention comprises an objective lens (21) for irradiating a recording surface of a recording",
