    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above description is included to illustrate the operation of the preferred embodiments and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims. From the above discussion, many variations will be apparent to one skilled in the art that would yet be encompassed by the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, instead of basing the declaration of malicious code upon the condition that the starting address of a send function is a non-normal location, the basis for declaring malicious code could be that another function, e.g., a receive function, a bind function, or a connect function, is stated to have, within function location directory 27, a starting address that is non-normal. illustrates a computer-readable medium 60 containing the inventive modules 51\u201356. Searching module 51 is coupled to examining module 52, which is coupled to locating module 53. which is coupled to declaring module 54, which is coupled to optional scanning module 55, which is coupled to optional excising module 56. FIG. 5 If the answer to the question in step 48 is \u201cyes\u201d, i.e., criterion 3 has been satisfied, two different things may happen. In a first embodiment, declaring module 54 at step 49 reports the file containing communications module 20 as being corrupted rather than as being infected with malicious",
