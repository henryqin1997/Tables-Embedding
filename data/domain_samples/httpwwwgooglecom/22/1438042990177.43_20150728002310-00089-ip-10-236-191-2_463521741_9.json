Swilslow, and A. Shar, Phys. Rev. Letters., 45 1636 (1980) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,933 (Tanaka et al.), incorporated herein by reference., 34879=Recently, a gel-based dehumidifier has been proposed whose operation is based upon application of an electric field to a porous water-based polymer gel electrolyte. See, Japanese Patent Application 243516, Aug. 31, 1992, Fujitsu Inc. Application of an electric field between two electrodes to a water-based system leads to unwanted, and possibly dangerous, electrochemical reactions involving the water., 85533=A gel, however, is not constrained by these same limitations imposed by surface tension or stress. A much larger surface charge density can be applied. Use of an electric field to enhance sorption is conveniently demonstrated by forming a gel sorbent as one or more plates of a capacitor (e.g. parallel plate, cylindrical, and the like). The gel sorbent is allowed to sorb vapor and during the sorption mode, an electrical field is applied to each plate of the gel capacitor, providing the gel with a surface charge. At a relative humidity of about 40% RH, an exemplary electric field is generated by applying about 2000 volts DC or 2000 volts AC to plates spaced apart about 0.5 mm. The applied charge enhances sorption as described above. When sorption is completed, the sorbent is regenerated by either collapsing the sorbent by inducing a phase-transition and/or removing the surface charge. Removing the surface charge will remove liquid, not by inducing a phase transition (compare to Example 1) but by returning the gel to a condition where the balance between the vapor pressure above the gel and osmotic pressure within the gel forces the liquid to be disgorged. After removal of liquid, the gel sorbent is again brought to a sorptive mode position., 102719=At equilibrium, the air within the sealed capsule is saturated with vapor at the water temperature. A differential thermocouple arrangement permitted the monitoring of temperature differences between water and air within the capsule to about 0.005 deg. C. Water temperature within the capsule was measured to about 0.1 deg. C. with a digital thermocouple (mfg. by Cole-Parmer Scanning Thermocouple Thermometer #92800-00). The diameter of the gel string was observed and recorded through the optically clear walls of the capsule using a 70X microscope with an associated 35 mm camera. Volumetric ratio changes of the gel with temperature were determined by cubing the ratio of the gel string diameter to pipette bore, as scaled in arbitrary length units from photographic prints., 81720=Gel beads may be made by polymerization methods known in the art for preparing uniform polymer beads. See, for example, Okubo and Nakagawa, \"Preparation of Micron-Sized Monodisperse Polymer Particles having highly Cross-Linked Structures and Vinyl Groups by Seeded Polymerization of Divinylbenzene Using the Dynamic Swelling Method\", Colloid and Polymer Science, 270: 853-858 (1992), incorporated herein by reference and Park and Hoffman, \"Preparation of Large, Uniform Temperature-Sensitive Hydrogel Beads\", J. Polymer Science: Part A: 80: 505-507 (1992), incorporated herein by reference. The size of the beads may vary from 0.1 micron in diameter to 1000 microns in diameter. Preferred beads will vary within a range dictated by the particular application. Beads that are too small will not be retained within the apparatus and beads that are too large may have phase-transition kinetics that are too slow. Preferred beads are about 10 microns in diameter., 61536=On a molecular level, the gel sorbents for use in the present vapor-extraction apparatus are sensitive to small changes in a restricted repertoire of \"trigger\" conditions consisting of temperature, pH, solvent concentration, and ion concentration. Nevertheless, on a macroscopic level, any of a variety of environmental conditions may be imposed on the gel which allows the specific trigger to induce a phase-transition. These environmental conditions may, but not necessarily, be the same as the trigger and include, but are not limited to, a change in temperature, electric field, photon energy, pH, solvent composition, ion concentration, concentration of biomolecules, and the like. Preferably, a gel sorbent may be combined with a material that acts as a molecular \"transducer\", converting an environmental condition into an appropriate trigger. For example, a dye may be introduced into a temperature-triggered gel sorbent. The dye is designed to absorb light of a given energy and convert the light energy into heat, thus triggering the gel sorbent to undergo a phase-transition. See, for example, A. Suzuki and T. Tanaka, Nature: 346: 6282 (1990), incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, a pH-sensitive gel sorbent may be combined with a dye that, upon interaction with light, will change the pH of the gel sorbent and trigger a phase-transition. See for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/936,681, filed Aug. 27, 1992, now abandoned, entitled \"Light Powered Synthetic Muscles\", by Albert R. Zorino (assigned to the United States Navy)., 110711=The size and shape of the gels in the micropipettes are monitored at different temperatures using a Model C1966 AVEC image processor, commercially available from Hamamatsu Photonics, Inc. Each gel is submerged in water in a micropipette. The temperature of the water in the gels is controlled to within 0.01\ufffd C. using circulating water at temperatures in the range of between 4\ufffd C. and 50\ufffd C., 54264=Recently, phase transition phenomena have been observed in permanently crosslinked polymer networks that exist as gels. The term \"polymer network\" refers to polymers cross-linked to create a tangled network and immersed in liquid medium. As an external environmental condition (e.g., temperature; solvent composition) is changed, the polymer network becomes increasingly compressible, and at a certain point, it becomes infinitely compressible. At the same time, the effective pore size of the network increases. It was also observed that the volume of such a gel changes reversibly by a factor as large as several hundred when the gel is presented with a small change in external conditions such as solvent chemical composition or temperature.
