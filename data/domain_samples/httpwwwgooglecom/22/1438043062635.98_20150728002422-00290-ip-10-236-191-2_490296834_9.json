    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40261=Referring to FIG. 11, a methodology for assembling the winding 530 to the stator 515 is illustrated. The winding 530 is preshaped (see FIG. 18) on a forming fixture (not shown but well known in the art) and then installed on the bobbin 522. The forming fixture defines the outer diameter of the finished stator 515 and draws a potting medium such as an epoxy into the desired locations. The methodology begins in block 532 by dividing a cylindrical forming fixture 1000 (see FIG. 19) into a plurality of segments 1002, such as four. The fixture 1000 includes a slightly compressible seal made from a material such a aluminum at each of the joints separating a segment. The seal prevents the entry of epoxy during potting. Advancing to block 534, the methodology positions the fixture 1000 around the fins 525, shaping the windings 530 into a cylindrical form. Advancing to block 536, the methodology compresses the seal forming a seal. Advancing to block 538, the methodology pots the winding 530, as is known in the art, such as under alternate cycles of vacuum and pressure., 17051=Since the invention of powered vehicles, many different powertrain systems have been attempted, including a steam engine with a boiler or an electric motor with a storage battery. It was, however, the four-stroke internal combustion engine invented by Otto in 1876, and the discovery of petroleum in 1859 that provided the impetus for the modern automotive industry., 39212=A first radial length of the encoder disc 600 includes at least one, preferably a plurality of slots 620 equally spaced around the perimeter of the disc 600. For example, the length of a slot 620 is approximately 0.015 in., width 0.006 in., and there are 10 slots 620 in number. A second radial length includes at least one, preferably a plurality of elongated slots 630 spaced around the perimeter of the disc 600. For example, there are 1280 elongated slots 630 in number.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced other than as specifically described. The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. At least one dampening mechanism 725, such as an external damper, dampens the motion of the flywheel 505 relative to the motion of the vehicle 100. A first end of the dampening mechanism 725 attaches to the chassis 110 (not shown) and a second end of the dampening mechanism 725 attaches to an external face of the flywheel housing 520, preferably near the top centerline of the housing 520. Preferably, there are two dampers 725 each located 45 degrees from a centerline of the beam 705 and 90\ufffd from a spin axis passing through the flywheel 505. The flywheel 505 is centered between the beams 705, and attached by a suitable means, such as with bolts. A first and second end of each beam 705 attaches to the chassis 110 of the vehicle 100. For example, a pair of opposing ledges 710 integral with the chassis 110 have a raised knife edge for supporting the first and second end of the beam 705, respectfully. This type",
