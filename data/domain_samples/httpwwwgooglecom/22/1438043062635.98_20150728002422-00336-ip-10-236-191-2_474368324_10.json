Therefore, n will be 4 and m will be 376. This organization for a sector of the array provides efficient storage for analog data such as voice, sounds, and music. The memory cells in a sector may be erased at one time because a high erase voltage (e.g., Verase) is provided to the sources of all cells at the same time. The cells are erasable using quantum mechanical tunneling. Other configurations and organizations for a sector can be used. A sector may have more or less than 1504 cells and have any number of row lines and column lines., 113730=Each switch can be connected (\u201con\u201d) or disconnected (\u201coff\u201d) depending on a control signal 1440 from a digital data input circuit 1420. When on, the switch shorts the impedance. Digital data input circuit 1420 receives a digital data input and generates an appropriate pattern for the control signals to determine which switches are on or off. Depending on whether particular switches are on or off, the value of the impedance between OUT and NOUT may be varied. Therefore, the voltage between OUT and NOUT is variable based on the digital data input. Using this technique, a number of analog equivalent voltages are generated., 100669=The common mode feedback circuitry further includes transmission gates 1213, 1215, 1217, 1223, 1225, and 1227. These transmission gates are connected to SET, SENS, NSENS, and NSET control inputs. The circuitry includes two more capacitors 1233 and 1235. Capacitors 1233 and 1235 are typically smaller than capacitors 1203 and 1205. For example, capacitors 1213 and 1217 are about 0.2 picofarads. A signal ground SG input is coupled through transmission gates 1223 and 1213 to OUT, and through transmission gates 1227 and 1217 to NOUT. A VBIAS input is connected through transmission gates 1225 and 1215 to CMF., 91082=Inputs of transmission gates 1132 and 1138 are connected to a first bias voltage line 1143. Inputs to transmission gates 1134 and 1136 are connected to a second bias voltage line 1145. Outputs of transmission gate 1132 and 1134 are connected to an OUT output 1147. Outputs of transmission gate 1136 and 1138 are connected to an NOUT output 1149. Digital data input 1114 control the transmission gates to pass the bias voltages as summarized in the following table A., 99663=Common mode feedback circuit 1201 has an OUT and NOUT input that is connected to the OUT and NOUT output of FIG. 11. CMF is an output connected to VSN (i.e., the gate of transistor 1170) of FIG. 11. In circuit 1201, OUT and NOUT are connected to capacitors 1203 and 1205, respectively. Within an integrated circuit, there are many techniques of implementing a capacitor or a capacitance, and any of those techniques may be used to implement the capacitors or capacitances used in the circuitry of the present invention. Some techniques for implementing capacitors and capacitances include using parasitic capacitances, transistors, oxide capacitors, and diffusion capacitors, just to name a few. In this implementation capacitors 1213 and 1217 are about 0.8 picofarads. Other capacitors sizes may be used. Bigger capacitors sizes than 0.8 picofarads will speed up changes or adjustments in the CMF voltage during operation., 88468=FIG. 10 shows a further embodiment of circuitry for the digital output path. The stored analog value 1012 is input into a look-up table (LUT) circuit 1016. The look-up table circuitry provides an analog look-up table function. For each analog value in the table, there is a corresponding digital value. The look-up table outputs this digital value. In an embodiment, the look-up table may be implemented using sense amplifiers, arranged in parallel or series. For example, this may be a 4-bit digital value in the case four bits are stored in each memory cell. The digital value may be output to a register 1022 in parallel or serial. The digital data may be clocked out to a digital output 1028 using clock input 1024 in parallel or serial., 98594=In an embodiment, the digital reference generator includes a common mode feedback (CMF) circuit 1201 such as shown in FIG. 12. In such a case, VSN in FIG. 11 is generated by the common mode feedback circuit. The common mode feedback circuit connects to OUT and NOUT of the digital data input circuit 1110 of FIG. 11 as input to CMF circuit and generates output CMF, which connects to the VSN of FIG. 11. The common mode feedback circuit regulates the OUT and NOUT voltage levels by feeding back and adjusting the VSN voltage. VSN is connected to the gate of transistor 1170, which acts like a current source. If changes occur at OUT and NOUT outputs of circuit 1110, the common mode feedback circuit adjusts VSN (i.e., control of the current source) to compensate so the bias voltages at 1143 and 1145 will be centered about the reference voltage R. By using common mode feedback, the digital reference generator will provide a consistent analog output with reference to a reference voltage R., 95417=Bias voltage generator circuit 1160 generates the first and second bias voltages 1143 and 1145. The circuitry includes transistors 1162, 1164, 1166, 1168, and 1170, connected in series between a positive supply voltage VDDA and a reference supply voltage VSSA. VDDA and VSSA are supply voltages for the analog circuits while VDDD and VSSD are supply voltages for the digital circuits. Typically, VDDA is about 3 volts and VSSA is ground. Separate digital and analog supply pins are provided to give some noise immunity between the digital and analog circuits. Noise from the digital circuits will not couple to the analog circuits, and vice versa. Transistors 1162 and 1164 are PMOS devices. Transistor 1162 has a gate connected to a VSP bias voltage and transistor 1164 has a gate connected to a VSPC bias voltage. Transistor 1166 is diode-connected NMOS device, connected between first bias voltage line 1143 and second bias voltage line 1145. Transistors 1168 and 1170 are NMOS devices. Transistor 1168 has a gate connected to a VSNC bias voltage and transistor 1170 has a gate connected to a VSN bias voltage., 103455=While SENS, NSENS, SET, and NSET are switching, node N2 will be common with N1 and N3. So, N2 will be at the SG voltage. Through switch 1215, N2 and CMF will be equalized. The common mode feedback circuit compensates for changes at OUT and NOUT of circuit 1110 of FIG. 11 by adjusting CMF (VSN of FIG. 11), which will ultimately adjusts the OUT and NOUT. First bias voltage 1143 and second bias voltage 1145 of bias voltage generator 1160, and in turn, the OUT and NOUT outputs will be centered around the SG voltage. This digital reference generator circuit with common mode feedback is efficient, robust, and reliable., 90448=Digital data input 1114 is connected to inverters 1117 and 1119. Digital data input 1114 and inverters 1117 and 1119 are connected to control four transmission gates 1132, 1134, 1136, and 1138. In a specific embodiment, each of the transmission gates is implemented using an n-channel or NMOS transistor and a p-channel or PMOS transistor connected in parallel. There are two control inputs to each transmission gates, one to the gate or control electrode of the NMOS transistor, and one to the gate or control electrode of the PMOS transistor., 38244=This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/091,326, filed Jun. 30, 1998, and U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/116,760, filed Jan. 22, 1999, which are incorporated by reference., 66280=Furthermore, the digital storage of the present invention can be used to store frequently used numbers, word, or sound bites. For example, information such as the days of the weeks (i.e., Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday), ordinal numbers one through fifty-nine (e.g., one, two, three, four, and so forth), and DTMF sounds, may be digitally stored or stored in analog. These types of information will be retrieved and linked together as needed by the electronic system to provide information messages such as: \u201cYou have three new messages. Message one was received on Tuesday at 3:15 p.m.\u201d This sound bite or message linking scheme will greatly ease the re-use of the commonly used sound bites and reduce the amount of memory used., 105348=The number of different bias voltage inputs to circuit 1320 depends on the scheme used. For one scheme, similar to that described above for FIGS. 11 and 12, the voltages passed to OUT and NOUT will be selected from combinations of the bias voltage inputs 1 to j. For example, for three bits of digital input and j equal to 8, table B summarizes OUT and NOUT outputs and the bias voltage (BV) input at OUT and NOUT., 96683=In an implementation, transistor 1166 is a native type NMOS transistor, which means this device is not doped with a threshold adjust implant (or other implant) as are the other standard enhancement type NMOS transistors on the integrated circuit. The threshold voltage (VT) of a native NMOS device will be typically about 0.4 volts. In comparison, a standard NMOS device will have a VT typically about 0.7 volts. The VT of device 1166 provides the voltage difference between the output lines 1143 and 1145. A native device is used for transistor 1166 in order to obtain about a 0.4-volt difference between the two bias voltages 1143 and 1145. Depending on the particular implementation and the desired separation between the bias voltages, other types of devices, diodes, bias current level, and transistors with different VTs may be used in place of a native device. For example, if a 0.7-volt difference between bias voltages 1143 and 1145 were desired, a standard NMOS transistor may be used as a device 1166. Two or more transistors may be connected in series and placed between nodes 1143 and 1145 to give a greater voltage separation between the bias voltages. A 1.4-volt difference is obtained by using two standard NMOS transistors between nodes 1143 and 1145., 114397=The common mode feedback circuit 1430 operates as described above for the previous described digital reference generator implementation., 111655=Bias generator 1325 generates bias voltages VB1 to VBj. The number j of bias voltages will vary depending on which analog equivalent voltage are selected. To generate j bias voltages, impedances R1 to Rj are connected in series with a current source 1350 between the supply voltages. This implementation is similar to the bias voltage generator circuit 1160 in FIG. 11. The bias voltages VB1 to VBj are taken at taps between the impedances., 104870=The digital reference generator has a digital data input circuit 1320, bias voltage generator circuit 1325, and common mode feedback circuit 1330. Digital data input circuit 1320 receives n digital bits of input and a number of bias voltage inputs. Each of the bias voltage inputs is at a unique voltage level. Digital data input circuit 1320 generates the 2n different analog equivalent outputs at OUT and NOUT., 112691=As was discussed above, common mode feedback circuit 1330 is used to adjust the current source 1350 based on the OUT and NOUT voltages in order to keep the OUT and NOUT voltages centered about a signal ground., 89755=The digital reference generator includes a digital data input circuit 1110 and bias voltage generator circuit 1160. Digital data is input at a digital data input 1114. An analog output equivalent to the digital data is output at OUT 1147 and NOUT 1149. OUT and NOUT are differential outputs of the digital reference generator. A differential output signal for the digital reference generator is needed in the case when the analog signal path in the integrated circuit is differential. In a memory integrated circuit such as in FIG. 4, OUT and NOUT are connected to write circuit 414, and more specifically, a level shifter circuit., 112934=FIG. 14 shows another implementation of a digital reference generator. The digital reference generator provides analog equivalent outputs OUT and NOUT that will be used by the write circuitry to store a digital value in the analog cell. This digital reference generator has a digital data input circuit 1420 and common mode feedback circuit 1430. A number of impedances R1 to Rn and a current source 1433 are connected in series between the supply voltages. In parallel with each resistor is a switch 1435. OUT and NOUT are taken from two taps in the impedance chain. There will be any number of impedances and parallel switches between OUT and NOUT. Also there may be impedances between OUT and NOUT without parallel switches, such as impedance K., 102342=In operation, the common mode feedback circuit regulates and adjusts the CMF voltage based on OUT and NOUT inputs. SENS, NSENS, SET, and NSET are switch control inputs connected to clock signals. NSENS is the complementary signal of SENS, and NSET is the complementary signal of NSET. Consequently, transmission gates 1213, 1215, 1217, 1223, 1225, and 1227 are repeatedly switching based on the SENS, NSENS, SET, and NSET clock signals., 101439=SG is a signal ground voltage. In an implementation, this is connected to a 1.23-volt bias voltage generated by a bandgap voltage generator. Other voltages may be selected to fit a particular application. SG is the R or center voltage about which bias voltages 1143 and 1145 will be centered. Typically, the same SG voltage is used for other circuits such as the write and read circuits on the integrated circuit to provide a consistent reference. For example, this will allow the digital reference generator to track similarly with the write circuit or level shifter up circuit and with read circuit or level shifter down circuit. The complete circuit system will reliably operate despite variations in operating conditions and process.}",
