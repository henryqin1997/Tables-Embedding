Various modifications, such as the dimensions of the test device and the amounts and types of chemicals used in the colorimetric analysis, may occur to those skilled in the art without departing form the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. With reference to the above description of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, in operation, a reagent, preferably chromium trioxide, is deposited into the detection well 86 and is absorbed by the glass fiber paper 98. A control sample and a sample of the biological fluid under test are deposited into the control and specimen wells 82, 84, respectively, using a swab, a pipet, or other fluid transfer means. Once inside the wells 82, 84, the control specimen is wicked across the first strip of paper 102 toward the first concentration chamber 96, and the sample of the biological fluid under test is wicked across the second strip of paper 104 toward the second concentration chamber 98. The strips 102, 104 volatilize the alcohol in the specimens and the vapors are focused upward by the concentration chambers 96, 98 through the passages 92, 94 in the detection well 86. Upon contact with the reagent, alcohol vapors contained in the",
