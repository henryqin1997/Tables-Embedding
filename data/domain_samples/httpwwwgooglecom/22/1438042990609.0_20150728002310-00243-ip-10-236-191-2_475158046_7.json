Although a number of embodiments have been described, it is to be appreciated that these embodiments are provided for illustrative purpose only and is not for the purpose of limiting the invention. In accordance with these principles numerous modifications and alternatives may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The practice of the present invention permits the surface mounting of transformers, especially when utilized with automated assembly mechanisms. The economic advantages derived results from not needing to physically wind the transformer windings and from reduced labor costs due to automated assembly. Additionally, the design flexibility permits numerous design modifications to be achieved to meet various design and safety requirements. Further, the physical parameters of the transformer can be tightly controlled for precise and accurate design constraints, such as the control of leakage inductance by controlling the geometry of the size, shape and material of the transformer components. Also, the present invention improves heat dissipation from the transformer due to the exposure of a significant surface of the core of the transformer. A slightly modified design of the concentric surface mounted transformer of FIG. 12 is shown in FIG. 13. In this embodiment, a third winding 59 is placed atop winding 58 and coupling is made to the tracings 60 on the opposite side of the PC board 56. In",
