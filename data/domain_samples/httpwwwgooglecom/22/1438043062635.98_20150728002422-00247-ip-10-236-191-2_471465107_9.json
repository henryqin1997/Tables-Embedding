After the panel had cooled, a second film of Tie-coat B2 was cast in 10 mils wet thickness over the first coating and the panel again baked at 200\ufffd F. for 30 minutes. When cooled again to room temperature, a coating of sodium hyaluronate was applied from 0.5% aqueous solution at 200 mils thickness and allowed to dry at room temperature overnight. The next day, the panel was immersed in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and n-butyl acetate and again dried at room temperature in a stream of clean air. The polysaccharide film was then crosslinked with Desmodur N as described in Example 1., 34410=The resulting panel was clear, colorless and caused no distortion of transmitted light. In the conventional knife test, the adhesion of the composite film among its component layers was judged to be excellent. The surface was readily and uniformly wetted by water, and the wet surface was uniformly lubricious in the hockey puck test. Long soaking in water caused no delamination or other visible change. Notes: 1. Tie-coat A is a copolymer comprising ethyl methacrylate and one mol-percent of methacrylic acid, supplied at 30% solids in xylol/n-butyl acetate (75/25). 2. Tie-coat B is a copolymer comprising methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and acrylic acid (mol ratios, 50:40:8:2, respectively) supplied in xylol/Cellosolve acetate (70/30).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations CATALYSTS ##STR2## POLYISOCYANATES ##STR1## Applicants submit examples of polyisocyanates and catalysts usable in the foregoing, as follows: A flat cast panel was made by copolymerizing 77.5 g (0.5 mol) of isocyanatoethyl methacrylate and 953 g. (9.5 mol) of carefully dried methyl methacrylate in a mold that had been dried for 2 hours at 115\ufffd C. and then continuously flushed with dry nitrogen while cooling to suitable temperature for filling with the monomer mix. The panel was coated with a 100-mil wet film of 0.5% aqueous hyaluronic acid. After drying overnight at room temperature, the film was uniformly sprayed with a 1% solution of dibutyltin dilaurate in n-butyl acetate. Grafting reactions between the polysaccharide and panel base occurred spontaneously overnight, with the result that the polysaccharide film was chemically and permanently bonded to the underlying polymer. The possibility of later hydrolysis of remaining isocyanato groups not involved in grafting at the interface, generating undesirable bubbles of carbon dioxide imbedded in the plastic, was originally of concern. However, experience showed no such disadvantage, perhaps because any such by-products were able to migrate through the polymer and escape without causing visible damage. EXAMPLE 12 A Lexan polycarbonate panel was coated with a solution copolymer of methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and acrylic acid, to which had been added 10% by weight, based on solids content of the polymer solution, of catalyzed Desmodur",
