As before, at step A MS 102 has established a connection with UNC 140 in the normal manner. At step B, a network-initiated update event occurs. At step C, the UNC sends a URR REGISTER UPDATE DOWNLINK message 1002, respective embodiments of which are detailed in message formats 1002A and 1002B of FIGS. 12A and 12B. The URR REGISTER UPDATE DOWNLINK message format 1002A includes a Redirected UNC Address IE, a Redirected SGW Address IE, and a Status IE. The Status IE provides an indication from the UNC on whether location services are available (based on knowledge of the AP's geographical location). This can be used to trigger an icon or other display on the MS. In one embodiment, possible values are:}",

The Multi Rate Configuration IE appears if the Mode of the First Channel IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. it is different from the MultiRateconfiguration used in the serving cell. If the Mode of the First Channel IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and this IE is not included, then the MS shall assume that the MultiRateconfiguration has not changed., 194023=The UNC SDP (Session Description Protocol) IE is used for specifying information used to implement the uplink (from MS to UNC) portion of the voice bearer channel. For example, this information may include the network address (IP address), the transport address (port), the transport protocol (e.g., RTP over UDP), the sample size (e.g., 20 ms) and the payload type (among other things). In one embodiment the format of this IE's values are defined in RFCs 2327, 3551 and 3267. The use of a single IE to contain this information is merely exemplary, as such information may also be provided via separate IEs. The optional CIPHER Mode Setting IE appears when the ciphering mode is changed after the MS has switched to the assigned channel. If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the channel assignment procedure.}",
