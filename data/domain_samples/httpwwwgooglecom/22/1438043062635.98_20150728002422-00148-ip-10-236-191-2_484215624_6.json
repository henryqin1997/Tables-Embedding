Description of the related art including information disclosed under 37 C.F.R. \ufffd1.97-1.99, 50431=Preferably, the E1 interface circuit card 26 interfacing to the multiport sending switch 30 is a thirty-two channel digital interface. The thirty-two channels of the interface often are in differing states during progress of a telephonic call. For example, some telephonic calls on certain channels are fully established, while other telephonic calls on other channels are in the process of establishing a call (i.e. in call set up), and furthermore, other telephonic calls are in an idle state on other channels. The E1 interface circuit card 26 preferably handles thirty-two channels and establishes a PCM delay IN (or ON) for some channels while establishing a PCM delay OUT (or OFF) for other channels. While the E1 interface circuit card 26 of the present invention can generally be implemented in numerous types and sizes of telecommunication systems, it is preferably employed in a telecommunication system of the type shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/770,197 of Jones et al. entitled \"Multichannel Telephonic Switching Network With Different Signaling Formats and Connect/PBX Treatment Selectable For Each Channel\", filed Oct. 2, 1991; U.S. Pat.

No. 4,627,047 of Pitroda et al. entitled \"Integrated Voice and Data Telecommunications Switching System\", issued Dec. 2, 1986, to which reference should be made for details., 53059=The E1 interface circuit card 26 is shown, FIG. 2, with the multichannel link 28 interconnecting the multiport sending switch 30, FIG. 1. The line interface unit, or LIU, 36 connects the E1 line interface circuit 26 to the multichannel link of the E1 line 28. The LIU 36 provides conversion between E1 line signal levels and coding as defined by standard CCITT (Consultative Committee on the International Telegraphy and Telephony) specifications and standard TTL (transistor logic) level signals for connection to the Mitel MT8979 transceiver 38. The LIU 36 further provides isolation of the E1 interface circuit card 26 from potential hazardous energy on the E1 line 28. For further information on standard E1 line signaling specifications reference should be made to Sections G.703, G.704 and G.732 of CCITT Blue Book Vol. III--Fascicle III.4 \"General Aspects of Digital Transmission Systems\", Geneva, 1972., 33315=Digital telephonic switching systems employing a multiport switch having a central control circuit for distributing information received over a multichannel link from another sending switch are well known. It is also known in such telephonic switching systems to have a distributed architecture in which the processing of information is performed at a variety of peripheral circuits, and the resultant data is sent to the central control circuit for further processing with the data received from other multiport switches. A distributed architecture is advantageous in digital telephonic switching systems since distributed processing is often an efficient means of enhancing computer processing power by having each peripheral circuit preferably devoted to a specialized task. Examples of such telephonic switching systems are shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/770,197 of Jones et al. entitled \"Multichannel Telephonic Switching Network With Different Signaling Formats and Connect/PBX Treatment Selectable For Each Channel\", filed Oct. 2, 1991, now U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been given, it should be appreciated that many variations can be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Once the bus maintenance unit breaks the connection between the seized channel and the channel indicated by the DTMF tones in step 122, the method proceeds to step 134, FIG. 6B, in which the PCM path temporary delay is inserted for a predetermined interval on the identified channel at the E1 interface circuit card 26, FIG. 1. The temporary delay for the sending of data to the peripheral circuits of the receiving switch remains intact on the designated channel. In this alternative method, the delay is removed only upon the connection of a call between the sending switch 30, FIG. 1, and the receiving switch 12 as discussed with respect to step 114, FIG. 6A. The temporary delay is re-established in step 134, FIG. 6B, in response to the termination of the call. Referring to FIG. 6B, the flow chart illustrates the procedural steps within the telecommunication system 10, FIG. 1, of the preferred embodiment of the invention for the method of maintaining the temporary delay for the sending of data transmitted from the sending switch to a peripheral circuit of the receiving switch and removing the temporary delay in response to the connection of a",
