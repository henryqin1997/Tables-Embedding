Extent of binding to CD4 was determined using 1 \u03bcg of Q425, a murine anti-CD4 mAb IgG. Healey, D., et al., (1990) J. Exp. Med. 172, 1233-1242. Cells were harvested and washed and incubated with oligonucleotide as above. After a 30 min incubation at room temperature with antibody, the cells were washed and incubated with 100 \u03bcL of media containing 5 \u03bcg of goat F (ab')2 anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). The cells were incubated 30 min, washed and associated fluorescence determined as above. Results shown in FIG. 6 show that ISIS 5320 blocks binding of an antibody specific for the V3 loop of gp120 (solid line), but not antibodies specific for CD44 (even dashes) or CD4 (uneven dashes). The percent relative fluorescence units (RFU) vs. increasing concentration of ISIS 5320 (filled triangle) and scrambled control (circles) is also shown in FIG. 6., 12898=This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application U.S. Ser. No. 07/954,185 filed Sep. 29, 1992 now abandoned., 15004=Sarin and coworkers have also used chemically modified antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the HIV cap and splice donor/acceptor sites. P. S. Sarin, S. Agrawal, M. P. Civeira, J. Goodchild, T. Ikeuchi, P. C. Zamecnik, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988, 85, 7448. Zaia and coworkers have also used an antisense oligonucleotide analog targeted to a splice acceptor site to inhibit HIV. J. A. Zaia, J. J. Rossi, G. J. Murakawa, P. A. Spallone, D. A. Stephens, B. E. Kaplan, J. Virol. 1988, 62, 3914. Matsukura and coworkers have synthesized antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the initiation of translation of the HIV rev gene mRNA. M. Matsukura, K. Shinozuka, G. Zon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1987, 84, 7706; R. L. Letsinger, G. R. Zhang, D. K. Sun, T. Ikeuchi, P. S. Sarin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989, 86, 6553. Mori and coworkers have used a different antisense oligonucleotide analog targeted to the same region as Matsukura. K. Mori, C. Boiziau, C. Cazenave, Nucleic Acids Res. 1989, 17, 8207. Shibahara and coworkers have used antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to a splice acceptor site as well as the reverse transcriptase primer binding site. S. Shibahara, S. Mukai, H. Morisawa, H. Nakashima, S. Kobayashi, N. Yamamoto, Nucl. Acids Res. 1989, 17, 239. Letsinger and coworkers have synthesized and tested a oligonucleotide analogs with conjugated cholesterol targeted to a splice site. K. Mori, C. Boiziau, C. Cazenave, Nucleic Acids Res. 1989, 17, 8207. Stevenson and Iversen have conjugated polylysine to antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the splice donor and the 5'-end of the first exon of the HIV tat gene. M. Stevenson, P. L. Iversen, J. Gen. Virol. 1989, 70, 2673. Buck and coworkers have described the use of phosphatemethylated DNA oligonucleotides targeted to HIV mRNA and DNA. H. M. Buck, L. H. Koole, M. H. P. van Gendersen, L. Smith, J. L. M. C. Green, S. Jurriaans and J. Goudsmit, Science 1990, 248, 208-212. These prior attempts at inhibiting HIV activity have largely focused on the nature of the chemical modification used in the oligonucleotide analog., 42219=Direct binding to gp120 was assayed using immobilized gp120 from a CD4 capture ELISA kit (American Bio-technologies). Biotinylated oligonucleotides were incubated in a volume of 100 \u03bcL with immobilized gp120. Following a 1 hour incubation wells were washed and 200 \u03bcL of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Gibco BRL) diluted 1:1000 in PBS added to each well. After a 1 h incubation at room temperature wells were washed and PNPP substrate (Pierce) added. Plates were incubated at 37\ufffd C. and absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 ELISA plate reader. T2 G4 T2 -biotin binds to immobilized gp120 with a Kd of less than 1 \u03bcM. T2 A4 T2 -biotin had a Kd of approximately 260 \u03bcM., 37208=Oligonucleotides were screened in an acute HIV-1 infection assay which measures protection from HIV-induced cytopathic effects. The CEM-SS cell line; Nara, P. L. & Fischinger, P. J. (1988) Nature 332,469-470; was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 units mL-1), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg mL-1). The antiviral assay, using XTT-tetrazolium to quantirate drug-induced protection from HIV-induced cell killing has been described. White, E. L., Buckheit, Jr., R. W., Ross, L. J., Germany, J. M., Andries, K., Pauwels, R., Janssen, P. A. J., Shannon, W. M. & Chirigos, M. A. (1991) Antiviral Res. 16, 257-266., 65005=ELISA assays were performed to determine whether ISIS 5320 was capable of blocking the interaction between CD4 and gp120 (data not shown). Addition of increasing amounts of ISIS 5320 decreased binding of CD4 to immobilized gp120; 50% of binding was inhibited at a concentration of approximately 2.5 \u03bcM. The control oligonucleotide (5' TGTGTGTG3') had no effect on the CD4/gp120 interaction. These results were confirmed in a gp120-capture ELISA assay in which the microtiter plates were coated with CD4 (IC50 approximately 20 \u03bcM). Compounds that bind to the V3 loop of gp120 can inhibit fusion without completely blocking the interaction between CD4 and gp120. Callahan, L., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 1543-1550. Unlike ISIS 5320, dextran sulfate does not prevent the gp120/CD4 interaction in an ELISA assay even at concentrations 10,000-fold above its IC50 Callahan, L., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 1543-1550., 43502=The site of ISIS 5320 binding to gp120 was determined by competition for binding of antisera specific for various regions of the protein. Rusche, J. R., et al., (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 6924-6928; Matsushita, S., et al., (1988) J. Virol. 62, 2107-2114; Meuller, W. T., et al., (1986) Science 234, 1392-1395. gp120-coated microtiter plates were incubated with oligonucleotide at a concentration of 25 \u03bcM for 1 h at room temperature. Antisera was added at a dilution of 1:250 and the plates incubated 40 min. The plates were washed four times with PBS and amount of antibody bound quantitated by incubating with protein A/G-alkaline phosphatase (1:5000, Pierce) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After one wash with PBS, substrate was added and absorbance at 405 nm was measured., 49522=Although the oligonucleotide ISIS 5320 has a phosphorothioate backbone, evidence suggests that it adopts a four-stranded, parallel helix as do phosphodiester oligonucleotides of similar sequence. Cheong, C. & Moore, P. B. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 8406-8414; Aboul-ela, F., et al., (1992) Nature 360, 280-282; Sarma, M. H., et al., (1992) J. Biomol. Str. Dyn. 9, 1131-1153; and Wang, Y. & Patel, D. J. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 8112-8119. The oligonucleotides in the combinatorial library pools that show antiviral activity (Table 1) and oligonucleotide ISIS 5320 form multimeric complexes as shown by size exclusion chromatography (FIG. 1). The retention time of the complex was that expected for a tetrameric species based on plots of retention time vs. log molecular weight of phosphorothioate oligonucleotide standards (data not shown). The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the multimeric form of oligonucleotide ISIS 5320 is characterized by a peak at 265 nm and a trough at 242 nm (data not shown), similar to the spectra reported by others for deoxyoligonucleotide tetramers. Sarma, M. H., et al., (1992) J. Biomol. Str. Dyn. 9, 1131-1153; Lu, M., Guo, Q. & Kallenbach, N. R. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2455-2459; Jin, R., et al., (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 8832-8836 and Hardin, C. C., et al., (1992) Biochemistry 31, 833-841. It has been reported that when two phosphodiester oligonucleotides of dissimilar size, but each containing four or five guanosines in a row, are incubated together, five distinct aggregate species are formed on a non-denaturing gel Sen, D. & Gilbert, W. (1990) Nature 344, 410-414 and Kim, J., Cheong, C. & Moore, P. B. (1991) Nature 351, 331-332. In principle, only a tetramer of parallel strands can explain this pattern. When this experiment was performed with two phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, the antiviral oligonucleotide ISIS 5320 and a 21-residue oligonucleotide containing 4 guanosines near the 3' end (5' T13 G4 T4 3' ; SEQ ID NO: 4), the five aggregate species expected for a parallel-stranded tetramer were observed on a non-denaturing gel (FIG. 2). Example 7, 27316=Virus and cell membrane fusion is initiated by binding of gp120, the major envelope protein of HIV, to its cellular receptor. The mechanism by which membrane fusion occurs is not well understood, but a particular region of gp120, the V3 loop, is essential. (1992) Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1992, eds. Myers, G. et al. (Theoretical Biology and Biophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N. Mex.). The V3 loop maintains a high percentage of positively charged amino acids across all HIV strains; Callahan, L., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 1543-1550; and the extent of virus-mediated cell fusion and rapid viral replication have been correlated with increased cationic composition of the V3 loop. Fouchier, R. A. M., et al., (1992) J. Virol. 66, 3183-3187. In vitro studies showed that the G-quartet structure bound directly to the V3 loop of gp120. Thus the G-quartet structure provides a novel scaffold to present the backbone groups such as phosphorothioate groups in a favorable orientation for binding to the highly cationic V3 loop., 58952=The tetramer form of ISIS 5320 also inhibited binding or fusion of infectious virus to a CD4+ cell. The assay was performed as described in Example 4. HeLa-CD4-LTR-B-gal cells; Kimpton, J. & Emerman, M. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 2232-2239; were incubated for 15 minutes with oligonucleotide at 37\ufffd C. prior to the addition of virus. After 1 hour, the cells were washed to remove unbound virus and oligonucleotide. During the incubation period, virus binding and membrane fusion events occur. Srivastava, K. K., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 3900-3902. Extent of infection after 48 hours was determined by quantitation of syncytia and ELISA as previously described in Kimpton, J. & Emerman, M. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 2232-2239. At a ISIS 5320 concentration of approximately 0.4 \u03bcM, virus production was reduced to 50% of control (data not shown). Heat-denatured ISIS 5320 and 5' TGTGTGTG3' showed inhibition of binding at 5 \u03bcM oligonucleotide concentration. These fusion and binding inhibition experiments strongly suggest that the tetramer form of ISIS 5320 inhibits viral infection at a very early step, either during binding of the virion to the cell or during the early events of fusion and internalization of the virion., 23565=The selection strategy known as synthetic unrandomization of randomized fragments (SURF); Ecker, D. J., Vickers, T. A., Hanecak, R., Driver, V. & Anderson, K. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 1853-1856; is employed to screen libraries of oligonucleotides for activity such as anti-viral activity. This type of selection technique; Geysen, H. M., et al. (1986) Mol. Immunol. 23, 709-715; Houghten, R. A., et al., (1991) Nature 354, 84-86; and Owens, R. A., et al., (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 181,402-408; involves iterative synthesis and screening of increasingly simplified sets of oligonucleotide pools. Oligonucleotide analogs can be used in the libraries because this technique does not require enzymes either to synthesize the randomized pools or to amplify the active molecular species. The use of nuclease-resistant oligonucleotide analogs allows screening for functional activities in cell culture systems in which unmodified RNA or DNA is rapidly degraded. Assay of compound libraries in the presence of whole viruses and cells provides the opportunity to screen \"a library of compounds\" against \"a library of targets,\" potentially inhibiting any step in the viral life cycle. Since functional inhibition of viral infection rather than nucleic acid binding is the selection criterion, the chances are enhanced that a useful compound will be identified., 17154=Guanosine nucleotides, both as mononucleotides and in oligonucleotides or polynucleotides, are able to form arrays known as guanine quartets or G-quartets. For review, see Williamson, J. R., (1993) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 3:357-362. G-quartets have been known for years, although interest has increased in the past several years because of their possible role in telomere structure and function. One analytical approach to this area is the study of structures formed by short oligonucleotides containing clusters of guanosines, such as GGGGTTTTGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 1), GGGTTTTGGG (SEQ ID NO: 2), UGGGGU, GGGGGTTTTT (SEQ ID NO: 3), TTAGGG, TTGGGG and others reviewed by Williamson; TTGGGGGTT described by Shida et al. (Shida, T., Yokoyama, K., Tamai, S., and J. Sekiguchi (1991) Chem. pharm. Bull. 39:2207-2211), among others., 62890=The oligonucleotide ISIS 5320 also interferes with binding of antisera directed against the V3 loop region of gp120, but not to antisera specific for another region of the protein. Rusche, J. R., et al., (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 6924-6928; Matsushita, S., et al., (1988) J. Virol. 62, 2107-2114 and Meuller, W. T., et al., (1986) Science 234, 1392-1395. The control oligonucleotide had no effect on antibody binding., 30151=Some preferred oligonucleotides useful in some aspects of the present invention may include intersugar linkages such as phosphotriesters, methyl phosphonates, chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages or short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages including those with CH2 --NH--O-- CH2, CH2 --N(CH3)--O--CH2, CH2 --O--N(CH3)--CH2, CH2 --N(CH3)--N(CH3)--CH2 and O--N(CH3)--CH2 --CH2 backbones (where phosphodiester is O--P--O--CH2). Oligonucleotides having morpholino backbone structures may also be useful in some aspects of the invention. Summerton, J. E. and Weller, D. D., U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,506. In other preferred embodiments, such as the protein-nucleic acid (PNA) backbone, the phosphodiester backbone of the oligonucleotide may be replaced with a polyamide backbone, the bases being bound directly or indirectly to the aza nitrogen atoms of the polyamide backbone. P. E. Nielsen, M. Egholm, R. H. Berg, O. Buchardt, Science 1991, 254, 1497., 61839=The V3 loop of gp120 (amino acids 303-338) is considered the principal neutralizing domain of the protein; peptides derived from this region elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies that block viral infection by blocking fusion. (1992) Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1992, eds. Myers, G. et al. (Theoretical Biology and Biophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N. Mex.). The V3 loop of gp120 is also the site of action of anionic polysaccharides, such as dextran sulfate, that inhibit viral binding, replication and syncytium formation. Callahan, L., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 1543-1550. Dextran sulfate is a competitive inhibitor of binding of biotinylated ISIS 5320 to gp120 immobilized on a microtiter plate. About 50% of the tetramer binding was inhibited at a dextran sulfate concentration between 10 and 50 \u03bcg mL-1 (FIG. 5). Dextran sulfate has been shown to inhibit binding of gp120-specific antibodies to gp120 in this concentration range. Callahan, L., et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65, 1543-1550., 13707=Prior attempts to inhibit HIV by various approaches have been made by a number of researchers. For example, Zamecnik and coworkers have used phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the reverse transcriptase primer site and to splice donor/acceptor sites, P. C. Zamecnik, J. Goodchild, Y. Taguchi, P.S. Sarin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1986, 83, 4143. Goodchild and coworkers have made phosphodiester antisense compounds targeted to the initiation sites for translation, the cap site, the polyadenylation signal, the 5' repeat region and a site between the gag and pol genes. J. Goodchild, S. Agrawal, M. P. Civeira, P. S. Sarin, D. Sun, P. C. Zamecnik, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988, 85, 5507. Agrawal and coworkers have used chemically modified antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the cap and splice donor/acceptor sites. S. Agrawal, J. Goodchild, M. P. Civeira, A. H. Thornton, P. S. Sarin, P. C. Zamecnik, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 1988, 85, 7079. Agrawal and coworkers have used antisense oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the splice donor/acceptor site inhibit HIV infection in early infected and chronically infected cells. S. Agrawal, T. Ikeuchi, D. Sun, P. S. Sarin, A. Konopka, J. Maizel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 1989, 86, 7790., 63339=The tetramer also binds to the V3 loop of gp120 expressed on cells. Binding of a monoclonal antibody specific the V3 loop of gp120 was inhibited by ISIS 5320 at a concentration of approximately 0.5 \u03bcM (Ki) determined using immunofluorescent flow cytometry (FIG. 6). The control oligonucleotide had little effect on binding at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcM. Neither oligonucleotide significantly decreased binding of antibodies directed to human CD44 on the same cells or to CD4; Healey, D., et al., (1990) J. Exp. Med. 172, 1233-1242. on CEM-T4 cells., 40129=The tetramer formed was parallel-stranded as determined by analysis of the complexes formed by the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides having T2 G4 T2 and 5' T13 G4 T4 3' (SEQ ID NO: 4). Each oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5' end with 32 P. Each sample contained 125 \u03bcM unlabeled and 15 pM radioactively labeled amounts of one or both of the oligonucleotides. The samples were heated in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 200 mM KCl in a boiling water bath for 15 min then incubated for 48 h at 4\ufffd C. Samples were analyzed by autoradiography of a 20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide: bis) gel run at 4\ufffd C. in 1\ufffd TBE running buffer. FIG. 2. Lane 1: ISIS 5320 (T2 G4 T2) alone. Lane 2: ISIS 5320 incubated with T13 G4 G4 (SEQ ID NO: 4). Lane 3: T.sub. 13 G4 T4 (SEQ ID NO: 4) alone. The pattern, five aggregate species, is characteristic of parallel-stranded tetramer., 18510=Guanosine-rich oligonucleotides have been observed in superstructures formed by G-rich oligonucleotides with terminal guanosines. Lu, M., Guo, Q. & Kallenbach, N. R. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2455-2459; Sen, D. & Gilbert, W. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 65-70. The role of the multimeric structures in antiviral activity is not known and the structures were not characterized further.}",

The tetramer provides a rigid, compact structure with a high thio-anionic charge density that may be the basis for its strong interaction with the cationic V3 loop. Although the V3 loop is a hypervariable region, the functional requirement for cationic residues in the V3 loop may limit the virus's capability to become resistant to dense polyanionic inhibitors. Compounds derived from the G-quartet structural motif are potential candidates for use in anti-HIV chemotherapy. ELISA assays were performed to determine whether ISIS 5320 was capable of blocking the interaction between CD4 and gp120",
