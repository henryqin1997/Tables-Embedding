    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{357263=After the step 2412, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to steps 2414 and 2416, wherein the variables \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d and \u201csum_of diff are each reset to zero. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, after the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is set to true at the step 2410 in response to one of the landing criteria of the routine 2110 being met, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 requires again that one of the landing criteria be met, this time within the next six iterations of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408. This is why, at the step 2122 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, it is determined whether the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is greater than seven, and why the qualification flag is set to false at the step 2126 if more than seven qualifying cycles have elapsed., 355400=When, at the step 2402, it is determined that the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is not yet true, the \u201cis landing qualified\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2410, wherein the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is set to true. Because the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 is entered only when at least one of the several landing criteria of the routine 2110 has been met, the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is set to true in connection with the step 2410 only after at least one of these landing criteria has been met. As explained in more detail below, the setting of the \u201cqualification flag\u201d to true in connection with the step 2410 enables a heel-strike event 702 to possibly be qualified during a subsequent iteration of the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112., 372177=When, at the step 2802, it is determined that the heel-to-heel Ts value Ts(HH)\u22121 is not greater than the heel-to-heel step value Ts(HH), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2806, wherein it is determined whether the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH)\u22121 is less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH)., 341827=Similarly, at the step 2116, the value of Ta is set to be equal to the current value of the Ta timer minus the current value of the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer. Therefore, the value of Ta also takes into account the time at which the first of several samples used to satisfy one of the landing criteria was taken. The Ta timer may have been reset at the step 1820 of the routine 1708 (FIG. 18), or it may have been reset at the step 1426 of the primary routine 1400., 385973=When, at the steps 3102 and 3104, it is determined that the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than eight seconds greater than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to a step 3110, wherein the two most recent Tc values obtained (including the current Tc value) are averaged to obtain a new value of Tcave, and the routine 2610 then terminates., 249988=As discussed above, each line in the graph of FIG. 11 can be translated into a corresponding line in the graphs of FIG. 13 (e.g., by selecting a few reasonable values of Tc and Pace, calculating values of 1/Tc and Speed based thereupon, plotting points corresponding to the calculated values, and interpolating a line between the points so plotted). Therefore, because a single calibration point can identify the position of each of the curves 802 and 804 in the graph of FIG. 11, a single calibration point can also be used to identify the position of each of the curves 1302 and 1304 in the graph of FIG. 13. In this regard, it should be understood that, while each single calibration \u201cvalue\u201d used in connection with the graph of FIG. 11 identifies a corresponding degree of rotation of one of the lines 802 and 804 about its pivot point, each of the \u201csingle\u201d calibration values used in connection with the graph of FIG. 13 identifies both a corresponding degree of rotation and a corresponding degree of translation of one of the lines 1302 and 1304 with respect to the Speed and 1/Tc axes of the graph., 366838=After routine 2610, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a step 2611, wherein it is determined whether the user 112 is walking. This determination may, for example, be made solely upon the most recently measured Tc value. According to one embodiment, when the most recent Tc value is greater than \u201c420\u201d milliseconds, it is determined at step 2611 that the user 112 is walking. On the other hand, when the most recent Tc value is less than \u201c420\u201d milliseconds, it is determined at the step 2611 that the user 112 is running., 347164=When, at the step 2206, it is determined that the sum of the last three differences is greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2208, wherein it is determined whether the first one of the last three differences is greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d, 344267=When, at during the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112, it is determined that a heel-strike event 702 has not yet been confirmed, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds first to the routines 1504 and 1506 (discussed above), and then back to the step 2102, wherein another sample of the signals 710 and 712 is taken., 326150=As shown in FIG. 18, the routine 1708 begins at a step 1802 wherein it is determined whether the most recent sample taken during the step 1702 is greater than the next most recent sample taken at the step 1702., 306104=FIG. 14 shows and illustrative example of a primary routine 1400 that may be performed by the processor 422 of the foot-mounted unit 102 (FIG. 4) in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The processor 422 may, for example, execute a plurality of instructions stored in the memory 424 or another computer-readable medium to perform the various method steps and routines of the primary routine 1400. Alternatively, of course, the primary routine 1400 can be implemented using dedicated hardware or firmware, or any combination of hardware, firmware and software capable of achieving a similar result., 309422=When, during the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404, a toe-off event is identified, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1406, wherein a foot contact time (Tc) is recorded based upon a measured time difference between the time of the identified toe-off even 704 and the time of a heel-strike event 702 previously identified in connection with a \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 of the primary routine 1400 (as described below). It should be appreciated that, during the initial cycle of the primary routine 1400, the first identified toe-off event 704 does not follow a previously identified heel-strike event 702. Therefore, the initial recorded Tc value will be inaccurate. In light of this, the primary routine 1400 may, for example, be permitted to cycle until data for at least one complete footstep has been accumulated before any Tc or Ts values are recorded or used (at the step 1406 or elsewhere) in performing distance, pace, speed, and/or energy expenditure calculations based thereupon. Alternatively, a \u201cdummy\u201d Tc value may be recorded during the initial iteration of the step 1406., 336429=After the step 2101, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to a step 2102, wherein a sample of the signals 712 and 710 (discussed above) is taken., 389295=When, at the steps 3116 and 3118, is determined that the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than four milliseconds less than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to the step 3120, wherein up to the four most recent Tc values are averaged to obtain a new value of Tcave, and the routine 2610 then terminates., 380172=As shown, the routine 2608 begins at a step 3002, wherein it is determined whether the measured Tc value is less than \u201c420\u201d milliseconds., 350571=When, at the step 2212, it is determined that three of the last four differences are not greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2220, wherein it is determined whether the difference between any two of the last four samples is greater than \u201c40\u201d levels (using the scale of 0-256 levels discussed above in connection with FIG. 7)., 354000=When, at the step 2306, it is determined that five consecutive valid steps have been identified, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 proceeds to a step 2308, wherein the current value of the variable \u201cneg_val\u201d is averaged with all other values of the variable \u201cneg_val\u201d that have been obtained during the last five footsteps taken by the user 112, thereby obtaining another variable \u201cave_neg_val.\u201d, 316556=After the routine 1402, the primary routine 1400 returns to the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 (discussed above)., 319925=When, at the step 1626, it is determined that the shutting down flag is currently true, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1628, wherein the shutting down flag is set to false, and the routine 1504 terminates., 341327=At the step 2114, the value of Ts is set to be equal to the current value of the Ts timer minus the current value of the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer. The Ts timer may have been preset to the value of the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer in connection with a step 2120 (described below) during a previous iteration of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, or may have been reset in connection with the step 1426 (discussed above) of the primary routine 1400., 348613=At the step 2212, it is determined whether three of the last four differences (i.e., the differences between consecutive ones of the last five samples) are greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d, 382642=When, at the steps 3008 and 3010, it is determined that the ratio of the measured Tc and Ts values falls both below the line 2906 a (step 3008) and above the line 2906 b (step 2910), the routine 2608 terminates., 387852=When, at the steps 3106 and 3108, it is determined that either the current Tc value or the next most recent Tc value is not more than eight milliseconds less than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to steps 3112 and 3114, wherein it is determined whether the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than four milliseconds greater than the currently-stored value of Tcave., 338585=When, at the step 2108, it is determined that the current step time (Ts) value has exceeded that maximum acceptable step time, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to the step 1420 of the primary routine 1400, as shown in FIG. 14., 379720=FIG. 30 is a flow diagram illustrating an example implementation of the routine 2608 of the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 shown in FIG. 26. Pursuant to the routine 2608, the values of Tc and Ts are checked individually to ensure that each falls within an acceptable range, and each ratio of these two values is checked as well to ensure that it falls within the bounds of the lines discussed above., 362262=When, at the step 2502, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is not true, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 proceeds to a step 2504, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has been false for more than sixty minutes., 385466=FIG. 31 is a flow diagram showing an illustrative implementation of the routine 2610 of the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 shown in FIG. 26. As shown, the routine 2610 begins at steps 3102 and 3104, wherein it is determined whether the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than eight seconds greater than the currently-stored value of Tcave (i.e., the average value of Tc over the last several steps)., 359212=When, at the step 2404, it is determined that the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is not greater than seven, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2406, wherein it is determined whether more than one qualifying cycle has elapsed since the \u201cqualification flag\u201d was set to true. In other words, the step 2406 prevents the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 from qualifying a heel-strike event 702 when a landing criterion is met only during two consecutive iterations of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408. Rather, the step 2406 requires the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 to undergo at least one iteration after a first landing criterion is met before a second landing criterion can be used to qualify a heel-strike event 702., 346715=When, at the step 2202, it is determined the difference between the two most recent samples is not greater than the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2206, wherein it is determined whether the sum of the last three differences (i.e., the three differences between consecutive ones of the last four samples) is greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d, 330449=As shown, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 beings at a step 1902, wherein it is determined whether the current sample is negative. As used herein, a \u201csample\u201d refers to a voltage difference between the signals 710 and 712 at a particular moment in time. With reference to FIG. 7, assuming that the signal 710 is exactly at level \u201c128,\u201d a sample would be positive if it were taken when the signal 712 is at a level greater than level \u201c128,\u201d and would be negative if it were taken when the signal is at a level less than level \u201c128.\u201d, 384031=When, at the step 3014, it is determined that the measured Ts value is not between \u201c700\u201d and \u201c1360\u201d milliseconds, the routine 2608 proceeds to the step 3020, wherein the measured Tc value is replaced with the next most recent Tc value, and the routine 2608 then terminates., 351492=When, at the step 2220, it is determined that no difference between any two of the last four samples is greater than \u201c40\u201d levels, the routine 2110 proceeds to the step 2122 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, as shown in FIG. 21., 361786=FIG. 25 is a flow diagram showing an example implementation of the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 of the primary routine 1400 (FIG. 14). As shown, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 begins at a step 2502, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is true., 365081=When, at the step 2604, it is determined that the \u201cstep error flag\u201d is false, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 terminates., 325261=When, at the step 1710, it is determined that an \u201cair signature\u201d has not yet been identified in the signals 710 and 712, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to the \u201cprocess button\u201d routine 1506 (discussed above), then to the \u201cprocess RF\u201d routine 1504 (also discussed above), and finally back to the step 1702, wherein another sample of the signals 710 and 712 is taken., 313340=When, at the step 1420, it is determined that it is not the third consecutive time that a heel-strike event 702 has not been identified during the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1422, wherein the value of Tc is set to the last recorded Tc value, rather than the current incorrect value, and the value of Ts is set to maximum allowable value of Ts (i.e., the threshold Ts value that caused the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 to \u201ckick out\u201d to the step 1420. The value of Ts is not replaced by a substitute value in this situation because it is desirable to use cumulative sum of all recorded Ts values as the total elapsed time of the outing, and such replacement would result in an error in this value., 363447=When, at the step 2506, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has been false for more than five minutes, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 proceeds to a step 2508, wherein the foot-mounted unit 102 is placed into a low-power sleep mode for approximately five seconds. Thus, whenever it is determined that the foot-mounted unit 102 has been inactive for a particular period of time (e.g., five minutes), it may be kept in a low-power mode, waking up only briefly every five seconds or so to determine whether any new activity can be identified., 317120=As shown, the routine 1402 begins at a step 1502, wherein it is determined whether the ignore time 708 has elapsed since the last heel-strike event 702., 321460=When, at the step 1616, it is determined that the button is no longer depressed, the routine 1504 terminates., 332552=When, at the step 1906, it is determined that the sample is not greater than the variable max_level_below\u20140, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to the step 1910, wherein it is determined whether: (1) the \u201cbelow\u20140\u201d counter has reached fifty milliseconds (ms), and (2) the variable max_level_below\u20140 is greater than seventeen., 351005=When, at the step 2220, it is determined that the difference between two of the last four samples is greater than \u201c40\u201d levels, the routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2222, wherein the variable \u201cdown correction value\u201d is set to be equal to a single sample period., 329858=When, at the step 1814, it is determined that the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is greater than 80% of the variable \u201cdiff_max,\u201d the routine 1708 proceeds to the step 1818 (discussed above), then to the step 1820 (also discussed above), and the routine 1708 then terminates., 388353=When, at the steps 3112 and 2114, it is determined that the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than four milliseconds greater than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to a step 3120, wherein up to four of the most recent Tc values are averaged to obtain a new value of Tcave, and the routine 2610 then terminates., 342507=After the step 2120, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to the step 1410 of the primary routine 1400, as shown in FIG. 14., 332086=When, at the step 1906, it is determined that the absolute value of the sample is greater than the variable max_level_below\u20140, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to a step 1908, wherein the variable max_level_below\u20140 is updated to be equal to the absolute value of the sample. After the step 1908, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to a step 1910 (discussed below)., 386448=When, at the steps 3102 and 3104, it is determined that either the current Tc value or the next most recent Tc value is not more than eight milliseconds greater than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to steps 3106 and 3108, wherein it is determined whether the current Tc value and the next most recent Tc value are each more than eight milliseconds less than the currently-stored value of Tcave., 333173=When, at the step 1910, it is determined that both of these conditions are met, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to a step 1912, wherein both the \u201cbelow\u20140\u201d counter and the variable max_level_below\u20140 are reset., 314161=When, at the step 1420, it is determined that it is the third consecutive time that a heel-strike event 702 has not been identified during the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1424, wherein the \u201cstep error flag\u201d (if false) is set to true to indicate that a step monitoring error has occurred. As discussed below, the \u201cstep error flag\u201d may be passed to the wrist-mounted unit 104, and used thereby to indicate an anomaly to the user 112., 321872=When, at the step 1620, it is determined that the shutting down flag is true, the routine 1504 proceeds to the step 1622, wherein it is determined whether the shutting down flag has been true for more than thirty seconds., 352071=As shown in FIG. 23, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 begins at a step 2302, wherein it is determined whether the sample is less than \u201c\u221264.\u201d Again, it should be appreciated that each \u201csample\u201d taken represents a difference between the current level (on a scale of 0-255) of the active signal 712 and the current level of the reference signal 710. Therefore, a given sample will be less than \u201c\u221264\u201d only when the current level of the active signal 712 is more than \u201c64\u201d levels below the current level of the reference signal 710., 314712=After the step 1424, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to the step 1426, wherein the Tc, Ta, and Ts timers are reset because of the identified missing of the heel-strike event., 318568=When, at the step 1604, it is determined that the foot-mounted unit 102 is not yet powered on, the routine 1504 proceeds back to the step 1602, wherein it is again determined whether the button 1502 is depressed., 322376=After the step 1624, the routine 1504 returns to the step 1602 (discussed above)., 343984=After the step 2126, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds first to the routines 1504 and 1506 (discussed above), and then back to the step 2102, wherein another sample of the signals 710 and 712 is taken., 381076=When, at the step 3004, it is determined that the measured Tc value is greater than \u201c120\u201d milliseconds, the routine 2608 proceeds to a step 3006, wherein it is determined whether the measured Ts value is between \u201c400\u201d and \u201c910\u201d milliseconds (i.e., an acceptable range of Ts values for running)., 358737=When, at the step 2404, it is determined that the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is greater than seven, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2418, wherein the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is set to false, thereby preventing the identified characteristic of the signals 710 and 712 that initially caused the qualification flag to be set to true from being qualified as an actual heel-strike event 702., 325720=When, at the step 1710, it is determined that an \u201cair signature\u201d has been identified in the sensor signal, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to the step 1406 of the primary routine 1400., 373789=When, at the step 2806 (discussed above), it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH)\u22121 is not less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2810, wherein it is determined whether the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)., 386950=When, at the steps 3106 and 3108, it is determined that both the current Tc value and the next most recent value are each more than eight milliseconds less than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to the step 3110, wherein the two most recent Tc values are averaged to obtain a new value of Tcave, and the routine 2610 then terminates., 318004=An example implementation of the \u201cprocess button\u201d routine 1504 of FIG. 15 is shown in FIG. 16. As shown, the routine 1504 begins at step 1602, wherein it is determined whether the button 204 on the foot-mounted unit 102 is currently depressed., 334223=As mentioned above, one of the events identified during each footstep taken by the user 112 is a heel-strike event 702. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the signals 710 and 712 are analyzed to identify any of a plurality of predetermined criteria indicative of such an event. An example of one such criteria is illustrated in FIG. 20. As shown, after an air signature 706 of the signal 712 has been identified (i.e., it has been determined that the foot 114 of the user 112 is airborne), a subsequent sharp, positive peak 2002 in the signal 712 is one characteristic in the signal 712 that is indicative of the foot 114 of the user 112 impacting the surface 108. Other criteria which, if satisfied, may also be indicative of a heel-strike event 702 are discussed below in connection with the routine 2110 (shown in FIGS. 21 and 22)., 310952=After the step 1418, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1426, wherein the various timers used to measure the foot contact time (Tc), foot-air time (Ta), and step time (Ts) are reset because of the identified lack of activity., 328192=When, at the step 1812, it is determined that the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is greater than the variable \u201cdiff_max,\u201d the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1816, wherein the variable \u201cdiff_max\u201d is set to be equal to the variable \u201cdiff.\u201d, 220943=This discovery is significant because each of the Pace vs. Tc lines 802 and 804 for a particular user 112 may be plotted by locating only a single point on the graph of FIG. 11 when the user 112 is walking or running at a comfortable pace, and interpolating a line between the measured point and the corresponding constant X-intercept point 1106 or 1108., 360758=After the step 2408 (discussed above), the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2420, wherein it is determined whether the value of the variable \u201csum_of_diff\u201d is greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d (discussed above)., 319080=When, at the step 1606, it is determined that the foot-mounted unit 102 is not yet powered on, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1608, wherein the foot-mounted unit 102 is powered up and initialized, and the routine 1504 terminates., 272099=wherein SpeedEPW and PaceEPW represent, respectively, the speed at one of the \u201cend points\u201d 1306 and 1308 of the line segment 1302 a of the \u201cwalking\u201d line 1302 and the pace (i.e., 1/Speed) corresponding therewith, and SpeedEPR and PaceEPR represent, respectively, the speed at one of the \u201cend points\u201d 1310 and 1312 of the line segment 1304 a of the \u201crunning\u201d line 1304 and the pace (i.e., 1/Speed) corresponding therewith. The speed with which each of the endpoints is associated therefore corresponds precisely with a pace on one of the lines 802 and 804 in the graph of FIG. 11, whereas the speeds with which central portions of the line segments 1302 a and 1304 a are associated may not correspond precisely with paces on the lines 802 and 804 in the graph of FIG. 11 because of the slight bend in the curves 1202 and 1204 between the endpoints of the line segments 1302 a and 1304 a, respectively., 354445=After the step 2308, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 proceeds to a step 2310, wherein the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d is set to be equal to \u201c15,\u201d plus the value of the variable \u201cave_neg_val\u201d divided by 2., 244327=In light of the universal pivot points 1106 and 1108 identified in the graph of FIG. 11 for the lines 802 and 804, respectively, we have recognized that, for each of the two lines 802 and 804, each individual user may be assigned a single calibration \u201cvalue\u201d that identifies the location of that line. For example, each user may be assigned a first calibration value between \u201c1\u201d and \u201c200\u201d that identifies a corresponding angular orientation of the \u201crunning line\u201d 802 about the pivot point 1106, and may be assigned a second calibration value between \u201c1\u201d and \u201c200\u201d that identifies a corresponding angular orientation of the \u201cwalking line\u201d 804 about the pivot point 1108., 353898=After the step 2312, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 terminates., 219530=FIG. 11 shows the lines 802 and 804 of the Pace vs. Tc lines of FIG. 8, and also illustrates the above-calculated replacement values of MpW, BpW, MpR, and BpR included in the equations (6). By setting the value of Pace in the equations (6) to be equal to \u201c0,\u201d and then solving the equations (6) for Tc, it is discovered that the locations of the constant X-intercept points 1106 and 1108 of the lines 802 and 804, respectively, are equal to MstepW and MstepR, respectively. As discussed above, our empirical measurements have revealed that these values are relatively constant across a substantial cross-section of the population. Therefore, the X-intercept points of each of the lines 802 and 804 (i.e., points 1106 and 1108, respectively) do not change significantly from person to person, so that the lines 802 and 804 simply pivot about the respective points 1106 and 1108 on the graph of FIG. 11. Our empirical measurements have revealed that the constant X-intercept value for the \u201cwalking\u201d line 802 (MstepW) is equal to approximately \u201c200\u201d milliseconds (ms), and the constant X-intercept value for the \u201crunning\u201d line 804 (MstepR) is equal to approximately \u201c75\u201d milliseconds (ms)., 383703=When, at the step 3012, the measured Tc value is determined to be less than \u201c900\u201d milliseconds, the routine 2608 proceeds to a step 3014, wherein it is determined whether the measured Ts value is between \u201c700\u201d and \u201c1360\u201d milliseconds (i.e., an acceptable range of Ts values for walking)., 364329=FIG. 26 is a flow diagram of an illustrative implementation of the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 of the primary routine 1400 (FIG. 14.). As shown in FIG. 26, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 begins at a step 2602, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is true., 333721=When, at the step 1914, it is determined that at least one possible Tc has been recorded, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to the step 1406 of FIG. 14 (discussed above)., 223980=FIG. 13 illustrates the same relationship as does FIG. 12, but uses the units miles-per-hour (MPH) on the Speed axis, rather than miles-per-minute (i.e., a factor of \u201c60\u201d adjustment). In addition, the graph of FIG. 13 focuses only on the relative portion of the graph of FIG. 12 that corresponds to reasonable ranges of walking and running speeds for a human being. As shown, FIG. 13 illustrates that, within a reasonable range of walking speeds (e.g., between \u201c3\u201d and \u201c4\u201d MPH), the curve 1202 is substantially linear. Similarly, between a reasonable range of running speeds (e.g., between \u201c7.5\u201d and \u201c10.8\u201d MPH), the curve 1204 also is substantially linear. Therefore, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a line 1302, which passes through the aforementioned substantially linear portion of the curve 1202, may used to define an approximation of the relationship between Speed and 1/Tc when the user 112 is walking, and a line 1304, which passes through the aforementioned substantially linear portion of the curve 1204, may be used to define an approximation of the relationship between Speed and 1/Tc when the user 112 is running. As shown, the lines 1302 and 1304 may be defined using the equations:, 329366=When, at the step 1812 (discussed above), it is determined that the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is not greater than the variable \u201cdiff_max,\u201d the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1814, wherein it is determined whether the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is greater than 80% of the variable \u201cdiff_max.\u201d, 344668=FIG. 22 shows an example implementation of the routine 2110 shown in FIG. 21. As mentioned above, the routine 2110 serves to identify one or more characteristics in the signals 710 and 712 that satisfy at least one of a plurality of predetermined criteria consistent with the occurrence of a heel-strike event 702., 380343=When, at the step 3002, the measured Tc value is determined to be less than \u201c420\u201d milliseconds, it is determined that the user 112 is running, and the routine 2608 proceeds to a step. 3004, wherein it is determined whether the measured Tc value is greater than \u201c120\u201d milliseconds., 371464=When, at the step 2804, it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH) is less than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2818, wherein the current value of Tc is replaced with the next most recent value of Tc. It should be appreciated that, when the questions asked by the steps 2802 and 2804 are both answered in the affirmative, a determination has been made that the heel-strike event 702 corresponding to the hatch mark 2704 a in FIG. 27 was identified too late, and that the Tc value obtained with respect to this \u201clate landing\u201d should be replaced with a previously obtained \u201cgood\u201d Tc value., 323068=After the step 1702, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to an \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704, during which the value of a variable \u201cthreshold\u201d which is used in connection with the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 (described below). An example of implementation of the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 is described below in connection with FIG. 23., 366254=After the routine 2608, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a routine 2610, during which an average value of the foot contact times (TcAVE) for the last several footsteps is calculated. In accordance with one embodiment, the number of Tc values used to calculate the value of TcAVE is dependent upon the difference between the most recent Tc value and the last-calculated value of TcAVE. An example implementation of the routine 2610 is described below in connection with FIG. 31., 374496=When, at the step 2812, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is not less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 terminates., 372874=When, at the step 2808, it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH) is not greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 terminates., 324699=After the routine 1708, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to an \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710, wherein it is determined whether an \u201cair signature\u201d 706 has been identified in the signals 710 and 712. An example implementation of the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 is described below in connection with FIG. 19. As shown in FIG. 7, an air signature in the signals 710 and 712 may be an extended period of relatively constant, negative acceleration during a footstep., 336639=After the step 2102, a value of the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d is updated in connection with the routine 1704 (discussed below in connection with FIG. 23). As explained below, the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d may be used in connection with the steps 2110 and 2112 to determine whether the user's foot 114 has, in fact, impacted with the surface 108. Advantageously, the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d is updated dynamically in response to measured characteristics of the samples taken during the preceding five footsteps taken by the user 112., 372535=When, at the step 2806, it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH)\u22121 is less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2808, wherein it is determined whether the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH) is greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)., 360348=When, at the step 2406, it is determined that the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is two or greater, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2408, wherein the variable \u201csum_of_diff\u201d is incremented by the difference between the current sample and the next most recent sample taken at the step 2102 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408., 259706=wherein PPW is equal to the Tc value at the pivot point 1106 of the line 802 (i.e., MstepW), and PPR is equal to the Tc value at the pivot point 1108 of the line 804 (i.e., MstepR). In the units used in the graph of FIG. 11, the values of PPW and PPR are \u201c200\u201d and \u201c75,\u201d respectively., 335223=In the example embodiment described herein, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 of the primary routine 1400 is the routine responsible for performing this analysis., 327311=When, at the step 1808, it is determined that the variable \u201ccount\u201d is not greater than one, the routine 1708 terminates., 375388=When, at the step 2810 (discussed above), it is determined that the toe-to-step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is not greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2814, wherein it is determined whether the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is less than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)., 337573=After the step 2106, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to a step 2108, wherein it is determined whether an excessive amount of time has elapsed since the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 began looking for a heel-strike event 702. That is, it is determine whether the sought-after heel-strike event 702 must have been missed by the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 because the currently-measured step time (Ts) has reached a value that is outside of a predetermined range of acceptable step times for human beings. In one embodiment, this upper limit on acceptable step time (Ts) is approximately \u201c1360\u201d milliseconds. In this regard, it should be appreciated that, in addition to or in lieu of the maximum acceptable step time (Ts), other variables such as a foot air time (Ta) may also or alternatively be examined at the step 2108 to determine whether the sought-after heel-strike event 702 must have been missed., 327818=After the step 1810, the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1812, wherein it is determined whether the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is greater than another variable \u201cdiff_max.\u201d The variable \u201cdiff_max\u201d is one of the values which may be initialized in connection with the step 1701 of the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 of FIG. 17., 358171=After the step 2416, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to the step 2102 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, as shown in FIG. 21, wherein the next sample of the signals 710 and 712 is taken., 390183=Based upon the above, it should be appreciated that the routine 2610 ensures that the value Tcave will be updated at a rate commensurate with the rate at which the Tc values being measured are changing. In this manner, when the value Tcave is used to calculate the instantaneous pace of a user in locomotion on foot, the pace displayed to the user 112 may respond quickly to sudden changes in the user's pace, but may also be \u201csmoothed\u201d over several footsteps when the user's pace is relatively steady., 311555=When, during the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, a heel-strike event 702 is identified, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1410, wherein the \u201cactivity flag\u201d (if false) is set to true to indicate that the user 112 is currently active. In addition, at the step 1410, a \u201cstep error flag\u201d (if true) is set to false to indicate that both a toe-off event 704 and a heel-strike event 702 were identified in connection with the current footstep., 323507=After the routine 1704, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to a step 1706, wherein it is determined whether an amount of time has elapsed that is in excess of a maximum possible time of a foot-step (i.e., it is determined whether the toe-off event must have been missed because too much time has elapsed since the last heel-strike event 702)., 365797=After the routine 2606, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a routine 2608, wherein the values of Tc and Ts measured during the most recent iteration of the primary routine 1400 (as well as the ratio between these values) are checked to be sure that they fall within acceptable ranges. An example implementation of the routine 2608 is described below in connection with FIGS. 29 and 30., 361407=When, at the step 2420, it is determined that the value of the variable \u201csum_of_diff\u201d is greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to the steps 2114, 2116, 2118, and 2120 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, as shown in FIG. 21., 326823=When, at the step 1802, it is determined that the most recent sample is not greater than the next most recent sample, the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1804, wherein the variable \u201ccount\u201d is reset to zero, and the routine 1708 then terminates., 384727=When, at the steps 3016 and 3018, it is determined that the ratio of the measured values of Tc and Ts falls above the line 2906 a (step 3016) or falls below the line 2906 b (step 3018), the routine 2608 proceeds to the step 3020, wherein the measured Tc value is replaced with the next most recent Tc value, and the routine 2608 then terminates., 157855=The sensor included in the foot-mounted unit 102 may be any of a number of devices capable of sensing the motion of the user's foot 114, and the invention is not limited to the use of any particular type of sensor. In one illustrative embodiment, for example, the foot-mounted unit 102 includes a solid-state accelerometer that senses acceleration along an acceleration sensing axis 110, as shown in FIG. 1. In another embodiment, the sensor includes a low-cost accelerometer such as that disclosed in co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/382,049, filed Aug. 24, 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Other sensors that may be used include, for example, pressure-sensitive resistive switches, piezoelectric transducers, GMR sensors, simple contact switches, mercury switches, or any other devices capable of generating a signal indicative of motion of the foot 114 of the user 112 while the user 112 is in locomotion., 322498=FIG. 17 shows an illustrative implementation of the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 of the primary routine 1400. As shown in FIG. 17, the \u201ctoe-off event\u201d routine 1404 begins at a step 1701, wherein certain values (discussed below) are initialized., 324206=When, at the step 1706, it is determined that an excessive amount of time has not yet elapsed since the last heel-strike event 704, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to a routine 1708, wherein it is determined whether a potential toe-off event 704 occurred in connection with the last sample taken at the step 1702. An example implementation of the routine 1708 is described below in connection with FIG. 18., 365244=When, at the step 2604, it is determined that the \u201cstep error flag\u201d is not false, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a routine 2606, wherein, for each footstep, the measured time between consecutive toe-off events 704 is compared to the measured time between corresponding consecutive heel-strike events 702, and correction are (possibly) made based upon these comparisons. An example implementation of the routine 2606 is described below in connection with FIGS. 27 and 28., 312080=After the step 1410, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1412, wherein a measured step-time (Ts) and a measured foot air time (Ta) are recorded. Because, during the initial iteration of the primary routine 1400, the step time (Ts) cannot be accurate, the primary routine 1400 may, for example, wait until both a toe-off even 704 and a heel-strike even 702 have been identified at least once before recording a value of Ts. Alternatively, a \u201cdummy\u201d value may be recorded as the value of Ts. Because both a toe-off event 704 and a heel-strike event 702 were identified in the steps 1404 and 1408, however, the value of the step air time (Ta) may be assumed to be accurate at this stage and that therefore may be recorded, if desired., 352832=When, at the step 2302, it is determined that the current sample is less than \u201c\u221264,\u201d the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 proceeds to a step 2304, wherein a variable \u201cneg_val\u201d is set to be equal to the absolute value of the sample (which will be positive and greater than \u201c64\u201d) minus \u201c64.\u201d, 364672=When, at the step 2602, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is not true, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 terminates., 216763=These substantially linear relationships are illustrated in FIG. 10. Curves 1002 and 1004 in FIG. 10 illustrate typical relationships between the user's step length (Ls) and the walking speed (curve 1002) or running speed (curve 1004) of the user 112. As illustrated by line 1006 in FIG. 10, the relationship between the step length (Ls) of the user 112 and the speed of the user 112 is substantially linear through a reasonable range of walking speeds (e.g., between 2.5 and 4.5 miles per hour (MPH)). Similarly, as illustrated by line 1008 in FIG. 10, the relationship between the step length (Ls) of the user 112 and the speed of the user 112 also is substantially linear through a reasonable range of running speeds (e.g., between 5 and 12 MPH). As shown, the line 1006 has a slope equal to MstepW and a Y-intercept equal to BstepW, and the line 1008 has a slope equal to MstepR and a Y-intercept equal to BstepR., 317578=After the process button routine 1504, the routine 1402 proceeds to a process RF routine 1506, during which any necessary RF transmission/reception functions, e.g., information transmissions to and/or from the wrist-mounted unit 104 may be performed., 389735=When, at the steps 3116 and 3118, it is determined that either the current Tc value or the next most recent Tc value is not more than four milliseconds less than the currently-stored value of Tcave, the routine 2610 proceeds to a step 3122, wherein up to nine of the most recent Tc values are averaged to obtain a new value of Tcave, and the routine 2610 then terminates., 342351=At the steps 2118 and 2120, the Tc timer and Ts timer each are preset to the current value of the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer., 356218=After the step 2410, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2412, wherein the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer is set to be equal to the current value of the variable \u201cdown correction value.\u201d The variable \u201cdown correction value\u201d may have been set, for example, in connection with the routine 2110 of FIG. 22. By so setting the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer at the step 2412, the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer correctly reflects the time period that has elapsed since the first of several samples that satisfied one of the landing criteria of the routine 2110 was taken. In this manner, when a heel-strike event 702 eventually is qualified in connection with a subsequent iteration of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, the value of the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer can be used to \u201ccorrect\u201d the values of the Ts and Ta timers in connection with the steps 2114 and 2116, respectively, of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 of FIG. 21., 385169=When, at the steps 3016 and 3018, it is determined that the ratio of the measured values of Tc and Ts falls both below the line 2906 a (step 3016) and above the line 2906 b (step 3018), the routine 2608 terminates., 326408=When, at the step 1802, it is determined that the most recent sample is greater than the next most recent sample, the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1806, wherein a variable \u201ccount\u201d is incremented by one. The variable \u201ccount\u201d is one of the values that may be initialized in connection with the step 1701 of the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 of FIG. 17., 381411=When, at the step 3006, it is determined that the measured Ts value is not between \u201c400\u201d and \u201c910\u201d milliseconds, it is determined that the Ts value is outside of the acceptable range for Ts values for running, and the routine 2608 proceeds to the step 3020, wherein the measured Tc value is replaced with the next most recent Tc value, and the routine 2608 then terminates., 314929=Following either of the steps 1412 or 1426, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a routine 1414 wherein a determination is made whether the foot-mounted unit 102 should remain powered on, should be powered down, or should be temporarily set to a low-power \u201csleep\u201d mode. As explained in more detail below in connection with FIG. 25, based upon the level of activity detected (i.e., whether and for how long the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has been false), the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 may take appropriate action. For example, it may cause the foot-mounted unit 102 to enter a temporary, low-power sleep mode, or may set a flag that will cause the foot-mounted unit 102 to power down completely., 378005=In light of these discoveries, in one embodiment of the invention, for each footstep taken by the user 112, the ratio of Tc to Ts is checked to make sure it falls within the bounds identified by these lines. That is, for Tc values in the walking range (e.g., above 420 milliseconds), each measured ratio of TcW to TsW is checked to make sure it falls between the lines 2904 a and 2904 b of FIG. 29A. Similarly, for Tc values in the walking range (e.g., less than 420 milliseconds), each measured ratio of TcR to TsR is checked to make sure it falls between the lines 2906 a and 2906 b of FIG. 29B. Each of the Tc and Ts values also may be separately checked to ensure that, by itself, it falls within a reasonable range for such values. As shown, the lines 2904 a and 2904 b may be defined by the equations TcWAX=TsW*XW+AW and TcWMIN=TsW*YW+BW, respectively, wherein the values XW and YW are slopes of the respective lines, and the values AW and BW are the respective Y-intercepts thereof. Similarly, as shown, the lines 2906 a and 2906 b may be defined by the equations TcRMAX=TsR*XR+AR and TcRMIN=TsR*YR+BR, respectively, wherein the values XR and YR are slopes of the respective lines, and the values AR and BR are the respective Y-intercepts thereof., 358444=When, at the step 2402 (described above), it is determined that the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is true, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to a step 2404, wherein it is determined whether the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is greater than seven., 320183=When, at the step 1626, it is determined that the shutting down flag is not currently true, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1630, wherein the shutting down flag is set to true, ant the routine 1504 terminates. As discussed below in connection with step 1622, after the shutting down flag has been true for more than thirty seconds, the foot-mounted unit is powered down., 317320=When, at the step 1502, it is determined that the ignore time 708 has not yet elapsed, the routine 1402 proceeds to the \u201cprocess button\u201d routine 1504, which is described below in connection with FIG. 16., 368515=After the step 2614, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 terminates., 337234=After the routine 1704, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to a step 2106, wherein a variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is incremented by one. The variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d may, for example, be one of the values that was initialized in connection with the step 2101 discussed above., 343291=When, at the step 2122, it is determined that the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is not greater than seven, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds first to the routines 1504 and 1506 (discussed above), and then back to the step 2102, wherein another sample of the signals 710 and 712 is taken., 361059=When, at the step 2420, it is determined that the value of the variable \u201csum_of_diff\u201d is not greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to the step 2102 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 so that the next sample may be taken., 368032=When, at the step 2611, it is determined that the user 112 is not walking, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a step 2614, wherein the most recent \u201crunning\u201d Tc value (TcR) is added to a running total of previously-obtained \u201crunning\u201d Tc values (\u03a3TcR), and the most recent \u201crunning\u201d Ts value (TsR) is added to a running total of previously-obtained \u201crunning\u201d Ts values (\u03a3TsR)., 352662=When, at the step 2302, it is determined that the current sample is not less than \u201c\u221264,\u201d the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 terminates., 342696=When, during the routine 2110 (described above), it is determined that none of the landing criteria were met as a result of the most recent sample taken at the step 2102, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to step 2122, wherein it is determined whether a variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is greater than seven. The significance of the variable \u201cqualifying cycles,\u201d as well as the so-called \u201cqualification flag,\u201d will be explained below in connection with the description of the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 (FIG. 24)., 376282=When, at the step 2816, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is greater than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 proceeds to the step 2818, wherein the current value of Tc is replaced with the next most recent value of Tc. It should be appreciated that, when the questions asked by the steps 2814 and 2816 are both answered in the affirmative, a determination has been made that the toe-off event corresponding to the hatch mark 2702 a in FIG. 27 was identified too early, and that the Tc value obtained with respect to this \u201cearly takeoff\u201d should be replaced with a previously obtained \u201cgood\u201d Tc value., 353161=After the step 2304, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 proceeds to a step 2306, wherein it is determined whether five consecutive \u201cvalid\u201d steps have been identified in connection with the primary routine 1400 of FIG. 14. A valid step may be identified, for example, when the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is true and the \u201cstep error flag\u201d is false for five consecutive iterations of the primary routine 1400., 351782=FIG. 23 shows an example implementation of the routine \u201cupdate threshold\u201d 1704, which may be performed after each of the steps 1702 and 2102 of the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 and the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, respectively., 318309=When, at the step 1602, it is determined that the button 204 is not depressed, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1604, wherein it is determined whether the foot-mounted unit 102 is currently powered on., 319663=When, at the step 1610, it is determined that the button has not been depressed for more than 3 seconds, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1626, wherein it is determined whether the shutting down flag is currently true., 339452=When, during the routine 2110, it is determined that at least one of the several predetermined landing criteria was met as a result of the most recent sample taken at the step 2102, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 proceeds to a \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112, wherein additional analysis may be performed to ensure that the satisfied landing criteria was definitely the result of a heel-strike event 702. An example implementation of the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 is described below in connection with FIG. 24., 348371=When, at the step 2206, it is determined that the sum of the last three differences is not greater than two times the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2110 also proceeds to the step 2212., 346471=After the step 2204, the routine 2110 proceeds immediately to the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, as shown in FIG. 21., 370254=FIG. 28 is a flow diagram of an illustrative implementation of the routine 2606 of the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 (FIG. 26). During the routine 2606, heel-to-heel and toe-to-toe step times, such as those illustrated in FIG. 27, may be compared to verify the accuracy of the identified occurrences of the heel-strike events 702 and toe-off events 704 on which these values are based., 329008=After the step 1818, the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1820 wherein the timer used to measure foot air time (the \u201cTa timer\u201d) is reset so that, if the current sample is later determined to be an actual lift-off event, the Ta timer is set appropriately. After the step 1820, the routine 1708 terminates., 336187=As shown in FIG. 21, the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 begins at a step 2101, wherein certain values (discussed below) used in connection with the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 are initialized., 335549=Referring briefly to FIG. 7, the period during which the user's foot 114 is airborne (i.e., the period between each toe-off event 704 and the subsequent heel-strike event 702) is characterized by a relatively smooth signal that is substantially free of sharp transitions. Based upon this characteristic, one goal of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 is to identify when one or more sharp transitions first begin to appear in the signal 712. When such sharp transition(s) appear in the signal, it may be concluded that the foot 114 has impacted with the surface 108., 345044=As shown, the routine 2110 begins at a step 2202, wherein it is determined whether the difference between a current sample and the next most recent sample is greater than the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d As mentioned above, the value of the variable \u201cthreshold\u201d may be dynamically adjusted based upon at least one characteristic of one or more previously taken samples. For example, in the illustrative routine 1704 described below in connection with FIG. 23, samples taken during the last five footsteps of the user 112 are used to dynamically set the value of the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d It should be appreciated, however, that the quantity \u201cthreshold\u201d may alternatively be a fixed (i.e., non-variable) value, and the invention is not limited to embodiments that employ a dynamically-adjusted value as the \u201cthreshold.\u201d, 360054=When, at the step 2406, it is determined that the variable \u201cqualifying cycles\u201d is not greater than one, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 proceeds to the step 2102 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 so that a new sample may be taken., 321198=When, at the step 1616, it is determined that the button remains depressed, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1618, wherein a new network address for the foot-mounted device is broadcasted by the transceiver 420., 364836=When, at the step 2602, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is true, the \u201csmooth and calculate\u201d routine 1416 proceeds to a step 2604, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cstep error flag\u201d is false., 376987=When, at the step 2814 (discussed above), it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is not less than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 terminates., 362107=When, at the step 2502, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d is true, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 terminates., 217842=We have further discovered, again based upon empirical measurements, that the values of the slopes MstepW and MstepR of the lines 1006 and 1008, respectively, are substantially constant across a large portion of the population, and that the values of the Y-intercepts BstepW and BstepR for the lines 1006 and 1008, respectively, are generally the only values in equations (5) which vary significantly from person to person. By combining equations (3) and (4) and (5), we have discovered that the values MpW and MpR in the equations (3) are equal to 1/BstepW and 1/BstepR, respectively, and that the values BpW and BpR in the equations (3) are equal to \u2212MstepW/BstepW and \u2212MstepR/BstepR, respectively. Equation (3) therefore may be rewritten as follows:, 383287=When, at the step 3012, it is determined that the measured Tc value is not greater than \u201c900\u201d milliseconds, it is determined that the Tc value is outside of the acceptable range for Tc values for walking, and the routine 2608 proceeds to the step 3020, wherein the measured Tc value is replaced with the next most recent Tc value, and the routine 2608 then terminates., 381832=When, at the step 3006, it is determined that the measured Ts value is between \u201c400\u201d and \u201c910\u201d milliseconds, the routine 2608 proceeds to steps 3008 and 3010, wherein it is determined whether the ratio of the measured Tc and Ts values falls between \u201crunning\u201d lines 2906 a and 2906 b of FIG. 29., 382936=When, at the step 3002 (described above), it is determined that the measured Tc value is not less than \u201c420\u201d milliseconds, it is determined that the user 112 is walking, and the routine 2608 proceeds to a step 3012, wherein it is determined whether the measured Tc value is less than \u201c900\u201d milliseconds., 384352=When, at the step 3014, it is determined that the measured Ts value is between \u201c700\u201d and \u201c1360\u201d milliseconds, the routine 2608 proceeds to steps 3016 and 3618, wherein it is determined whether the ratio of the measured values of Tc and Ts falls between the lines 2906 a and 2906 b of FIG. 29., 318835=When, at the step 1602, it is determined that the button 204 is depressed, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1606, wherein it is determined whether the foot-mounted unit 102 is powered on., 321603=When, at the step 1604 (discussed above), it is determined that the foot-mounted unit 102 is currently powered on, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1620, wherein it is determined whether the shutting down flag is true., 375752=When, at the step 2814, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is less than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2816, wherein it is determined whether the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is greater than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH)., 330172=FIG. 19 illustrates an illustrative implementation of the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 of the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 of FIG. 17, during which the signals 710 and 712 are analyzed to identify an \u201cair signature\u201d 706., 363137=When, at the step 2504, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has not been false for more than sixty minutes, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 proceeds to a step 2506, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has been false for more than five minutes., 348861=When, at the step 2212, it is determined that three of the last four differences are greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2214, wherein it is determined whether the first one of the last four differences is greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold.\u201d, 373069=When, at the step 2808, it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH) is greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 proceeds to the step 2818, wherein the current value of Tc is replaced with the next most recent value of Tc. It should be appreciated that, when the questions asked by the steps 2806 and 2808 are both answered in the affirmative, a determination has been made that the heel-strike event 702 corresponding to the hatch mark 2704 a in FIG. 27 was identified too early, and that the Tc value obtained with respect to this \u201cearly landing\u201d should be replaced with a previously obtained \u201cgood\u201d Tc value., 351305=After the step 2222, the routine 2110 proceeds to the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 of the routine 1408, as shown in FIG. 21., 325963=FIG. 18 shows an illustrative implementation of the routine 1708 of FIG. 17, wherein it is determined whether a potential toe-off event 704 has occurred., 223505=When Speed, defined according to the equations (8), is plotted against 1/Tc, curves 1202 and 1204 shown in FIG. 12 may be obtained. As shown in FIG. 12, the relationships between Speed and 1/Tc while the user 112 is walking (curve 1202) and while the user is running (curve 1204) appear to be substantially non-linear, as compared to the relatively linear relationships between Pace and Tc illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 11., 354687=After the step 2310, the \u201cupdate threshold\u201d routine 1704 terminates., 328456=After the step 1816, the routine 1708 proceeds to a step 1818, wherein, the current value of a timer used to measure foot contact times (the \u201cTc timer\u201d) is recorded as a possible foot contact time (Tc).

An example implementation of the routine 2110 is described below in connection with FIG. 22., 331786=When, at the step 1902, it is determined that the current sample is negative, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to step 1906, wherein it is determined whether the absolute value of the sample is greater than the variable max_level_below\u20140., 84808=This is a continuation-in-part of each of application Ser.

Three separate heel-to-heel step times (i.e., Ts(HH)\u22122, Ts(HH)\u22121, and Ts(HH)) are labeled between respective pairs of the hatch marks on the line 2704., 322791=After the step 1701, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to a step 1702, wherein a sample of an output signal of the sensor 418 (i.e., a difference between the signals 710 and 712 of FIG. 7), is taken., 331042=When, at the step 1902, it is determined that the current sample is positive, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to a step 1904, wherein a counter that keeps track of a time period during which sequential samples of the signals 710 and 712 are negative (the \u201cbelow\u20140\u201d counter) is reset, and a variable \u201cmax_level_below\u20140\u201d also is reset. The variable max_level_below\u20140 represents the maximum negative acceleration that has occurred since the last time the \u201cbelow\u20140\u201d counter was reset., 245086=In one embodiment, a \u201cbaseline\u201d value of a foot contact time (Tc) is selected, and an equation including the single calibration value (e.g., a number between \u201c1\u201d and \u201c200\u201d) as a variable is used to define the pace that corresponds to the baseline foot contact time (Tc). Thus, each change in the value of the single calibration value causes a corresponding change in the value of the pace associated with the baseline foot contact time (Tc). In this manner, a point is defined on the Pace vs. Tc graph of FIG. 11 through which an appropriate one of the lines 802 and 804 may be interpolated, with the other point through which the line is interpolated being one of the universal pivot points 1106 and 1108. In one illustrative embodiment, this relationship is defined (for each of the lines 802 and 804) using the following equation:, 364139=When, at the step 2506, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has not been false for more than 5 minutes, the \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 terminates., 331632=After the step 1904, the \u201cair signature?\u201d routine 1710 proceeds to the routine 1506 (as shown in FIG. 17)., 225852=wherein MsW and MsR are constants representing the slopes of the lines 1302 and 1304, respectively, and BsW and BsR are constants representing the Y-intercepts of the lines 1302 and 1304, respectively. Although linear relationships between the inverse of foot contact time (1/Tc) and speed are illustrated in FIG. 13, it should be appreciated that higher-order polynomials may alternatively be used to define these relationships., 309128=For convenience, it may be assumed initially that the primary routine 1400 begins at a routine 1404, wherein the signals 710 and 712 are analyzed to attempt to identify one or more characteristics thereof indicative of a toe-off event 704., 380671=When, at the step 3004, it is determined that the Tc value is not greater than \u201c120\u201d milliseconds, it is determined that the Tc value is outside of the acceptable range for Tc values for running, and the routine 2608 proceeds to a step 3020, wherein the measured Tc value is replaced with the next most recent Tc value, and the routine 2608 then terminates., 315693=After the step 1414, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a routine 1416, wherein the recorded values of Tc, Ts, and Ta accumulated during the previous iteration of the primary routine 1400 are evaluated and smoothed, and certain values are calculated based thereupon. Such values may, for example, be displayed to the user 112 via a display on the foot-mounted unit 102 and/or may be transmitted to the wrist-mounted unit 104 or elsewhere for display to the user, processing, and/or storage., 317876=After the routine 1506, the routine 1402 returns to the routine 1502 (discussed above)., 226373=Unfortunately, because the universal pivot points 1106 and 1108 of FIG. 11 are defined at a pace equal to \u201c0,\u201d such pivot points cannot be identified on the graph of FIG. 13 because, as is evident from the equation (7), a pace of \u201c0\u201d corresponds to an infinite speed. When a single point calibration scheme is used wherein a single point on the graph of FIG. 11 is identified for either walking or running and a line is interpolated between the identified point and one of the universal pivot points 1106 and 1108, however, it is possible to pick a few (at least two) points from the interpolated \u201cwalking\u201d line 802 or the interpolated \u201crunning\u201d line 804 of FIG. 11 that fall within a reasonable range of paces for running or walking. These selected points may then be transferred onto the graph of FIG. 13, and a line may be interpolated between the transferred points to obtain a corresponding one of the lines 1302 and 1304 shown in FIG. 13., 307665=The primary routine 1400 may be best understood with reference to FIG. 7 in conjunction with FIG. 14, as the primary routine 1400 is concerned primarily with identifying the various characteristics in a signal such as that shown in FIG. 7 that are indicative of particular events during a user's footsteps (e.g., the heel-strike events 702 a-b and toe-off events 704 a-b of FIG. 7), and in performing calculations and analyses based upon measured time periods between such events., 308214=As shown, the primary routine 1400 is a continuous loop. As discussed below, various routines within the primary routine 1400 may be capable of performing functions such as responding to a user input to shut down the power of the foot-mounted unit 102, transmitting information from the foot-mounted unit 102 to the wrist-mounted unit 104, and altering a network address of the foot-mounted unit 102/wrist-mounted unit 104 combination. For ease of description, however, these underlying functions will be ignored at the outset, and it will be assumed that the power in the foot-mounted unit 102 remains on at all times. First, a high-level description of the primary routine 1400 will be provided, and then functionality of each of the constituent routines of the primary routine 1400 will be described in more detail below., 376087=When, at the step 2816, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is not greater than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 terminates., 348112=When, at the step 2208, it is determined that the first of the last three differences is not greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2210 proceeds to a step 2212 (described below)., 362538=When, at the step 2504, it is determined that the \u201cactivity flag\u201d has been false for more than sixty minutes, the routine \u201ccheck activity?\u201d routine 1414 proceeds to a step 2510, wherein the \u201cshutting down flag\u201d is set to false. As described above in connection with the \u201cprocess button\u201d routine 1504 (FIG. 16), the placing of the \u201cshutting down flag\u201d in the false state will cause the foot-mounted device 102 to be powered down unless the user 112 pushes. the button 204 within 30 seconds (see steps 1620-24)., 371272=When, at the step 2804, it is determined that the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH) is not less than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 terminates., 329678=When, at the step 1814, it is determined that the variable \u201cdiff\u201d is not greater than 80% of the variable \u201cdiff_max,\u201d the routine 1708 terminates., 374688=When, at the step 2812, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH), the routine 2606 proceeds to the step 2818, wherein the current value of Tc is replaced with the next most recent value of Tc. It should be appreciated that, when the questions asked by the steps 2810 and 2812 are both answered in the affirmative, a determination has been made that the toe-off event corresponding to the hatch mark 2702 a in FIG. 27 was identified too late, and that the Tc value obtained with respect to this \u201clate takeoff\u201d should be replaced with a previously obtained \u201cgood\u201d Tc value., 273231=With the units used in FIGS. 11 and 13, the endpoint paces (PaceEPW) corresponding to the endpoint speeds (SpeedEPW) of the line segment 1302 a of \u201c4\u201d and \u201c4.5\u201d MPH are \u201c15\u201d and a \u201c13.333\u201d minutes/mile, respectively, and the endpoint paces (PaceEPR) corresponding to the endpoint speeds (SpeedEPR) of the line segment 1304 a of \u201c7.5\u201d and \u201c9\u201d MPH are \u201c8\u201d and \u201c6.666\u201d minutes/mile, respectively., 349815=When, at the step 2214, it is determined that the first of the last four differences is not greater than two-thirds of the value of the variable \u201cthreshold,\u201d the routine 2110 proceeds to a step 2218, wherein the variable \u201cdown correction value\u201d is set to be equal to three times the sample period. The variable \u201cdown correction value\u201d is set to this value because it is recognized that the first of the last five samples was not used in satisfying a criterion of the steps 2212 and 2214, but that the second of the last five samples must have been so used. Therefore, three sample periods would have elapsed between the second of the last five samples and the most recent one of the last five samples., 321032=After the step 1614, the routine 1504 proceeds to a step 1616, wherein it is determined whether the button remains depressed., 251177=Based upon empirical measurements of the relationships between Tc and Pace and 1/Tc and Speed for a large number of users, we have discovered universal relationships between the calibration constants MpR and BsR and between the calibration constants MpW and BsW of the equations (3) and (11), respectively, that have enabled us to derive respective equations (each including a single, user-specific constant) that identify corresponding rotational and translational positions of the curves 1302 and 1304 in the graph of FIG. 13. Therefore, using these equations, each user may simply be assigned a first calibration constant that defines that user's \u201cwalking curve\u201d 1302 in the graph of FIG. 13 and second calibration constant that defines that user's \u201crunning curve\u201d 1304. This may compared to the alternative technique of using two separate calibration constants (i.e., the calibration constants MsW and BsW or MsR and BsR of equations (9)) to define each of the lines 1302 and 1304., 312916=When, during the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408, it is determined that a heel-strike event 702 has not occurred within a predetermined time period, the primary routine 1400 proceeds to a step 1420, wherein it is determined whether this is the third consecutive time that a heel-strike event 702 was not identified during the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408., 354789=FIG. 24 is a flow diagram of an example implementation of the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 of the \u201cheel-strike event?\u201d routine 1408 shown in FIG. 21. As shown in FIG. 24, the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 begins at a step 2402, wherein it is determined whether the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is true. The \u201cqualification flag\u201d may, for example, be one of the values initialized in connection with the step 2101 (FIG. 21), so that the \u201cqualification flag\u201d is set to be false when the \u201cis landing qualified?\u201d routine 2112 begins., 323905=When, at the step 1706, it is determined that an excessive amount of time has elapsed since the last heel-strike event 704, the \u201ctoe-off event?\u201d routine 1404 proceeds to the step 1418 (discussed above in connection with the primary routine 1400)., 340705=In essence, the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer is used to measure the amount of time that has elapsed since the identification of the first of several samples that are determined to satisfy one of the landing criteria. For example, if three samples are used to satisfy a landing criteria, recognizing that the first of the three samples occurred two sample periods prior to the third sample, the \u201cdown correction\u201d timer would have been preset during the routine 2110 to a value equal to two sample periods, and would therefore reflect a time period that has elapsed since the time of that first sample., 374161=When, at the step 2810, it is determined that the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT)\u22121 is greater than the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT), the routine 2606 proceeds to a step 2812, wherein it is determined whether the toe-to-toe step time Ts(TT) is less than the heel-to-heel step time Ts(HH).}",
