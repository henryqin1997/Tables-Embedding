    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38184=The dopant concentration in the doping solution is pre-determined according to the desired doping level. The target doping level of 6\ufffd1014 to 2\ufffd1017 can be varied by changing the dopant concentration in the doping solution, the amount of doping solution used, and/or the further dilution of the doped feedstock with undoped feedstock. For a given set of treatment conditions, the utilization of the dopant solution is determined experimentally for each dopant and defined by the target bulk resistivity of the crystallized material. For example, a more concentrated doping solution can be made and diluted to the appropriate level before use. Alternatively, a portion of the feedstock can be doped, and the doped feedstock is mixed with undoped feedstock to achieve the desired doping level. This later approach mimics the usual procedure of adding concentrated pellets to the silicon melt., 23806=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/215,391, filed on Aug. 8, 2002, which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/311,782, filed on Aug. 10, 2001, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Doping Semiconductors\u201d by Cretella et al. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference., 40385=In one example, a doping solution containing boron at 0.008% by weight and a low boiling solvent, ethyl alcohol, is added to silicon feedstock pellets in an amount sufficient to achieve a desired doping level, such as 3 to 5\ufffd1015 atoms/cm3, which is typical for a p-type material with 1\u20135 ohm-cm. In determining the amount of doping solution to use, small batch trials can be performed to determine the level of boron utilization. The amount of doping is determined experimentally for the end concentration desired recognizing that the efficiency of coverage from the doping solution is less than 100 percent since losses of the doping element occur during the overall treatment process. Utilization of the available boron in the doping solution can vary from 10 to 45% determined by the heat treatment and the dilutions employed. That is, at the higher temperatures and/or at a rapid rate of heating a greater amount of the dopant material may be volatilized with the solvent. Similarly, at higher concentrations of dopant in solvent, the utilization may or may not be improved depending on whether the heat treatment necessary to achieve attachment of the dopant and drying of the silicon can be balanced against additional loss of dopant. The undoped silicon feedstock material with the added doping solution is agitated briefly at room temperature in a chemically inert chamber, under a flow of argon or nitrogen, to uniformly wet the silicon. The temperature is then raised to about 100\ufffd C., while agitation continues, in order to affix the doping element onto the silicon surface and to drive off the excess alcohol vehicle. The material is cooled slowly while continuing the inert atmosphere flow until brought to room temperature at which time drying is complete. Temperature of processing can vary from about 30\ufffd C. to about 110\ufffd C. depending on the dopant concentration, the solvent and the time parameters chosen. Total process time is typically determined by the mass of silicon feedstock to be treated and can range from less than an hour for a few kilograms of silicon feedstock to several hours for a scale of hundreds of kilograms.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Variations, modifications, and other implementations of what is described herein will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited only to the preceding illustrative description. Each of the patent and patent application documents disclosed hereinabove is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Some commercial mixing and blending units commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry can potentially be adapted for a large range of scale for production needs. Standard ancillary equipment for loading, treating, vacuum, heating, cooling and solvent recovery can be incorporated, as appropriate. , a V-shaped vessel 61 is used both to mix and to dry the feedstock material 62. The semiconductor feedstock 62 is added in the vessel 61 and a required amount of doping solution is added through port 63 a or port 63 b. The components are mixed by rotation of the vessel 61 with a motor 64. Heating is provided through a heated jacket 65. A gas flow is introduced through opening 66 and pulled out of the vessel 61 by a vacuum through opening 67. Processed feedstock exits the vessel through port 68.
