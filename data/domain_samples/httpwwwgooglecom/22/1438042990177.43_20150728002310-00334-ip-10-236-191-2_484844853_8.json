Thus, the invention encompasses all alternate embodiments that fall literally or equivalently within the scope of these claims. Third, while the arms 14 and 16 are described as moving symmetrically and equidistantly about the horizontal center of the radiation field (depicted by phantom line 26), it is also possible to provide one arm in a fixed position with respect to the detector and have only the other arm move. In this case, the sensor would provide a signal dependent on the displacement of the moving arm/stop, and the immobile arm could simply be provided as a portion of the housing and/or the support structure for the detector. Unlike the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the center of the field between the stops would be mobile. Therefore, the collimator must take account of this condition and only allow expansion or reduction of the projected radiation beam in an area to one side of the immobile stop. Alternatively, the source 100 could be mounted on a linear actuator which receives feedback from the controller 32 and carries the source 100 horizontally so that its beam is always centered between the stops. Second, the sensor 28 need not be provided in the form of a rotary displacement sensor which",
