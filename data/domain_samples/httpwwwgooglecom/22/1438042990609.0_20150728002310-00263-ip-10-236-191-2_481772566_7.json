    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22242=Coincident with the use of video displays has always been the problem of the man/machine interface. Traditionally, control of displayed information or cursors has been via a keyboard. Recently, however, a number of devices have been introduced which allow an operator to directly interact with the video display. These types of devices have included light pens, desk-type mouse controllers, or touch input devices such as a switch matrix or opto-electronic matrices. While generally switch-type overlays which are placed adjacent a video display are inexpensive to apply and utilize, they are generally susceptible to contact wear as well as distortion of the video information which is presented to the viewer, particularly in high usage environments. However, since opto-matrix schemes utilize light, which is generally in the infrared region, the switch matrix presented by the light beams is invisible to the viewer and, therefore, does not distort the video information displayed to the viewer and is not subject to wear in high usage environments. A number of schemes which utilize opto-matrix frames may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,443 \"Photoelectric Input Apparatus\", issued May 12, 1981 to Carroll et al; U.S. Pat. No. 4,243,879 \"Touch Panel with Ambient Light Sampling\", issued Jan. 6, 1981 to Carroll et al; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,764,813\"\"Coordinate Detection System\", issued Oct. 9, 1973 to Clement et al. These three schemes address problems inherent with opto-matrix devices such as increasing frame resolution without a corresponding increase in components, surrounding or ambient light compensation, or optimization of emitter/detector driving and detecting networks respectively. These systems still have drawbacks in some areas such as large component usage thereby resulting in higher costs, ambient light sensing which is based on a predetermined value rather than dynamically, and difficulty in compensating for reflection or glare which may result in stylii hits not being recorded., 21767=Ser. No. 621,575, \"Touch Input Device\", filed June 18, 1984; and, 55514=Accordingly, at 350, 600 and 830 data which represents an X or Y broken or non-broken status condition is presented onto the data line. Therefore, referring now to FIG. 12 there can be seen a timing and data scheme for the present invention. Upon initialization and snychronization at 110 of FIG. 6 four continuous ones are placed onto the data line for the host computer to receive. This thereby lets the host computer know that a synchronization frame has occurred and that the host computer should now start to count. Thereafter, the data is presented in 4-bit bytes with the first two bits always being zero and the third and fourth bits indicating broken or non-broken conditions for the X and Y axes respectively. If a broken condition does exist, then a 1 is placed onto the data line and if an unbroken condition exists, then a 0 is utilized. As an example, should a hit occur at the intersection of CR0 and CR4 and since these are the first X and Y pairs interrogated, the first 4-bit byte of data after synchronization will read (0011). However, had a hit occurred at the intersection of CR0 and CR5, then the first 4-bit byte would have contained (0001) and the second 4-bit byte would have contained (0010). For those frames where no Y axis detector is being interrogated, a 0 is preferably inserted as a false bit although a 1 may also be utilized. This 4-bit byte data stream is continued until all the X detectors have been interrogated with the microprocessor U2 sending out the 4-bit sync cycle at the end of the interrogation thereby indicating a new cycle or frame. Additionally, the present device will allow for beam averaging, the disclosure of which may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,443 \"Photoelectric Input Apparatus\", issued May 12, 1981 to Carroll et al, incorporated by reference herein, and which allows for a stylus between two emitters to be registered as a hit between two beams thereby effectively doubling the resolution or interpolation of the present system to a 32\ufffd64 matrix., 21861=Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, the present invention produces a device which accommodates for changing ambient light levels, emitter and/or detector degradation and which has few components. It is to be remembered that many variations of the present invention may be accomplished without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, power profiling resistors may be placed on individual emitters or detectors or at the decoders rather than at the Darlington transistor arrays without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Further, the program could be utilized in a different sequence without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Also, other data streams may be utilized such as parallel output using additional I/O lines which are available or different types of serial data streams. Additionally, different types of arrays other than Darlington transistors may be utilized while different types of decoders may be used while other types of detectors such as photodiodes may be used. It is also to be remembered that the firing or detection order of the emitters and detectors may be changed to any order desired. The present device may also be used with or without a display or a CRT or with a flat panel display. Accordingly, at 350, 600 and 830 data which represents an X or Y broken or non-broken status condition is presented onto the data line. Therefore, referring now to FIG. 12",
