A card may include logos of multiple credit card companies, banks, or other entities. A logo may be provided on a display (e.g., an electronic ink display). Different logos may be provided on a display and a particular button press may cause a different logo to be displayed. Different logos of different stores may be displayed depending on, for example, the gift card that is utilized at a particular time., 137824=Flow chart 1030 may be included. Step 1031 may be included, in which an online card account maybe be visited by a user. Step 1032 may be included in which gift cards associated with the card account may be listed with the card. Additional cards may be listed such as, for example, additional credit, debit, check, or pre-paid cards. Cards may be added, deleted, or transferred electronically (e.g., via mail) in step 1133. A balance may be viewed for one or more cards in step 1134. Transactions associated with cards may be viewed in step 1135., 150594=A button, such as button 1551, may be utilized, for example, to display a number. Such a number may be, for example, encrypted from a secure number based on time or use. For example, one-time use numbers (e.g., a payment number or code) may be retrieved from a list of numbers on memory each time button 1551 is pressed and displayed on display 1550. A processor may only go through each number once on a list. A registration process may be provided in which a user may be requested to enter in a sequence of numbers such that a remote server may validate the card and learn where in a sequence of a list a card currently resides. Numbers may be repeated on a list or may only occur once on a list. All of the numbers available by the length of the number may be utilized by the list or only a portion of the numbers available by the length of the number may be provided by the list. A secret number may be encrypted on a card and a verification server may also have knowledge of this secret number. Accordingly, the remote server may perform the same encryption function as the card on the secret number and verify that the resultant encrypted number is the same as the resultant encrypted number on a card. Alternatively, for example, the remote server may decrypt the received encrypted number to determine the authenticity of the encrypted number and validate an activity (e.g., validate a security access request or a purchase transaction)., 138444=Flow chart 1040 may be included. Card may be used at a reader via an IC chip in step 1041. Step 1042 may be included in which data may be transmitted from a card to a reader. Step 1043 may occur in which data may be transmitted from a reader to a card. A function may be associated with one or more buttons in step 1044. Information may be displayed via a function when the associated button is pressed in, for example, step 1045., 137213=Flow chart 1020 may be included that may include step 1021, in which a card may be swiped to transmit data to a reader (e.g., a magnetic stripe reader). Step 1022 may occur in which a transaction is completed. Step 1023 may then ensue, in which a card is swiped through the reader (e.g., a magnetic stripe reader) to receive data from the reader. The received data may be, at least in part, associated with a button in step 1024. Such received data may be displayed, at least in part, when the associated button is pressed in step 1025., 146066=Card 1450 may be provided. Card 1450 may include, for example, button 1451 and associated display 1452. A code may be entered using a button array to cause a processor to display a particular number, character set (e.g., name), logo, or other indicia on display 1452 upon the utilization of button 1451. Accordingly, for example, a user may load a gift card onto a card and may be provided with customized visual indicia such that a user may not forget what card is associated with what button. A user may select what button a card (e.g., gift card) may be associated with or the card may autonomously associate a card to the next available button. A card may have a pre-set number of cards that are provided to buttons on a one card per button basis or multiple cards may be associated per button (e.g., a single button press of a button provides one gift card while two button presses of a button in tandem provides a different gift card). Balances, gift card amounts, expiration dates, or other information may also be provided via a display. Other information may include a message from the gift card purchaser. A display may scroll data autonomously such that information that would extend beyond the display capabilities of a display may be displayed by the display without further user interaction. Accordingly, for example, a user may unlock a card by entering a particular PAC on a button array, the user may press a button to see the gift card associated with that button, the user may then select a different button and see a different gift card associated with that different button, the user may then swipe a card and a read-head detector may detect a swipe, the processor may then drive one or more magnetic emulators to communicate data to one or more magnetic stripe read-heads that causes that different credit card to be utilized. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that codes may be utilized to, for example, load cards or denote a particular flag be sent with particular payment card information (e.g., default credit card information) such that processing servers may utilized gift cards linked to a card. Similarly, for example, a user may load a gift card into a card and the card may send information along with the payment card information (e.g., in discretionary fields) such that a processing server notes that a gift card was added to the card and links the gift card to the user's account. Accordingly, a user may, for example, receive a gift card, enter the card into his card (e.g., by entering a unique code for that gift card), use the credit card, and then go online to his payment card account and see that the loaded gift card is associated to his account. The user then may, for example, utilize the loaded gift card online from his/her payment card account., 141023=Card 1150 may be provided. Global number 1101 may be displayed permanently (or via a display). Display 1102 may be utilized to display information. For example, display 1102 may be utilized to display a code or a portion of a payment card number. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that different territories may be have different lengths of different types of data (e.g., different lengths of payment card numbers). Accordingly, a user may be assigned numbers in each territory with overlapping digits (e.g., global portions). For example, a sixteen digit number for one territory may be the same as the first sixteen digits of a nineteen digit number in another territory. The remaining digits for that territory may be displayed, for example, on display 1102. Accordingly, for example, the card may, upon entry of an appropriate PAC default to not showing any information on a display and, upon sensing of a read-head, sending the default payment information through one or more magnetic emulators and/or encoders (or RFID or IC chip). Upon the utilization of a button signifying a nineteen digit scheme for a different territory is utilized, the extra digit information may be displayed on display 1102 and the payment information for that territory may be communicated via a magnetic emulator, magnetic encoder, RFID, or IC chip. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that pressing a button for a particular territory (or other payment information) may be utilized to send that payment information through a communications device such as a magnetic emulator. However, for example, another button may be utilized to cause a display to display the appropriate corresponding payment information. Accordingly, for example, a user may protect information from being visible read by others in particular situations (e.g., when a card is handed to a bartender for processing).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the present invention is not limited to only the embodiments described. Instead, the present invention more generally involves dynamic information. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the apparatus of the present invention may be implemented in other ways then those described herein. All such modifications are within the scope of the present invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a dynamic magnetic communications device (e.g., a magnetic emulator or magnetic encoder) may be fabricated, either completely or partially, in silicon and provided as a silicon-based chip.
