    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The heating of the biological liquid by contact between the lower surface of the cylinders 21 and the supply bags 39 should also be mentioned. This type of heating without a water bath presents an important advantage. In fact, a water bath constitutes an ideal medium for the growth of germs. If any part of the connection between the supply bag 39 and the strike pin 44 should accidently come into contact with the water bath's water, there is a high risk of contamination, a risk which is avoided by the type of heating using the surface of cylinder 21, the external face of which is heated by the resistance 49. The assembly of the front 16 and rear 17 walls with the help of the tie rods serving as spacers makes for an extremely simple assembly of the whole. The low voltage electric current with 40 W power allows the amperage to be reduced to below 2 A, so that the machine does not need electric accreditation. The cylinders, the cylindrical enclosures' floors and doors, all in plexiglass, enable good thermal insulation of the biological liquid. The tubes 42, with the incorporated sealing plug, allow one to introduce the strike pin 44 through the opening 41 of the door 31 and to close this opening by pushing the plug 45 in. The doors 31 are made of a thick plexiglass plaque, which gives it enough",
