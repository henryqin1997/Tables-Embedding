    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0037] It will be clear that the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those inherent therein. While a presently preferred embodiment has been described for purposes of this disclosure, numerous changes may be made which will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. For example, while twelve discs 108 are shown in FIGS. 2-4, the spindle hub assembly 206 may hold fewer or greater than twelve discs, and in some embodiments may hold just a single disc 108. Similarly, the STW 200 may be used to write both embedded and dedicated servo information on the discs 108. Additionally, while the preferred embodiment of the STW 200 defines a stationary spindle hub assembly 206 and a moveable actuator assembly 202, the present invention encompasses have a stationary actuator assembly and a moveable spindle hub assembly, or even having both assemblies being moveable relative to the stationary platform 212. Furthermore, while specific embodiments of the comb 232 and the interferometer 210 were described above, the present invention encompasses alternative means known to those skilled in the art for both separating the heads 204 on the actuator assembly 202 and for determining the position of the heads 204 during the servo-writing process. Accordingly, all such modifications, changes and alternatives are encompassed in the spirit of the invention disclosed and as defined in the appended claims.",
