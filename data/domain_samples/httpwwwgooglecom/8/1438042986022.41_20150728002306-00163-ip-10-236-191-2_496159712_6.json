This circuit may be programmed so as to create a smart response which may be of the flashing type, enabling the response expected during the card validity checking operations to be made more complex. This overlaying of gratings gives rise to four images. With this set of two crossed gratings, it is therefore possible to obtain electrical switching between a diffractive state without a zero order diffraction, creating four images, and a transparent state. By overlaying a second grating, orthogonal to the first one, on this grating the previously unaffected polarization is then diffracted in two directions D'1 and D'2 that are orthogonal to the directions D1 and D2, the other polarization going through the second grating without being modified. Thus, one of the polarizations is not affected by the grating, the other one being diffracted mainly according to the +1 order diffraction and the -1 order diffraction along two directions D1 and D2. The device according to the invention may also advantageously comprise a phase grating made in the electrooptical material. In the case of a polymer matrix, it is possible to use microlithography techniques (with a pitch of a few microns) to make grooves in the polymer, filled with liquid crystal. The liquid crystal molecules, which are typically nematic crystals, are",
