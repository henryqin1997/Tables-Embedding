This invention thereby provides protective headgear for its wearer which is very forgiving of stress during rest or ready situations, but which is instantly available to protect him and provide him with an effective breathing mixture if needed. Should blown air or its equivalent--a pressurized supply of fresh air from a tank be provided, it will be as the result of connection of conduit 54 to a respective source, or the the blower. The other control setting is return to atmosphere or the the rebreather. Thus, the two rotary type selector valves will be concurrently adjusted by moving lever 90 to shift control loop 91 (a flexible cable) to set the two rotary valves. A selector 80 is mounted to the face shield at its central front region. For simplicity, the wearer should not have to make any involved setting. He need only to move a lever 90 to one side or the other. One control setting is to admit or to exclude ambient air, and this in effect means to select between conduits 54 and 56. Ambient air will never conveyed to the recirculation unit. The conduits are flexible hoses, readily flexed to permit",
