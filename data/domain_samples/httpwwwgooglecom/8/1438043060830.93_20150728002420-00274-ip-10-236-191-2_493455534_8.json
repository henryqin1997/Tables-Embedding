Variations and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and equivalents. The entire disclosures of all references, applications, patents, and publications cited above are hereby incorporated by reference. The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by substituting the generically or specifically described materials and/or uses of this invention for those used in the preceding examples. The design of the vehicle partition is adaptable to any car or sport utility vehicle that has a metal cage or shield (e.g. Plexiglas shield) or barrier installed between the front and back seat, or alternatively the mounting mechanism may be mounted directly to the vehicle. The top end of door frame 12 also is capable of sliding along top rail 38 of mounting bracket 32. In a preferred embodiment, mounting bracket 32 is fixed to the barrier separating the front and back seats by the use of four nuts and bolts. The mounting and sliding mechanisms are shown in FIGS. 1 and 4. The other end of slide arm 20 is mounted to guide 28, which is positionally slidable on rail 30 of mounting bracket 32. Guide 28 contains pinhole 34, which can be aligned with",
