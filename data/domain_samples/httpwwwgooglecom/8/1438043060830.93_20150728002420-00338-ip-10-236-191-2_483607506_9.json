After the phosphate buffer salt was completely dissolved, 4.7351 g (50.84 mmoles) of aniline was added to the reaction solution. Ice was added to the reaction solution to cool it down to 0\ufffd C., 39557=Suitable crosslinkers also include polymeric crosslinkers, such as, Polyethylene glycol 1000 Diacrylate, Polyethylene glycol 1000 Dimethacrylate, Polyethylene glycol 600 Dimethacrylate, Polybutanediol 2000 Dimethacrylate, Polypropylene glycol 1000 Diacrylate, Polypropylene glycol 1000 Dimethacrylate, Polytetramethylene glycol 2000 Dimethacrylate, and Polytetramethylene glycol 2000 Diacrylate., 34441=Compound 2 may be prepared by the azo coupling reaction of aniline (optionally substituted) with N-phenyldiethanolamine under conditions described above for azo coupling reactions, except that only a 1:1 stoichometry is necessary for azo coupling of N-phenylamines with diazonium salts. The azo coupling proceeds well at a pH of about 2 to 4. The diazonium salt of aniline is reacted in-situ with N-phenyldiethanolamine to give the intermediate azo dye N-(4-phenylazo)phenyldiethanolamine (also known as Solvent Yellow 58). The dimethacrylate derivative can then be prepared by reacting the intermediate azo dye, N-(4-phenylazo)phenyldiethanolamine with methacrylic anhydride in the presence of a weak base, such as triethylamine, to yield the reactive dimethacrylic azo yellow dye, N-(4'-phenylazo)phenyl-2-bis-(2-methacrylo)ethylamine. In addition, other stronger bases, such as sodium hydride or butyllithium, might be used to form the disodium or dilithium salt followed by reaction with methacrylic anhydride, or other methacrylic/acrylic agent used to incorporate the polymerizable group., 47268=Into a 1000 mL beaker was added 200 mL of deionized water followed by 6.2 g (100 mmoles) of boric acid (H3 BO3). The boric acid was dissolved with stirring and the pH was monitored with the aid of a Orion EA940 Ion Analyzer and a Ross pH electrode. To the beaker was added dropwise 6N HCl to adjust the solution to about pH 2. o-Toluidine in the amount of 2.0831 g (19.94 mmoles) was added to the beaker and the solution pH was again adjusted to pH 2 with the addition of 6N HCl. Ice was added to the reaction solution to cool it down to 0\ufffd-10\ufffd C., 46221=To the reaction flask was added 100 mL of 10% Aq. NaCl and an additional 30 g of salt was added to the flask. The excess salt was filtered off and the reaction flask was cooled overnight in a freezer. The next morning a white solid precipitate was filtered from the reaction solution and was washed with cold 50:50 methanol:water solution. The liquid supernatent was cooled again to obtain a second crop of crystals. After filtering the second crop, all the solid precipitant was combined together and 5.6668 g (27.61 mmoles) of Compound 1 precursor product was obtained, Yield=84.5%., 52667=Into another beaker was placed 9.1481 g (50.48 mmoles) of N-Phenyldiethanolamine, 100 mL of water, and enough 6N HCl was added to dissolve the solid. The N-Phenyldiethanolamine solution was added dropwise into the stirring reaction solution which was kept at 0\ufffd-10\ufffd C. by periodic addition of ice. Immediately the reaction solution began to develop a dark red to purple color which grew more intense as more of the N-Phenyldiethanolamine solution was added. After the addition was completed the solution was stirred for about an hour and warmed up to about 10\ufffd C. Then 50% w/v and 2N NaOH solutions were added to the reaction solution to pH 6.9. As the pH of the reaction solution rose, a dark red solid precipitated out of solution. At this point the total reaction volume was about 1 L. The solid was filtered off and washed with water. 27.7363 g of wet precipitate was obtained., 18505=In the ambient environment solar radiation is the primary hazard to vision. The sun freely emits UV, visible and IR radiation much of which is absorbed by the atmosphere. The solar radiation that is transmitted through the atmosphere and reaches the earth's surface consists of UV-B radiation (230-300 nm), near UV or UV-A radiation (300-400 nm), visible light (400-700 nm) and near IR radiation (700-1400 nm). The ocular media of man in its normal, healthy state freely transmits near IR and most of the visible spectrum to the retina, but UV-B radiation is absorbed by the cornea and does not reach the retina. The transmission of near UV and the blue portion of the visible spectrum can be absorbed by the crystalline lens depending on age., 54116=Into a 100 mL round bottomed flask was placed 1.4299 g (5.011 mmoles) of Compound 2 precursor and 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), completely dissolving the Compound 2 precursor. Into a tared 16\ufffd125 mm testtube was weighed 1.5549 g (10.086 mmoles) of MAA. The MAA was then added dropwise to the stirring reaction solution using a transfer pipet and the time of MAA addition was noted. An HPLC analytical method was used to monitor the progress of the reaction with time. After about four hours, 1.0452 g (10.329 mmoles) of triethylamine (Et3 N) was added dropwise to the reaction solution. The reaction was stirred for 2 days, and then another aliquot of 4.1877 g (41.385 mmoles) of Et3 N was added to the reaction. The next day, the reaction was analyzed by HPLC and another aliquot of methacrylic anhydride, 3.5542 g (23.054 mmoles), was added to the reaction to complete the conversion of the Compound 2 precursor to Compound 2 product., 53568=The solid obtained from the reaction was recrystallized from a methanol:water 91:9 solution. The Compound 2 precursor product crystals were filtered off and dried under vacuum overnight at 50\ufffd C. The identity of the Compound 2 precursor was confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis. Compound 2 precursor in the amount of 11.1449 g (39.06 mmoles) was obtained, melting range 136\ufffd-138\ufffd C., Yield=77.4%., 32311=These side reaction products are also phenolic compounds which can compete with the desired intermediate acrylic/methacrylic compound in the azo coupling reaction. As a result, changing the reaction stoichiometry from a 1:1 molar equivalence to a 4:1 excess of diazonium salt to acrylic/methacrylic intermediate compound is the preferred way to synthesize Compound 1. Other reaction stoichiometries may be more effective in the azo coupling of other acrylic/methacrylic phenolic intermediates as determined by someone skilled in the art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 3 shows that the largest loss of absorbance between 400-500 nm after extraction occurred with the Solvent Yellow 7 dye (84%). In contrast, the dyes containing polymerizable groups resulted in less than 50% absorption loss. Of the polymerizable dyes, 4-phenylazophenol allyl ether (containing a polymerizable vinyl group) resulted in a 44% absorbtion loss, while both Compounds 1 and 2 (containing polymerizable methacrylate groups) resulted in less than 10% absorbtion loss. As measured by the absorption loss at appropriate wavelengths between 400-500 nm, the lens material containing Compound 2 lost approximately 7% of its blue light absorption while Compound 1 lost only 1%. The amount of absorbance between 400-500 nm lost after extraction is an indication of the amount of dye removed from the lens material by the extraction process. Low absorbance loss for wavelengths between 400-500 nm indicates that very little dye failed to copolymerize with the lens forming monomers. A comparison of the incorporation efficiency of the dyes of Examples 1, 2, 5 and 11 in the same lens material (66% PEA, 30.5% PEMA and 3.3% BDDA by weight) is shown in FIG. 3. 4-Phenylazophenol, [Solvent Yellow 7 (SY7)], a conventional yellow dye obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company in the amount of 10.3 mg was dissolved into a 10.01 g solution of monomers containing 66% PEA, 30.5% PEMA, and 3.3% BDDA by weight respectively giving a SY7 concentration of 0.103 wt. %.
