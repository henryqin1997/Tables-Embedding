In FIG. 13 a triangle 1301 indicates the position and heading of the airplane. In an alternate embodiment, an image of an airplane may be displayed instead of a triangle. As discussed above, the displayed position and heading of the airplane may be estimated to help smooth the transition from one position and heading reading to the next position and heading reading. Although not illustrated, the ATNS may highlight the names of the taxiways in the taxi route text box 102 as the airplane enters each taxiway to show progress through the cleared taxi route. As the airplane taxis, the ATNS may provide visual and audio notifications of alert conditions, such as nearing the edge of a taxiway, entering a wrong taxiway, or approaching a holdshort line., 94985=[0054]FIG. 15A illustrates the user interface of the ATNS when an airport map is displayed in the align-to-runway mode. In this example, the airplane is on approach to runway 16L. The ATNS displays runway 16L 1550 vertically and centered horizontally on the display. The compass 1551 indicates that the airplane is approaching from the north. When the airplane lands, for example, as detected by WOW, the ATNS may automatically switch to heading up mode., 103723=[0059]FIG. 18 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of the taxi route selection component of the ATNS when an airplane lands. The taxi route selection component controls the entry of the taxiways of the cleared taxi route by a crewmember. In block 1801, the component identifies the logically possible next taxiways for the landing runway based on the information in the airport taxiway data store. The component may alternatively give the crewmember an option to select any one of the taxiways at the airport. In blocks 1802-1809, the component loops, allowing the crewmember to input the next taxiway of the cleared taxi route. In block 1802, the component displays the names of the logically possible next taxiways adjacent to the taxiway/gate buttons. Although not shown by this flow diagram, the component may allow the crewmember to page through the list of taxiways. In block 1803, the component receives the selection of the next taxiway from a crewmember. In block 1804, the component adds the selected taxiway to the taxi route. In block 1805, the component retrieves a mapping for the selected taxiway to the displayed map. In block 1806, the component uses the retrieved mapping to highlight the next taxiway of the taxi route. In block 1807, the component adds the name of the selected taxiway to the taxi route text box. In decision block 1808, if all the taxiways of the taxi route have already been selected, then the component completes, else the component continues at block 1809. In block 1809, the component identifies the logically possible next taxiways for the last selected taxiway and then loops to block 1802 to allow a crewmember to select the next taxiway., 110581=[0064]FIG. 23 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of the evaluate horizontal limit component of the ATNS. This component determines whether the airplane is near the edge of a taxiway. This component is passed the estimated position of the airplane. In block 2301, the component retrieves information describing the location of the current taxiway. In block 2302, the component calculates the distance between the estimated position and the nearest edge of the taxiway. In decision block 2304, if the distance is greater than a specified limit, then the component returns an indication that the airplane is within an acceptable area of the taxiway, else the component returns an indication that the airplane is not within an acceptable area of the taxiway., 93423=[0052]FIG. 12 illustrates the user interface of the ATNS after the crewmember has selected the destination gate. The ATNS indicates the destination gate by highlight 1201. The crewmember may then select the display on moving map button 126 to switch to a dynamic mode. The ATNS may automatically enter an airplane tracking mode. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the ATNS may be in airplane tracking mode concurrently with other modes to show the current position and heading of the airplane even before or during entry of the cleared taxi route., 107790=[0062]FIG. 21 is a flow diagram of the airplane tracking component of the ATNS. This component may be automatically executed periodically (e.g., every one-tenth of a second) to indicate the new position of the airplane. Since the position and heading information of the AASB may be updated less frequently, this component estimates the position and heading information in between AASB readings. In block 2101, the component retrieves the position and heading information from the AASB. In block 2102, the component invokes a component to estimate the current position and heading. In block 2103, the component invokes a component to evaluate the horizontal limit of the current taxiway. In block 2104, the component displays an indication of the airplane at the estimated position and heading. In decision block 2105, if the airplane is not within the horizontal limit, then the component outputs an alert in block 2106 before completing., 101832=[0058] FIGS. 17-23 are flow diagrams that illustrate the processing of the components of the ATNS in one embodiment. The flow diagrams illustrate the overall function of the ATNS. One skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the functions may be implemented in many different ways, and the components and data stores can be organized in many different ways. FIG. 17 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of an initialize ATNS component. This component may be a subcomponent of the main ATNS component. This component identifies the airport (i.e., landing or takeoff) and displays the initial user interface for input of the cleared taxi route. In block 1701, the component receives position, speed, and heading information from the AASB. In block 1702, the component identifies the airport based on comparison of the position information and the location information in the airport location data store. Alternatively, the component may retrieve the identity of the airport from the AASB or receive it from a crewmember. In block 1703, the component retrieves the airport map for the airport from the airport map data store. In block 1704, the component retrieves the taxiway information for the airport from the airport taxiway data store. In block 1705, the component retrieves the preferred taxi routes from the preferred route data store for the selected airport. In block 1706, the component receives an identification of the runway. In one embodiment, a crewmember may input the runway identification. Alternatively, it may be retrieved from the AASB. In block 1707, the component displays the airport map. In block 1708, the component displays the names of the logically possible next taxiways adjacent to the taxiway/gate buttons and then completes., 108814=[0063]FIG. 22 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of the estimate position and heading component of the ATNS. This component may be passed the last retrieved heading and position information and estimates the current position and heading of the airplane. In decision block 2201, if the retrieved position and heading information is different from the last retrieved position and heading information, then new information is available and the component continues at block 2202, else the component continues at block 2204. In block 2202, the component saves the retrieved position and heading information. In block 2203, the component initializes a timer to indicate the time since the last new position and heading information was retrieved. This timer is used to estimate the position and heading. The component then returns the new position and heading information as the estimated heading and position information. In block 2204, the component increments the time since the last new position and heading information was received. In block 2205, the component estimates the current position and heading of the airplane based on the actual position and heading information that was previously retrieved. One skilled in the art will appreciate that various different algorithms may be used to provide the estimates. For example, the algorithm may use a linear extrapolation of the last few positions based on the timer value. The algorithm may also factor in whether the airplane is turning based on the previous position and/or heading information and the ground speed of the airplane. The component then returns the estimated position and heading information., 105554=[0060]FIG. 19 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of the gate selection component of the ATNS when landing. The gate selection component allows a crewmember to designate the destination gate. In block 1901, the component retrieves the gate information for the airport from the airport gate data store. In block 1902, the component displays the concourse names adjacent to the taxiway/gate buttons. In block 1903, the component receives the selection of a concourse from a crewmember. In block 1904, the component highlights the selected concourse on the map. In block 1905, the component displays the names of the gates for the selected concourse adjacent to the taxiway/gate buttons. In block 1906, the component receives the selection of the destination gate from a crewmember. In block 1907, the component highlights the selected gate on the map and then completes., 106529=[0061]FIG. 20 is a flow diagram that illustrates the processing of the preferred route selection component of the ATNS. This component allows a crewmember to select a preferred taxi route as the cleared taxi route. In block 2001, the component retrieves the preferred taxi routes for the landing runway of the landing airport (or for the departing gate when taking off). In block 2002, the component displays a list of the preferred taxi routes. In block 2003, the component receives the selection of a preferred taxi route from a crewmember. In blocks 2004-2007, the component loops, highlighting each taxiway of the preferred taxi route. In block 2004, the component selects the next taxiway of the preferred taxi route. In decision block 2005, if all the taxiways of the preferred taxi route have already been selected, then the component completes, else the component continues at block 2006. In block 2006, the component retrieves a mapping for the selected taxiway to the airport map. In block 2007, the component highlights the selected taxiway and loops to block 2004 to select the next taxiway of the selected preferred taxi route., 95511=[0055]FIG. 15B illustrates the user interface of the ATNS with annotations displayed. In this example, a crewmember has selected the freehand drawing mode and annotated portions of the cleared taxi route. The line 1561 indicates the cleared taxi route. The \u201cXs\u201d 1562 indicate taxiways or portions of taxiways not on the cleared taxi route. The exclamation point with the circle 1563 indicates an area of concern noted by a crewmember. For example, the area of concern may indicate that a construction project is in progress near that position. The circle 1564 indicates the destination gate. The \u201cundo\u201d button 1565 allows a crewmember to remove the freehand drawing segment (e.g., a circle) or other annotation that was last placed on the map. The \u201cclear all\u201d button 1566 allows a crewmember to remove all the annotations from the map., 96432=[0056]FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustrating components of the ATNS in one embodiment. The ATNS may include software components such as a main ATNS component 1601, a taxi route selection component 1602, a gate selection component 1603, an airplane tracking component 1604, a define preferred route component 1605, a flight management control interface 1606, and a map attributes component 1607. In addition, the ATNS may include various data stores such as an airport location data store 1610, an airport map data store 1611, an airport taxiway data store 1612, an airport gate data store 1613, a preferred route data store 1614, and an airport satellite map data store 1615. The data stores may be implemented using files and databases and may contain various data structures. The main ATNS component provides for initialization of the ATNS and selection of the various modes of the ATNS. The taxi route selection component controls the input of the cleared taxi route by a crewmember. The gate selection component controls the input of the destination gate by a crewmember. The airplane tracking component periodically retrieves position and heading information from the AASB and displays an indication of the current position and heading of the airplane. The airplane tracking component may provide various alerts, such as when the airplane is getting near the edge of a taxiway or near another airplane (assuming it has access to the position information of other airplanes). The define preferred route component allows a crewmember to define new preferred taxi routes. The flight management control interface provides access to flight management information, such as position and heading. The flight management control interface may also provide access to taxiing information (e.g., cleared taxi route) provided by the ground control computer system to the flight management control system of the airplane. The map attribute component is used to control various attributes of the map, such as selection of static or dynamic modes, selection of a satellite view mode, and zooming and scrolling of the map. In satellite view mode, the ATNS displays a satellite image of the airport to help orient the crewmembers. The airport location data store contains a list of supported airports along with location information for each airport. The ATNS may use this information to identify the landing or takeoff airport. The airport map data store contains a map of each supported airport. Each map may be stored as vectors describing the boundaries of the runways, taxiways, concourses, and so on, of each airport. The airport taxiway data store identifies the name of each taxiway and other ways of the corresponding airport and may include additional information, such as the logically possible next taxiways for each taxiway. The airport taxiway store contains a mapping of taxiway names to corresponding information in the airport map data store. The airport taxiway data store may also include information describing holdshort lines and identifying major and minor taxiways. In one embodiment, the ATNS allows a crewmember to input only the major taxiways of the cleared taxi route and automatically identifies the corresponding minor taxiways. The airport gate data store identifies the name of the concourses and gates of the airport along with a mapping to the corresponding information in the airport map data store. The preferred route data store contains the currently define preferred routes for each airport. The airport satellite map data store contains a satellite image of the supported airports.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0070] It will be appreciated that although specific embodiments of the ATNS have been described for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the ATNS may provide a user interface that uses various user interface elements, such as drop-down lists, scroll bars, text boxes, radio buttons, and so on, and uses various input devices, such as a trackball, a mouse, a keyboard, a light pen, a voice recognition system, and so on. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the ATNS may be useful for any type of air vehicle or aircraft as it taxis or otherwise moves about the taxiways or other ways of an airport. In addition, it may be useful to have the ATNS available to ground vehicles (e.g., maintenance and emergency vehicles) that travel around the taxiway or other ways of an airport. The ATNS has been described primarily in terms of taxiing after landing. The ATNS is also useful when taxiing before takeoff. A complete route of an airplane may include gate, taxi route, and runway whether taxiing before takeoff or taxiing after landing. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except by the appended claims. [0069] The movement smoothing algorithm smooths the heading and speed of the aircraft. The algorithm initially removes jitter from the heading and speed readings by using the",
