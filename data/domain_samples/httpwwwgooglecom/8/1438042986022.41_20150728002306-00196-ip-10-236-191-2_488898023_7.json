Referring to FIG. 22, a kit containing the apparatus necessary to perform the procedure of the subject invention is illustrated and is designated generally by reference numeral 500. The kit comprises a preformed enclosure 510 defining recessed areas 520 and 530 for respectively retaining the apparatus 200 for applying the anchoring device 10, and the apparatus 300 for drawing the suture 12 relative to the cinching member 20. The enclosure is preferably vacuum formed from a durable plastic material and is configured to be hermetically sealed with a cover sheet 540 to maintain the sterility of the instrumentation enclosed therein. VI. THE KIT Following the initial application of the anchoring device 10, if required, additional anchoring devices may be applied to the vaginal wall and Cooper's ligament. In total, three anchoring devices are retained within the anchor applying apparatus 200 for ready application to body tissue. Referring now to FIG. 19, following the removal of anchor applying apparatus 200 from the surgical site, the suture drawing apparatus 300 is introduced into the retropubic space 400 through the abdominal wall",
