It is also possible to retrofit known thermocyclers with lifting elements. It has been found that it is generally sufficient if the lifting elements together exert a force of about 0.8 N/cm2, preferably 1 N/cm2, on the microtitre plate. Contact pins made of PEEK have proved suitable in that they are thermally stable and do not bake onto microplates of the conventional materials, such as polypropylene, so that the slight frictional lock is sufficient to hold the lifting elements 7 in the blind holes 6. After the thermal treatment of the samples in the microtiter plate, which, for example to initiate a PCR reaction, may undergo a relatively large number of temperature cycles, each of which may consist of, for example, heating from 4\ufffd C. to 96\ufffd C. with subsequent cooling to 4\ufffd C., the cover 14 is swivelled up again. Each of the compressed lifting elements 7 exerts an upward force of about 15 N on the microtitre plate 13. This is sufficient to detach the microtitre plate 13 from the heating surface 3 even if it is baked onto the latter and to raise it, possibly with a delay of a few seconds (FIG. 4b). The microtitre plate 13 raised in this manner and no longer connected to the",
