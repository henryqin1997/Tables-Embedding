    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, numerous modifications may be made in the practice of the invention. For example, while the invention has been described in terms of apparatus (AND gate 60) which tests for completion of communication on an interconnection network, it may be desirable to make other tests in place of or in addition to such a test of the communication network. Thus, if the computer systems includes mathematics co-processors or the software includes various subroutines whose outputs might alter data to be communicated from one processor to another, it will be desirable to test such equipment or operations to make sure they have completed their tasks before issuing the READY signal to the processors. Such a test can readily be made by using a global OR network to test the state of an activity flag associated with each hardware or software element whose operation must be completed before the program can proceed. The processors are all aligned at the time the READY signal goes logic high which occurs at some point between the request for alignment at line 6 and the time each processor initiates a successful test for a 1-bit in the AL register as at lines 20-23. It is not necessary, however, that each processor make such a test at the same time; and it is not necessary that the first such test be made after the",
