    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59251=Depending on the type of PDA/MDA in communication with external controller 102, space may be available for specialized circuitry specifically adapted for ultrasound signal processing such that a controller or portions thereof may be embedded into the PDA/MDA. This preferably permits scan head 103 to be directly connected to a port on the PDA/MDA using a thin wire connector. A thin wire connector is preferably a pair of Low Voltage Differentiating Signal (LVDS) lines and is preferably used when beamforming is to be performed in the scan head as opposed to the external controller. Alternatively, a universal serial bus (USB), a USB2 or an IEEE1394-type interface, or other suitable interface, may be used. Alternative embodiments provide for using a PDA/MDA wireless interface, such as an infrared (IR) port or radio frequency (RF), such as Bluetooth or wireless LAN, to communicate directly, for example, to a corresponding IR port which may be built into the scan head., 71774=Interconnect 104 from external controller 102 to ultrasound scan head 103 preferably may be wired or wireless. In a hardwire mode, a thin wire cable or an optical fiber link may be used. When interconnect 104 of embodiments is wired, the interconnect may be a thin wire or a wide broadband serial interface. In another embodiment, interconnect 104 may be a general, low voltage differential signaling cable. Further embodiments may provide for an interconnect that may include, but is not limited to, USB, broadband, or high speed USB. High speed USB includes the broadband 1394 as well as other wide media networks available for some other applications. In a wireless configuration, an IR or RF signal may be used. Other wireless interconnect options also are available including, but not limited to, ultra wide band (UWB), wireless USB, and UWB wireless 1394. Accordingly, as wireless options develop, it may be possible to substitute wired options with other wireless options. Although interconnect 104 has been described with respect to hardwire and wireless configurations, this does not limit the means for communication available., 40577=The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/491,919, entitled \u201cUltrasound Conversion Kit for a PDA/MDA,\u201d filed Jul. 31, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the invention as defined by the appended claims. Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification. As one will readily appreciate from the disclosure, processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, means, methods, or steps, presently existing or later to be developed that perform substantially the same function or achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding embodiments described herein may be utilized. Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to include within their scope such processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, means, methods, or steps. Although the interconnects have been described as being wireline or wireless radios of various types, it should be appreciated that a single super broad band wireless radio may be implemented to replace these interconnects. Accordingly, the system architecture may be simplified, for example, into acquisition sensor/radio, user interface/radio, processing server/radio, and display/radio or different combination of modules/radio. It should be appreciated that as PDA/MDA technology changes, such as when a PDA manufacturer designs an upgrade, typically no change in the interface of external controller 102 is required. Accordingly, an upgraded PDA/MDA 101 may be incorporated",
