Additional advantages and modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art. The control module 30 may control a life light, such as an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), attached to an upper surface 60 of the integrated adhesive in the visible or infrared spectrum to help the corpsmen locate the wounded soldier. The light frequency may advantageously be selected for being visible by night vision goggles (NVG), low light camera and/or naked eye. The light pattern/color may also relay information as to the wounded or injured person's condition such as flashing if in a critical condition. To further reduce susceptibility to detection, modulating with a spread spectrum carrier is difficult for hostile forces to differentiate from background noise and provides an additional layer of encryption even if detected. For instance, the newly approved federal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) endorsed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) may be employed, similar to 128-bit AES AIRFORTRESS WIRELESS SECURITY GATEWAY developed by Fortress Technologies Inc. of Tampa, Fla. This device encrypts everything from the data layer up in a",
