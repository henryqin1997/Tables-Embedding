Basically, such methods comprise stretching the sheet or film at least in the machine or longitudinal direction after it is cast or extruded an amount of about 1.5-10 times its original dimension. Such sheet or film may also be stretched in the transverse or cross-machine direction by apparatus and methods well known in the art, in amounts of generally 1.5-10 (usually 3-4 for polyesters and 6-10 for polypropylene) times the original dimension. Such apparatus and methods are well known in the art and are described in such U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,234., 26695=This application is one of a group of five applications co-filed on May 16, 2002 under Serial Nos. 10/147,703; 10/147,776; 10/147,777; 10/147,775; and 10/147.659, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 36177=In U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,153, oriented polymer film containing pores for expanding the viewing angle of light in a liquid crystal device is disclosed. The pores in U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,153 are created by stress fracturing solvent cast polymers during a secondary orientation. The aspect ratio of these materials, while shaping incident light, expanding the viewing angle, do not provide uniform diffusion of light and would cause uneven lighting of a liquid crystal formed image. Further, the disclosed method for creating voids results in void size and void distribution that would not allow for optimization of light diffusion and light transmission. In example 1 of this patent, the reported 90% transmission includes wavelengths between 400 and 1500 nm integrating the visible and invisible wavelengths, but the transmission at 500 nm is less that 30% of the incident light. Such values are unacceptable for any diffusion film useful for image display, such as a liquid crystal display., 104276=The microbeads of cross-linked polymer range in size from 0.1-50 \u03bcm, and are present in an amount of 5-50% by weight based on the weight of the polyester. Microbeads of polystyrene should have a Tg of at least 20\ufffd C. higher than the Tg of the continuous matrix polymer and are hard compared to the continuous matrix polymer.}",

Further, because the invention materials were constructed on an oriented polyester base, the materials have a higher elastic modulus compared to cast diffuser sheets. The oriented polymer base of the example allow for the light diffuser to be thin and therefore cost efficient and light as the materials content of the example materials is reduced compared to prior art materials. With a uniform diffuser, the level of diffusion",
