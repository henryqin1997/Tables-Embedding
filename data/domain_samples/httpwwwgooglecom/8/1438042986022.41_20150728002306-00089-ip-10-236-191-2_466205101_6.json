This description is intended to provide specific examples of individual embodiments which clearly disclose the present invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to these embodiments or the use of elements having specific configurations and shapes as presented herein. All alternative modifications and variations of the present invention which follow in the spirit of the broad scope of the appended claims are included. The present invention also provides a method for computer-controlled automated distribution of articles whereby an authorized customer 1 using the system described above can order one or more articles and have them automatically delivered to a specified location, e.g. a home or business address. Sensory modules 11 placed at numerous locations along the underground tunnel network 12 of the present invention are in communication with the route information center 9 and in one embodiment of the present invention may perform a dual function. They can fulfill their primary role which is to relay information regarding vehicular traffic conditions to the route information center 9 and, in addition, they can also interact with guidance sensors 16 placed on the vehicle 15. Such guidance sensors 16 interact with the route information center's 9 program. The vehicle sensors 16 interact with the sensory modules 11 in order to switch the path of the vehicle 15 from",
