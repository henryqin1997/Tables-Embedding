Since the coating station is usually only one part of a complicated expensive machine with a high rate of production, such as a paper board machine, or a steel galvanizing line, faults such as dirt in the nozzle produce scrap rapidly while stops disrupt many processes and restarting may take many minutes. Since a speck of dirt on or in the nozzle can cause a streak in a 200 inch wide strip running 1000 feet per minute or more, lost time and lost production cannot be tolerated.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having now described the features, discoveries and principles of the invention, the manner in which the improved cleaning mechanism for coating control fluid nozzle is constructed and used, the characteristics of the construction, and the advantageous, new and useful results obtained; the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, parts, and combinations, are set forth in the appended claims. Moreover, the description and illustration of the invention is by way of example, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness and understanding; but no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirements of the prior art, because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Accordingly, the improved nozzle cleaning mechanism is simplified, provides an effective, safe, inexpensive, and efficient device which achieves all the enumerated objectives, provides for eliminating difficulties encountered with prior devices, and solves problems and obtains new results in the art. If desired, only blades 61 and 62 can be used for cleaning nozzle lips 6 or they can be mounted adjacent brushes 50 and used in combination therewith to provide an additional type of cleaning arrangement. Blades 61 and 62 are generally similar to each other with each block being formed with a V-shaped notch 65 defined by sloped side surfaces 66 and",
