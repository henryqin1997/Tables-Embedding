The FIG. 4 structure is a starting point. Next, as shown in FIG. 10, a glue/barrier layer 100 of TiW, TiN, TaN, Cr, or Ti is sputter deposited to a thickness of between about 200 and 2000 Angstroms. Next, a Cu seed layer 102 is sputter deposited to a thickness of between about 2,000 and 10,000 Angstroms. Bulk layer 104 of Cu is next electroplated to a thickness of between about 3 and 20 \u03bcm, also using a photoresist 94\u2032 and conventional lithography to define the areas to be electroplated in the selective deposition process of the invention. Finally, an optional cap layer 106 comprising Ni may also be formed, also by electroplating, to a thickness of between about 0.1 and 3 um.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{91757=In a fourth example, typical capability fine line metal thickness is about 0.4 \u03bcm, fine line metal width is about 0.2 \u03bcm, fine line IMD thickness is about 0.4 \u03bcm, and the line spacing is about 0.2 \u03bcm. Post-passivation metal thickness is about 10 \u03bcm, metal width is about 10 \u03bcm, dielectric thickness is bout 10 \u03bcm, and line spacing is about 40 \u03bcm. The metal thickness difference results in about a 1250 times reduction in resistance in the post-passivation metal structure over the fine line metal structure. The capacitance is dominated by coupling capacitance and results in about an 8 times difference in capacitance in the post-passivation metal structure over the fine line metal structure. Then, the reduction in RC product is about 10,000 times., 48899=Layers 14 represent metal and dielectric layers that are typically created over ILD 12. Layers 14 contain one or more layers of dielectric, interspersed with one or more metal interconnect lines 13 that make up a network of electrical connections. At a top metal layer are points 16 of electrical contact. These points 16 of electrical contact can establish electrical interconnects to the transistors and other devices 11 that have been provided in and on the surface of the substrate 10. These metal layers are referred to as fine line metal interconnections. Typically, the intermetal dielectric (IMD) layers comprise silicon-based oxides, such as silicon dioxide formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, CVD TEOS oxide, spin-on-glass (SOG), fluorosilicate glass (FSG), high density plasma CVD oxides, or a composite layer formed by a portion of this group of materials. The IMD layers typically have a thickness of between about 1000 and 10,000 Angstroms. The fine line metal interconnections are typically formed by sputtering aluminum or an aluminum alloy and patterning the aluminum to form the fine metal lines. Alternatively, the fine lines may be formed by a copper damascene process. In the copper damascene process, the copper is protected by an adhesion/barrier layer not only underlying the copper, but also surrounding the copper at the sidewalls of the line through the IMD. These fine lines typically have a thickness of between about 1000 and 10,000 Angstroms. In the fabrication process of the fine line metal interconnections, a typical clean room environment of class 10 or less is required; that is, having no more than 10 particles larger than 0.5 microns in any given cubic foot of air. The fine line IC metal is fabricated using 5\ufffd steppers or scanners or better and using a photoresist layer having thickness of less than 5 microns., 34765=Since the 1960's, sputtered aluminum has become a main stream IC interconnection metal material. The aluminum film is sputtered covering the whole wafer, and then the metal is patterned using photolithography methods and dry and/or wet etching. It is technically difficult and economically expensive to create thicker than 2 \u03bcm aluminum metal lines due to the cost and stress concerns of blanket sputtering. About 1995, damascene copper metal became an alternative for IC metal interconnection. In damascene copper, the insulator is patterned and copper metal lines are formed within the insulator openings by blanket electroplating copper and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the unwanted copper. Electroplating the whole wafer with thick metal creates large stress and carries a very high material (metal) cost. Furthermore, the thickness of damascene copper is usually defined by the insulator thickness, typically chemical vapor deposited (CVD) oxides, which does not offer the desired thickness due to stress and cost concerns. Again it is also technically difficult and economically expensive to create thicker than 2 \u03bcm copper lines., 31691=This application is related to MEG00-008CBBC, Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated, and that form has been described in detail, it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention or from the scope of the appended claims. In summary, the sheet resistance of the post-passivation metal is at least two times smaller than the sheet resistance of the fine line metal. As shown in the examples above, the sheet resistance of the post-passivation metal can be five times smaller than the sheet resistance of the fine line metal. For some applications of post-passivation metal, a 10 \u03bcm thick copper thickness is used. In this case, the sheet resistance is 2 milliohms per square, which is at least 10 times smaller than that of the fine line metal. Sheet resistance is calculated by dividing the resistivity of the metal by the metal thickness. Sheet resistance is independent of metal line width (W) and length (L), and is in a unit of resistance per square. The number of square is counted by dividing length (L) by width (W), L/W. For example, resistivity of aluminum is 3.0 micro-ohm-cm, resistivity of copper is 2 micro-ohm-cm, and resistivity of gold is 2.2 micro-ohm-cm. In fine line metallization, for aluminum lines having a thickness of 0.8",
