Numerous alternative embodiments may be desired without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Only a few of the expensive matrixes 18 are sufficient with this device to produce an unlimited number of different master structures. In a fourth embodiment of the device a controllable drive, instead of the ray deflection device 24 (FIG. 5), produces a relative mechanical movement between a source of radiation 31 comprising components 20; 22 and 23 and an aggregate 32 comprising components 17; 18; 19; 25; 26 and 29, whereby the illuminated location, i.e. the focal point or the diaphragm image is shifted in the plane of the cover layer 19. In the following steps additional groups of surface portions 8, 9, 10 (FIG. 4) are transferred by means of one of the above-described method, whereby surface elements 16 of the cover layer 19 (FIG. 5) can again be shaped. This process of form reproduction is repeated until all surface portions 8, 9, 10 (FIG. 1) of structure 7 have been produced. The matrix 18 is then lifted off from the cover layer 19, is rotated around an axis 30 which is perpendicular to the plane of matrix 18, is shifted laterally or is replaced by a matrix 18 with a different microstructure 28. The diaphragms can be replaced in the modulator 22 and",
