This describes a browser that arranges HTML pages on the back, top, bottom, left and right inside faces of a cube, with the viewer positioned just inside the nearest (sixth) face. Each of the five navigable inside faces can open into a further cube. The aim is to enable the viewer simultaneously to see several pages selected by the viewer. This could be especially useful where the content on the five pages is being compared or contrasted., 81028=Another method for searching and presenting information in a geography-based configuration which also provides realistic navigation is described in U.S. patent application Publication No. 2002/0059207 A1. This method converts multiple aerial photos of an actual city into a three-dimensional stereoscopic aerial view, and allows the viewer to move across this view, simulating a \u2018sight-seeing flight\u2019, and to request information pertaining to his or her location. This is done by linking the latitude and longitude of the viewer's position with \u2018landmark databases\u2019 compiled using conventional Internet searches based on keywords or other verbal expressions. Multiple viewers can interact and be tracked., 65664=A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent & Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations the viewer is facing a display window and could potentially interact with the window in the manner of a conventional two-dimensional browser. FIG. 4 the viewer is at a \u201ccorner\u201d of a \u201cstreet\u201d with a \u201cside street\u201d running off to the left. In FIG. 3 show alternative views of the three-dimensional space. For example in FIG. 4 and FIG. 3 By analogy with e-commerce business methods, a sales tax could be imposed on viewers transacting with content providers. An auction system could be used to enable display window rights owners to buy or sell their rights to others. The presentation, display and navigation method has many possible applications. Apart from the HTML browsing and virtual shopping embodiments described in detail above, virtual entertainment guides, tourist guides, trade fairs and travel/hospitality guides could be created. The method also finds application in displaying the contents of libraries, photo libraries, scientific data, and medical records and it could play a role in virtual government. In addition, road tolls, gateway tolls, admission fees and transport charges could be built into any model. For example, the virtual space may be used in an analogous way to any property space and new properties can be sold or leased, ground rents and service charges imposed, property",
