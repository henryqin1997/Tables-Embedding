The portable computer 20 is connected to the microprocessor 19 by means of the cable 21, of an input terminal 39 of the terminal board 14, of an output terminal 40, and of a cable 41 connected to a special socket 42 of the microprocessor 19. In a variant, the cable 21 may be connected directly to the special socket 42. The inputs/outputs terminals of the inputs/outputs circuit 18 may be of any known type and each may comprise a coded marking 37 and a signal light 38. The cables 22a, 22b, 23 and 36 belong to the pre-cabling network and are connected to the terminal board 14, 14' by its rear face, while the cables 27a, 27b, 30 and 33 are put in place upon request and are connected to the terminal board by the front face. Similarly, an actuating element 13' receives an electric signal, by means of an output terminal 32 of the inputs/outputs circuit 18, of a first cable 33 which connects it to a terminal 35 of the terminal board 14' by its front face, and of a second cable 36 between the rear face of the terminal 35 and the actuating element 13'.
