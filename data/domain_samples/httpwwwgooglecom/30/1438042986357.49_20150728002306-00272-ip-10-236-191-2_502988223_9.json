    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In use of the apparatus, total delivery time will depend on the volume of the low concentration solution. For example, with a 1 liter volume and a flow rate of 1 ml/min infusion can run for approximately 16.7 hours. At the same rate with a low concentration solution volume of 0.5 liters, the infusion can be contained for approximately 8.3 hours. In an illustrative embodiment, a one liter intravenous solution bag containing 0.9% saline can be used. 10 ml lidocaine HCL (200 mg/ml) is introduced into the bag by an additive syringe, resulting in a lidocaine HCL concentration of 2 mg/ml (1.7 mg/ml lidocaine). The mixing vessel can consist of a 20 ml vial or prepackaged lidocaine solution containing 200 mg lidocaine HCL (8.7 mg/ml lidocaine). The vial may have a rubber closure through which hypodermic needles are inserted. The vial closure is pierced with two needles, the needle providing the inlet being 1/2\"\ufffd27 SWG hypodermic needle, and the outlet being provided by a 11/2\"\ufffd22 SWG hypodermic needle. The inlet needle terminates in the lower portion of the inverted container, and the outlet needle extends into the upper portion, in the manner illustrated in FIG. 1. Preferably, although not essentially, the mixing vessel is completely full of solution, thereby eliminating any air space which might create air bubbles in the infusion solution. With the apparatus as shown in FIG. 1, after the patient has been given",
