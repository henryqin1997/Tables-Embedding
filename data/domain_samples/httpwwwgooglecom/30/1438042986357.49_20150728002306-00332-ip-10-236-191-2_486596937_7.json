Such systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/741,416, filed Dec. 19, 2003., 62697=Alternatively, instead of using a test strip comprising a lateral flow porous carrier such as described by EP291194, a test strip having the binding reagents disposed within a capillary could be used, such as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,855., 65482=Conveniently the assay result reading device will comprise some manner of indicating the result of the assay to a user. This may take the form, for example, of an audible or visible signal. Desirably the device will comprise a visual display to display the assay result. This may simply take the form of one or more LED's or other light sources, such that illumination of a particular light source or combination of light sources conveys the necessary information to the user. Alternatively the device may be provided with an alphanumeric or other display, such as an LCD. In addition, or as an alternative, to displaying the assay result, the device may also display or indicate in some other way to the user whether the calculated rate and/or extent of progress of the liquid sample is within the predetermined acceptable limits, and thus whether or not the result of the particular assay should be disregarded. If the reading device determines that a particular assay result should be disregarded it may prompt the user to repeat the assay. Displays suitable for displaying this sort of information are known to those skilled in the art and disclosed, for example, in WO 99/51989., 34224=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/508,001, filed Oct. 2, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference., 34832=Analytical devices suitable for home testing of analytes are now widely commercially available. An immunoassay device suitable for this purpose for the measurement of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is sold by Unipath under the brand-name CLEARBLUE\ufffd and is disclosed in EP291194., 89063=An assay result reader according to the present disclosure may also include optical arrangement such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/508,001, filed Oct. 2,2003., 68560=The assay device for use with the reading device is a generally conventional lateral flow test stick e.g. of the sort disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,271, U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,013, EP 728309 or EP 782707. The assay device and a surface or surfaces of the slot in the reader, into which the assay device is inserted, are so shaped and dimensioned that (1) the assay device can only be successfully inserted into the reader in the appropriate orientation; and (2) there is a precise three dimensional alignment of the reader and an inserted assay device, which ensures that the assay result can be read correctly the reader., 61646=The assay test strip may be any conventional lateral flow assay test strip such as disclosed in EP291194 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,862. The test strip preferably comprises a porous carrier containing a particulate labelled specific binding reagent and an unlabelled specific binding reagent. The light sources and corresponding photodetectors are preferably so aligned such that during use, light from the light source or sources falls upon the respective zones on the porous carrier and is reflected or transmitted to the respective photodetectors. The photodetectors generate a current roughly proportional to the amount of light falling upon it which is then fed through a resistor to generate a voltage. The amount of light reaching the photodetector depends upon the amount of coloured particulate label present and therefore the amount of analyte. Thus the amount of analyte present in the sample may be determined. This method of optically determining the analyte concentration is described more fully in EP653625., 35169=EP291194 discloses an immunoassay device comprising a porous carrier containing: a particulate labelled specific binding reagent for an analyte, which reagent is freely mobile when in the moist state; and an unlabelled specific binding reagent for the same analyte, which reagent is immobilised in a detection zone or test zone downstream from the unlabelled specific binding reagent. Liquid sample suspected of containing analyte is applied to the porous carrier whereupon it interacts with the particulate labelled binding reagent to form an analyte-binding partner complex. The particulate label is coloured and is typically gold or a dyed polymer, for example latex or polyurethane. The complex thereafter migrates into a detection zone whereupon it forms a further complex with the immobilised unlabelled specific binding reagent enabling the extent of analyte present to be detected or observed. Due to the nature of the binding reactions taking place it is necessary to wait for a particular period of time to elapse after the test has commenced in order to read the result. This is particularly important for a visual, semi-quantitative type of test whereby the detection zone or read line develops over time.}",

This alignment ensures that any variation of the relative positioning of the test strip and assay reader has minimal effect on the angle \u03b8. While PD1 and PD2 are not aligned with the reference zone, and are therefore subject to a relatively large (and therefore undesirable) angle of \u03b8, this problem is not significant because (i) the use of two detectors to read the reference zone allows for compensation of any positional variation, since relative movement of the test strip so as to increase \u03b8 for one photodetector may decrease \u03b8 for the other photodetector; and (ii) the reference zone is used to give a background reading for calibration purposes\u2014the photodiodes are not required to measure the signal intensity from a narrow line (as with the test or control zones), and so the measurement of the reference zone signal is inherently less sensitive to variation from mis-positioning.
