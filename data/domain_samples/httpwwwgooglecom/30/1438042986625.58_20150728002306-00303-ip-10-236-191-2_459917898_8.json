    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The transistor switches 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 100, and 102 may be operated independently of each other or operated in groups. In a preferred arrangement, the switches are grouped into four sets of two and biased by switching signals S1 -S4 which place the switches in a conducting state when active and a non-conducting state when not active. As shown in FIG. 6, the gates of transistors 86 and 88 are both biased by S1, transistors 94 and 100 are biased by S2, transistors 96 and 102 are biased by S3, and transistors 90 and 92 are biased by S4. In the first data state, S1 and S4 are active and S2 and S3 are inactive. In the second data state, S1 and S4 are inactive and S2 and S3 are active. The buffer 12 may be placed in a tri-state mode by setting the switching signals S1 -S4 inactive. Because switch transistors 88 and 92 have an inherent resistance, it is advantageous to include matching switch transistors 100, 102 in series with transistor 98 as shown in FIG. 6 to better match the resistance of the load path and the shunt path. If these additional transistors 100, 102 have similar geometries as transistors 88 and 92, they will introduce a similar inherent resistances as transistors 88 and 92. The shunt transistor 98 can then be designed to have a resistance equal to the",
