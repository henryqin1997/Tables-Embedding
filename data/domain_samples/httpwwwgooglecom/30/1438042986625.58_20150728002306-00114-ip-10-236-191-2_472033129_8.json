    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there are shown and described present preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be distinctly understood that the invention is not limited thereto, but may be otherwise variously embodied and practiced within the scope of the following claims. ACCORDINGLY, Instead of providing perforations or holes possessing a round circular-shaped cross-sectional area, the perforations or holes could be differently designed in their configuration or shape, for instance can possess a multi-cornered, oval, elongate or slot-shaped configuration, by way of example. As will be evident from the drawings, the perforated plates 4, whether they be mounted to be stationary or rotatable, always have a forced flow of the fiber stock suspension through such perforated plates 4, and specifically through the open-ended perforations or holes or the like thereof. Consequently, there is beneficially avoided the formation of any shunt or short-circuit flow of the fiber stock suspension. The fiber stock suspension which is delivered through the grooves 2 of the grinding disc or grinding discs, as the case may be, must pass through the holes or perforations of the perforated plate or plates 4. The embodiments of FIGS. 7 and 8 which utilize rotatable perforated plates or discs 4 have the advantage that they do not exhibit any pumping action, thus the no-load or idle power requirements are substantially reduced. In the modified embodiment of FIG. 8 there are rotatably arranged or mounted two perforated discs 4",
