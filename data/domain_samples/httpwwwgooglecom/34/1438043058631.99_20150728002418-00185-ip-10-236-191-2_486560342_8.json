    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In summary, the network and process of the present invention provides the ability to process a mobility origination, derive the subscriber's location from this trigger, and construct the set of all coupons or message associated with that location, for that subscriber, at that time. These messages are then delivered to the subscriber on their handset for their selection or deletion. The WSN can also be configured to further filter the information sent to the handset by giving the subscriber selectable options through an interactive voice response menu. The user can respond to requests by pressing a particular key or speaking a particular word or words. After the announcement or interactive voice response is complete, the WSN disconnects the voice connection and begins sending the short message coupons incrementally. When the call arrives, a voice connection between the WSN and the subscriber handset is set-up. At this point, the WSN plays a specific announcement such as \u201cWelcome to Dirty Creek Mall. We will shortly download 3 coupons to your handset.\u201d The message flow begins with the subscriber dialing the pre-defined telephone number. The mobile then generates the origination message to the MSC/HLR. The message flow requires that the original voice call be routed back to the WSN as part of the origination request. In this case, the mobile origination response includes a temporary logical dialed number that causes the MSC to route the call to the WSN.",
