For example, features or aspects of any of the embodiments may be applied in combination with any other of the embodiments or in place of counterpart features or aspects thereof. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. \u2019) is also used to indicate an active low signal. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d is used herein to express a direct connection as well as a connection through one or more intervening circuits or structures. The term \u201cexemplary\u201d is used to express an example, not a preference or requirement. <signal name> In the foregoing description and in the accompanying drawings, specific terminology and drawing symbols have been set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. In some instances, the terminology and symbols may imply specific details that are not required to practice the invention. For example, the interconnection between circuit elements or circuit blocks may be shown or described as multi-conductor or single conductor signal lines. Each of the multi-conductor signal lines may alternatively be single-conductor signal lines, and each of the single-conductor signal lines may alternatively be multi-conductor signal lines.
