Unicat ISM active ceramic spherical support media series are impregnated, all-purpose support materials for use in refineries, chemical and gas plants and provides active ceramic support. It is available in a wide variety of sizes and in the form of spheres and in tubular shapes. Important characteristics for these class of products are a uniform spherical shape that provides high stress distribution and a high crush strength. Composition ranges are: CoO 1-2% or NiO 1-2%, MoO3 5-6%, SiO2 55%, Al2O3 25-35%, TiO2 0-2% max, Fe2O3 0-2% max, CaO 0.3-0.5% K2O 1-3%, sulfur 20-30 ppm, and Cl 1-5 ppm. The bulk density can range from 81-90 lbs/cu.ft., depending on size. The preferred size is \u215b inch spheres. The crush strength is >400-1800 lbs., based on size correlation surface area: 0.02-0.03 M2/g; apparent porosity >0.80-0.9; and acid resistance is >98%}",

As will also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. It should also be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting, and that the full scope of the invention is to be determined with reference to the claims that follow. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the above examples can be readily scaled-up to provide pilot plant and commercial scale operations. As demonstrated above, the process of the invention produces an environmentally harmless, neutral, non-toxic aqueous stream similar in composition to seawater, at a very low initial capital cost when compared to the processes of the prior art. As a further advantage, the process has no significant operating expenses. The hypochlorous acid reacts with sulfur species including sulfide ion, polysulfides, mercaptans, thioethers, dialkyl disulfides, and other organics and sulfur compounds over a nickel oxide-molybdenum oxide catalyst bed, causing their oxidation to sulfates.
