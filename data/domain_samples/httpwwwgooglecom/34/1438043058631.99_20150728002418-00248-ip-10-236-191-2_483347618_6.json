Bed temperature started at 495\ufffd C. and average ending temperature was about 1000\ufffd C. Bed temperature was more uniform. Cool off rate for the bed is more rapid., 72823=The gas glow was raised to 1500 ccm to check bed uniformity. The electrode placement and the grain level remained the same. Bed temperature started at 300\ufffd C. and heating continued for twelve minutes. The ending temperature was about 950\ufffd C. and the bed temperature was uniform to within 20\ufffd C., 69777=In #4B, the amperage was set to 35+5 amps and the bed went from 500\ufffd C. to 900\ufffd C. Interestingly, at very high flow rates (2400 ccm+), very high wattage readings were recorded., 70863=Flow (ccm) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1500 2000 2500, 30809=This is a continuation, of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above results are obtained from a small retort with the electrodes only 1 5/16 inches apart. With a larger retort, the size of the electrode, voltage, grain volume, and flow rates will need to increase. Samples indicate the grain is unaffected by the heating method. Grain effect: This is similar to the distance apart. The better the alignment, the smaller the heat circle. Electrode alignment: The closer the electrodes are to each other, the smaller the heat circle is, and the greater the localized heating. Electrode Distance Apart: AC 60 cycle works very nicely and should be the cheapest to provide. Current Type: Power amount can be adjusted with gas flow. If a very evenly heated bed is desired, slower heating is needed. Power amount: To get an even heated fluid bed, the flow must be sufficient to agitate the grain well. Gas flow: The heat zone ends at the end of the rods so this can be set where bed heating is needed. Electrode length: It should be large enough to handle the amperage but excessive size interferes with fluidization. Electrode diameter: Results This test produced an interesting result even though there was failure to get bed heat. Using undersize electrodes, the electrodes became hot but not the grain. The rods use up the power. Grain was added to the retort to increase the contact with the electrodes but still didn't produce",
