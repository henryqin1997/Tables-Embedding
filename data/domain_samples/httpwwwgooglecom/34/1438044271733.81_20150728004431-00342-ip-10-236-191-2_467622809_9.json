Preferably, an anisotropic dry etching technique, such as RIE or ECR etching using a fluorine-containing gas such as CF6, NF3, or SF6, with oxygen, is used. A portion 6' of the insulating film 6 is left in place adjacent to and contiguous with gate electrode 2 over active layer 3, i.e., at the side wall of the gate electrode 2. By controlled etching, the transverse width of the non-metallic film portion 6' left at the side of gate electrode 2 is reduced to a desired dimension extending from the gate electrode 2. That dimension and the width of gate electrode 2 determine the channel length in the final FET device and the spacing between the drain region and the gate electrode 2. Using the second mask portion 6' and the mask 5 as implantation masks, silicon or selenium ions are implanted into the substrate at energies of about 50 KeV to a dosage below 1\ufffd1013 cm-2 to form a relatively low dopant concentration drain region 42. Both the source region 41 and the drain region 42 have a higher dopant concentration than the active layer 3. However, the dopant concentration in the drain region 42 is low relative to the dopant concentration of the source region 41., 37646=A process for producing an FET according to the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1(a) to 1(d). A semi-insulating GaAs substrate 1 first has deposited on it a protective insulating layer (not shown) of, for example, SiO, SiON, or SiN, to a thickness of several hundred Angstroms. By comparison, the GaAs substrate 1 typically has a thickness of about 600 microns. With the protective film in place, silicon ions with energies of about 30 to 50 KeV and a dosage level of about 1 to 6\ufffd1012 cm-2 are implanted into the substrate 1. The implantation is followed by annealing to activate the implanted species. The protective insulating layer is then removed, for example, by etching. The ion implantation step produces an active layer 3 within the body of the substrate and at its surface., 29905=In the FET structures of FIGS. 7-9 and 10(f), the formation of the source and drain regions is carried out simultaneously by ion implantation. As a result, those regions are generally symmetrical with respect to their depths and dopant concentrations. Another FET structure for suppressing short channel effects employs asymmetrically doped source and drain regions. Such a structure is shown in cross-section in FIG. 11 taken from FIG. 4 of Kimura et al, \"Asymmetrical Implantation Self-alignment Technique For GaAs MESFETs\", Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 27, No. 7, July 1988, pages L1340 to L1343. The self-aligned structure of FIG. 11 includes a source region 4A that is more heavily doped and deeper than is the drain region 4b. That result is achieved by carrying out three ion implantation steps in the course of making the FET rather than the two implantation steps employed in making the structures described above., 38473=A gate material 2', for example, a refractory metal or a refractory metal alloy such as WN, WAl, WSi, or W, is formed on a portion of the surface of the substrate where the active layer is present. The gate material is deposited by sputtering or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to a thickness of about 0.2 to 0.5 micron. The gate material covers only a portion of the surface of the substrate 1 through controlled deposition, by etching, or by the lift-off technique. Using the gate material 2' as an ion implantation mask, silicon or selenium ions are implanted in the unmasked portion of the substrate 1 at energies of about 50 to 100 KeV and a dosage exceeding about 1\ufffd1013 cm-2. This implantation of dopant ions forms a relatively high dopant concentration source region 41 in substrate 1. Preferably immediately after this second ion implantation step, the substrate is annealed at about 800 degrees Centigrade in an ambient of arsine, if substrate 1 is GaAs, to activate the implanted species. The resulting structure is illustrated in FIG. 1(a).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The structures of FIGS. 4-6, like those of FIGS. 1(d), 2(d), and 3(d), provide significant performance advantages over the prior art FETs. The invention provides FETs that can be reproducibly manufactured with precision gate lengths, asymmetrically disposed gate electrodes spaced from the both the source and drain regions, asymmetrically doped source and drain regions, low gate-to-source resistances, high drain breakdown voltages, and improved high frequency performance. In FIG. 6, still another FET structure is shown. In addition to the elements of the FET of FIG. 1(d), the structure of FIG. 6 includes an electrically insulating layer 71 interposed between active layer 3 and gate electrode 2 on the surface of substrate 1. This MISFET structure is particularly useful for materials such as InP in which the preparation of rectifying junctions is sometimes difficult. The structure of FIG. 6 may be prepared by the same methods employed to prepare the structure of FIG. 4 except that a semi-insulating layer or an insulating layer, such as SiO2, SiN, or a III-V semiconductor alloy having a larger band gap than the substrate, such as AlGaAs, on a GaAs substrate, is deposited on the surface of substrate 1 after the formation of the active layer 3 and before the deposition of the gate material 2'. As with the layer 51 of FIG. 4, the layer 71 is protected by the gate electrode 2 in subsequent processing steps. In FIG. 5,",
