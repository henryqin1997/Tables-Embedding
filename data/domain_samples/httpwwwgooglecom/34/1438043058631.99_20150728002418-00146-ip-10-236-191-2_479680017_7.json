Briefly, in a handshake phase of the server authentication process, the client authenticates the server (and is optionally authenticated by the server) and selects a symmetric master key for subsequent data transmission. In the case of a new session, the handshake phase involves four messages: CLIENT_HELLO, SERVER_HELLO, CLIENT_MASTER_KEY, and SERVER_VERIFY, the first and third messages being sent by the client, and the second and fourth by the server. The CLIENT_HELLO message contains a random authentication challenge to the server and a request for the type and level of cryptography and certification to be used for the session. The SERVER_HELLO message contains a certificate of the server and a random connection identifier. The server's certificate is used by the client to authenticate the server. The CLIENT_MASTER_KEY message sent by the client includes the master key for the session (from which the session keys are derived) encrypted with the public key taken from the server's certificate. Finally, the server sends the SERVER_VERIFY message which includes a response to the client's challenge and a random session ID for the session. Since the server authentication is based on the certificate of the server, the MQIS keeps one or more external certificates 148 (FIG. 3) issued by respective certification authorities, one of which is transmitted to the receiving MQ server upon request.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the foregoing detailed description, it can be appreciated that the present invention provides a method and system for access control of message queues in a message queuing system for asynchronous communications. The access control of the invention implements certificate-based message authentication and uses a database of the message queuing system as a trusted entity in the authentication process. The certificates used may be internal certificates generated by the message queuing system. The use of internal certificates provides significant convenience to the user. Alternatively, the user may select to use an external certificate issued by a certification authority, which provides compatibility with other certificate-based authentication operations. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the arrangements for the storage and retrieval of the private key described above are provided only as examples. With a given certificate for message authentication, there are many other alternative ways, which may employ special hardware devices or software, for retrieving the private key and generating the digital signature. Such alternative ways may be used in the message authentication without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. In an alternative arrangement which is also shown in FIG. 8, the private key 180 for the user certificate 182 may be stored on a machine-readable card 184 held by the user, and the link 183 stored with the certificate 182 in the certificate store points to the",
