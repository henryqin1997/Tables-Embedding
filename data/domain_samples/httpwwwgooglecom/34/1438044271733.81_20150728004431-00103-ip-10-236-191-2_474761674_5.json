It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims. In another alternative method of allowing a customer access to its data and images, the user connects to archive 250 through the public Internet 220. The connection process provides for adequate security and authentication of a user as well know to those skilled in the art. Using standard browsing techniques, the customer is able to search for, retrieve, sort, download and print data records and images desired by the customer. In a second alternative delivery method according to the present invention, workstation 215 is used to create a bulk electronic file of all of the data and images for a customer. This bulk file is preferable encrypted for security purposes and transmitted to the customer over the public Internet 220. In another alternative embodiment, this bulk file can be transmitted to the customer using a private network (e.g., Value Added network (VAN)) or other dial up connection between workstation 215 and the customer system 210. , the document capture memory 130 maintains the associated data records and images for all batches 100 for a period of preferably 60 to 90 days,",
