While the currently preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the principles of the invention are readily adaptable to other implementations and system configurations and communications paradigms without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, as defined in the following claims. End of Header Marker (bits 73-80): The literal value 0\ufffd00 (zero) used to delimit the header and data portions of a transmission. HTTP Response Data Length (bits 40-72): Length of the encrypted HTTP Response in bytes. Protocol Version (bits 32-39): A number used to identify the version of the protocol for future compatibility. The version of the protocol used in the prototype implementation will be 0\ufffd01 (one). Magic Cookie (bits 0-31): A unique identifier used to rapidly indicate a valid transmission. All components of the system shall terminate communications that do not begin with this sequence. Marker (0 \ufffd 00) Data Length End of Header HTTP Response Data Length",
