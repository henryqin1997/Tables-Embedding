Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is intended to be limited only by the claims appended hereto. There has thus been provided a method and apparatus of operating a gaming device, for example a slot machine, in an automated manner. The present invention permits a casino to significantly increase the usage and revenue of such gaming devices, encouraging substantially continuous play at times when the machine might otherwise be un- or under-used. The invention further permits a player to enjoy all of the benefits of gambling, such as the enjoyment of viewing real-time gaming device results, without necessitating a physical presence at the machine. Additionally, the invention permits the casino to offer better-than-normal playing parameters, such as an improved payout schedule, or even the special reservation of a selected machine during normal playing hours, to players who are willing to utilize the machines during what would normally be off hours. Furthermore, the present invention encompasses automated play of gaming devices that require a player to make decisions during play, such as video blackjack machines, video poker machines, and the like. The inclusion of decision rules in the player parameter selections accounts for the need to make decisions.",
