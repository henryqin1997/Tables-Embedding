    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29144=In accordance with the formula for dynamic power consumption, it has been effective conventionally in CMOS integrated circuit designs to scale down the supply voltage for an entire device (e.g., hybrid) or integrated circuit (IC), i.e., operate the circuit at low supply voltages, to reduce power consumption for such designs. For example, in the MEDTRONIC SPECTRAX\ufffd product of circa 1979, IC circuitry was powered by one lithium iodine (as opposed to the two cells employed in the prior art). This reduced the supply voltage to 2.8 volts from 5.6 volts, thus reducing overhead current. Voltages required to be greater than 2.8 volts were generated by a voltage doubler, or alternatively by a charge pump (e.g., output pacing pulses). In the MEDTRONIC SYMBIOS\ufffd product of no circa 1983, for example, logic circuitry was powered by a voltage regulator controlling the IC supply voltage to a \u201csum of thresholds\u201d supply. This regulator provided a supply to the IC (i.e., VDD) of several hundred millivolts above the sum of the n-channel and p-channel thresholds of the CMOS transistors making up the IC. This regulator was self calibrating regarding manufacturing variations of the transistor thresholds., 26474=This application is a Continuation-In-Part, and claims priority and other benefits from the filing date, of U.S. patent application. Ser. No. 09/067,881 for \u201cPower Consumption Reduction in Medical Devices Using Multiple Supply Voltages and Clock Frequency Control\u201d to Thompson, filed Apr. 29, 1998, now abandoned hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 49736=As shown in FIG. 4B, according to conventional processing, circuit functions were typically performed at a burst cycle frequency and, as such, the function performed required a time period 60. Therefore, only a small amount of time (i.e., time period 60) of the entire time period x was used to perform the one or more functions requiring n cycles of time to complete. In such a case, conventionally, such burst clocks were at a substantially high clock rate. e.g., 500-1000 KHz, for such short periods of time to gain the benefit of a \u201cduty cycle\u201d to reduce average current drain. However, such high clock rates may not be required for carrying out such functions, or all functions., 52148=FIG. 4C shows an illustrative timing example for processing circuitry which performs multiple functions. For example, the cardiac cycle of a patient is represented in FIG. 4C as time period x. During time period 71, i.e., during a QRS complex of the cardiac cycle, high speed processing is performed at a high clock frequency relative to a lower clock frequency used to control operation of the processing circuitry during time period y. During the time period y, when the processing circuitry is operated at a lower clock frequency, such lower clock frequency may be set such that the functions performed during z cycles are performed in substantially the entire maximum time period available for such processing, i.e., time period y. Once again, a small remainder time period 75 of the cardiac cycle time period x may exist. Such time period may be, for example, in the range of about 1.0 millisecond to about 10.0 milliseconds when the cardiac cycle is in the range of about 400 milliseconds to about 1200 milliseconds., 30376=Other devices reduced power consumption in other manners. For example, various device designs have shutdown analog blocks and/or shut-off clocks to logic blocks not being used at particular times, thereby reducing power. Microprocessor based devices have historically used a \u201cburst clock\u201d design to operate a microprocessor at a very high clock rate (e.g., generally 500-1000 Kilohertz (KHz)), for relatively short periods of time to gain the benefit of a \u201cduty cycle\u201d to reduce average current drain. A much lower frequency clock (e.g., generally 32 KHz) is used for other circuitry and/or the processor when not in the high clock rate mode, i.e., burst clock mode. Many known processor based implanted devices utilize the burst clock technique. For example, implanted devices available from Medtronic, Vitatron, Biotronic, ELA, Intermedics, Pacesetters, InControl, Cordis, CPI, etc., utilize burst clock techniques. A few illustrative examples which describe the use of a burst clock are provided in U.S. Pat.

Moreover, the supply voltage source may include not only discrete supply voltages, but may include a source that is varied continuously over a particular range, such as, for example, by a voltage regulator. The present invention is also not limited to use in conjunction with pacemakers or PCDs, but may find further application in other relevant areas such as telecommunications or portable computers where low power consumption is desired. The present invention further includes within its scope methods of making and using the just-in-time clocking and/or multiple supply voltage concepts described herein above.
