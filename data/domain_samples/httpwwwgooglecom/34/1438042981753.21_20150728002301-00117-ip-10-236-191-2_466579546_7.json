    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39224=[0026] Image transfer sheets suitable for use in this invention comprise an image receptor layer which is releasably attached to a carrier sheet. Suitable image transfer sheet constructions include those described, for example, in PCT Intl. Pub. No. WO 00/02735 (Dinkel et al.), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The various components of these image transfer sheets are described in greater detail below., 23247=[0001] This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/285,216, filed on Apr. 20, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 60325=[0061] A variety of sealant compositions may be used in the methodology of the present invention to protect the image that has been imparted to the target substrate. These compositions may protect the image from abrasion, moisture or humidity, UV degradation, or fingerprints, and may also prevent the image from retransferring to other objects. These compositions may also be used advantageously to manipulate the finish of the image, thereby providing an image with a finish that is flat, semi-gloss, gloss, or satin. The exact choice of sealant compositions will depend, in part, on the inks used, the materials of the image receiving layer, and/or the target substrate. However, examples of such compositions include Krylon #1312 spray, also referred to as Kamar Varnish, available from Krylon Products Group, Specialty Division, of the Sherman Williams Co. of Solon, Ohio., 25676=[0006] However, the approach of WO 00/11067 (Lang) suffers from a number of serious drawbacks. For example, foil balloons are typically constructed from very thin caliper foils so that they will be suitably buoyant, and hence tend to have very little rigidity. Consequently, when a foil balloon is fed through a conventional inkjet printer, it tends to wrap around the drums, rollers and other feeding mechanisms of the printer, thereby causing the printer to jam., 26185=[0007] WO 00/11067 (Lang) also notes that the balloon may be wrapped around, or adhered to, a rigid substrate such as card sheet to facilitate printing. However, this approach suffers from the drawback that such a substrate tends to jam the feeding mechanisms of conventional printers, which are designed for feeding paper sheets of ordinary caliper. The approach of WO 00/11067 (Lang) also assumes that the uninflated balloon can be pressed into a flat or smooth surface suitable for printing, and thus places limitations on the size and geometry of the balloon and on the way that the balloon is compressed for storage or shipping. Moreover, the approach of WO 00/11067 (Lang) is not applicable to inflated balloons., 52345=[0050] The adhesive patch preferably comprises a suitable pressure sensitive adhesive, which may be defined as a material which adheres using applied finger pressure and which is permanently tacky. Pressure sensitive adhesive formulations are described, for example, in Satas, Ed., \u201cHandbook of Pressure Sensitive Adhesives\u201d,2nd Ed., Von Nostrand Reinhold 1989, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,973,826, 4,112,213 (Waldman) and 5,670,557 (Dietz et al.). Pressure sensitive adhesives typically comprise an elastomeric polymer such as natural or synthetic rubber, acrylic polymers and copolymers, or styrene butadiene copolymers. The adhesive composition typically contains one or more of the following additives: tackifying additives, cross-linking agents, fillers, antioxidants and stabilizers., 25079=[0005] Some attempts have been made to develop methods for the production of customized foil balloons. Thus, for example, PCT Intl. Pub. No. WO 00/11067 (Lang) discloses methods for producing decorative foil balloons through the use of a conventional ink jet printer. In accordance with the methodology disclosed therein, the surface of the foil is first adapted for printing by having a surface coating applied thereto. The balloon is then fed through a conventional inkjet printer which is set up to print a design on the adapted surface of the foil., 53174=[0051] The pressure sensitive adhesive may be applied to the balloon as a liquid coating which is subsequently dried. The liquid coating of adhesive may, for example, be sprayed or brushed onto the balloon. A suitable spray adhesive is available from 3M Co. under the brand-name Photo Mount\ufffd spray adhesive. The liquid coating of adhesive coating may also be applied to the balloon by a printing process such as screen printing, flexographic printing or gravure printing. Printable adhesive compositions are disclosed, for example in PCT Intl. Pub. No. WO 99/11727 (Banovetz et al.). The adhesive may be printed as a continuous layer or as discrete dots separated by narrow channels. However, the preferred method of application of the adhesive patch to the balloon is by transfer of an adhesive layer that is precoated on a releasable backing sheet. Suitable examples of a coated adhesive layer on releasable backing sheet are available from 3M Co. under the brand-name Scotch\ufffd adhesive transfer tape.}",

However, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. [0084] A helium filled balloon, produced in accordance with EXAMPLE 3, was tied to a 3 foot length of light ribbon and secured to a fixed object. No attempt was made during manufacture of the balloon to balance the extra weight present on one side of the balloon through the addition of the adhesive and image bearing layer. Consequently, the balloon floated at an angle of approximately 15 degrees from vertical. The experiment was repeated starting with a balloon prepared with asymmetrically weighted sides, achieved by adhering a piece of foil weighing 1.5 grams (the approximate combined weight of the adhesive and image bearing layer) to the side of the balloon opposite the side prepared to receive the image. The resulting balloon floated in a proper, essentially vertical manner. EXAMPLE 6 [0083] The image-bearing balloons produced in EXAMPLES 3 and 4 were filled with helium and kept in a normal office environment (71\ufffd F., 50% Relative Humidity) for 48 hours. Close",
