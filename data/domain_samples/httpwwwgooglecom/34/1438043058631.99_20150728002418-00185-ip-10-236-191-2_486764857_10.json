Nos. 5,751,336 and 5,936,659, as well as related publications \u201cPyramid Broadcasting for Video On Demand Service,\u201d by S. Viswanathan and T.

In the technique described in these documents, each movie is divided into segments of increasing size, and each segment is repeatedly transmitted in an associated logical channel of the broadcast medium. In the disclosed implementations, each segment is approximately 2-2.5 times longer than the preceding segment. At the receiving end, once the first segment is received, all of the other segments are received in time, so that continuous viewing of the movie is possible., 38713=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/414,514, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE BROADCAST DISSEMINATION OF TIME-ORDERED DATA, filed Oct. 8, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,155,735 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, while the foregoing embodiments of the invention have been specifically described with reference to their application to televised movies, it will be appreciated that the principles which underlie the invention can be applied to any type of temporally-ordered data that is distributed via a broadcast or multicast medium. The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore considered in all respects to be illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalence thereof are intended to be embraced therein. Similarly, while the use of equal-size fragments has been described in the foregoing examples, particularly to facilitate the multiplexing of the substreams, other embodiments of the invention might employ fragments of varying sizes, for instance where the substreams are transmitted independently of one another, in parallel. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. For instance, the foregoing examples of the invention have been described for the cases in which each segment contains the maximum integral number of fragments that fit within the repetition period of the segment. In this case, in order to ensure that each fragment arrives at the subscriber's premises within the required time, the fragments",
