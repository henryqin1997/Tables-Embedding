    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the invention overcomes the long-standing need for an IR system and method for measuring temperature of an object accurately and efficiently. The invention implements a traditionally slow IR sensor, such as a bolometer, with a predictive algorithm to predict temperature of a subject without the need for waiting excessively. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiment is to be considered in all aspects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which fall within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. It should be noted that the same predictive technique as described above can be used to improve the response speed of other types of thermal radiation sensors, for example\u2014thermopiles. A typical thermopile thermal time constant is of the order of 30 milliseconds which allows achieving a steady-state response in about 1 second. The predictive technique of the invention reduces that time by about 10 times, thereby yielding a steady state level within about 100 milliseconds. Alternatively, to reduce noise, instead of the instant measurements, to obtain Vx, Vy, the signal V may be integrated over a time interval which is shorter than to 630.",
