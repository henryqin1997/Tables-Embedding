Although the technical details of the chemical vapor deposition apparatus according to the present invention have been described with reference to the accompanying drawings, they merely exemplify the preferred embodiments of the present invention and do not limit the invention. Moreover, according to the chemical vapor deposition apparatus of the present invention, there is an advantage in that a high quality thin-film can be formed by a low temperature process and thus reliability of the process is improved. There is also another advantage in that excellent step coverage characteristics and a high deposition rate can be ensured and thus the manufacture yield of products is enhanced. As described in detail above, the chemical vapor deposition apparatus of the present invention can improve the low deposition rate that was a problem of a conventional chemical vapor deposition apparatus in which the process gases are sequentially supplied, and prevent the problems of the generation of plasma arc, the ion bombarding, the ion implant, and the like. In addition, it can prevent introduction of a large amount of particles and impurities such as C, H, Cl, Br, I and O which may be contained in the thin film deposited by the chemical",
