    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26250=[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/409,448, entitled \u201cSystem and method for Multi-Modal Browsing with Integrated Update Feature,\u201d filed Sep. 9, 2002., 55964=[0043] At this point, it should be noted that the placing of a voice call to the number identified by _K_PHONE provides sufficient information to synchronize a voice browser to an equivalent point in the navigation that has been reached by the visual browser. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, multi-modal platform 116 inserts the number(s) to call into the visual content, and knows where in the content the number(s) have been inserted. Thus, the fact that a call has been placed by a particular wireless telephone 102 to a particular telephone number provides sufficient information to deduce the point on the visual page to which the user has navigated. For example, suppose a voice call is initiated to the telephone number 555-1234, and multi-modal platform knows that this number is called only from a link contained on card #5 (e.g., card 205 in FIG. 2). Thus, the calling of this number indicates that the user has reached card #5. Moreover, multi-modal platform can determine the card from which the mode swap was initiated by using at least one different telephone number on each card. Thus, multi-modal platform has the opportunity to synchronize voice browser 119 to the state that had been reached by the visual browser, by using the information that is implied by the calling of a particular telephone number. (It should be noted that the name \u201cupdate card\u201d refers to the fact that it enables multi-modal platform 116 to \u201cupdate\u201d the state of one browser to the state of another.)}",
