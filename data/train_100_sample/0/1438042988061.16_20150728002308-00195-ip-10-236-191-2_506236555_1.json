If you're wondering why, just take your stock, Mopar-powered anything out on the street and try to take off really quickly without spinning the little repop redline tires on your ride. With the finesse required-and the fact that Doug leaves his car in Drive when he races-the Road Runner has still posted a best quarter-mile time of 12.16 at 115 mph. Give him a little more time behind the wheel and 11s are definitely within reach. Keep in mind that this engine uses a stock intake manifold with three Holley carbs, as well as stock exhaust manifolds. The final tally was 377 hp at 5,200 rpm, and 417 lb-ft of torque at 4,200. It was almost a mirror image of the previous pass. We figured there weren't any gains from jetting, so we played with the timing some more. We began by moving it back down to 36 degrees total and lost 4 hp and 5 lb-ft of torque from our peak numbers. Once we moved the timing back up to 39 degrees, we were ready to hit the track for some testing. On the third pull, we upped the jetting to 88 on the driver side and 86 on the passenger side. This pull responded with an A/F ratio of 12.7:1 at peak horsepower, but the horsepower numbers didn't show a substantial increase. For the second pull, we",
