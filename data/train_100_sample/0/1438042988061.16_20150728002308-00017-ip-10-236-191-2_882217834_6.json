Her 85-minute sets feature an opening montage of strong women, and she's still backed by a five-piece band full of mandolin and pedal steel, not to mention Lambert's famous twang-fueled vocals. You can catch her on the road through October 12. The last date on her calendar is in Sioux City, Iowa at the Tyson Center., 7800=The Platinum tour, which also includes opening acts Justin Moore and Thomas Rhett, will end on September 20., 8181=Lambert recently kicked off her Platinum Tour (also known as Crystal Light Presents the Platinum Tour) on July 10. She said of the trek, \"Platinum represents a lifestyle for me. It's the color of my hair, wedding ring, my airstream trailer, so it's just a natural fit for the name of my new album and it's why we decided to name the tour Platinum too.\", 4252=In 2011, Lambert married Shelton at the Don Strange Ranch outside San Antonio, Texas. The couple stood on cowhide to say their vows, served venison to 560 guests at an outdoor buffet barbecue, and Miranda wore a pair of custom-made cowboy boots under her dress. It was a true reflection of the personalities of the couple. The marital bliss led to a musical collaboration on her fourth album, \"Four the Record,\" for the song \"Over You.\" Though Blake didn't have a hand in the actual recording, husband and wife co-wrote the song, which is a ballad describing Shelton's experience as a teenager after his older brother had been killed in a car accident., 7286=It was August 25, 2013 when Lambert tweeted that she was, \"Back in Nashville. Time to make a record!\" Four days later came a tweet with the words \"Day 4! Surprises in store\u2026\" along with a photo of Miranda in studio. The picture not only sparked a fan frenzy, it pretty much confirmed the follow-up to 2011's \"Four the Record\" is definitely in the works for the reigning ACM Female Vocalist of the Year., 9359=Is Miranda Lambert part singer/songwriter, part prognosticator? One might believe that to be the case for naming of her most recent album, \"Platinum,\" released on June 3, 2014 through RCA Records Nashville., 6835=Does the singer-songwriter still get nervous when releasing new music? According to multiple media reports, she's always a \"basket case\" when it's time to make a record\u2026 because she fears this could be the one that stops selling. Of course, we don't think Miranda has anything to worry about. Not only is she one of the most popular singers on the planet, she's currently making the rounds with Dierks Bentley on the \"Locked & Reloaded Tour,\" which kicked off January 17., 4753=The soft side of Lambert has also come out in song. \"The House That Built Me,\" her third single from her third studio album, was the fastest-rising single of her career. It not only became her first Number One hit, it sat at the top of the charts for four consecutive weeks. Her acoustic performance of the song during the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards drew a standing ovation, and at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, she won for Best Female Country Vocal Performance., 3562=From her solo career to her girl group, Pistol Annies, Lambert puts her heart and soul into her music. She is currently part of the Locked & Reloaded tour with Dierks Bentley, which kicked off January 17 in Columbia, South Carolina.}",
