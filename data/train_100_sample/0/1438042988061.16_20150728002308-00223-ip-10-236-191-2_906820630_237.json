            "Irvine is such a safe city and UCI is not an exception. Very safe. You could sleep on a random bench and you'll probably be pretty safe.",
            "Sororities and fraternities are visibly seen. Posters cheering on brothers and sisters during finals or midterms week are plastered along various bridges and walls. A couple of times a week there will be sororities and frats recruiting students along Ring Road.",
            "There are so many clubs and various activities you could get involved in. You'll meet your type of people. Don't be afraid to check out different clubs you're interested in.",
            "UCI is great for people who are looking for a comfortable, home-like campus. It has a great combination of fun, safety, and rest.",
            "There is a huge dodgeball tournament in the beginning of the school year. I believe it is a world record? There is a sperm cell near the biology departments.",
            "I do not understand this.",
            "Beaches, shopping centers, and LA is all within reach. Various cafes and restaurants are sprawled everywhere. Hang out with seniors and juniors and they'll take you to fun places.",
            "Food was good. The desserts caused me to gain the freshman 15.",
            "Dorm life was pretty decent. I liked how you saw various students. You'll have your anime nerds, sorority sisters, sports stars, and stressed-out pre-med students. It was a nice community and felt like a small apartment area.",
            "It actually depends on the major but most people stress about their academics. Workload is pretty hefty. You have to stay on top of things. The quarter system goes by quickly. Brace yourselves.",
            "Go to office hours. Eat healthily and sleep regularly. Do not slack off on your studies. As it is a quarter system, the pace of your studies will go by quickly. It is a large university so professors will not wait for you. Study in the library.",
            "UCI is located in a clean, suburban environment. Academics are pretty decent. The people here are a bit more reserved compared to students of other campuses."

Students usually know they can also shake the Mesa bridge by jumping on it in the middle and that there is a building that can project your own voice back to you if you stand in the right spot. Also, there is a taxidermized anteater (Peter!) in the study lounge., 728083=Keep your GPA up, get a good SAT/ACT score and write a good personal statement! UCI is upping its standards according to my incoming year (2012/2013 freshmen). Many people who seemed likely to get in did not, and UCI under accepted so they had to accept so many appeals., 698467=Dorm life is amazing! You meet different types of people who are easy to get along with and are fun to be around. I currently live in Crickhollow, which I must say is the best hall in UCI dorms of the 2012-2013 school year. Big thanks to our RA Colin for being so great in not only being a resident advisor but also being a mentor to us first years. There several activities at the dorms anywhere from movie and karaoke nights to hall mixer/party. To dorm in UCI is a great experience; Dorm life here makes the transition from high school to college easier and joyful., 222588=I spend a lot of my free time with my friends. I've made amazing friends at UCI and I have the most fun with them whether we're making a run to Cha at 12:50 am, shopping at the Irvine Spectrum, or at a fraternity event in AV., 462156=You can see the Disneyland fireworks at around 9:45 from the top of Engineering Hall., 93939=Well with the 32% increase it is getting a little expensive for a public University but it is a really good research University with enough mediums to help you learn what you are interested in and the quality is worth the money. Also they have a lot of Scholarships to apply for and not only GPA based so it can be a great relief for people who cannot afford College. I know people going to UCI that only pay $2000 all include per quarter. Although it is really expensive for out-of-state students and I would not recommend it for them., 309846=Research-oriented students. UC Irvine has one of the greatest research institutions and is renowned for its research achievements all over the world. If you're in social movements, UC Irvine specializes in social movements. Our Sociology Department has a great, prestigious set of professors who have both contributed to the realm of sociological research and social advocacy. May I recommend you get to know the following: Prof. Caesar Sereseres, Prof. Al Valdez, Prof. Charles O'Connel, Prof. Carter Butts... these are only but a few of the AMAZING faculty we have in the Sociology department. And THAT's just one department within the School of Social Sciences... GO SOCIAL SCIENCES!, 324026=If you are bored, even for one second at UC Irvine, you are doing it all wrong. UCI is a place for fun, learning, and involvement. http://www.uci.edu/features/2011/09/feature_bucketlist_110926.php This bucket list should be a requirement for graduation., 810798=Quarterly Undie run the weekend before finals. Shocktoberfest is a HUGE concert where we've had artists such as TYGA, Kendrick Llamar, etc.. Raggaefest is at the end of Spring Quarter where artist like The Expendables, Iration, Rebelution, and other top Reggae artists., 923332=The Academic rigor is slightly harsh. For English courses, you need to have good grammar in order to enroll to a low division writing class. Also, attendance is mandatory for many class such as Chemistry lab, writing, and discussions., 840202=eat around. and there's lots of beaches, huntington, newport, corona del mar, 22569=Study hard in high school and try to get at least a 3.7 GPA. Participate in as many extracurricular activities as you can. Try and score at least an 1850 in your SATs., 1141747=Brandywhine best place to eat lunch. Lot 5 is the temporary food for Mesa Court (Dorms) while they are building the new dorms and dinning hall (Complete in 2016 I think). Lot 5 has ok food, better than high school for sure. Pippins is in middle-earth(dorms) and has a larger variety, but might get extra protein from bugs in the food. They have panda, subway, wendys, a pub on campus and other dinning venues. Across the street is taco bell, chick-fila, chipotle, Cha, in-and-out, and other eateries. Overall the food on campus is ok, but across the street is best.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Being that I have only been at UCI for one year so far, I feel that I am really learning a lot from my professors and from the students that I have surrounded myself with. No matter where you are at, it is the people you are around that you can learn from. UCI has a lot to offer when it comes to academia. There are numerous Nobel Prize winners, each having a building on campus named after them. Upon arriving at UCI, I took a campus tour and during this tour I knew that I was going to be learning something new every day from the students and from the faculty. For example, did you know that there are 1100+ trees planted in the center of our school (Aldrich Park)? I had no idea! Taking the time out of the day to notice things of beauty like the structure of our campus has made me realize how thankful I am to be learning something new every day. I never walk out of a class empty-handed and wishing I had actually learned something. Instead, I always look forward to the next day of classes, even if it becomes a struggle to wake up in the morning. UCI has so much to offer in the broad scope of learning that I cannot name everything, but everyone should get the opportunity to see for themselves.",
