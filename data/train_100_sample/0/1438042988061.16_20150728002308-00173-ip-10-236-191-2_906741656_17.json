            "I think they have one greek organization, for Honors students.",
            "Lots of clubs and activities. Too many to name. Some that come to mind are student congress, Latinos Unidos club, and much more.",
            "Students who want to stay close to their home, and want a quality education. Most teachers are very nice and friendly and want to help you succeed. If you are the type of student that is willing to try, you will breeze through it!",
            "Classes are so much cheaper then going to a University. I would recommend you get an Associates here and then transfer to a University. Help your GPA go up and also it shows that you have shown commitment to a prior schools. Most universities don't deny transfer students.",
            "There are a lot of clubs you can possibly join at this college.",
            "They have a cafeteria, although the food is expensive. You will most likely find a better deal at McDonald's. Vending machines are convenient and take credit cards.",
            "Writing papers is so important in college! Always be prepared to get multiple paper assignments throughout the semester, as they are a true test of your knowledge!",
            "Try your hardest while you are in college, even if it is a community college like MCC. It is really a matter of trying, and you get recognized for your achievements!",
            "Its a really good school because it is very local and close to home. It has a very small campus feel to it. Also all the teachers that I have had are very nice and ready to help you out!"

There are tons of vending machines around campus which have a lot of variety of snacks and drinks! I think the best part of the vending machines now is you can use your debit card instead of having to carry around cash.}",
