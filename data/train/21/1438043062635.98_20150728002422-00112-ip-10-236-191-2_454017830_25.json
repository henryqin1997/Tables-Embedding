Data for Priest Rapids (Grant Co PUD), Rock Island, Rocky Reach (Chelan PUD) and Wells (Douglas PUD) is downloaded directly from their websites and/or from DART. As a consequence of the 2000 BiOp, beginning in 2001, the USACE has reported Bonneville video counts for the period of 1/1 - 3/14. These counts appear on-line in their monthly summary report but not in their running sums report. To maintain consistency from year to year, FPC keeps these adult data in ancillary databases which can be found here 2002, 2001, 2000. 2002 to present is available in our \"Counts starting January 1st\" data set /adultsalmon/adultqueries/Adult_Table_Species_allCurrent.html for current and /adultsalmon/adultqueries/Adult_Table_Species_AllHistoric.html for 2002 to 2005. The webpage: /currentdaily/HistFishTwo_7day-ytd_Adults.html reports all fish count data available. This data has only been available since 2000 when counts began March 1. In 2001 counts began on January 1 for Bonneville. Douglas County PUD does not post wild steelhead numbers, but does report them",
