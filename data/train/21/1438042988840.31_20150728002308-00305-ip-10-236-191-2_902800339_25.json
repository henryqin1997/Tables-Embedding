            "The dining hall is average at best, it can get a little pricey. However, there are a lot of options in the area.",
            "It may seem like a college where you don't have to try, but you do need to put in the effort. Phi Theta Kappa has a HVCC chapter and is a pristegous group to be invited to- less than 1% of community college students are accepted.",
            "Get involved! There are so many different clubs and activities, and this can make all the difference in the college experience.",
            "After attending a private school for a year I transferred to HVCC and couldn't be happier. The students are friendly and the staff is phenomenal, always going above and beyond. For being a commuter college there are a lot of opportunities to make this more than just another school, but to make it your school."

They also have a great nursing program and dental hygienist program and we kick butt in football and bowling. Tips for prospective students I felt like it defiantly wasn't a waste of money but you have to do the work in order to really succeed here. They dont hold your hand and you really have to navigate your path if you want to graduate there in 2 years. Word to the wise dont go into individual studies until u know exactly what you want because they dont know how to really guide you when it comes to picking class. I began to think of it this way as my friends spent so much money on a four year diploma i was getting an associates",
