Two early humorous works were Sylvia Toh Paik Choo's Eh, Goondu! (1982)[1] and Lagi Goondu! (1986).[2] In 1997 the second edition of the Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary[3] was published. To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published., 3440=2002 saw the publication of the Coxford Singlish Dictionary,[4] a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website Talkingcock.com. In 2004 a website, A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English, was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the Oxford English Dictionary does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur lexicographer, the Dictionary appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally-written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "0\u20139[edit] A list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary. Letters contributed to the forum of The Straits Times, the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish. The lack of an officially-printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the Speak Good English Movement over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish",

Ar Hokkien Used as either noun or a verb to denote a very cozy, non-sexual relationship with someone that might result in special considerations or leeway not available to anyone else without such a relationship. As in \"I ar with the boss because I'm his golf buddy so I can occasionally come to work later without getting into trouble with him.\" Or \"You got ar with him or not?\" to inquire as to the status of the relationship between two people. Similar to the American slang expression \"having juice with someone.\" Ah Beng Hokkien A hillbilly, someone with little dress sense. Also used to refer to a gangster[6] The expressions came about because Ah Beng is a common Chinese male name. A transliteration of the Chinese name \"\u963f\u660e\" (a-b\u00eang). Ah Lian Hokkien A hillbilly, someone with little dress sense. Also used to refer to a gangster[6] The expressions came about because Ah Lian is a common Chinese female name. A transliteration of the Chinese term \"\u963f\u83b2\" (a-li\u00e1n), female form of Ah Beng, Ah Long Cantonese A transliteration of the Chinese name \"\u963f\u7abf\", which is a shortened form of \"\u5927\u8033\u7abf\".
