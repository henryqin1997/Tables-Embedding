It gets really cold in Fargo with the wind. - Do not let one teacher/professor make you rethink your major. Where there is one bad teacher there are ten great ones. - Join organizations that you find interesting and want to support or start your own organization. - Set an alarm for 7:55 am on Mondays when football tickets go on sale. Make sure you are logged on at 8 am or you may not get a ticket to the game and that is no fun., 328975=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 38261=Food is really good compared to other cafeteria style dining. It has its ups and downs. I don't prefer their asian food, but man is their burger bar the best thing ever. Take advantage of the chocolate milk! And get creative with the grills. There's so much you can make on your own in the dining center! One down side I have is, all the dining centers are closed on the weekend except for The Residence Dining Center. It's a big bummer during the winter. Living in Dinan, I had to get some confidence to make the trek during -40 degrees in January., 221202=March over!!!!!!!!!!}",

Clubs and Activities Tons and tons and tons of clubs/activities. An activity fair is hosted each year, about twice a year just so you can get a real in-depth look at each club and see what you're most interested in. Great for these types of students Friendly, determined, hard-working, happy-go-lucky students. Bang for the buck",
