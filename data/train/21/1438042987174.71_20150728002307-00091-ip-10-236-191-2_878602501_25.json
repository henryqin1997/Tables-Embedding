Example 8: Bacon Jr., Dan K. Top of Page Count the total length of the text string in A2, and then subtract the number of characters from the left up to the first space, found in step 1. The result is the number of characters to be extracted from the right of the full name. (15 - 6 = 9) Search for the numeric position of the first space in A2, starting from the left. (6) Use the LEN and SEARCH functions to find the value for num_chars: The last name starts with the ninth character from the right (v) and ends at the first character from the right (n).
