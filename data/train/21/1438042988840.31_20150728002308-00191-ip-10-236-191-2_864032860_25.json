The Wildcats controlled the first half and held a 17-point lead in the second before the Commodores answered with an 18-0 run. The teams traded leads down the stretch, but Kyle Wiltjer hit a jump shot with 1:57 to put UK in front to stay. There was late controversy when Nerlens Noel's jumper narrowly beat the expiring shot clock. Ryan Harrow led Kentucky with 16 points. Noel added 13 and Archie Goodwin 12. Kedren Johnson had 18 for Vandy., 51204=3. Precious Points: Despite Vanderbilt's struggles, the Commodores don't make it easy to score.

The Commodores are giving up 61.2 points per game in league play, and only two SEC teams have scored more than 61 points against Vandy. Ole Miss put up 89 in an overtime win.
