            "The most important thing I've learned at Coppin is staying focused. Do not let anyone or anything put you down. If you be your own person you can achieve anything. There will always be someone to give you good advice, such as the RA's, president of the school, and dean. Surround yourself by good people. Do good and you shall get good. Learn from your mistakes and you will succeed.",
            "There are a lot of educational activities that are fun. Informative things on health and campus life, as well as game night, steps shows, baskeballt games, volleyball games. The is an indoor pool and open basketball court. There are also parties where you can dance. Being responsible is most important when it comes to partying.",
            "Depending on how well you like your food. Dining is great. They have all types of meals to choose from. From vegetarian food, normal pizza and fries, home cooked meals, to gourmet. Its all good.",
            "It's all what you make it. Be around people who are not only similiar to you, but want to make it through just like you do. You can enjoy dorm life and get good grade all at the same time. Do not let anyone make choices for you. Be yourself!",
            "It's all up to you. How you study, go to class, and participate all determines on whether you make it at coppin. The professors are there to help, but you have to be the one to let them motivate you to keep going. You have to motivate yourself not to give up. If you study hard and keep pushing you will see great results.",
            "Staying focused and not giving up is what you need at coppin. If you do not give up you can get through any obstacle.",
            "Coppin state university's pride is what attracted me the most. The professors are down to teach you everything you need to know and will do anything to help you. They are willing to help you through."
