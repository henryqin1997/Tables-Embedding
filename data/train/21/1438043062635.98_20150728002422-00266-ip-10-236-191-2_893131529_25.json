            "The campus is beautiful, as is the surrounding area. There is plenty of cool stuff to do in NW Arkansas (concerts, events, dining, attractions, etc.).",
            "The Honors Program at UA is phenomenal. They provide extraordinary opportunities for undergraduate research and overseas studies. All of it is well-funded via grants, fellowships, and scholarships. This is an outstanding place to be an Honors Student."

However, I do not like the fact that the U of A is raising tuition fall 2011 by 7%. Haven't they heard about the great recession? It is already difficult to pay for college, now it is even harder., 1010554=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 553336=Taking a class in Old Main is a must, but be careful not to step on the Class of 1900 on your way in, it's bad luck. And Spoofer's stone has a rather romantic history of lovers and proposals., 949718=The food is okay. Overall, nothing to get excited about but decent. I will say, however, that Chartwells does a terrible job making dining options available to students. Dining halls close at 7:30 PM on weekdays and 7 PM on weekends (including Fridays). While meal trade/alternative dining options remain open later into the evenings, almost all are fast food. A healthy diet and the late-nights typical of college simply don't coexist at this university., 374897=I will attend the University of Arkansas in the fall of 2012. The application process is so simple and there are always people you can contact that are ready and willing to help you. The only downfall is the price., 123599=part of the walkway in front of the old main building is supposedly haunted. here at the university of arkansas, the names of students and the years in which they graduated are literally etched into the campus sidewalks. apparently, all the students who graduated in 1842 died soon after leaving college. for this reason, it is considered bad luck to walk over the part of the sidewalk where their names are inscribed., 100521=The University of Arkansas has great teachers that are interested in your education. The class sizes are relatively small, especially in the honors college. My largest freshman lecture class had 350 students as opposed to over 1000. The teachers have great office hours and are flexible. There is a very broad range of degrees and topics to be studied., 5220=My tip for prospective students would be to start everything early. I recommend applying for the University of Arkansas in September. It's not hard, and the admission staff is there to help every step of the way. Also, take advantage of the scholarship opportunities! The priority deadline for scholarship applications is early November. Making this deadline will give you the best chance at receiving one. When one is a junior and senior in high school, one needs to participate in as many things as possible. Involvement looks great on scholarship applications. When one actually begins the freshman semester, I strongly recommend getting involved in every opportunity that comes one's way. This is a great way to meet new people and learn new things. Most of all, enjoy you time at the University of Arkansas. It truly is a great environment., 859167=The top of the line greek life, for example, 1600 girls rushed this past fall and boys rush is almost exactly the same. Top of the line parties...did I mention Juicy J came last year... 10 sororities and 10 fraternities., 826353=We call the HOGS all the time! All the people that graduate from here get their names engraved in the sidewalk, it's super inspirational to get to walk to class on the names of those that came before you, and you get to look forward to seeing your name engraved there one day too! Just be sure not to step on the class of 1900 as a freshman, there's a superstition that then you won't graduate!, 47046=Eating at the dining halls on campus can get pretty old after a while, but when you go home and realize how convenient it is to have your food made and ready to go at all times, you may reconsider. There are three dining halls on campus and various other restaurants that you can go to and even do meals trades for. The meal trades are great because they stay open until 11:00 and it gives you a way to switch things up and not go to a dining hall every single night. Overall, I do think the dining halls have pretty good quality food. I have eaten on other college campuses and I have to say that the U of A is probably the best in comparison. Lots of options for anyone, including vegetarians, those with food allergies, etc. You can even special request certain things from the chefs and they will make them for you (usually vegetarian). The restaurants on campus include Quiznos, Starbucks, Burger King, Chik-fil-a, Sub Generation, the Wok, a burrito bar, and a pasta place. Overall, good food but definitely not a bang for your buck. Meal plans are great, but pretty pricey!, 183440=There is this place called Old Main and right in from of Old Main is a sidewalk with the first graduation class on it an goes on and on until the current year. A legend says if you step on the year 1914 you will die in four years. No one steps on that year!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Although attending the University of Arkansas is extremely pricey, the money is well spent. I would not trade any amount of money for the experience I have had at the University of Arkansas. The price for a good education may be high, but its totally worth it at the University of Arkansas. I guarantee you will not regret spending the extra money to attend the University of Arkansas. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being at the University of Arkansas, so much so that I miss being there during the summer. There are all types of people and so many wonderful activities to get involved in, you will never get bored. From joining a sorority to study to groups to even workout groups, I found friends that will last me a lifetime while learning so much about myself and my field of study. Am learning a lot I am an International Business student in the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas. Throughout my time at the University of Arkansas I have learned more than I ever imagined. My business classes were focused and interactive mixing a good time with learning. My professors were always interested in my concerns and helped me in every way possible.",
