The device helps the user to synchronize their hip rotation with the rotation of their hands. Rotating the hips and hands at the same time is difficult to master, especially for a beginner. With this device, if a user does not rotate his or her hips at the correct time, then the user's hands will encounter the forwardly extending rod that is affixed to the user's waist. Thus, this invention teaches correct timing. 08-18-2011 Phillip Butts, Pacific Palisades, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20130268529 Systems and Methods for Contact Management and Referral Engine - The present system allows business people to organize, receive and transfer key information about themselves and their contacts through the use of videos, audio and text. Users can create their own profile video (either from a pre-set group of videos or videos they create and name themselves) that may then be disseminated to their entire contact list, prompting their network to join the system. The system in one embodiment provides an effective way to give referrals to others as a path to in turn receiving referrals. The system also provides a way for users to associate a plurality of multimedia clips with then profile, so that",
