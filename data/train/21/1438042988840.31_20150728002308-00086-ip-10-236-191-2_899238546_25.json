Position level margin is arrived at by applying the IM% on the value of net open position. For example, you have open buy position in Fut - ACC- 26 Jun 2008 for 100 shares @ 150 and IM % for ACC is 25%. In that case, margin at position level would be 15000 * 25% = 3750/-., 124048=Calendar spread means risk off-setting positions in contracts expiring on different dates in the same underlying. For example, you take buy position for 200 shares in Fut - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 @ 150 and sell position for 100 shares in Fut - ACC- 29 Apr 2002 @160. 100 buy position in Fut - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 and 100 sell position in Fut - ACC- 29 Apr 2002 forms a spread against each other and hence called spread position.This spread position would be levied spread margin % for margin calculation instead of IM%. In this example, the balance 100 shares buy position in Fut - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 would be non-spread position and would attract initial margin., 16276=OPT denotes Option, ACC is the underlying, 30 may 2002 is the expiry date of the contract, 150 is the strike price and PE denotes it is an European Put option., 108207=Rs.1500, 108065=Rs. 2600, 51205=As mentioned above, the higher of buy and sell order value in the same contract is margined. In the above given example, for ACC Jun contract Buy order value is greater since there is no sell order, hence Margin @ 10% would be levied on Rs.142880/-. For the ACC Jul 2008 contract sell order value is greater than buy order value. Hence margin would be levied at specified margin % of 10% on Rs. 143444, 94584=In this example, on 17th February 2002, you can place a GTD order for earlier of the following two dates., 108344=Rs.1000, 113727=Orders in Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 and Fut-Nifty-28 Feb 2002 have been placed in 3000 : 400 or 15: 2 ratio. Execution will take place only if the same ratio can be maintained on execution also. In the above example, available quantities are not sufficient to maintain the ratio. Hence both the orders will be cancelled by the exchange. If order qty for Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 is 1500 instead of 3000, execution will take place for 1500 Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 and 200 Fut-Nifty-28 Feb 2002. Remaining 1500 Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 and 200 Fut-Nifty-28 Feb 2002 unexecuted orders will be cancelled by the exchange., 82348=Loss = (1000-980) *250 = Rs. 5000., 53535=142880, 16423=An European Put ACC Options expiring on 30 May 2002 with a strike price of 150 is described as OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-PE., 47970=Marginable buy and sell order quantity would be 188 and 188 respectively. Marginable buy and sell order value would be Rs. 141940 and Rs. 143444 respectively., 124443=For example, you have open buy position in Fut - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 for 100 shares @ 150 and IM % for ACC is 25%. In that case, margin at position level would be 15000 * 25% = 3750/-. Moreover, benefit of calendar spread margin may also be available to you in case of spread position., 99213=For example, you take buy position for 100 shares in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 @ 150 and sell position for 100 shares in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 @ 160. 100 buy position and 100 sell position would form spread. At 10% spread margin, margin blocked is Rs 1600/-. IM is 20%. Now position in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 is taken out of spread. Following would be the margin requirement., 83198=Current limit available = Rs.50000/- a) Margin blocked on taking Future position= 250*1000*11% = 27500. \u00a0 Free Current limit available after the position taken=50000-27500=22500 b) On Convert To FuturePLUS, required Initial Margin for FuturePLUS = 250*1000*6% = 15000, 128147=Fut - ACC- 26 Mar 2002, 34018=In that case, margin required on executed position is re-calculated by taking CMP of respective FuturePLUS position(s) and the FuturePLUS IM % . Available margin as calculated above should now be compared with the required margin and amount for additional margin call is arrived at. For example say you have bought 100 shares of Futures- ACC-26-Jun-2008 at Rs.150 and FuturePLUS IM is 20% and minimum margin is 10%. You would be having a margin of Rs.3000 blocked on this position. The current market price is now say Rs.130. This means the effective available margin Rs. 1000/- which is less than the minimum margin of Rs 1500/- and hence additional margin to be called in for. Additional margin to be calculated as follows: (a) Margin available Rs.3000 (b) Less : MTM Loss (150-130)*100 Rs.2000 (c) Effective available margin (a-b) Rs.1000 (d) Minimum Margin 100*150*10% Rs.1500 (e) Re-calculated margin 100*130*20% Rs. 2600 a. Additional margin Call (e-c) Rs. 1600, 121654=Lets assume that Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 and Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 are included in spread definition and Future - ACC- 29 Apr 2002 is kept out of spread definition. If you take buy position for 200 in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 and sell position for 100 in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002, 100 buy position and 100 sell position would form spread. If you take buy position for 200 in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 and sell position for 100 in Future - ACC- 29 Apr 2002, it will not form spread and margin at IM% would be levied on both 200 buy and 100 sell position., 73697=You cannot place rollover order, to the extent of a cover square off order quantity, which is already placed by you but you can still continue to place Rollover orders to the extent of remaining net open position quantity. For example: If you have buy position of 150 quantity in Nifty Futures February contract and you have already placed cover square-off order for 50 quantity then you can place rollover orders only upto the remaining position i.e.100 Quantity., 111616=For example, say you have a futures position - 'Buy 200 Reliance Shares' in contract Futures - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 at an average price of Rs. 300 per share created through the execution of two orders - 'Buy 100 @ Rs. 310 per share' and 'Buy 100 @ Rs. 290 per share'. If you square off a part of the position by selling 50 Reliance Shares @ Rs. 305 per share, the profit on such square off would be calculated as:, 109145=For example say you have bought 100 shares of Futures - ACC - 27 Feb 2002 at Rs.150 and IM is 20% and minimum margin is 10%. You would be having a margin of Rs.3000 blocked on this position. The current market price is now say Rs.130. This means the effective available margin Rs. 1000/- which is less than the minimum margin of Rs 1500/- and hence additional margin to be called in for. Additional margin to be calculated as follows:, 127448=Fut - ACC- 29 Apr 2002, 6126=a) if you have a Buy position of 4500 in OPT-STABAN-25-Jul-2002-210-CE, and you place a sell order of 3000 then the sell order becomes non-marginable., 43034=FuturePLUS is an intraday product wherein any position taken needs to be squared off on the same trading day or Convert to Future (CTF) till the end of the day by the customer itself. If customer doesn't place square off or does CTF for his position by the end of the day before the stipulated time, then following possibilities may arise, viz: 1) ICICI Securities may run End of settlement Square off process which will square off the open FuturePLUS position generally 3:15 pm onwards on best effort basis.However, I-Sec reserves the right to change the square off timing , if required, especially during volatile days. OR 2) The FuturePLUS position may be compulsorily converted to future position by the system at the end of the day. . How do I convert my FuturePLUS position into a Future position?, 6980=If you place a Buy order in the same Contract OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE 3000 at Rs 20/- it would attract margin of, 114249=Fut-Nifty-28 Feb 2002, 53825=Fut - ACC- 26 Jun 2008, 46942=Squaring off a position means closing out your FuturePLUS position. For example, if you have FuturePLUS buy position of 500 Reliance expiring on 26th June 2008, squaring off this position would mean taking sell position in 500 Reliance expiring on 26th June 2008. The order placed for squaring off an open position is called a cover order., 120932=The same rule applies even at order level. If you place buy order for 100 in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 and sell order for 100 in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002, order having larger value would be margined. If you place buy order for 100 in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 and sell order for 100 in Future - ACC- 29 Apr 2002, both buy order and sell order would be margined at IM%., 74137=Yes, you can place part Rollover order against the open position quantity in multiple of the lot size. For example: If you have buy position of 150 quantity in Nifty Futures February contract and lot size is 50, then you can place rollover orders for 50 or 100 or 150 quantity of your choice., 94240=Hence on 17th Feb, GTD order in any of the three contracts can be placed maximum for 23th Feb 2002., 135383=ACC future contract expiring on 27th Feb, 2002 is defined as \"Fut-ACC-27-Feb-2002\". Wherein \"Fut\" stands for Futures as derivatives product, \"ACC\" for underlying stock and \"27-Feb-2002\" for expiry date., 52508=Fut - ACC- 31 Jul 2008, 10374=Buy orders irrespective of whether it is a Call or a Put, is margined only to the extent of the Premium payable on the order.For e.g. If you place a Buy order in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-PE for 1500 quantity at a Limit price of 20 would attract margin of Quantity * Price at Rs 30,000/-., 131070=Squaring off a position means closing out a futures position. For example, if you have futures buy position of 500 Reliance expiring on 27th Feb 2002, squaring off this position would mean taking sell position in 500 Reliance expiring on 27th Feb 2002 on or prior to 27th Feb 2002. The order placed for squaring off an open position is called a cover order., 122941=In the above mentioned example margin position of 100 shares in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 will be subjected to IM% and 100 spread position quantity would attract spread margin %. However, you will able to view only overall margin figure on open position page. Assuming IM and spread margin at 20% and 10% respectively, overall margin to be calculated as follows:, 5950=b) If you have a sell position in OPT-NIFTY-27-May-2004-1700-CE, and the margin blocked is Rs.45,500.00 and a cover buy order is placed which requires total premium of Rs.65000.00, then extra margin to the extent of Rs. 14500.00 (65000-45500) is required., 82649=a) When the loss is less than or equal to the additional released Margin i.e. loss is less than or equal to Rs. 12500., 122408=Rs. 1600, 114673=1500, 125096=For example, there is an open sell position of 100 shares in \"Fut - ACC- 29 Apr 2002\". Marginable buy and sell order quantity would be 100 and 300 respectively. Marginable buy and sell order value would be Rs. 12750 and Rs. 48300 respectively., 134946=An index or stock enabled for trading on futures is called an \"Underlying\" e.g. NIFTY (index) and ACC (stock). There may be various tradable contract for the same underlying based on its different expiration period. For example Fut - ACC - 27 Feb 2002, Fut - ACC - 27 Mar 2002 and Fut - ACC - 27 Apr 2002 are \"contracts\" available for trading in futures having ACC as \"underlying\"., 108486=Rs.2000, 48334=141940, 118052=Continuing the above example, if you place an sell order for 100 shares in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 @ 170, margin of Rs. 3400/- would be required to place this order. This margin would be required despite being a cover order to square off the open position in the same contract. Reason for the same is that the order now being placed by you would result into the increased risk exposure since the buy position of 100 shares in Futures - ACC - 27 Feb 2002 has already been considered as position building up spread position. If buy position of 100 shares in Futures - ACC - 27 Feb 2002 is squared off, sell position of 100 shares in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 @ 160 would become non-spread position and subjected to margin at 20 % IM., 114794=Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002, 118665=For example, you are taking an open buy position for 100 shares in Future - ACC- 27 Feb 2002 @ 150 and IM is 20%. Rs 3000/- would be blocked as an initial margin. Thereafter you take a sell position for 100 shares in Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 @ 160 and spread margin is 10%. Hence the execution of Future - ACC- 26 Mar 2002 order is resulting into spread position. As explained above, margin required would be 100*160*10% = 1600/- now. Hence the excess margin of Rs 1400/- (3000-1600) would be released and added into your trading limits., 70793=At the time of Rollover order placement, additional differential margin required will be computed after giving the effect of rollover trades in both the months as follows: Additional margin required on Rollover = Margin required to take position in the new month contract - Existing margin blocked on near month position + Notional Loss/Profit of Near Month Futures contract If you do not have sufficient limit to bring additional margin required on Rollover, then you will not be allowed to place Rollover order. For Example: You have a near month position of 50 quantity Buy in NIFTY say Fut-Nifty- 28-Feb-2013 at Rs. 6080 and IM% is 8%. You now want to Rollover this entire position in Fut-Nifty-28-Mar-2013 at Rs. 6100 and the LTP of Fut-Nifty-28-Feb-2013 is 6075 at the time of rollover. Then in the above example; Existing Margin blocked = 6080*50*8% = 24320 New Margin required = 6100*50*8% = 24400 Notional Profit/(Loss) = (6075-6080)*50 = 250 Loss Additional Margin required to Rollover = 24400 - 24320 + 250 = 330, 7990=You place a sell order in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE, for 3000 quantity at a limit price of 20/-, 81522=b) When the loss is more than the additional releasable Margin on conversion to FuturePLUS i.e.Loss is more than Rs.12500., 81217=Loss = (1000-945) *250 = Rs. 13750., 45213=Execution price of cover order is compared against the weighted average price at which the position was built up as shown in the \"Open Positions for FuturePLUS\" and profit/loss is calculated therefrom. For example, say you have a FuturePLUS position - 'Buy 200 Reliance Shares' in contract Futures - ACC- 26 Jun 2008 at an average price of Rs. 300 per share created through the execution of two orders - 'Buy 100 @ Rs. 310 per share' and 'Buy 100 @ Rs. 290 per share'. If you square off a part of the position by selling 50 Reliance Shares @ Rs. 305 per share, the profit on such square off would be calculated as: Quantity squared off * (Square off trade price - Weighted Average price of the position) 50 * (305 - 300) = 250 Profit or Loss for all your trading transactions can be checked from the \"Portfolio Details\" link on the FNO trading page for FuturePLUS product., 128739=Fut - ACC- 27 Feb 2002}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24642=Yes, you can modify the price of your cover SLTP order subject to the Trigger price conditions being fulfilled. You can even modify the Cover SLTP order to a Market order. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously, you also place the sell (cover SLTP) order of 1000 quantity at Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. The above trigger condition is defined with a view to curtail losses. If subsequently the current market price shoots up to 110/-. You can modify the order as below Limit price 103/- SLTP 108/- (i.e. SLTP can be placed upto 110) or alternatively you can modify the order to market and book profits., 32195=Yes, it is recalculated and excess amount if any will be released or additional margin needed will be blocked if you change the limit price of your cover SLTP order. In the above example where OptionPLUS margin % is 10%, if you modify the SLTP to 98/- and limit price to 92/-. The amount to be blocked would be recalculated as: (100*1000)*10%) + (100-92)*1000) = 18000/- The excess amount of 2000/- would be released and added in your limit. In the above example where OptionPLUS margin % is 10%, if you modify the limit price of your cover SLTP order to 88/- difference amount would be recalculated as (100*1000)*10%) +(100-88)*1000 = 22000/- Additional amount of 2000/- would be blocked. If limits are insufficient then you will be unable to modify the order., 151494=No. In case your Fresh/Cover SLTP order gets canceled by National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) due to Trade Price execution Range, you will not be allowed to re-enter either Market/Cover SLTP Order. In such cases I-Sec on best effort basis would first cancel pending fresh/cover orders and then initiate the Square off process for the pending Open position. For Example: Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of cover order, the execution price say for example 91/- is outside the Trade price Execution Range (92-98). Such order will be canceled by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since there will be no order to cover your Open position. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try squaring off your net Open buy position at current market price. Assume you try taking a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. Fresh order of SLTP product is always a market order and execution price of market order depends on the available ask - bid prices and quantity at that point of time in exchange. Hence, in this case, if the execution of market order is going beyond exchange specified trade range, then the fresh order (fully or partially) could be canceled by exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since reverse position can be created if cover SLTP order gets matched and traded within the Trade price Execution Range. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try canceling your pending cover SLTP order or if cover SLTP order is traded then try squaring off your net Open Sell position at current market price., 134781=Yes, you can modify the price of your cover SLTP order subject to the Trigger price conditions being fulfilled. You can even modify the Cover SLTP order to a Market order. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously, you also place the sell (cover SLTP) order of 1000 quantity at Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. The above trigger condition is defined with a view to curtail losses. If subsequently the current market price shoots up to 110/-. You can modify the order as below Limit price 103/- SLTP 108/- (i.e. SLTP can be placed upto 110) or alternatively you can modify the order to market and book profits., 34101=I-Sec may define 'Minimum SLTP - Limit price difference %' for different SLTP range at underlying level depending upon the volatility and market conditions of the stock. However, it is possible to have different 'Minimum SLTP - Limit price difference %' for different ranges of SLTP for same contracts even within the same underlying. This would mean that different orders placed even within the same contract but with different SLTP may have different 'Minimum SLTP - Limit price difference' applied depending on the price range in which the Client specified SLTP falls. Assume you want to take Put long (buy) position for 1000 quantity in NIFTY underlying at Rs. 100/- with strike price of Rs 6000/-. Simultaneously you also want to place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity with SLTP ranges for NIFTY underlying defined as follows. The OptionPLUS margin % for the scrip is 0%. Suppose following is the Minimum SLTP- Limit Price difference specified by I-Sec:, 153959=Yes. Your Fresh/Cover SLTP order can get part canceled by National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) if part of the ordered quantity tries to match part opposite order whose price is not within the Trade Price execution Range. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of cover order, there are two opposite orders finding match of 500 quantity each at Rs 91/- and 93/-, respectively. The Trade price Execution Range at that point is Rs 92-98. Such order will be partly canceled (Quantity 500 at Rs 91/-) and partly executed (Quantity 500 at Rs 93/-) by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since there will be no order to cover your part open position. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try squaring off your net part open buy position (Quantity 500) at current market price. Assume you try taking a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of fresh order, there are two opposite orders finding match of 500 quantity each at Rs 97/- and 99/-. The Trade price Execution Range at that point is Rs 88-98. Such order will be partly canceled (Quantity 500 at Rs 99/-) and partly executed (Quantity 500 at Rs 97/-) by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since reverse position will be created if cover SLTP order gets matched and traded within the Trade price Execution Range (88-98). In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try canceling your part cover SLTP order or if cover SLTP order gets traded then try squaring off your net part open Sell position (Quantity 500) at current market price., 60355=Yes. Your Fresh/Cover SLTP order can get part canceled by National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) if part of the ordered quantity tries to match part opposite order whose price is not within the Trade Price execution Range. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of cover order, there are two opposite orders finding match of 500 quantity each at Rs 91/- and 93/-, respectively. The Trade price Execution Range at that point is Rs 92-98. Such order will be partly canceled (Quantity 500 at Rs 91/-) and partly executed (Quantity 500 at Rs 93/-) by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since there will be no order to cover your part open position. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try squaring off your net part open buy position (Quantity 500) at current market price. Assume you try taking a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of fresh order, there are two opposite orders finding match of 500 quantity each at Rs 97/- and 99/-. The Trade price Execution Range at that point is Rs 88-98. Such order will be partly canceled (Quantity 500 at Rs 99/-) and partly executed (Quantity 500 at Rs 97/-) by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since reverse position will be created if cover SLTP order gets matched and traded within the Trade price Execution Range (88-98). In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try canceling your part cover SLTP order or if cover SLTP order gets traded then try squaring off your net part open Sell position (Quantity 500) at current market price., 11079=1500, 30346=Margin in case of fresh order is charged to the extent of maximum possible loss that you may incur plus an additional margin calculated at the OptionPLUS margin % specified, if any, for the underlying in the stock list page. It is calculated as {(Weighted average price of fresh order - limit price of cover SLTP order) * Quantity of shares} + {(Weighted average price of fresh order * quantity of shares) * OptionPLUS margin %, if any, for the stock} Margin is blocked as per the above formula on order placement and adjusted further based on the actual execution price. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. The OptionPLUS margin % for the scrip is either 0 or 10%. In this case margin amount would be blocked as (Weighted average price of fresh order * quantity of shares)* OptionPLUS margin% +( weighted average price of fresh order - limit price of cover SLTP order)* quantity of shares In case the OptionPLUS margin % is 0% (100*1000)*0%) +(100-90)*1000) = 10,000/- In case the OptionPLUS margin % is 10% (100*1000)*10%) +(100-90)*1000) = 20,000/-, 3259=When the ACC price would fall below 124.44 the sell position in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-PE would be in the MTM Loop., 33109=SLTP - Limit price difference % is the difference percentage defined between the SLTP and Limit price of your cover order. For example: SLTP - Limit price difference % is defined as 10% and you want to place call long (buy) order for 100 quantity in NIFTY underlying at Rs. 1200/- with strike price of Rs 6000/-. You specify the sell order (Cover SLTP order) for 100 quantity at SLTP of 1150/-. Since this is a sell cover SLTP order the limit price would be lower than the SLTP. Limit price of Rs 1035/- = (1150-(1150*10%)) will automatically appear in the Limit Price field., 141854=Yes, it is recalculated and excess amount if any will be released or additional margin needed will be blocked if you change the limit price of your cover SLTP order. In the above example where additional margin % is 10%, if you modify the SLTP to 98/- and limit price to 92/-. The amount to be blocked would be recalculated as: (100*1000)*10%) +(100-92)*1000) = 18000/- The excess amount of 2000/- would be released and added in your limit. In the above example where additional margin % is 10%, if you modify the limit price of your cover SLTP order to 88/- difference amount would be recalculated as (100*1000)*10%) +(100-88)*1000 = 22000/- Additional amount of 2000/- would be blocked. If limits are insufficient then you will be unable to modify the order., 1164=When the ACC price would rise above 165.45 the sell position in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE would be in the MTM Loop., 139938=Margin in case of fresh order is charged to the extent of maximum possible loss that you may incur plus a additional margin calculated at the SLTP margin % specified, if any, for the underlying in the stock list page. It is calculated as {(Weighted average price of fresh order - limit price of cover SLTP order) * Quantity of shares} + {(Weighted average price of fresh order * quantity of shares) * SLTP margin %, if any, for the stock} Margin is blocked as per the above formula on order placement and adjusted further based on the actual execution price. Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. The SLTP margin percentage for the scrip is either 0 or 10%. In this case margin amount would be blocked as (Weighted average price of fresh order * quantity of shares)* additional margin% +( weighted average price of fresh order - limit price of cover SLTP order)* quantity of shares In case the additional margin percentage is 0% (100*1000)*0%) +(100-90)*1000) = 10,000/- In case the additional margin percentage is 10% (100*1000)*10%) +(100-90)*1000) = 20,000/-, 11481=Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002, 2794=You have a sell position in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-PE, 109926=In the year 2013 the India VIX values were in the range of 13 to 32. Since India VIX signifies volatility, the values will be computed upto 4 decimal places as market participants may like to analyse impact on prices due to small changes in volatility., 144750=Example Assume you take a sell position for the fresh order of 1000 shares at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the SLTP buy (cover order) of 1000 shares at SLTP 108/- and Limit price 112/-. The above example can be analyzed as follows: Apart from an additional margin on the fresh order value which is normally 0, the maximum loss amount would be blocked on the fresh order and cover SLTP order as difference between current market or weighted average price of Fresh order and limit price of cover SLTP order. (112-100)*1000= 12,000/-. The fresh order is a market order which will get executed at the market price available at that point of time. If the order gets executed as 101/-, revised amount of 1000/- would be released. The cover order would remain in the ordered state. Current market price rises - Position is making a loss: Once the current market price starts rising and reaches 108/-, the cover SLTP order would be triggered to a limit order with price 112/-. The cover SLTP order would get executed at the best prices available up to the SLTP limit price of 112/-. Current market price falls - Position is making a profit: You can choose to modify the buy cover SLTP order to a market order to immediately book profits at market price., 98181=Yes. You can withdraw the margin amount between Monday to Friday - till 07:00 pm., 12279=If order qty for OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE is 1500 instead of 3000 and order qty for Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 is 200 instead of 400 , execution will take place for 1500 OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE and 200 Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002. There will be no balance quantity for cancellation by exchange in this case., 10957=OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE, 50467=Example Assume you take a sell position for the fresh order of 1000 shares at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the SLTP buy (cover order) of 1000 shares at SLTP 108/- and Limit price 112/-. The above example can be analyzed as follows: Apart from OptionPLUS margin % on the fresh order value (assuming to be zero), the maximum loss amount would be blocked on the fresh order and cover SLTP order as difference between weighted average price of Fresh order and limit price of cover SLTP order. (112-100)*1000= 12,000/-. The fresh order is a market order which will get executed at the market price available at that point of time. If the order gets executed as 101/-, revised amount of 1000/- would be released. The cover order would remain in the ordered status. Current market price rises - Position is making a loss: Once the current market price starts rising and reaches 108/-, the cover SLTP order would be triggered to a limit order with price 112/-. The cover SLTP order would get executed at the best prices available up to the limit price of 112/-. Current market price falls - Position is making a profit: Once the current market starts falling and reaches 85/- you can choose to modify the buy cover SLTP order to a market order to immediately book profits at market price., 11919=Orders in Fut-ACC-28 Feb 2002 and OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE have been placed in 3000: 400 or 15: 2 ratio. Execution will take place only if the same ratio can be maintained on execution also. In the above example, available quantities are not sufficient to maintain the ratio. Hence both the orders will be cancelled by the exchange., 752=You have a sell position in OPT-ACC-30-May-2002-150-CE, 114269=For ease of trading the India VIX futures price shall be quoted as expected India VIX index value * 100. If trader wants to buy or sell contracts of India VIX futures at 18.1475, then the price to be quoted shall be Rs.1814.75., 57837=No. In case your Fresh/Cover SLTP order gets canceled by National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) due to Trade Price execution Range, you will not be allowed to re-enter either Market/Cover SLTP Order. In such cases I-Sec on best effort basis would first cancel pending fresh/cover orders and then initiate the Square off process for the pending Open position. For Example: Assume you take a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. At the time of Execution of cover order, the execution price say for example 91/- is outside the Trade price Execution Range (92-98). Such order will be canceled by Exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since there will be no order to cover your Open position. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try squaring off your net Open buy position at current market price. Assume you try taking a buy position for the fresh order of 1000 quantity at current market price of 100/-. Simultaneously you also place the Sell (cover SLTP order) of 1000 quantity as Limit price 90/- and SLTP 95/-. Fresh order of SLTP product is always a market order and execution price of market order depends on the available ask - bid prices and quantity at that point of time in exchange. Hence, in this case, if the execution of market order is going beyond exchange specified trade range, then the fresh order (fully or partially) could be canceled by exchange and you will be exposed to higher risk since reverse position can be created if cover SLTP order gets matched and traded within the Trade price Execution Range. In such case I-Sec on best effort basis would try canceling your pending cover SLTP order or if cover SLTP order is traded then try squaring off your net Open Sell position at current market price.}",

What is meant by 'Convert to FuturePLUS'? \u00a0'Convert to FuturePLUS' is a newly added feature provided under Future product where one can convert his existing position under a contract in Future to FuturePLUS position of the same contract within the stipulated time prescribed by I-Sec. . How do I convert my Future position into a FuturePLUS position? You will find the link of 'Convert to FuturePLUS' in the 'Actions' column of Future open positions page against each position under a contract. Once you choose to convert the existing Future open position to FuturePLUS position, a remark will appear stating \"You are requesting to convert Future position to FuturePLUS\". . Can I convert part of the open position under a contract to FuturePLUS position? Yes. A part quantity out of the Future position quantity under a contract can be converted to FuturePLUS position. . Can I convert pending order / partly executed pending order from Futures to FuturePLUS order? No. The orders placed in Futures cannot be converted to FuturePLUS orders. Only open position under a contract is allowed to be converted from Future to FuturePLUS Position. . How does 'Conversion to FuturePLUS' impact limits?

When converting to Future PLUS if the LTP of the contract falls to say Rs.980, then in such a case, Loss = (1000-980) *250 = Rs. 5000. Thus,on conversion to FuturePLUS the total amount that would be blocked is 15000(Required Margin for FuturePLUS position) + 5000(Loss) = Rs. 20000. Thereby, after taking the FuturePLUS position, Blocked Margin = Rs. 20000 Minimum Margin = Rs.10000 Available Margin = Rs.15000 i.e. (20000-5000) Additional releasable Margin added to limits = Rs. 7500 Thus in this case on 'Convert to FuturePLUS' additional margin of Rs.7500 would be added to your current limits. b) When the loss is more than",
