The FEEDBACK value applies to all tables being scanned. It cannot be set for individual tables., 11290=When the binary values for a language match two or more encodings that have a subset/superset relationship, the subset character set is returned. For example, if the language is German and all characters are 7-bit, then US7ASCII is returned instead of WE8MSWIN1252, WE8ISO8859P15, or WE8ISO8859P1., 95380=The following examples show how to scan a single table to see the effects of migrating it to WE8MSWIN1252. These examples assume that the current database character set is in US7ASCII. Language and character set detection is performed on the LOSSY data cells., 164182=All the character-based data in CHAR, VARCHAR2, LONG, CLOB, and VARRAY columns are stored in the database character set, which is specified with the CREATE DATABASE statement when the database is first created. However, in some configurations, it is possible to store data in a different character set from the database character set either intentionally or unintentionally. This happens most often when the NLS_LANG character set is the same as the database character set, because in such cases Oracle Database sends and receives data as is, without conversion or validation being guaranteed. It can also happen if one of the two character sets is a superset of the other, in which case many of the code points appear as if they were not converted. For example, if NLS_LANG is set to WE8ISO8859P1 and the database character set is WE8MSWIN1252, then all code points except the range 128-159 are preserved through the client/server conversion., 93323=The following examples show how to scan the user tables to see the effects of migrating them to AL32UTF8. These examples assume that the current database character set is US7ASCII, but the actual data stored is in Western European WE8MSWIN1252 encoding., 165778=For example, this can occur when the Database Character Set Scanner is used with the FROMCHAR parameter set to WE8MSWIN1252. This single-byte character set encodes a character in every available code point so that no matter what data is being scanned, the scanner always identifies a data cell as being available in the source character set., 97554=Example 12-12 Single Table Scan with Parameter-File Method, Showing the Effect of Migrating to WE8MSWIN1252, 148660=The values \u00c4hrenfeldt and \u00f3r\u00e2cl\u00eb8\u2122 exceed the column size (10 bytes) because each of the characters \u00c4, \u00f3, \u00e2, and \u00eb occupies one byte in WE8ISO8859P1 but two bytes in AL32UTF8. The value \u00f3r\u00e2cl\u00eb8\u2122 has lossy conversion to AL32UTF8 because the trademark sign \u2122 (code 153) is not a valid WE8ISO8859P1 character. It is a WE8MSWIN1252 character, which is a superset of WE8ISO8859P1., 72449=For example, if the MAXBLOCKS parameter is set to 1000, then any tables that are greater than 1000 blocks in size are divided into n chunks, where n=CEIL(table block size/1000)., 99489=The following example shows how to scan columns within a table to see the effects of migrating it to WE8MSWIN1252. This example assumes the current database character set is in US7ASCII. Language and character set detection is performed on the LOSSY data cells., 97154=The following example shows how to scan a single table to see the effect of migrating it to WE8MSWIN1252. Before scanning, a query is run against the table to limit the rows that will be scanned. This example assumes the current database character set is in US7ASCII. Language and character set detection is performed on the LOSSY data cells., 98086=Example 12-13 Single Table Scan with Command-File Method, Showing the Effect of Migrating to WE8MSWIN1252, 140403=For example, a VARCHAR2(5 char) column in a WE8MSWIN1252 database can store up to 5 characters, using 5 bytes. When these characters are migrated to AL32UTF8, the same 5 characters can expand to as much as 20 bytes in length. Because the physical byte limits allocated for the column are determined by the current database character set, this column must be manually expanded to 20 bytes before the data can be converted in the target character set. Alternatively, you can apply the character set conversion to this column after the database character set has been changed. Then the same VARCHAR2(5 char) definition will automatically allocate 20 bytes, and no special handling is required.}",

The ideal case is literary text of one single language with no spelling or grammatical errors. These types of text may require 100 characters of data or more and can return results with a very high factor of confidence. On the other hand, some technical documents can require longer segments before they are recognized. Documents that contain a mix of languages or character sets or text such as addresses, phone numbers, or programming language code may yield poor results. For example, if a document has both French and German embedded, then the accuracy of guessing either language successfully is statistically reduced. Both plain text and HTML files are accepted.
