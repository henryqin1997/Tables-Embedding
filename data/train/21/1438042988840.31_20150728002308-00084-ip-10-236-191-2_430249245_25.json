He had a successful career in the Rossall side, and when he took five wickets - including Mike Gatting - on his Hampshire debut aged 18 the newspapers heralded the second coming. But he realised that he was never going to match his father's achievements, and he soon ditched cricket for rugby - initially union and latterly league. In 1997 he played rugby union for England U21s, and for some time it seemed he might throw his lot in with Wales after joining Cardiff. In 2002-03 he signed for Leeds on a dual code basis, but his career was cut short by a serious neck injury.
