Claim 2 describes a water-insoluble tape, sheet, film, dental tray, mouth tray, mouthpiece, impression pack, pack material, and chewing brushing having a plurality of protrusion on a surface contacting with teeth and prepared by forming upon dental arch. Upon reviewing the specification, the invention is characterized by thinly applying a whitening component in a gel phase on a supporting layer of the above appliances or by immersing the adhesion portion of the above appliances in a solution containing a whitening agent. That is, the appliances claimed in this patent are wet type. When using such type of appliances, the whitening agent may contact with hands or other part of body, causing irritation., 47937=Hydrophilic glass polymers such as polyviny pyrrolidone (PVP, K-15\u02dcK-120), polyquaternium-11, polyquaternium-39, polyvinyl pyrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVP/VA copolymer) have a good compatibility with peroxide as well as a good solubility in water and ethanol. Accordingly, with using these polymers in the patch, the peroxide can be stabilized only by adjusting ratio of water to ethanol to be 9:1 to 0:10 without a stabilizer for peroxide. It is believed that the peroxide becomes compatible and thereby stabilized by formation of complex of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and peroxide via hydrogen bonding. Also, peroxides are found to be compatible with polymers having quaternary ammonium structure, such as polyquaternium.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes As apparent from the above description, the patch for tooth whitening according to the present invention has a superior tooth whitening effect. Further, the present patch is dry type using a hydrophilic glass polymer in an adhesive layer. Accordingly, only upon attaching the patch to teeth the glass polymer is hydrated to provide an adhesion while making the whitening agent released. Therefore, it is safe and efficient in using for a short time period. In addition, the patch of the present invention has a good stability of peroxide in the patch at a high temperature. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As shown from the results of Examples 4 and 5 and Comparative Examples 2 and 3 in table 3, adding a stabilizer for peroxide effects favorably in the stability with time when other compositional components are same. However, in case of Example 3 and Comparative Example 10 which did not include a stabilizer for peroxide, since the used glass polymer and peroxide are well compatible with each other, the stability with time of peroxide at a high temperature could be good only by adjusting the ratio of water and ethanol in the adhesive layer during the producing process. Comparative Example 4 is to evaluate Crest Whitestrips, a novel wet type whitening agent produced by Procter and Gamble. It was observed that residual peroxide content in the patch was reduced rapidly after 4 weeks.",
