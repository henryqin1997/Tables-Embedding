This fountain adds a peaceful atmosphere to the campus. Around this fountain are two concrete walls that explain the meaning behind this beautiful fountain., 150338=The University of Evansville just currently announced the Big Freeze. Starting next year, 2013, incoming freshmen's tuition will be frozen. What that means is, whatever tuition the students have currently will remain the same for the next four years of their college. So it is great for parents and students because they can save money for themselves., 168225=Sticker price is expensive (~$40K/year) but scholarships are generous and the Big Freeze (no changes in tuition for current and incoming 2013 freshmen) are a big help. Work-study as well as a few other on campus jobs are available., 253288=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 89862=Everyone here is obsessed with the Basketball team and Soccer team. There are many clubs to chose from, but be warned with a school of a little more than 2000, don't expect to have huge group activities., 147248=The University of Evansville is an amazing campus where students can feel very much at home. It is very personal and students have the chance to really connect with their peers and professors since the student-teacher ratio is 13:1, and every faculty member makes it a personal effort to make sure that every students succeeds.}",

    "textAfterTable": "After only a single semester I feel like I've learned a lot from all of my classes so far. Even classes that I thought I would hate have something to learn from. The professors are amazing and willing to talk to you and answer questions you may have, even if it is unrelated to the course material. Other students are also willing to teach others what they have learned so far.
