    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{367854=HGK is found to be broadly expressed in human tumor cells and can modulate cellular transformation, invasion, and adhesion (Wright et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 23: 2068-2082, 2003). Wright et al showed HGK to be highly expressed in most tumor cell lines relative to normal tissue. An active role for this kinase in transformation was suggested by an inhibition of H-Ras (V12)-induced focus formation by expression of inactive, dominant-negative mutants of HGK in both fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. Expression of an inactive mutant of HGK also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of cells yet had no effect on proliferation in monolayer culture. Expression of HGK mutants modulated integrin receptor expression and had a striking effect on hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated epithelial cell invasion. Together, these results suggest an important role for HGK in cell transformation and invasiveness. More recently, a small interfering RNA screen for modulators of tumor cell motility identifies MAP4K4 as a promigratory kinase (Collins et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103: 3775-3780, 2006). Collins et al. showed that the knockdown of the HGK transcript inhibited the migration of multiple carcinoma cell lines, indicating a broad role in cell motility, and potently suppressed the invasion of SKOV-3 cells in vitro. The effect of HGK on cellular migration was found to be mediated through JNK kinase, independent of AP1 activation and downstream transcription. Accordingly, small molecule inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase suppressed SKOV-3 cell migration, underscoring the potential therapeutic utility of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition in cancer progression (Collins et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103: 3775-3780, 2006). These studies strongly support HGK as a target in a broad range of oncology indications. In particular, an HGK inhibitor could have utility in blocking the migration, invasion and metastasis in many different tumor types., 645617=The results are assessed to determine whether the combination is synergistic or antagonistic. The compound interactions are calculated by multiple drug effect analysis and are performed by the median equation principle according to the methodology described by Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984, 22: 27-55)., 364263=In patients with neuroblastomas, co-expression of TrkB and BDNF, co-expression of TrkB with N-Myc amplification, and expression of truncated TrkB are found to be associated with poorer clinical outcome (Nakagawara et al, 1994, Mol Cell Biol. 14:759-767). Co-expression of TrkB with its ligand BDNF could generate a positive feedback loop through autocrine and paracrine loops. Also TrkB truncations found in these tumors generate activated forms of the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase. The constitutively active TrkB signals through multiple pathways to promote cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. These truncated TrkB kinases were also found in hepatocellular carcinoma (Yang et al, 2005, Cancer. Res 65:219-225). Thus TrkB inhibitors could be used to treat a sub-population of cancer patients with an activated TrkB pathway., 495089=Compound P-1841 was synthesized in six steps from 2,4-difluoroaniline 47 as shown in Scheme 14., 339284=As used herein, the terms \u201cligand\u201d and \u201cmodulator\u201d are used equivalently to refer to a compound that changes (i.e., increases or decreases) the activity of a target biomolecule, e.g., an enzyme such as a kinase. Generally a ligand or modulator will be a small molecule, where \u201csmall molecule refers to a compound with a molecular weight of 1500 daltons or less, or preferably 1000 daltons or less, 800 daltons or less, or 600 daltons or less. Thus, an \u201cimproved ligand\u201d is one that possesses better pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic properties than a reference compound, where \u201cbetter\u201d can be defined by one skilled in the relevant art for a particular biological system or therapeutic use., 350090=c-Raf-1: Target kinase c-Raf-1 (i.e., v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog 1) is a 73.0 kDa STK encoded by chromosome 3p25 (symbol: RAF1). c-Raf-1 can be targeted to the mitochondria by BCL2 (i.e., oncogene B-cell leukemia 2) which is a regulator of apoptotic cell death Active c-Raf-1 improves BCL2-mediated resistance to apoptosis, and c-Raf-1 phosphorylates BAD (i.e., BCL2-binding protein). c-Raf-1 is implicated in carcinomas, including colorectal, ovarian, lung and renal cell carcinoma. C-Raf-1 is also implicated as an important mediator of tumor angiogenesis (Hood, J. D. et al., 2002, Science 296, 2404). C-Raf-1 inhibitors may also be useful for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (Crump, Curr Pharm Des 2002, 8(25):2243-8). Raf-1 activators may be useful as treatment for neuroendocrine tumors, such as medullary thyroid cancer, carcinoid, small cell lung cancer and pheochromocytoma (Kunnimalaiyaan et al., Anticancer Drugs 2006, 17(2):139-42)., 367170=Expression of HGK in transfected cell lines resulted in strong JNK activation and, in turn, c-jun transcriptional activity (Yao et al. J. Biol. Chem. 274: 2118-2125, 1999). HGK-induced JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative MAP2K4, MAP2K7, and TAK1 mutants. TNF-alpha also stimulated HGK kinase activity. HGK was identified as a putative effect of Rap2 to activate JNK (Machida et al. J, Biol. Chem. 279: 15711-15714, 2004). This link establishes HGK as a potential target for a range of metabolic indications, since the JNK pathway clearly antagonizes insulin signaling. An HGK inhibitor could re-sensitize fat and muscle cells to insulin., 365139=In patients with pancreatic cancer, TrkB expression is correlated with perineural invasion, positive retroperitoneal margin, and shorter latency to development of liver metastasis (Selabas et al, 2005, Clin. Cancer. Res VI 1:440-449). Mechanistically, TrkB activates the PI3K pathway to suppress anoikis (apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions) which is one of the physiological barriers to metastasis. TrkB kinase inhibition could break down resistance to anoikis of metastasizing tumors (Douma et al, 2004, Nature 430:1034-9). Therefore, TrkB inhibitors could have utility in a broad range of tumor types., 641423=The tumor cells (10,000 per well) are plated in 96-well flat-bottom microtitration plates (Ref 055260, Nunc, Dutscher, Brumath, France) and incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 24 hours before treatment in 100 \u03bcl of drug-free culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS. In order to assess the IC50 of each compound to be used for each cell line, the tumor cells are incubated in a 200 \u03bcl final volume of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and containing either a compound of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, or one of 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin, dacarbazine, gefitinib, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, SN-38, temozolomide, or vinblastine. The compounds are tested in a suitable concentration range, such as 10\u22128 to 10\u22123 M for a compound of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, 5-fluorouracil, dacarbazine or gefitinib, 10\u22129 to 10\u22124 M for carboplatin, oxaliplatin, or temozolomide, 10\u221211 to 10\u22126 M for paclitaxel or SN-38, and 10\u221215 to 10\u221210 M for vinblastine. Compounds of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III are dissolved in DMSO and diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations. 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/ml, Dakota Pharm, LePlessis Robinson, France), carboplatin (10 mg/ml, Aguettant, Lyon, France), and paclitaxel (6 mg/ml, Bristol-Myers Squibb SpA, Rueil Malmaison, France), are diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations. Dacarbazine (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) and vinblastine (Lilly France S. A., Saint Cloud, France) are dissolved in NaCl 0.9% and diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations. Gefitinib is dissolved in a mixed solution of RPMI 1640 and DMSO and diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations (maximum final DMSO of 0.1% v/v). SN-38 (LKT Laboratories, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) is dissolved in DMSO and diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations (maximum final DMSO of 0.1% v/v). Temozolomide (LKT Laboratories, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) is dissolved in water for injection and diluted with culture medium to the desired concentrations. Cells are incubated for 96 hours in the presence of test substances at 37\ufffd C. under 5% CO2. At the end of treatments, the cytotoxic activity is evaluated by an MTT assay., 640350=Tumor cells are grown as a monolayer at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Cells are grown in a suitable culture medium, e.g. RPMI 1640 (Ref BE12-702F, Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium) containing 2 mM L-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Ref DE14-801E, Cambrex). For experimental use, the tumor cells are detached from the culture flask by a 5-minute treatment with trypsin-versene (Ref 02-007E, Cambrex), diluted in Hanks' medium without calcium or magnesium (Ref BE10-543F, Cambrex). Trypsin treatment is neutralized by culture medium addition. The cells are counted in a hemocytometer and their viability assessed by 0.25% trypan blue exclusion., 365872=MAP4K4: Target kinase MAP4K4 (i.e., Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, aka Hematopoietic progenitor kinase/Germinal center kinase-like Kinase) is a 130 kDa serine/threonine kinase encoded by chromosome 2q11.2-q12 (symbol: MAP4K4) and is also known as HGK. It is a member of the human STE20/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) family of serine/threonine kinases and is the human ortholog of mouse NtK (Nck-interacting kinase). The N-terminus of the mature HGK protein has a catalytic kinase domain that shares 47% and 48% amino acid sequence identity to the catalytic domain of Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) and Germinal center kinase (GCK), respectively. Yao et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 274: 2118-2125, 1999) identified 2 HGK isoforms, one of which has no proline-rich domains, and another, longer variant that contains such domains and appears to be expressed in brain only. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 3 HGK transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kb in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, liver, lung, and kidney. By Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody, Yao et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 274: 2118-2125, 1999) found that the 130-kD protein is expressed in multiple cell lines., 360916=The late phase reaction in asthma following allergen provocation is dominated by an influx of activated eosinophils into the bronchial lumen, which correlates with the release of cosinophilic products into the airways to increase disease severity. The viability and activation of cosinophils from patients with mild asthma were significantly enhanced after NGF stimulation. Addition of neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies ex vivo abrogated the effects (Nassentein et al, 2003, J Exp Med 198:455-467). TrkA kinase inhibitors could decrease this paracrine loop between the respiratory tract and infiltrating mast cells as well as endobronchial cosinophils, and thus be useful for the treatment of asthma and other allergic disorders., 499811=Into a microwave reaction vessel were combined (3-amino-2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-(5-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-methanone (56, 50 mg, 0.16 mmol), 3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (57, 103 mg, 0.49 mmol), pyridine (0.5 mL, 6.1820 mol) and tetrahydrofuran (3.0 mL). The reaction was warmed in the CEM microwave at 300 watts, 130\ufffd C. for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and brine. The organic layer was collected, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The compound (58) was isolated using column chromatography (silica, hexane:ethyl acetate 70:30) to obtain 36 mg (46%) compound. MS=482.0., 340012=In the context of compounds binding to a target, the terms \u201cgreater affinity\u201d and \u201cselective\u201d indicates that the compound binds more tightly than a reference compound, or than the same compound in a reference condition, i.e., with a lower dissociation constant. In some embodiments, the greater affinity is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 1000, or 10,000-fold greater affinity., 645965=The combination index (CI) will be calculated by the Chou et al. equation (Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984, 22: 27-55; Encyclopaedia of human biology, Academic Press, 1991, 2: 371-9; Synergism and Antagonism in Chemotherapy, Academic Press, 1991, 61-102) which takes into account both the potency (Dm or IC50) and the shape of the dose-effect curve (the m value). The general equation for the CI of the two compounds is given by:, 651431=The (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 can be calculated from the median-effect equation of Chou et al. (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994, 86: 1517-24):, 358166=Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is produced by a number of tissues and inflammatory cells during tissue injury and host immune response. It initiates and maintains hypersensitivity to incoming stimulus (hyperalgesia) and the perception of non-noxious stimuli (allodynia). Through its high-affinity receptor TrkA, NGF increases the excitation state of sensory neurons leading to the central nervous system (peripheral sensitization), and increases transmitter release from the dorsal spinal cord (central sensitization). In clinical trials, a single NGF subcutaneous injection generated local hyperalgesia persisting up to 7 weeks. At doses above 0.1 microgram/kg, NGF caused muscle pain that varied from mild to moderate, primarily in the bulbar and truncal musculature. Intravenous NGF produced earlier and more pronounced systemic effects (Petty et al, 1994, Ann Neurol. 36: 244-6). Conversely, TrkA kinase inhibitors could be used to treat diseases of enhanced states of nociception., 349689=Niihori et al., report that in 43 individuals with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, they identified two heterozygous KRAS mutations in three individuals and eight BRAF mutations in 16 individuals, suggesting that dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-ERK pathway is a common molecular basis for the three related disorders (Niihori et al., Nat. Genet. 2006, 38(3):294-6)., 348682=The BRAF gene is frequently mutated in a variety of human tumors, especially in malignant melanoma and colon carcinoma. The most common reported mutation was a missense thymine (T) to adenine (A) transversion at nucleotide 1796 (T1796A; amino acid change in the B-Raf protein is Val<600> to Glu<600>) observed in 80% of malignant melanoma tumors. Functional analysis reveals that this transversion is the only detected mutation that causes constitutive activation of B-Raf kinase activity, independent of RAS activation, by converting B-Raf into a dominant transforming protein. Based on precedents, human tumors develop resistance to kinase inhibitors by mutating a specific amino acid in the catalytic domain as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d. (Balak, et. al., Clin Cancer Res. 2006, 12:6494-501). Mutation of Thr-529 in BRAF to Ile is thus anticipated as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors, and this can be envisioned as a transition in codon 529 from ACC to ATC., 359179=In Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced hind-paw inflammation, spinal nerve ligation and streptozoticin-induced neuropathic pain models, a single intraperitoneal injection of anti-NGF reversed established tactile allodynia from day 3 to day 7 following treatment. In the mouse CCI model, anti-NGF reversed tactile allodynia when administered 2 weeks after surgery. Repeated administration of this antibody to CCI mice for 3 weeks produced a sustained reversal of tactile allodynia (Wild et al, 2007, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 322:282-287)., 362995=BDNF is known to act at the synapses between primary sensory and spinal dorsal horn neurons to affect pain transmission during inflammation. The primary afferent is the only source of BDNF in the spinal cord, and it is up-regulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by peripheral NGF a few days after inflammation, and is transported and released into the superficial dorsal horn in an activity-dependent manner. TrkB expression in the dorsal horn also increases for a few days after inflammation. These findings suggest that BDNF may act during the restricted period in the early phase of inflammation. Through TrkB, BDNF activates two distinct channels: (1) transient receptor potential canonicals (TRPC3), which produces a slow response by opening of a non-selective cation channel; and (2) Na+ channel, which mediates a rapid depolarization in the hippocampus. These channels have been strongly associated with inflammatory pain. Anti-BDNF significantly increased the withdrawal threshold in CFA-treated rats, a model of inflammatory pain. Since the swelling at the site of CFA injection was not affected by antiserum, the residual component might be due to peripheral sensitization (Matayoshi et al, 2005, J. Physiol. 569:685-95)., 654347=Additional examples of certain methods contemplated by the present invention may be found in the following applications: U.S. Patent Publ. No. 2006/058339, application Ser. No. 11/154,287; U.S. Patent Publ. No. 2006/058340, application Ser. No. 11/154,988; U.S. Prov. App. No. 60/682,076, filed May 17, 2005; U.S. Prov.

No. 11/473,347, filed Jun. 21, 2006, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties including all specifications, figures, and tables, and for all purposes., 353460=The compounds described herein are useful for treating disorders related to c-kit e.g., diseases related to unregulated kinase signal transduction, including cell proliferative disorders, fibrotic disorders and metabolic disorders, among others. As described in more detail below and in Lipson et al., U.S. 20040002534 (U.S. application Ser. No. 10/600,868, filed Jun. 23, 2003) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, cell proliferative disorders which can be treated by the present invention include cancers, and mast cell proliferative disorders., 362131=In clinical trials with recombinant BDNF, paresthesia was developed at the site of subcutaneous injection (Coulie et al, 2000, Gastroenterology 119:41-50). Intrathecal infusion of BDNF in humans also induced paresthesia and warmth as side effects (Ochs et al, 2000, Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 1:201-6). Chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological disease or traumatic nerve damage. Paresthesia can be caused by disorders affecting the central nervous system, such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes), multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis. Since BDNF binds to TrkB specifically with high affinity these neuropath effects are mediated through TrkB signaling. Thus Trkb kinase inhibitors could be used to treat certain patients with neuropathy., 142417=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional App. No. 60/876,953, entitled \u201cCompounds and Methods for Kinase Modulation, and Indications Therefor\u201d, filed Dec. 21, 2006, and is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/473,347, entitled \u201cCompounds and Methods for Kinase Modulation, and Indications Therefor\u201d, filed Jun. 21, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional App. No. 60/731,528, entitled \u201cCompounds and Methods for Kinase Modulation, and Indications Therefor\u201d, filed Oct. 28, 2005, and U.S. Provisional App. No. 60/692,960, entitled \u201cCompounds and Methods for Kinase Modulation, and Indications Therefor\u201d, filed Jun. 22, 2005, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirctics and for all purposes., 360496=In patients with mild asthma due to exposure to cat allergen, NGF expression was strongly induced in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and a few infiltrating cells. TrkA mRNA and protein levels in bronchial biopsies were increased significantly after allergen exposure in infiltrating mast cells before the onset of symptoms (Kassel et al, 2001, Clin Exp Allergy 31:1432-40)., 378570=Regarding the synthetic examples described herein, a nitrogen protecting group is a chemical group covalently bound to a nitrogen atom of a compound that is used to protect the nitrogen from reaction during a synthetic step. The nitrogen protecting group may be added to a compound and removed in a subsequent step by methods known to those of skill in the art. Nitrogen protecting groups include, without limitation, carbamates, amides, N-sulfonyl derivatives, groups of formula \u2014C(O)OR, wherein R is, for example, methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, CH2\u2550CHCH2\u2014, and the like, groups of the formula \u2014C(O)R\u2032, wherein R\u2032 is, for example, methyl, phenyl, trifluoromethyl, and the like, groups of the formula \u2014SO2R\u2033, wherein R\u2033 is, for example, tolyl, phenyl, trifluoromethyl. 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-yl, 2,3,6-trimethyl-4-methoxyphenyl, and the like, and silanyl containing groups, such as 2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like. Other suitable nitrogen protecting groups may be found in texts such as T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 1991., 370751=Insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 is a key modulator of whole body glucose homeostasis, and its selective loss in adipose tissue or skeletal muscle causes insulin resistance and diabetes. Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 103:2087-2092, 2006) found 4 negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse adipocytes: Pctk1, Pftk1, Ikbka (CHUK), and HGK. HGK suppressed expression of adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPA, C/EBPB, and PPARG, and it suppressed surface expression of GLUT4 (SLC2A4), resulting in attenuated membrane hexose transport activity. RNA interference-mediated depletion of HGK early in differentiation enhanced adipogenesis and triglyceride deposition; in fully differentiated adipocytes, loss of HGK upregulated GLUT4 expression. Conversely, conditions that inhibited adipogenesis, such as TNF-alpha treatment or PPARG depletion, markedly upregulated HGK. Tang et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 103:2087-2092, 2006) concluded that MAP4K4-dependent signaling inhibited PPARG-responsive gene expression, adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Furthermore, TNF-alpha signaling to down-regulate GLUT4 is impaired in the absence of HGK, indicating that HGK expression is required for optimal TNF-alpha action. This study further supports HGK as a target in metabolic disease, and suggests a role for HGK inhibition in ameliorating the pathology in adipocytes., 643759=For the MTT assay, at the end of the cells treatment, 20 \u03bcl of a 5 mg/ml solution 0.22 \u03bcm filtered tetrazolium reagent (MTT, Ref M2128, Sigma) in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, Ref BE17-517Q, Cambrex), is added in each well. Culture plates are incubated for 2 h at 37\ufffd C. The resulting supernatant is removed and formazan crystals dissolved with 200 \u03bcl of DMSO per well. Absorbency (OD) is measured at 570 nm in each well using VICTOR3\u2122 1420 multilabeled counter (Wallac, PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France)., 359754=Prostate tumors that have metastasized to bone frequently induce bone pain which can be difficult to fully control as it seems to be driven simultaneously by inflammatory, neuropathic, and tumorigenic mechanisms. Anti-NGF produced a significant reduction in both early and late stage hone cancer pain related behaviors. This therapy did not influence tumor-induced bone remodeling, osteoblast proliferation, osteoclastogenesis, tumor growth, or markers of sensory or sympathetic innervation in the skin or bone. All nerve fibers that innervate the bone express TrkA and p75, and these are the receptors through which NGF sensitizes and/or activates nociceptors (Halvorson et al, 2005, Cancer Res. 65:9426-35)., 147013=This application is related to the following published patent applications: WO 2004024895, US 20040142864, WO 2004078923, US 20050170431, WO 2005028624, US 20050164300, and WO 2005062795, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties including all specifications, figures, and tables, and for all purposes., 375111=A wide array of organic synthetic techniques exist in the art to facilitate the construction of potential modulators.
