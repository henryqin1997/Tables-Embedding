    "textBeforeTable": "After the top four, the field is wide open. More than a dozen throwers sit between 65 and 68 meters. Some have been consistent, others haven't and we always give the edge to those that are consistent. When it comes down to championship time, it's more likely that the consistent thrower will continue to be consistent. While big personal bests and fluke throws always happen, we're thinking that the consistency shown by some of the West region qualifiers will put them in the top eight. The only favorite that improved his case at regionals was Ziegler; the rest just turned in so-so performances that are hard to draw any conclusions from. As a result, I'm leaving my predictions relativly unchanged in this edition, with the exception of Ziegler moving up a few spots. This competition is almost two close to call.
