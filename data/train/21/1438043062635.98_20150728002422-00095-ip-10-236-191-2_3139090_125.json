Axion does not seem to support ALTER statements or sub-selects. This means: - We cannot auto upgrade the schema was we roll out new versions of ActiveMQ - We cannot delete durable sub messages that have be acknowledged by all consumers. org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.AxionJDBCAdapter blobJDBCAdapter This JDBCAdapter inserts and extracts BLOB data using the getBlob()/setBlob() operations. This is a little more involved since to insert a blob you have to: 1: insert empty blob. 2: select the blob 3: finally update the blob with data value. The databases/JDBC drivers that use this adapter are: org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.BlobJDBCAdapter broker An ActiveMQ Message Broker. It consists of a number of transport connectors, network connectors and a bunch of properties which can be used to configure the broker as its lazily created. org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerService bytesJDBCAdapter This JDBCAdapter inserts and extracts BLOB data using the setBytes()/getBytes() operations.
