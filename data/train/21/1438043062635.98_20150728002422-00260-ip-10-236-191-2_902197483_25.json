There's also a rumor on campus about a Panara Bread for the 2012-2013 year., 252751=Tuition is only 2900 per semester, with fees it comes around to about 4000 a semester which isn't bad at all for a University. You get a great education for a low tuition cost., 439266=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 334446=Parties and chilling with friends in the dorms.

I have lived in housing for both my years here and I love it. The Resident Assistants are wonderful and help when you need them. Am learning a lot Classes here at SIUe are challenging. However SIUe is a great place to learn outside of the classroom. Your instructors and professors make it a priority to teach you what you need to know and help get real-life, hands-on experience.
