The courses are structured well to incorporate real life experiences to prepare you for whatever field you intend to utilize your degree in. Professors are the best in their profession with solid credentials and experience. This University has great programs. Tips for prospective students If you plan on attending this University, a major tip is to have good time management skills. The course load is fierce and challenging. Professors expect for you to submit quality papers and engage in all online conversations. Make sure that you log onto your class at least twice a week to see updates from the professor and complete class participation assignments. Also find time in your schedule to properly review all material for the week and submit assignments on time. A good strategy would be to preview work for the next week to see if there are any assignments requiring additional time, and make arrangements in your schedule to accommodate the course work. In three sentences Franklin University is a wonderful school. I would give the school an A- for a rating or about 4 out of 5 stars. The University is centrally located",
