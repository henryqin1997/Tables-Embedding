Am learning a lot With seven different schools, stretching from psychology and law to theater and cinema production (offered at both grad and undergrad levels), Regent University is the place to be if you are a blossoming Christian leader.

If you are hungry for experience and thirsty for knowledge, the Comm. Arts programs will definitely give back what you put into it.
