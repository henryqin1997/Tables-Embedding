Lynch, Klipper and Riggio have performance targets based on Adjusted EBITDA that were established by the Compensation Committee in consultation with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer during the first quarter of Fiscal 2012. The targets were set in accordance with and based on the Company\u0092s annual budget and financial goals. The Compensation Committee considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate performance metric for performance units because it reflects sustained earnings and aligns performance-based annual incentive compensation with the interests of, 619340=As described in the \u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0097Key Elements of Compensation, Long-Term Equity\u0094 section of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee approved a grant to Mr.\u00a0Lynch of options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock on December\u00a09, 2011. However, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Company subsequently determined that stock options with respect to the 500,000 shares of common stock approved on December\u00a09, 2011 were not validly granted pursuant to the 2009 Incentive Plan because they exceeded the limit on the number of stock options that may be granted to any individual participant within any 36-month period. Accordingly, the attempted grant of these excess stock options was ineffective, and they were never granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. Had the grant of excess options been effective, the aggregate grant date fair value of the excess stock options would have been $5,285,000 and would have been included in Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, which would have increased his total compensation for Fiscal 2012 to $15,293,398. In order to rectify the situation, and in the interest of furthering the compensation objective of aligning pay to business objectives and long-term strategy,, 109705=All Board members are expected to attend in person the Company\u0092s annual meetings of stockholders and be available to address questions or concerns raised by stockholders. All of the then-incumbent directors attended the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders., 190828=In Fiscal 2010, when Mercer assessed the proposed compensation level for Mr.\u00a0Lynch in connection with his promotion to his current position as Chief Executive Officer and the execution of his employment agreement, it also reviewed compensation at a group of technology and internet retail companies as an additional reference point for his position. The group of technology and internet retail companies were: AOL Inc.; Avid Technologies, Inc.; eBay Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; NCR Corporation; Netflix, Inc.; NewEgg Inc.; Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. and priceline.com Incorporated (collectively, the \u0093Technology Peer Group\u0094)., 1071892=2.6. \u0093Code\u0094 shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, and any successor thereto., 351754=As mentioned above, for Fiscal 2012, the Company\u0092s actual Adjusted EBITDA was less than the minimum performance level of 84% of the Adjusted EBITDA target. Accordingly, Ms.\u00a0Keating and Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom did not receive the portion (25%)\u00a0of his or her performance-based annual incentive compensation that is based on Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2012. However, based on the achievement of each such executive\u0092s individual performance components, each of Ms.\u00a0Keating and Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom did receive the portion (75%)\u00a0of his or her performance-based annual incentive compensation that is based on his or her MBO Metrics. Ms.\u00a0Keating\u0092s MBO Metrics assessed her performance in three areas: (i)\u00a0the development and implementation of a world-class public relations program to support the launch of new Company products, (ii)\u00a0her material contribution to the development, implementation and oversight of the NOOK\u0099 advertising program and (iii)\u00a0the maintenance of the Company\u0092s premier position as leader in author promotions. Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom\u0092s MBO Metrics assessed his performance in four areas: (a)\u00a0his work with internal auditors and outside advisors to develop and implement an enterprise risk management system, (b)\u00a0the filing of accurate financial reports with no restatements, (c)\u00a0the preparation for change in segment reporting for the digital business and (d)\u00a0his material contribution to corporate due diligence regarding the Company\u0092s merger and acquisition activities. Set forth below are charts showing (1)\u00a0the target and maximum annual performance-based incentive compensation for each of Ms.\u00a0Keating and Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom for the portions of each such executive\u0092s incentive compensation that are based on Adjusted EBITDA and their MBO Metrics and (2)\u00a0the actual level of achievement and payment for each annual performance-based incentive compensation target for each of Ms.\u00a0Keating and Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom for Fiscal 2012., 186091=In Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee retained Frederic W. Cook\u00a0& Co., Inc., an independent nationally recognized compensation consulting firm (\u0093Cook\u00a0& Co.\u0094), to provide information, analyses and advice regarding executive compensation and other matters. Cook\u00a0& Co. was retained by the Compensation Committee in February 2011, and a representative of Cook\u00a0& Co. attended all but one of the meetings of the Compensation Committee during Fiscal 2012. Cook\u00a0& Co. had been previously retained by the Compensation Committee to advise with respect to prior fiscal years. Cook\u00a0& Co. reports directly to the Compensation Committee Chair. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, Cook\u00a0& Co. developed a new proxy peer group for executive compensation analysis and conducted a competitive compensation analysis of Chief Executive Officer pay using the new peer group and the Radford Global Technology Survey (\u0093Radford Survey\u0094). Cook\u00a0& Co. does not provide other services to the Company in addition to providing compensation consulting services to the Compensation Committee. Prior to Fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee retained Mercer (US) Inc. (\u0093Mercer\u0094) to advise on and analyze matters regarding executive compensation; however, Mercer does not currently provide any consulting services to the Compensation Committee. In determining the compensation of Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, the Compensation Committee did not use specific peer group data, but the Compensation Committee was presented with market information based on surveys provided by Mercer and Radford (collectively, \u0093Competitive Survey Data\u0094), in order to obtain a broad understanding of current executive compensation pay practices for the applicable positions., 207824=Impact of Fiscal 2011 Say-on-Pay and Say-on-Frequency Votes, 74367=Gregory B. Maffei has served as a director of the Company since September 2011.

Until June 2005, GameStop participated in the Company\u0092s workers\u0092 compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by the Company under these programs were allocated to GameStop based upon GameStop\u0092s total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history. GameStop reimbursed the Company for these services $3,000, $51,000 and $128,000 during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. Although GameStop secured its own insurance coverage, costs are continuing to be incurred by the Company on insurance claims which were made under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against GameStop will be charged to GameStop at the time incurred., 18983=Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on September\u00a011, 2012: The Proxy Statement and the Company\u0092s 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders are available online at www.bn2012annualmeeting.com., 81805=The Board met 17 times during the Company\u0092s 2012 fiscal year beginning on May\u00a01, 2011 and ending on April\u00a028, 2012 (\u0093Fiscal 2012\u0094).

In light of the review conducted in early Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee did not conduct a similar review for the remainder of Fiscal 2012. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider compensation risk implications, as appropriate, in designing any new executive compensation components., 172382=The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis summarizes the material elements of the Company\u0092s compensation programs for its named executive officers, including the Company\u0092s compensation philosophy and objectives.

Lynch, Huseby and Klipper, in the event of a change of control, unless otherwise provided by the applicable award agreement, if the successor company assumes or substitutes for an outstanding equity award, such award will continue in accordance with its applicable terms and not be accelerated. Under the option award agreements, if the holder were terminated within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested options underlying the award or substitute award would immediately vest. Furthermore, under the restricted stock award agreements, if the holder were terminated other than for \u0093cause\u0094 within 24 months following a change of control, then the unvested shares of restricted stock underlying the award would immediately vest. Finally, under the restricted stock unit award agreements, if the holder were terminated other than for \u0093cause\u0094 at any time following a change of control, then the unvested restricted stock units underlying the award would immediately vest.

Pursuant to such sublease, the Company charged B&N College $347,000 for such subleased space and other operating costs incurred on its behalf during Fiscal year 2010 prior to the Acquisition.

The performance units granted to Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio, which vest over a one-year period, are designed to motivate individual and team performance in attaining the current year\u0092s performance goals and business objectives. Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating participated in the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2012, which provides for an annual incentive payment to each such executive, 25% of which is based on the Adjusted EBITDA corporate performance target and 75% of which is based on each such executive\u0092s individual performance targets. Mr.\u00a0Huseby was not granted a bonus for Fiscal 2012, but he is guaranteed a bonus in Fiscal 2013, as discussed further below. Pursuant to the Lombardi Transition Agreement, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi was not eligible for an annual incentive compensation payment with respect to Fiscal 2012., 127196=Allen W.

Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom is a Certified Public Accountant., 105128=The Chairman of the Board is selected by the members of the Board. The positions of Chairman and CEO have been separate since 2002, and the positions remained separate when Mr.\u00a0Lynch became the Company\u0092s CEO in March 2010. The Board has determined that the current structure is appropriate at this time in that it enables Mr.\u00a0Lynch to focus on his role as CEO of the Company, including handling the complexities of implementing the Company\u0092s digital strategy, while enabling Mr.\u00a0Leonard Riggio to continue to provide leadership on policy at the Board level. Although the roles of CEO and Chairman are currently separated, the Board has not adopted a formal policy requiring such separation. The Board believes that the right Board leadership structure should, among other things, be informed by the needs and circumstances of the Company and the then current membership of the Board, and that the Board should remain adaptable to shaping the leadership structure as those needs and circumstances change., 78701=David A. Wilson has served as a director of the Company since October 2010. Dr.\u00a0Wilson serves as Chair of the Audit Committee. Dr.\u00a0Wilson has served, since 1995, as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Graduate Management Admission Council, a not-for-profit education association dedicated to creating access to graduate management and professional education that provides the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).

(formerly Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc.), an operator of an international network of licensed campus-based and online universities and higher education institutions, where he was Chairman of the Audit Committee beginning in 2003. From 1978 to 1994, Dr.\u00a0Wilson was employed by Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP (and its predecessor, Arthur Young\u00a0& Company), serving as an Audit Principal through 1981, as an Audit Partner from 1981 to 1983 and thereafter in various capacities including Managing Partner, National Director of Professional Development, Chairman of Ernst\u00a0& Young\u0092s International Professional Development Committee and as a Director of the Ernst\u00a0& Young Foundation. From 1968 to 1978, Dr.\u00a0Wilson served as a faculty member at Queen\u0092s University (1968-1970), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1970-1972), the University of Texas (1972-1978), where he was awarded tenure, and Harvard University\u0092s Graduate School of Business (1976-1977). Dr.\u00a0Wilson is also Director of CoreSite Realty Corporation and the chair of its Audit Committee., 125535=Jaime Carey has been Chief Merchandising Officer of the Company since May 2008.

Lynch, Huseby, Klipper and Riggio could be no less than $900,000, $850,000, $900,000 and $100,000, respectively, during the terms of their employment. Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper and Riggio are entitled to minimum target annual bonus or incentive compensation amounts of no less than 150% of their annual salaries. Each is also eligible for grants of\u00a0equity-based awards under the 2009 Incentive Plan., 627368=The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper and Riggio but has not entered into employment agreements with Ms.\u00a0Keating and Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom. Therefore while the compensation of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper and Riggio is based on their employment agreements, the compensation of Ms.\u00a0Keating and Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom is largely determined by job responsibilities. The terms of the employment agreements with Messrs. Lynch and Klipper commenced on March\u00a017, 2010, will continue for a period of three years thereafter, and renew each year automatically for one year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal. Following expiration of the initial terms of these employment agreements, the Compensation Committee will consider their continuing appropriateness on an annual basis. Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s employment agreement superseded his prior employment agreement with the Company, dated January\u00a06, 2009. Mr.\u00a0Klipper\u0092s employment agreement superseded his prior employment agreement, dated February\u00a018, 2002, as amended. Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s employment agreement is dated as of March\u00a09, 2012 and the term of his employment with the Company commenced on March\u00a013, 2012. Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s employment agreement will continue for a period of three years thereafter, and renew each year automatically for one year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal. Mr.\u00a0Huseby was not previously an employee of the Company. The terms of the employment agreement with Mr.\u00a0Riggio commenced on May\u00a012, 2010. Mr.\u00a0Riggio\u0092s employment agreement continued for a period of one year after its May\u00a012, 2010 effective date, and will renew each year automatically for one year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal. Mr.\u00a0Riggio was not previously a party to an employment agreement., 929391=GameStop Corp. (\u0093GameStop\u0094), a company in which Leonard Riggio was a member of the Board of Directors and is a minority shareholder, operates departments within some of the Company\u0092s bookstores. GameStop pays a license fee to the Company in an amount equal to 7% of the gross sales of such departments, which totaled $871,000, $989,000 and $1,061,000 during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. GameStop sold new and used video games and consoles on the Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com website up until May\u00a01, 2011, when the agreement between GameStop and Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com terminated. Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com received a commission on sales made by GameStop. For Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, the commission earned by Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com was $1,000 (from residual activity after the agreement terminated),, 617894=Fiscal 2012 Compensation for Mr.\u00a0Lynch, Fiscal 2012 Chief Executive Officer, 926394=The Company has leases for two locations for its corporate offices with related parties: the first location is leased from an entity in which Leonard Riggio has a majority interest and expires in 2013; the second location is leased from an entity in which Leonard Riggio has a minority interest and expires in 2016. The space was rented at an aggregate annual rent including real estate taxes of approximately $4,843,000, $4,868,000 and $4,889,000 during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively., 416603=Because it is critical to the Company to retain Mr.\u00a0Lynch given his role in the Company\u0092s digital strategy, the importance of his significant experience in the technology sector to his role as Chief Executive Officer and the fact that under his leadership the Company has, in a short period, been transformed into a leader in digital technology, on December\u00a09, 2011, the Compensation Committee approved a grant to Mr.\u00a0Lynch of options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The grant to Mr.\u00a0Lynch vests as follows: 25% on December\u00a09, 2013, 25% on December\u00a09, 2014 and the remaining 50% on December\u00a09, 2015. However, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Company subsequently determined that stock options with respect to the 500,000 shares of common stock approved on December\u00a09, 2011 were not validly granted pursuant to the 2009 Incentive Plan because they exceeded the limit on the number of stock options that may be granted to any individual participant within any 36-month period. Accordingly, the attempted grant of these excess stock options was ineffective, and they were never granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. All references in this Proxy Statement to the December\u00a09, 2011 grant reflect only the stock options with respect to the 500,000 shares of common stock that were validly granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. Had the grant of excess options been effective, the aggregate grant date fair value of the excess stock options would have been $5,285,000 and would have been included in Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table below, which would have increased his total compensation for Fiscal 2012 to $15,293,398. In order to rectify the situation, and in the interest of furthering the compensation objective of aligning pay to business objectives and long-term strategy, the Compensation Committee decided in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 to seek stockholder approval of an amendment to the 2009 Incentive Plan, as discussed in Proposal 3 submitted together with this Proxy Statement, that will allow an additional grant of stock options with respect to the 500,000 shares of common stock to Mr.\u00a0Lynch to replace the options that were not granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. In the event such approval is obtained, the new stock options will be granted on the date of the annual meeting and will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\u0092s common stock on the date of the meeting. The vesting schedule and other terms of the new options will be identical to the vesting schedule of the excess options., 881461=annual cash retainer. Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee members received an additional $10,000 annual cash retainer, and the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee received an additional $15,000 annual cash retainer. All directors are also reimbursed for travel, lodging and related expenses incurred in attending Board meetings. In addition, during Fiscal 2012, Messrs. Campbell, Dillard, Golden and Wilson and Mses. Higgins and Monaco received $20,000 per month in connection with his or her work on behalf of the Special Committee of the Board formed in connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Company. The Special Committee was chaired by Ms.\u00a0Higgins, who received an additional $5,000 per month for serving as the Chair. Additionally, during Fiscal 2012, Messrs. Campbell, Golden and Wilson and Ms.\u00a0Higgins received $20,000 per month in connection with his or her work on behalf of the Special Sub Committee of the Special Committee of the Board formed to consider certain matters relating to the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Company. The Special Sub Committee was chaired by Ms.\u00a0Higgins, who received an additional $5,000 per month for serving as the Chair., 990751=The Compensation Committee may provide that an award shall be cancelled if the participant, without the consent of the Company, while employed by or providing services to the Company or any affiliate of the Company or after termination of such employment or service, (a)\u00a0violates a non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement, (b)\u00a0otherwise engages in activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interest of the Company or any of its affiliates, including fraud, or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion or (c)\u00a0otherwise violates any policy adopted by the Company or any of its affiliates relating to the recovery of compensation granted, paid, delivered, awarded or otherwise provided to any participant by the Company or any of its affiliates as such policy is in effect on the date of grant of the applicable award or, to the extent necessary to address the requirements of applicable law (including Section\u00a0954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified in Section\u00a010D of the Exchange Act, Section\u00a0304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other applicable law), as may be amended from time to time. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may also provide that (i)\u00a0a participant will forfeit any gain realized on the vesting or exercise of such award if the participant engages in such activities referred to in the preceding sentence, or (ii)\u00a0a participant must repay the gain to the Company realized under a previously paid performance award if a financial restatement reduces the amount that would have been earned under such performance award., 57598=At the Meeting, two directors will be elected. William Dillard, II and Patricia L. Higgins are the Board\u0092s nominees for election as directors at the Meeting, each to hold office for a term of three years until the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2015 and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Each of the nominees has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve on the Board, if elected. However, if any nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve, proxies may be voted for a substitute designated by the Board., 941279=All Other Fees.\u00a0\u00a0The Company did not pay to BDO any other fees in Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011., 388644=Under certain circumstances, the Compensation Committee may deem it appropriate to award discretionary bonuses to certain named executive officers. Following the Compensation Committee\u0092s conclusion that the minimum Adjusted EBITDA performance level was not achieved for Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee considered factors that contributed to the actual Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2012, including costs associated with the ongoing review of strategic alternatives and legal and other costs (including the time and attention of management) attendant to the Microsoft transaction and the Liberty transaction as well as significant new product launches. The Compensation Committee determined that all these items were substantially outside of the control of the named executive officers and, in fact, required the named executive officers to assume additional responsibilities and address unexpected challenges. The Compensation Committee also determined that the accomplishment of the Company\u0092s strategic objectives during Fiscal 2012 and the operational challenges it faced represented extraordinary work for the named executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee noted that the named executive officers had taken important action during the year, and accomplished significant positive results, relating to, among other things, the Microsoft transaction and the Liberty transaction and the long-term strategy of the NOOK\u0099 and the Company\u0092s digital business and corporate retention which favored the Company\u0092s long-term global strategy and stockholder value creation, but which had a negative impact on the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2012 Adjusted EBITDA. Taking into account these factors, the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to grant each of the named executive officers a special discretionary bonus in an amount equivalent to what such executive would have received had the Adjusted EBITDA component of his or her performance-based annual incentive compensation award been paid out at the 25%-of-target incentive level., 955585=The maximum number of shares of the Company\u0092s common stock available for grant under the Incentive Plan is 1,700,000, plus shares that remain available under the Prior 2009 Plan on the effective date of the Incentive Plan. Any stock that is the subject of an award under the Incentive Plan, including the shares issuable under the Prior 2009 Plan, shall be counted against the limit as one share for every share issued., 944372=In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board subsequently approved) that the Company\u0092s audited financial statements and management\u0092s report on internal controls be included in the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC., 256319=Set forth below is a chart showing target and maximum annual performance-based incentive compensation for each of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio for Fiscal 2012. For Fiscal 2012, the Company\u0092s actual Adjusted EBITDA was less than the minimum performance level of 84% of the Adjusted EBITDA target. Accordingly, Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio did not receive performance-based annual incentive compensation for Fiscal 2012., 415459=In addition, taking into account the competitive analysis of Cook\u00a0& Co., on November\u00a015, 2011, the Compensation Committee granted the following stock options awards: to Ms.\u00a0Keating, 35,000 stock options; to Mr.\u00a0Carey, 50,000 stock options and to Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom, 35,000 stock options. The grants to Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating vest in the following three installments: 25% vests upon the second anniversary of the grant date, 25% vests upon the third anniversary of the grant date and 50% vests upon the fourth anniversary of the grant date., 622079=Fiscal 2012 Compensation for Messrs. Lombardi, Huseby and Lindstrom, Fiscal 2012 Chief Financial Officers, 35024=If you hold your shares in \u0093street name\u0094, i.e., through a bank, broker or other holder of record (a \u0093custodian\u0094), your custodian is required to vote your shares on your behalf in accordance with your instructions.

Pursuant to his employment agreement, as described further below, Mr.\u00a0Huseby is entitled to an annual bonus for Fiscal 2013, which is guaranteed at 150% of his annual base salary. During the negotiation of Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee determined that, as the Company deemed Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s extensive experience and knowledge integral to the future execution of its complex global strategy, in order to induce Mr.\u00a0Huseby to join the Company and also in light of certain foregone benefits, the guaranteed bonus was appropriate., 939892=Audit Fees.\u00a0\u00a0For Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, the Company was billed $1,664,147 and $1,579,500, respectively, by BDO for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company\u0092s annual financial statements and of its internal controls over financial reporting and for reviews of the Company\u0092s financial statements included in the Company\u0092s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC., 32586=If you are a registered holder of Common Stock (including unvested restricted stock), you may vote your shares either by voting by proxy in advance of the Meeting or by voting in person at the Meeting. By submitting a proxy, you are legally authorizing another person to vote your shares on your behalf. We urge you to use the enclosed proxy card to vote FOR the Board\u0092s nominees, FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company\u0092s named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, FOR the approval of the amended and restated 2009 incentive plan and FOR the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as independent registered public accountants for the Company\u0092s fiscal year ending April\u00a027, 2013. If you submit your executed proxy card, but you do not indicate how your shares are to be voted, then your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board\u0092s recommendations set forth in this Proxy Statement.

This process included a review of the Company\u0092s compensation programs for our employees, including non-executive officers; the identification and review of features of our compensation programs that could potentially encourage excessive or imprudent risk taking of a material nature; and the identification and review of factors that mitigate these risks. Based on the results of the risk assessment conducted in early Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee noted several risk-mitigating features and effective safeguards against imprudent or unnecessary risk-taking, including:, 130425=The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock, as of June\u00a030, 2012, by each person known by the Company to own beneficially more than five percent of the Company\u0092s outstanding Common Stock, by each director, by each director nominee, by each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table and by all directors and executive officers of the Company as a group.

Lynch, Klipper and Riggio. Each of these named executive officers has extensive responsibility within the Company and performs duties that significantly affect the Company\u0092s overall performance and value. Therefore, each such executive\u0092s incentive compensation payment is entirely measured with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, with no individual performance components taken into consideration.

The independent registered public accountants examine annual financial statements and provide other non-audit and tax-related services for the Company. The Company and the Audit Committee have considered whether the non-audit services provided by BDO are compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO in its audit of the Company and have determined that, because such services are not considered prohibited services under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, such services are compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO., 622308=As mentioned above, during Fiscal 2012, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi resigned as the Company\u0092s Chief Financial Officer, effective October\u00a021, 2011. Under the terms of the Lombardi Transition Agreement, as described further\u00a0below, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi was not eligible for any significant severance payments in connection with his resignation and his employment with the Company ended effective June\u00a030, 2012. On October\u00a021, 2011 the Board appointed\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom to serve as interim Chief Financial Officer while the Company conducted its search for a new Chief Financial Officer. Prior to his appointment, Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom had been the Vice President, Corporate Controller of the Company since November 2007. The Company did not enter into or amended any existing plans, contracts or arrangements with Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom as a result of his temporary position as Chief Financial Officer, therefore the compensation as disclosed above in the Summary Compensation Table reflects the compensation agreed to with Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom in connection with his ongoing role as the Vice President, Corporate\u00a0Controller of the Company. In light of additional responsibilities the Compensation Committee did increase his base salary. Mr.\u00a0Huseby joined the Company as the new Chief Financial Officer, effective March\u00a013,\u00a02012. With respect to Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the market median chief financial officer-level compensation for companies according to information based on Competitive Survey Data presented to the Compensation Committee members, as well as the compensation paid\u00a0to him by his prior employer. In addition, because Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s compensation was determined during the negotiation process, the Compensation Committee made certain determinations specifically to induce Mr.\u00a0Huseby to accept the role of the Company\u0092s Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to his employment agreement,\u00a0as discussed further below, Mr.\u00a0Huseby was granted 275,000 restricted stock units under his employment agreement, which vest as follows: 50% vest upon the second anniversary of the grant date and 50%\u00a0vests upon the third anniversary of the grant date, or, immediately upon the occurrence of a change of control, in the event Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s employment is terminated by the Company for \u0093cause\u0094 or by him for \u0093good\u00a0reason\u0094., 123069=Michael P.

Prior to joining Cablevision, Mr.\u00a0Huseby served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Charter Communications, Inc., the fourth largest cable operator in the U.S. From 1999 to 2002, Mr.\u00a0Huseby served as Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, of AT&T Broadband, a provider of cable television services. In addition, Mr.\u00a0Huseby spent over 23 years at Arthur Andersen, LLP and Andersen Worldwide, S.C., where he held the position of Global Equity Partner., 197240=Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating do not have employment agreements with the Company and their compensation has been largely determined by their respective job responsibilities. In determining the compensation for Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, the Compensation Committee considered the median compensation for their respective roles according to market information based on Competitive Survey Data presented to the Compensation Committee members. During Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee decided to increase Mr.\u00a0Lindstom\u0092s base salary because his responsibilities, both in connection with his temporary role as interim Chief Financial Officer and on an ongoing basis, increased in Fiscal 2012. With regard to Ms.\u00a0Keating, the Compensation Committee also considered that she had significant job responsibilities that were in addition to her role in managing the Company\u0092s retail business., 1053713=In addition, the Company\u0092s Bylaws provide that, in order for a stockholder to propose business for consideration at such meeting, such stockholder must deliver written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 40 days\u0092 notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given to stockholders, notice by the stockholder must be given not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such notice must contain the proposing stockholder\u0092s record name and address, and the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by such stockholder. Such notice must also contain: (a)\u00a0a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (b)\u00a0any material interest of the proposing stockholder in such business. Similar notice must be given with respect to any stockholder nominees for director. Accordingly, the business of the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013 shall not include voting on any stockholder nominee or proposal if proper notice as to such nominee or proposal is not properly delivered to the Company in accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws., 925032=In Fiscal 2010, the Company entered into an Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement with LR Enterprises Management LLC (\u0093LR Enterprises\u0094), which is owned by Leonard Riggio and Louise Riggio, pursuant to which LR Enterprises granted the Company the right to use a jet aircraft owned by it on a time-sharing basis in accordance with, and subject to the reimbursement of certain operating costs and expenses as provided in, the Federal Aviation Regulations (\u0093FAR\u0094). Such operating costs were $1,015,000, $932,000 and $429,000 during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. LR Enterprises is solely responsible for the physical and technical operation of the aircraft, aircraft maintenance and the cost of maintaining aircraft liability insurance, other than insurance obtained for the specific flight as requested by the Company, as provided in the FAR. Prior to the Acquisition, the Company used a jet aircraft owned by B&N College and paid for the costs and expenses of operating the aircraft based upon the Company\u0092s usage. Such costs which included fuel, insurance and other costs were $113,000 during Fiscal 2010 prior to the Acquisition, and were included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations., 179082=During Fiscal 2012, the Company made several key strategic steps and accomplished several critical strategic goals. The Company\u0092s management team was critical in steering the Company through retention and pricing challenges and maneuvering the Company into a stronger competitive position. Despite the fact that the Company\u0092s achievement of consolidated EBITDA (subject to certain adjustments, as described below) was below the level that would result in payouts to the named executive officers under the Company\u0092s incentive compensation plans, as discussed below, the Company achieved significant strategic progress during the year. Through the Liberty transaction and the Microsoft transaction, the Company is now better positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth of the NOOK\u0099 business (references to NOOK\u0099 include the Company\u0092s NOOK 1st Edition\u0099, NOOK Wi-Fi 1st Edition\u0099, NOOK Simple Touch\u0099, NOOK Tablet\u0099, NOOK Color\u0099, NOOK Simple Touch with GlowLight\u0099 and The All-New NOOK\u0099 eBook Reader devices), and to solidify its position as a leader in the rapidly growing market for digital content in the consumer and education segments. Furthermore, during Fiscal 2012, both the retail and college businesses substantially exceeded financial expectations and performance goals. The Compensation Committee carefully considered these achievements and challenges the Company faced in Fiscal 2012 in order to ensure that the compensation program would adequately reflect the Company\u0092s compensation principles., 878826=In Fiscal 2012, Cook\u00a0& Co. reviewed the design and competitiveness of the Company\u0092s non-employee director compensation program. Cook\u00a0& Co. estimated that the Company\u0092s director compensation was below the 25th percentile of the practice among the New Peer Group due to low annual cash retainer and equity award levels. In light of this analysis, and in consideration for the additional work being done by directors in connection with certain corporate transactions, Cook\u00a0& Co. recommended that cash retainers and equity award values be increased by approximately 18%, as well as increases for certain committee chairs. However, the Company did not make these recommended changes during Fiscal 2012, but the Compensation Committee decided to reconsider the recommendations in Fiscal 2013. In Fiscal 2012, Cook\u00a0& Co. also recommended that, in order to align with the New Peer Group, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vest after one year, rather than over a three-year period. Taking into account this recommendation, in Fiscal 2012 the Compensation Committee adopted a policy that restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for 2012 and all future awards to non-employee directors as compensation for their service as directors will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date., 240028=In addition to a base salary, in Fiscal 2012, each of the named executive officers (other than Messrs. Huseby and Lombardi) was granted an award of performance-based annual incentive compensation under either the Company\u0092s stockholder approved 2009 Incentive Plan, in the case of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio, or the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2012, in the case of Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating. The performance-based annual incentive compensation is earned based upon a corporate performance target of consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted as described below, and, in the case of Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, certain individual performance targets. Generally, the Compensation Committee sets performance targets for performance-based annual incentive compensation so that the relative difficulty of achieving the targets is consistent from year to year., 241104=The corporate performance target is based on \u0093Adjusted EBITDA,\u0094* which is EBITDA as reported in the Company\u0092s audited financial statements with certain adjustments relating to expenses incurred in connection with proxy contests, derivative litigation and the strategic alternative process. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee established a target level of Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $250 million. Adjusted EBITDA was chosen as the Company-wide performance metric in order to incentivize the named executive officers to work together to advance the Company\u0092s continuing efforts to integrate its operations as a multi-channel retailer in order to realize operational efficiencies and to provide a superior and seamless experience for customers., 940948=Tax Fees.\u00a0\u00a0In Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, the Company was billed $241,967 and $219,698, by BDO for services related to tax compliance and consultation on tax matters, respectively., 746561=Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal 2012, 31267=Only holders of record of the Company\u0092s Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (\u0093Common Stock\u0094), as of the close of business on July\u00a018, 2012 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting. As of the record date, 59,930,458 shares of Common Stock were outstanding, which number includes 1,155,102 shares of unvested restricted stock that have voting rights and that are held by members of the Board and the Company\u0092s employees. Each share of Common Stock entitles the record holder thereof to one vote on each matter brought before the Meeting., 127927=Michelle Smith became Vice President of Human Resources of the Company in November 1996. Ms.\u00a0Smith joined the Company in September 1993 as Director of Human Resources. Ms.\u00a0Smith is a member of the Society for Human Resource Management and serves on the National Retail Federation\u0092s Committee on Employment Law., 733623=25% on 05/23/2013, 25% on 05/23/2014 and, 30461=The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of the Board\u0092s nominees, FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company\u0092s named executive officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement, FOR the approval of the amended and restated 2009 incentive plan and FOR the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as independent registered public accountants for the Company\u0092s fiscal year ending April\u00a027, 2013., 634215=Further, if the employment of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby or Klipper is terminated by the Company without \u0093cause\u0094 or by such named executive officer for \u0093good reason\u0094 within two years (or, if applicable, the remainder of the named executive officer\u0092s term of employment under his employment agreement, whichever is longer) following a \u0093change of control\u0094 of the Company, such named executive officer is entitled, regardless of whether he signs a release of claims against the Company, to lump-sum severance equal to three times the sum of (a)\u00a0annual base salary, (b)\u00a0the average annual incentive compensation paid (or, in the case of Mr.\u00a0Huseby, guaranteed) to the named executive officer with respect to the preceding three completed years (or, in the case of Mr.\u00a0Lynch, such lesser number of completed years beginning in February 2009 and ending on the date of termination, or, in the case of Mr.\u00a0Huseby, such number of completed years beginning on March\u00a013, 2012 and ending on the date of termination) and (c)\u00a0the cost of benefits. However, if such severance payments trigger the \u0093golden parachute\u0094 excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, they would be reduced if such reduction would result in a greater after-tax benefit to the named executive officer., 1058997=BARNES\u00a0& NOBLE, INC., a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, together with any successor thereto (the \u0093Company\u0094), hereby establishes and adopts the following Amended and Restated 2009 Incentive Plan (the \u0093Plan\u0094). Certain capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Article 2. The Plan is intended to replace the 2009 Incentive Plan prior to its amendment and restatement (the \u0093Prior 2009 Plan\u0094), which shall be automatically terminated and replaced and superseded by the Plan on the effective date of the Plan. The Prior 2009 Plan previously replaced and superseded the 2004 Incentive Plan, as amended, which replaced and superseded the 1996 Incentive Plan, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any awards granted under the Prior Plans (as defined below) shall remain in effect pursuant to their respective terms., 550568=The following Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table accompanies the Summary Compensation Table and provides additional detail regarding grants of plan-based awards (such as equity award grants of restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units and grants of cash-based performance units under the 2009 Incentive Plan and incentive compensation awards under the Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2012) during Fiscal 2012., 174683=The Company is the world\u0092s premier destination for books, eBooks, magazines, toys\u00a0& games, music, DVD and Blu-ray, video games, and related products and services and, taking advantage of vast warehouses across the United States, the Company stocks over 1\u00a0million titles for immediate delivery\u0097more than any other online bookseller.

The Company serves approximately 40\u00a0million customers and, as of April\u00a028, 2012, employed approximately 35,000 full- and part-time employees. The Company\u0092s compensation program seeks to attract, incentivize and retain individuals who possess the unique skills, experience and knowledge to implement the Company\u0092s complex global strategy. The Company\u0092s compensation program for the named executive officers is structured to implement the following guiding principles:, 68407=Qualifications, Experience, Attributes and Skills.

In addition, Mr.\u00a0Carleton services on other public company boards has provided him with a number of skills, including leadership development and succession planning, risk assessment, and shareholder and government relations., 400944=Set forth below is a chart showing the total bonus payments made to each named executive officer for Fiscal 2012, which in the case of each of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio, is comprised of discretionary payments and, in the case of each of Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, is comprised of a combination of discretionary and plan-based incentive compensation payments, and the total bonus payment as a percentage of base salary for each such executive., 235792=The relative mix of compensation among the elements is designed to strike a long-term balance between rewarding annual performance in a competitive marketplace and aligning the long-term interests of the Company\u0092s named executive officers with those of the Company\u0092s stockholders. For Fiscal 2012, the relative mix of compensation for the named executive officers was generally slightly skewed toward long-term equity due to awards granted for retention purposes, as discussed below., 86074=Compensation Committee. The principal function of the Compensation Committee is to review and approve the compensation and employment arrangements for the Company\u0092s executive officers. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for administering various compensation plans of the Company.

For Fiscal 2012, the Company\u0092s actual Adjusted EBITDA was less than the minimum performance level of 84% of the Adjusted EBITDA target. Accordingly, each of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio did not receive performance-based annual incentive compensation for Fiscal 2012, as described in the \u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0097Key Elements of Compensation, Performance-Based Annual Incentive Compensation, Performance Units\u0094 section of this Proxy Statement, because their performance units were based only on the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA.

Accordingly, Mr.\u00a0Carey did not receive the portion (25%)\u00a0of his performance-based annual incentive compensation that is based on Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2012. However, based on the achievement of his individual performance components, Mr.\u00a0Carey did receive the portion (75%)\u00a0of his performance-based annual incentive compensation that is based on his individual performance targets. Set forth below is a chart showing (i)\u00a0the target and maximum annual performance-based incentive compensation for Mr.\u00a0Carey for the portions of his incentive compensation that are based on Adjusted EBITDA and his individual performance targets and (ii)\u00a0the actual level of achievement and payment for each annual performance-based incentive compensation target for Mr.\u00a0Carey for Fiscal 2012., 1049256=To the Company\u0092s knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons (or counsel to such reporting persons) that no additional forms were required, all filing requirements applicable to its executive officers, Directors and greater than 10-percent stockholders have been complied with during Fiscal 2012., 854471=For the table above, the amounts of potential payments to the named executive officers in the event of the termination of their employment were calculated assuming that such terminations occurred on the last day of Fiscal 2012 (April 28, 2012). For the table above, the amount of potential payments to the named executive officers in the event of a termination of their employment in connection with a change of control were calculated assuming that a change of control occurred on the last day of Fiscal 2012, each named executive officer\u0092s employment terminated on that date due to involuntary termination or for good reason and the successor company did not assume the named executive officer\u0092s restricted stock, stock option and restricted stock unit awards., 126344=Eugene V.

MBS paid B&N College $10,941,000, $13,031,000 and $7,014,000 related to these commissions in Fiscal 2012, the fiscal year ended April\u00a030, 2011 (\u0093Fiscal 2011\u0094) and Fiscal 2010 from the date of Acquisition, respectively. In addition, the Supply Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of B&N College and the Company to become a used textbook wholesaler and that place certain limitations on MBS\u0092s business activities. B&N College and Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com also entered into an agreement with MBS in Fiscal 2011 pursuant to which MBS agrees to purchase at the end of a given semester certain agreed upon textbooks which B&N College and Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com shall have rented to students during such semester. Total sales to MBS under this program were $13,339,000 and $506,000 for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. In addition, B&N College entered into an agreement with MBS in Fiscal 2011 pursuant to which MBS purchases books from B&N College, which have no resale value for a flat rate per box. Total sales to MBS under this program were $364,000 and $427,000 for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively., 194101=A portion of the compensation of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper, Lombardi and Riggio in Fiscal 2012 was based on the terms and conditions of their employment agreements. Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Lombardi\u0092s agreements were executed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, Mr.\u00a0Riggio\u0092s agreement was executed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2011 and Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s agreement was executed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012. In determining the compensation provided in Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median of chief executive officer-level compensation in both the Retail Peer Group and the Technology Peer Group. With respect to Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median chief financial officer-level compensation for companies according to market information based on Competitive Survey Data presented to the Compensation Committee members, as, 921013=In Fiscal 2010, the Company\u0092s wholly owned subsidiary Barnes\u00a0& Noble Bookquest LLC (\u0093Bookquest\u0094) entered into an agreement with TXTB.com LLC (\u0093TXTB\u0094), a subsidiary of MBS, pursuant to which the marketplace database of third party sellers on the Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com website was made available on the TXTB website. In Fiscal 2012, Bookquest was merged into Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com. Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com receives a fee from third party sellers for sales of marketplace items and, upon receipt of such fee, Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com remits a separate fee to TXTB for any marketplace items sold on the TXTB website. Total commissions paid to TXTB were $559,000, $775,000 and $0 during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. Outstanding amounts payable to TXTB were $6,000, $8,000 and $33,000 for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively., 46259=The Board currently consists of ten directors. Eight of the directors are divided into three classes, currently consisting of three members whose terms expire upon the election and qualification of their successors at the Meeting, three members whose terms expire at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders and two members whose terms expire at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders. Two directors are elected solely by the\u00a0holders of Series J Preferred Stock of the Company (currently, Liberty GIC, Inc. (\u0093Liberty\u0094)), voting as a separate class. At such time as Liberty and its affiliates hold at least 76,500 but less than 127,500 shares of Series\u00a0J Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect only one director. At such time as Liberty and its affiliates hold less than 76,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall cease to have the right to elect directors. Currently, Liberty owns 204,000 shares of the Series J Preferred Stock. In accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws, the Board reduced its size from ten to nine directors with no vacancies effective immediately before the Meeting, with such reduction being in the class of directors with terms expiring upon the\u00a0election and qualification of their successors at the Meeting. The Board unanimously recommends using the enclosed proxy card to vote FOR each of the Board\u0092s two nominees for director., 268399=Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating are responsible for more focused areas of the Company\u0092s business. For that reason, each of these executives participated in the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2012 and received an incentive compensation award with performance targets based on Company performance and individual performance. The Compensation Committee set a target annual incentive for each of these executives based on the scope of each executive\u0092s duties and respective individual capacity to affect the overall performance of the Company. For Fiscal 2012, 25% of each executive\u0092s incentive compensation was based on the Adjusted EBITDA corporate performance target and 75% was based on such executive\u0092s individual performance targets. The Compensation Committee believes that it is important for a portion of all executives\u0092 annual incentives to be tied to Company performance, but that, below the top senior executives, the majority of executives\u0092 annual incentives should be based on business segment goals and/or individual objectives that are most relevant for their roles. As discussed previously, Adjusted EBITDA was chosen to represent Company performance., 245544=stockholders. For Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee set the amount payable upon the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA according to a sliding scale based on a designated percentage of base salary. The sliding scale provided for no incentive compensation payout if the Company achieved less than 84% of the target and for a maximum incentive compensation payout, as more fully described below, if the Company achieved 115% or more of the target., 1028107=The following table lists each person named in the Summary Compensation Table, all current executive officers as a group, all current directors who are not executive officers as a group, each nominee for election as a director, each associate of the foregoing persons, each other person who has received or is to receive five percent or more of the aggregate options under the Incentive Plan and the Prior 2009 Plan, and all current employees (including all current officers who are not executive officers) as a group, indicating, as of April\u00a028, 2012, the aggregate number of options granted under the Incentive Plan and the Prior 2009 Plan to each of the foregoing since the inception of the Prior 2009 Plan. The fair market value per share of our common stock on July\u00a018, 2012 was $15.26., 733784=50% on 05/23/2015, 951159=Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board has approved, subject to the approval of the Company\u0092s stockholders, the Barnes\u00a0& Noble, Inc. Amended and Restated 2009 Incentive Plan (the \u0093Incentive Plan\u0094) and directed that it be submitted, with the Board\u0092s recommendation, to the Company\u0092s stockholders for approval at the Meeting. The Company desires to encourage high levels of performance by those individuals who are key to the success of the Company, to attract new individuals who are highly motivated and who are expected to contribute to the success of the Company and to encourage such individuals to remain as directors, employees, consultants and/or advisors of the Company and its affiliates by increasing their proprietary interest in the Company\u0092s growth and success. To attain these ends, the Company has formulated the Incentive Plan to authorize the granting of awards (as described below) to participants whose judgment, initiative and efforts are, have been, or are expected to be, responsible for the success of the Company., 430786=None of the members of the Compensation Committee has ever been an employee of the Company, and none of them had a relationship requiring disclosure in this Proxy Statement under Item\u00a0404 of SEC Regulation S-K. See \u0093Meetings and Committees of the Board\u0097Compensation Committee\u0094. None of the Company\u0092s executive officers serves, or in Fiscal 2012 served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of the Company\u0092s Board or the Company\u0092s Compensation Committee., 882974=Each non-employee director is eligible for equity award grants under the Company\u0092s 2009 Incentive Plan. The table below illustrates the fair market value of the Fiscal 2012 restricted stock awards on the date of grant and the aggregate number of awards outstanding at fiscal year end for each non-employee director., 1052511=The Company\u0092s Annual Report for Fiscal 2012, including financial statements, is being sent to stockholders together with this Proxy Statement., 237398=The Compensation Committee usually establishes base salaries of the named executive officers by the end of the first quarter of each fiscal year. In Fiscal 2012, taking into account the competitive analysis conducted by Cook\u00a0& Co. of the named executive officer base salary levels in the New Peer Group, the Compensation Committee approved the following merit-based base salary increases: for Mr.\u00a0Lynch, an increase from $900,000 to $1,200,000, for Mr.\u00a0Klipper, an increase from $900,000 to $927,000 and for Mr.\u00a0Carey, an increase from $468,000 to $500,000. Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s salary was increased by $300,000 because it is critical to the Company to retain Mr.\u00a0Lynch given his role in the Company\u0092s digital strategy and the importance of his significant experience in the technology sector to the Company. Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom received a base salary increase from $325,000 to $400,000 in connection with his temporary promotion to Interim Chief Financial Officer; this increase remained in effect even after Mr.\u00a0Huseby was hired because of additional responsibilities Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom assumed during his temporary role and has subsequently retained, including tax and risk management responsibilities. The Compensation Committee determined not to grant Ms.\u00a0Keating a base salary increase because she received a base salary increase in Fiscal 2011. Mr.\u00a0Lombardi did not receive an increase in his base salary in light of his decision to resign., 912484=August\u00a07, 2009 among the Company and the Sellers (the \u0093Purchase Agreement\u0094). As part of the Acquisition, the Company acquired the Barnes\u00a0& Noble trade name that had been owned by B&N College and licensed to the Company (described below). The purchase price paid to the Sellers was $596,000,000, consisting of $346,000,000 in cash and $250,000,000 in Seller Notes (described below). However, the cash paid to the Sellers was reduced by approximately $82,352,000 in cash bonuses paid by B&N College to 192 members of its management team and employees (the \u0093Bonus Recipients\u0094), not including Leonard Riggio. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, prior to the closing of the Acquisition, B&N College distributed to the Sellers certain assets that are not related to B&N College\u0092s core business, including common stock in the Company.\u00a0In connection with such distribution, 667,058 shares of the common stock in the Company previously held by B&N College were transferred to certain of the Bonus Recipients. The Company financed the Acquisition through $250,000,000 of Seller Notes, $150,000,000 from the Company\u0092s credit facility dated September\u00a030, 2009 (the \u00932009 Credit Facility\u0094) and the remainder from both the Company\u0092s and B&N College\u0092s cash on hand., 61074=Patricia L.

The Lombardi Transition Agreement provides that Mr.\u00a0Lombardi continued to be eligible for the compensation and benefits provided under his employment agreement through June\u00a030, 2012, but he was not eligible for any annual bonus compensation after Fiscal 2011. Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s outstanding equity-based awards continued to vest in accordance with their terms until June\u00a030, 2012. Pursuant to the Lombardi Transition Agreement, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi was no longer entitled to severance benefits and the termination of Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s employment upon June\u00a030, 2012 did not constitute a termination either by the Company without \u0093cause\u0094 or by Mr.\u00a0Lombardi for \u0093good reason.\u0094 Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s resignation as an Employee was effective June\u00a030, 2012, therefore the compensation provisions of his employment agreement, which were similar to those contained in the employment agreements of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper and Riggio, are no longer applicable. However, Mr.\u00a0Lombardi continues to be subject to certain restrictive covenants regarding competition, solicitation, confidentiality and disparagement. The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants will apply for a two-year period following his resignation, and the confidentiality and non-disparagement covenants apply indefinitely., 1084799=3.1.

Total purchases were $101,980,000, $102,573,000 and $24,186,000 for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. MBS sells used books through the Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com dealer network.

In addition, Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com hosts pages on its website through which Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com customers are able to sell used books directly to MBS. Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com is paid a fixed commission on the price paid by MBS to the customer. Total commissions paid to Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com were $160,000, $184,000 and $172,000 for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively., 200293=Set forth below is a chart showing the Fiscal 2011 compensation by element and target total compensation for Messrs.\u00a0Lynch, Klipper and Lombardi and Ms.\u00a0Keating relative to the New Peer Group based on compensation paid by members of the New Peer Group for 2010. For Mr.\u00a0Lynch, the pay percentiles provided below are based on median chief executive officer-level compensation for companies in the New Peer Group. For Messrs. Klipper, Lombardi and Ms.\u00a0Keating, the pay percentiles provided below are based on a comparison against counterpart executives within the New Peer Group according to the descending order of their target total direct compensation, as shown in the chart. The competitive analysis did not examine the compensation of Messrs. Huseby, Carey, Lindstrom or Riggio because the analysis only reviewed the compensation of (i)\u00a0individuals who were considered likely to be disclosed as named executive officers for Fiscal 2011 based on position or compensation levels and (ii)\u00a0individuals who were executives of the Company\u0092s digital business., 922664=Prior to the Acquisition, the Company licensed the \u0093Barnes\u00a0& Noble\u0094 name under a royalty-free license agreement dated February\u00a011, 1987, as amended, from B&N College.

Pursuant to the License Agreement, Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com had been granted an exclusive license to use the \u0093Barnes\u00a0& Noble\u0094 name and trademark in perpetuity for the purpose of selling books over the Internet (excluding sales of college textbooks). Under a separate agreement dated as of January\u00a031, 2001 (the \u0093Textbook License Agreement\u0094), between Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com, B&N College and Textbooks.com, Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com was granted the right to sell college textbooks over the Internet using the \u0093Barnes\u00a0& Noble\u0094 name. Pursuant to the Textbook License Agreement, Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com paid Textbooks.com a royalty on revenues (net of product returns, applicable sales tax and excluding shipping and handling) realized by Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com from the sale of books designated as textbooks. Royalty expense was $3,431,000 during Fiscal 2010 prior to the Acquisition, under the terms of the Textbook License Agreement.

In addition, the Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of confidential and anonymous complaints regarding the Company\u0092s accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters. The Board has adopted a written charter setting out these functions of the Audit Committee, a copy of which is available on the Company\u0092s website at www.barnesandnobleinc.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it in writing to the Company\u0092s Corporate Secretary, Barnes\u00a0& Noble, Inc., 122 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10011. From October 2011, the members of the Audit Committee were, and currently are, Dr.\u00a0Wilson (Chair), Mr.\u00a0Golden and Ms.\u00a0Higgins. From the beginning of Fiscal 2012 through October 2011, the members of the Audit Committee were Ms.\u00a0Higgins (Chair), Dr.\u00a0Wilson and Margaret T. Monaco. In addition to meeting the independence standards of the NYSE, each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and meets the independence standards established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094). The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee has the requisite attributes of an \u0093audit committee financial expert\u0094 as defined by regulations promulgated by the SEC and that such attributes were acquired through relevant education and/or experience. The Audit Committee met 13 times during Fiscal 2012.

The Retirement Plan is a defined benefit pension plan. As of January\u00a01, 2000, the Retirement Plan was amended so that employees no longer earn benefits for subsequent service. The Retirement Plan was frozen to reduce financial volatility and transition the Company\u0092s employees to a more customary defined contribution plan. Subsequent service continues to be the basis for vesting of benefits not yet vested at December\u00a031, 1999, and the Retirement Plan will continue to hold assets and pay benefits., 1001378=The following table provides information about stock option awards outstanding and shares of Company common stock available for future awards under all of the Company\u0092s equity compensation plans as of April\u00a028, 2012., 419700=Each of the named executive officers is entitled to participate in the Company\u0092s tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan on the same basis as all other eligible employees. The 401(k) plan provides the Company\u0092s named executive officers and other employees with a means for accumulating tax-deferred savings for retirement purposes. The Company matches the contributions of participants, subject to certain criteria. Under the terms of the 401(k) plan, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094), the contribution of any participating employee is limited to the lesser of 75% of annual salary before taxes or a maximum dollar amount ($17,000 for 2012), subject to a $5,500 increase for participants who are age 50 or older. The amount of the Company\u0092s matching payments for each of the named executive officers is set forth in Note 7 to the Summary Compensation Table., 38900=The proposal to approve the amended and restated 2009 incentive plan will require, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter in person or by proxy at the Meeting, provided that the total votes cast on the matter represents more than 50% in interest of all shares entitled to vote thereon., 1080306=2.27. \u0093Prior Plans\u0094 shall mean, collectively, the Company\u0092s 1996 Incentive Plan, as amended, the Company\u0092s 2004 Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Prior 2009 Plan., 40819=With respect to the proposal to approve the amended and restated 2009 incentive plan, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the matter. \u0093Broker non-votes\u0094 will not be considered as votes cast with respect to this proposal and so will have no effect on the vote, unless they result in a failure to obtain total votes cast of more than 50% of the shares entitled to vote. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote shares on this proposal without direction from the beneficial owner., 780914=For purposes of the Retirement Plan, pay is the sum of the participant\u0092s base compensation, overtime, incentive compensation and commissions. Pay under the Retirement Plan does not include any amounts paid on or after January\u00a01, 2000, and is limited to the maximum amount permitted under the Code for 1999 ($160,000) and previous years., 1050097=As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company does not intend to present any business for action at the Meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement, and the Company has not been notified of any stockholder proposals intended to be raised at the Meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement. It is nonetheless possible that stockholders may seek to raise a proposal at the Meeting that is not described in this Proxy Statement by notifying the Company of such proposal in accordance with the Company\u0092s Bylaws.

In addition, because Mr.\u00a0Huseby\u0092s compensation was determined during the negotiation process, the Compensation Committee made certain determinations specifically to induce Mr.\u00a0Huseby to accept the role of the Company\u0092s Chief Financial Officer. In determining the compensation provided in Mr.\u00a0Klipper\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median compensation of both Retail Peer Group chief operating officers and the-second-highest paid executive in each Retail Peer Group company. With regard to the compensation provided in Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s employment agreement, the Compensation Committee considered the market median chief financial officer-level compensation for companies in the Retail Peer Group. Mr.\u00a0Lombardi\u0092s compensation in Fiscal 2012 was also affected by his decision to resign and the terms and conditions of the Lombardi Transition Agreement, which limited his Fiscal 2012 compensation to his base salary, certain benefits and the vesting of his equity awards, as discussed further below. With regard to Messrs. Lynch and Riggio, the Compensation Committee also considered that each executive had significant job responsibilities that were in addition to their roles in managing the Company\u0092s retail business. With regard to Mr.\u00a0Lombardi, prior to his resignation, the Compensation Committee considered the significance of his job responsibilities in determining his compensation in addition to the terms and conditions of his employment agreement., 16443=July\u00a023, 2012, 76324=Irene R.

Klipper has been the Chief Executive Officer of the Company\u0092s retail group since March 2010. Since February 2002, he was the Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Prior to that, he was the President of Barnes\u00a0& Noble Development, the group responsible for selecting, designing and constructing new store locations, and an Executive Vice President of the Company from December 1995 to February 2002., 432152=The following Summary Compensation Table sets forth information concerning the total compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to the Company\u0092s Chief Executive Officer, current, former and interim Chief Financial Officers and four most highly compensated executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer and current, former and interim Chief Financial Officers, for the fiscal year ended April\u00a028, 2012. This Summary Compensation Table is accompanied by an All Other Compensation Table, a Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and additional narrative discussion as necessary to assist in the understanding of the information presented in each of such tables., 952988=The Incentive Plan is intended to replace the Company\u0092s stockholder-approved 2009 Incentive Plan that is currently in effect (the \u0093Prior 2009 Plan\u0094), which will be automatically terminated and replaced and superseded by the Incentive Plan on the effective date of the Incentive Plan. The Prior 2009 Plan previously replaced and superseded the 2004 Incentive Plan (the \u00932004 Plan\u0094), as amended, which replaced and superseded the 1996 Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u00931996 Plan,\u0094 and together with the Prior 2009 Plan and the 2004 Plan, the \u0093Prior Plans\u0094). Any awards granted under any of the Prior Plans will remain in effect pursuant to their respective terms., 412915=As mentioned above, because of significant retention concerns, including competitor recruitment of key employees and morale concerns arising from market uncertainties and the receipt of generally smaller bonuses for Fiscal 2011 than in prior years as a result of, among other things, increased litigation and proxy contest costs, in May 2011 the Compensation Committee, in connection with the Company\u0092s broad-based retention program, approved the following restricted stock unit awards: to Mr.\u00a0Lynch, 166,667 restricted stock units; to Mr.\u00a0Klipper, 83,333 restricted stock units; to Ms.\u00a0Keating, 16,667 restricted stock units; to Mr.\u00a0Carey, 20,000 restricted stock units and to Mr.\u00a0Lindstrom, 20,000 restricted stock units. The Compensation Committee decided to grant restricted stock units, as opposed to restricted stock, to key employees because restricted stock units results in less dilution to stockholders than the use of restricted stock alone (as mentioned above) and they would not provide voting rights upon grant since the Compensation Committee determined that recipients should earn voting rights upon vesting rather than upon grant. With the exception of the awards made to Messrs. Lynch and Klipper, restricted stock unit awards made under the retention program generally vest in the following three installments: 25% vests upon the second anniversary of the grant date, 25% vests upon the third anniversary of the grant date and 50% vests upon the fourth anniversary of the grant date. The Compensation Committee determined that, due to the importance of their roles in executing the Company\u0092s global strategic plan, it was necessary to enhance the retention objective for Messrs. Lynch and Klipper, therefore, each executive\u0092s restricted, 927037=The Company leases one of its B&N College stores from a partnership owned by Leonard and Stephen Riggio, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2014. Rent of $862,000, $862,000 and $512,000 was paid during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 from the date of the Acquisition, respectively., 1074497=2.13. \u0093Exchange Act\u0094 shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended., 123999=Mary Ellen Keating joined the Company as Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs in January 1998. Prior to that, she was an executive with Hill\u00a0& Knowlton, Inc., a worldwide public relations firm, from 1991 to 1998, where she served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Hill\u00a0& Knowlton\u0092s flagship New York office., 624863=Fiscal 2012 Compensation for Mr.\u00a0Lombardi under the Lombardi Transition Agreement, 188349=In May 2011, taking into account a review conducted by Cook\u00a0& Co., the Compensation Committee approved changing the previously-used 12-company peer group of retail companies (the \u0093Retail Peer Group\u0094), as described further below, by eliminating six specialty retail companies that were in bankruptcy, or no longer sufficiently similar to the Company\u0092s retailing approach and product mix, and adding 14 companies that were a better fit and aligned with the Company\u0092s digital business strategy. The Company\u0092s revised peer group consists of the following 20 companies: Adobe Systems Incorporated; Bed, Bath\u00a0& Beyond, Inc.; Dick\u0092s Sporting Goods, Inc.; eBay Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; The Gap, Inc.; Intuit Inc.; Limited Brands, Inc.; Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.;, 913912=In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company issued the Sellers (i)\u00a0a senior subordinated note in the principal amount of $100,000,000, payable in full on December\u00a015, 2010, with interest of 8%\u00a0per annum\u00a0payable on the unpaid principal amount (the \u0093Senior Seller Note\u0094), and (ii)\u00a0a junior subordinated note in the principal amount of $150,000,000 (the \u0093Junior Seller Note\u0094 and together with the Senior Seller Note, the \u0093Seller Notes\u0094), payable in full on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, with interest of 10%\u00a0per annum\u00a0payable on the unpaid principal amount. The Senior Seller Note was paid on its scheduled due date, December\u00a015, 2010. The Senior Seller Note was unsecured and subordinated to the obligations under the 2009 Credit Facility\u00a0and certain other senior obligations. The Company had the right to prepay the Senior Seller Note at any time without premium or penalty to the extent not prohibited by senior debt documents, provided that the Company did not have the right to prepay the Junior Seller Note until the Senior Seller Note had been repaid in full. On December\u00a022, 2009, the Company consented to the pledge and assignment of the Senior Seller Note by the Sellers as collateral security. The Junior Seller Note was and is unsecured and subordinated to the obligations under the 2009 Credit Facility, the Company\u0092s credit facility amended by agreement dated as of April\u00a029, 2011 (the \u00932011 Amended Credit Facility\u0094) and the Company\u0092s credit facility amended by agreement dated as of April\u00a027, 2012 (the \u00932012 Amended Credit Facility\u0094), as applicable, as well as certain other senior obligations. The Company may prepay the Junior Seller Note at any time without premium or penalty to the extent not prohibited by the 2012 Amended Credit Facility and senior debt documents. Pursuant to a settlement agreed to on June\u00a013, 2012, the Sellers have agreed to waive $22,750,000 of the purchase price by waiving a corresponding principal amount (and interest on) of the Junior Seller Note, subject to receipt of court approval., 618098=Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s compensation reflects the critical role he plays in the Company\u0092s digital and technology-based global strategy. Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s Fiscal 2012 total compensation amount reflected in the Summary Compensation Table includes $3,098,340 calculated as set forth above in footnote 3 to the Summary Compensation Table in restricted stock units in connection with the Company\u0092s retention program, which were granted, as discussed above, because of the importance to the Company in retaining him given his role in the Company\u0092s strategy. Also in Fiscal 2012, Mr.\u00a0Lynch was granted options on 500,000 shares, a grant valued at $5,285,000, calculated as set forth above in footnote 4 to the Summary Compensation Table, at an exercise price of $16.00. These options were granted to Mr.\u00a0Lynch for several reasons, as discussed above, including because under Mr.\u00a0Lynch\u0092s leadership the Company has, in a short period, been transformed into a leader in digital technology. In addition, Mr.\u00a0Lynch currently holds exercisable options on 333,333 shares and unvested options on 166,667 shares., 426645=In making its compensation determinations, the Compensation Committee considers the potential impact of Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code, which disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation for individual compensation exceeding $1,000,000 in any taxable year paid to its chief executive officer or any of its three other highest-paid officers employed at the end of the fiscal year (other than the Chief Financial Officer) unless (a)\u00a0the compensation is payable solely on account of the attainment of performance goals, (b)\u00a0the performance goals are determined by a committee of two or more outside directors, (c)\u00a0the material terms under which compensation is to be paid are disclosed to and approved by stockholders and (d)\u00a0the determining committee certifies that the performance goals were met. Because it is in the best interests of the Company to qualify to the maximum extent possible the compensation of its executives for deductibility under applicable tax laws, the Company obtained stockholder approval in June 2009 for the 2009 Executive Performance Plan and the 2009 Incentive Plan, which provide for the payment of compensation in compliance with Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code, and the Compensation Committee administers those plans in a manner intended to comply with Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code. However, it is possible that one or more grants may not qualify as performance-based awards as may be determined by the Internal Revenue Service or that, in limited circumstances, the Company may determine that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to pay awards that do not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code., 1058840=2009 INCENTIVE PLAN, 69413=David G. Golden has served as a director of the Company since October 2010. Mr.\u00a0Golden serves on the Compensation and Audit Committees. Mr.\u00a0Golden is Executive Chairman of Code Advisors, a private merchant bank focused on the intersections of technology and media founded in 2010. From 2006 through 2011, he was a partner and strategic advisor with Revolution LLC, an investment company formed by AOL Co-founder Steve Case. From February 1988 to April 1990 and from April 1992 to February 2006, Mr.\u00a0Golden held various positions with JPMorgan Chase and a predecessor firm, Hambrecht\u00a0& Quist Incorporated, including serving as Vice Chairman and Director of Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Investment Banking from March 2001 to January 2005 and Chairman of the Western Region from March 2001 to February 2006. At Hambrecht\u00a0& Quist, he was Co-Director of Investment Banking from April 1998 to December 2000 and Co-Director of Mergers and Acquisitions from April 1993 to March 1998. Mr.\u00a0Golden is a member of the board, 931626=The Company is provided with national freight distribution, including trucking services by Argix Direct Inc. (\u0093Argix\u0094), a company in which a brother of Leonard and Stephen Riggio owns a 20% interest, pursuant to a transportation agreement expiring in 2014 (following an automatic renewal of the agreement by its terms in 2012 for an additional two-year term, although at all times the agreement requires a two-year notice to terminate). The Company paid Argix $14,414,000, $15,890,000 and $16,536,000 for such services during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. At the time of the agreement, the cost of freight delivered to the stores by Argix was comparable to the prices charged by publishers and the Company\u0092s other third party freight distributors. However, due to higher contracted fuel surcharge and transportation costs, Argix\u0092s rates were higher than the Company\u0092s other third party freight distributors. As a result, the Company amended its existing agreement with Argix effective January\u00a01, 2009. The amendment provides the Company with a $3,000,000 annual credit to its freight and transportation costs for the remaining life of the existing agreement. The $3,000,000 annual credit expired with the April\u00a01, 2012 renewal of the agreement. Argix provides B&N College with transportation services under a separate agreement that expired and was renewed in 2011. The renewed agreement expires in 2013. The Company believes that the transportation costs that B&N College paid to Argix are comparable to the transportation costs charged by third party distributors. B&N College paid Argix $1,294,000, $1,477,000 and $658,000 for such services during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 from the date of Acquisition, respectively. Argix also leased office and warehouse space from the Company in Jamesburg, New Jersey, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2011. This lease was renewed for additional space in 2011. However, the Company subsequently sold the warehouse on December\u00a029, 2011. The Company charged Argix $1,514,000, $2,719,000 and $2,646,000 for such leased space and other operating costs incurred on its behalf prior to the sale of the warehouse during Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively., 911688=The Company completed the acquisition (the \u0093Acquisition\u0094) of B&N College from Leonard Riggio and Louise Riggio (the \u0093Sellers\u0094) on September\u00a030, 2009. Mr.\u00a0Riggio is the Chairman of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors and a significant stockholder. The Company is a party to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of, 191719=The Compensation Committee does not set percentile goals for its executive compensation relative to any peer group; however the Compensation Committee has considered market median compensation practices in the Retail Peer Group, Technology Peer Group and/or New Peer Group in the past when negotiating the employment agreements of certain named executive officers, as discussed below. In addition, the Compensation Committee was presented with market information based on Competitive Survey Data aimed at providing the Compensation Committee members with a broad understanding of current executive compensation pay practices. While the Compensation Committee has reviewed peer group analysis in the past to ensure that the compensation program is competitive and promotes retention, and is periodically presented with recommendations based on Competitive Survey Data, relative pay is just one factor that the Compensation Committee considers in determining compensation levels. In addition, the Compensation Committee considers: (a)\u00a0the Company\u0092s business performance; (b)\u00a0each named executive officer\u0092s experience, prior performance and anticipated future performance; (c)\u00a0relative compensation among the named executive officers; (d)\u00a0industry-wide business conditions and (e)\u00a0the recommendations of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. In Fiscal 2012, the compensation of the named executive officers was determined by taking into account (i)\u00a0in the case of Messrs. Lynch, Huseby, Klipper, Lombardi and Riggio, the terms and conditions of their respective employment agreements, their significant, respective job responsibilities and their roles in managing the Company\u0092s retail businesses and (ii)\u00a0in the case of Messrs. Carey and Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, their respective job responsibilities. In addition, with regard to the named executive officers\u0092 retention awards and discretionary bonuses (as discussed below), the Compensation Committee considered the degree to which each executive played a vital role in the achievement of the Company\u0092s strategic goals in Fiscal 2012 as well as the degree to which the Company will depend on their skills, knowledge and experience as it moves forward., 72996=William J. Lynch, Jr., has served as a director of the Company since October 2011. Mr.\u00a0Lynch has also been the Chief Executive Officer of the Company since March 2010. He joined the Company as President of Barnes\u00a0& Noble.com in February 2009. Previously, he held the title of Executive Vice President of Marketing and General Manager of HSN.com from January 2007 to January 2009.

Prior to that, Mr.\u00a0Lynch was Vice President and General Manager, e-commerce, for Palm Inc., 1057993=July\u00a023, 2012, 947852=The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2012 executive compensation programs align well with the Compensation Committee\u0092s philosophy and are sufficiently linked to the Company\u0092s performance., 950816=APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED 2009 INCENTIVE PLAN, 59574=William Dillard, II has been a director of the Company since November 1993. Mr.\u00a0Dillard serves as Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and as a member of the Compensation Committee.

Accordingly, participants as of December\u00a031, 1999 no longer earned benefits for service with the Company and no new employees became participants in the Retirement Plan after that date. Service with the Company after December\u00a031, 1999 continues to be taken into account for determining whether participants are vested in their accrued benefits on December\u00a031, 1999, if they were not vested on that date. The Retirement Plan continues to pay benefits in accordance with its provisions as in effect on December\u00a031, 1999., 644248=Each non-equity incentive plan award reported in the \u0093Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2012\u0094 table\u00a0was granted, with respect to Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio, under the Company\u0092s stockholder-approved 2009 Incentive Plan, and, with respect to Messrs. Carey, Lindstrom and Ms.\u00a0Keating, under the Company\u0092s Incentive Compensation Plan for Home Office Management for Fiscal 2012. Each equity-based award reported in the \u0093Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2012\u0094 table was granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. See the discussions in the \u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0097Key Elements of Compensation, Performance-Based Annual Incentive Compensation\u0094 section of this Proxy Statement and the \u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0097Key Elements of Compensation, Long-Term Equity\u0094 section of this Proxy Statement., 934034=The Company used Source Interlink Companies, Inc. (\u0093Source Interlink\u0094) as its primary supplier of music and DVD/video, as well as magazines and newspapers. Leonard Riggio is an investor in an investment company that formerly owned a minority interest in Source Interlink. Pursuant to the confirmation order of the United States Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware, as of June\u00a019, 2009 (the \u0093Discharge Date\u0094) the equity interests held by the then owners of Source Interlink were discharged, cancelled, released and extinguished. The Company paid Source Interlink $33,979,000 for merchandise purchased at market prices during Fiscal 2010 prior to the Discharge Date. In addition, Source Interlink purchases certain data related to magazine sales of the Company. Source Interlink paid the Company $20,000 during Fiscal 2010 prior to the Discharge Date., 19893=Stockholders May Call Toll-Free: (877)\u00a0456-3422., 246107=In establishing the target payouts for each of Messrs. Lynch, Klipper and Riggio for Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee conducted a subjective analysis that took into consideration each of these named executive officer\u0092s prior performance and anticipated future performance and the responsibilities of each named executive officer, both within the Company and as compared to the responsibilities of similarly situated executives in the peer groups. The Compensation Committee also considered the payout necessary to achieve the level of total cash compensation and total direct compensation that the Compensation Committee determined was necessary to retain and incentivize each of these named executive officers., 621115=the Compensation Committee decided in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 to seek stockholder approval of an amendment to the 2009 Incentive Plan, as discussed in Proposal 3 submitted together with this Proxy Statement, that will allow an additional grant of stock options with respect to the 500,000 shares of common stock to Mr.\u00a0Lynch to replace the options that were not granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan. In the event such approval is obtained, the new stock options will be granted on the date of the annual meeting and will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\u0092s common stock on the date of the meeting, and will be reflected in the Company\u0092s Fiscal 2013 Summary Compensation Table. The vesting schedule and other terms of the new options will be identical to the vesting schedule of the excess options., 198311=In early Fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee reviewed the findings of an updated competitive analysis conducted by Cook\u00a0& Co. using the New Peer Group developed during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and the Radford Survey. Depending on the position being analyzed, the Radford Survey included between 22 and 74 company participants with annual revenue greater than $3 billion. The findings indicate that target total direct compensation (i.e., base salary, annual cash incentive and the average annual value of equity awards) for Mr.\u00a0Lynch and Ms.\u00a0Keating is generally aligned with market median levels of both the New Peer Group and the Radford Survey, and that compensation for Messrs. Klipper and Lombardi is generally positioned above the median of the New Peer Group. Mr.\u00a0Klipper has been with the Company for many years and, as Chief Executive Officer\u0097Barnes\u00a0& Noble Retail Group, has assumed responsibilities beyond those of a traditional head of a business unit, including successfully managing the retail business, one of the Company\u0092s most critical operations, and implementing the Company\u0092s new digital strategy in its retail stores. In addition, due in large part to Mr.\u00a0Klipper\u0092s exemplary leadership, the retail business consistently out-performs expectations.
