The building once served as the Black Cat bar prior to its present split personality, but fortunately still offers the same popular beer garden that spans both rooms in the rear. Jack's Bar & Grill features a long wooden bar, booth seating under a big screen, a fireplace in the rear, 11 beers on tap and weekend bucket specials, plenty of TVs, and a menu of sandwiches, burgers and specialty chicken pot pie. 404 Wine Bar features intimate table and couch seating, another fireplace, over 120 wines by the bottle (and flights for sampling), and a menu of cheese plates, ravioli, pork chops, and hanger steaks. Both Jack's and 404 Wine Bar are perfect for heading out on a school night and as your starter bar on weekends. For more information, check out the Jack's Bar & Grill-404 Wine Bar website.",
