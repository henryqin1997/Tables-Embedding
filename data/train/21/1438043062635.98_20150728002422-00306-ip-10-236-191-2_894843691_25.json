This tradition is called Septembertime, and culminates up to the 21st night of September, when the song is played multiple times with the largest number of students possible crammed into the Choir Room., 186548=We have September Time Where we dance for a whole month, every night to September by Earth Wind and Fire. We dance like children(energetic and shamelessly.) It's great., 218577=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 141011=During the month of September Luther has Septembertime. This is an event in which every night in the month of September, at a different location around campus and play the song Do you remember? Christmas on campus is also a hugely popular time., 89452=The music program is phenomenal. Roughly 1000 out of the 2500 student body participate in either band, choir, or orchestra. There are activities for every kind of person; a ballroom/swing club, Performing Arts Committee, Student Senate, Debate, diversity center, and so many more that I can't name them all., 135428=Christmas at Luther is a choir program put on in late November/early December. It's always worth it, whether you're in the choir or just watching. There are also plenty of parks and wildlife centers all throughout Decorah, and the whole town has a strong Norwegian heritage that shines through., 174783=One of my favorite traditions on campus is SeptemberTime. Every night in the month of September, we will all gather at a different location on campus and dance to the song September by Earth, Wind, and Fire. Also, there is this cute little ice cream shack in town (within walking distance from campus) called the Whippy Dip. It is definitely a campus favorite.}",

Go in during their office hours and just chat with them. They will be more than willing to talk to you, and try to make life here easier. 2) Get to know your RA's (Resident Assistants). They are upperclassmen who have been through what you going through. They remember how difficult it was during their first year, and they will be able to help you get through it. 3) Get to know the people down in the Student Academic Support Center(SASC) and Student Support Services(SSS). They are located on the ground floor of the library. They will help you with whatever you need. They will help with academic help, and provide you with tutors. They can give advice for financial support and they are great people to talk to when you are having problems and you have no idea who to turn to.",
