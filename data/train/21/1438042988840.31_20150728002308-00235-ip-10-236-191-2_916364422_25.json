            "Campus security guards and emergency response personnel are always available in the central building.",
            "Music Club, Japanese Pop Culture Club, Phi Theta Kappa chapter, Flight club, Women's Resource Center",
            "The courses are university level for a very low price; full time tuition is $4,000-$6,000 per year depending on the field of study.",
            "The RC clubhouse hosts a number of clubs with all sorts of interests ranging from music, leadership, theater, anime, and so on. Athletics classes are offered where you can play sports in a group setting, or you can simply use the weight-room, basketball courts, and soccer fields on your own time.",
            "The cafeteria is a nice social setting to buy and eat lunch at, but the food is expensive. Vending machines around campus are stocked with healthy snacks for reasonable prices if you're on the go.",
            "There are no dorms that I know of.",
            "The courses are on par with university-level classes, but with a far more personal setting - most classes range from 15-30 students, and teachers are always available for questions. Teachers will often balance conceptual understanding and rote memorization (many offer notecards so that you will not need to spend time memorizing equations). Also, the Chemistry department is held to standards by the national ACS examination, so the chemistry courses are just as rigorous as anything else you will find.",
            "-The cafeteria food is very expensive, so pack a lunch! -Buy and sell your books online to avoid being overcharged -Never forget your parking permit, or you'll be charged a $20 fee -Arrive early; parking is competitive and you may need to walk for 10 minutes to class -Free tutoring is offered in the student learning center, and helpful counselors are in the administrative building -Check out the clubs by going to the clubhouse in the humanities and arts building",
            "The PCC Rock Creek campus is beautifully decorated with plants and students' art, and is in a highly accessible location. The math and science classes (my area of study) are generally well taught, and are comparable to the courses offered at a state university level. This quality combined with low tuition costs makes the college an excellent location for earning undergraduate or prerequisite credits."

The energy of the event will no doubt have your feet tapping. Best of all is the delicious frybread!, 414099=PCC is the perfect college for anyone who wishes to save money, get a quality education or work while going to school. I graduated in 2010 from high school and have been working part-time while going to school full time. Only PCC would've made this possible for me., 543572=At 92 dollars a credit, PCC definitely comes out cheaper than 2 years at a regular college. Unfortunately, it is pretty expensive as far as Community Colleges go and the price is sure to continue to go up. It has been doing so consistently for the last decade. In 2004 the classes were 44 dollars a credit., 445591=Tuition for a full-time student is on average only a little over $1000. For the quality of faculty and facilities that come with this price I'd say it's well worth the cost., 571272=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Put your admissions application in early, always check on financial aide. They are a lot of students who attend PCC and admissions rate goes up every year. If there is ever something you are unsure of, don't hesitate to ask, any staff member would be gladly to assist - they always have a smile on their face whenever I ask questions. Bang for the buck Most of the teachers teach at Portland State University as well, so we have the same instructors teaching our classes at a much lower cost. Any science instructor I've had, has their PhD and has done a lot of research on their field of study - so they know a lot! Am enjoying being here I love each campus at PCC. They are four main campuses serving the metro area, along with several other centers, so it is easy to for anyone living in and around Portland. They are tons of clubs and activities you can join - something for everyone. Am learning a lot The teachers here at PCC are very knowledgeable about the subject at hand. They are always there for their students with helpful answers and want each student to succeed.",
