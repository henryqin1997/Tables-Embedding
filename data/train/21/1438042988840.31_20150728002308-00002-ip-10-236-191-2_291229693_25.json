    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{11952=The wheat market is trading a bit lower this morning after a strong short covering rally which started at the end of July after tensions mounted at the boarder of Ukraine and Russia. The building of Russian troops at the boarder had some analysts worried that a Russian intervention was looming. However, as time passes without any further escalation we start to see wheat turn back over and move toward its lows.\u00a0\u00a0, 161718=Soybeans have continued to move lower in the overnight session with the January contract down 10 cents and testing $10.00 per bushel. No new news is pushing things this morning, general weakness in the soy complex has been observed since rumors started circulating that the U.S. would be importing Argentine soymeal in the next several months. One positive story this morning is related to crush margins in China, the world\u2019s largest importer of soybeans. Reuters is reporting that Chinese monthly imports are expected to improve 38% in November as crush margins improve and Chinese buyers try to lock in relatively cheap soybeans., 495505=The Russian Agricultural Ministry recently proposed to end the export tax on Russian wheat after July 1st. The decision will be voted on in either May or June after this year\u2019s crop yield becomes clearer. Also on the international front, the Ethiopian government has issued an international tender to purchase 400,000 metric tons of milling wheat to be sourced from optional origins. Traders are waiting on the results of that tender.\u00a0, 429478=For soybeans, basis levels have been stagnant since mid-February and this week was not much different. Basis levels on average across the country were up only 1 cent a bushel. At the Gulf, export basis levels were up by a similar amount and with this week\u2019s export sales coming in at a paltry 161,000 MT expectations are for slow business in the remainder of the marketing year. At crushing plants, gains were also muted when averaged across the country. However, there was more noticeable strength in MN & IA where there were some plants up 5 cents a bushel., 538517=China cut its interest rates\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0for the third time in six months which should support soybean prices this morning as lower borrowing costs can have a positive impact on demand for imports. China\u2019s economy continues feel economic pressure with analysts expecting annual growth to fall to 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014. More economic numbers will be released\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0including industrial output and investment. \u00a0\u00a0, 470254=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with corn down 2 1/4 cents, soybeans down 8 cents and wheat down 3 cents. The Dollar is trading a bit lower this morning with crude oil off over a dollar a barrel. On Thursday the Saudi Arabia\u2019s state grains authority issued a large international tender to purchase 715,000 metric tons of hard wheat for delivery between June to August. A reportable sale of new crop soybeans was reported for 118,000 metric tons to unknown destinations this morning. \u00a0, 305017=Also out this morning will be NOPA crush numbers which may add a sharp amount of volatility to the market. Expectations for December crush is for 166.9 million bushels of soybeans which would be a record. The previous crush record was December 2013 which used 165.3 million bushels of soybeans., 493328=NOPA soybean crush came in well over analyst expectations with 162.822 million bushels of soybeans crushed in the month of March. Analyst expectations ranged from 150.5 to 159.5 million bushels with the average analyst guess expecting 155.261 MBU. The latest NOPA report marks the largest March soybean crush on record. Soyoil stocks were reported at 1.420 billion pounds well over analysts\u2019 expectations of 1.383 billion pounds, but below last year\u2019s levels of 2.023 billion pounds., 385425=At the USDA forum on Friday, analysts\u2019 pegged new-crop 2015 supplies based on normal yields and reduced acres. For corn, USDA sees the 2015/16 crop at 13.6 BLN BU as compared to 14.2 BLN last year. The soybean crop is projected to be 3.80 BLN BU versus 3.96 in 2014/15. Finally for wheat, USDA looks for the 2015/16 crop to be 2.125 BLN BU as compared to 2.026 BLN in 2014/15., 596742=In the overnight session, the grains traded higher with corn up 2 3/4 cents, soybeans up 6 cents and wheat up 6 3/4 cents. The U.S. dollar is trading lower by nearly 1/2 a percent and crude oil is down 33 cents. Greece expressed interest toward negotiating the latest Austerity proposal from lenders through the remainder of June which is an improvement from the outright rejection of the proposal which occurred last week. This is a slight improvement in the tone and helped lift the Euro early\u00a0Monday\u00a0morning., 309896=Keep a close watch on March corn in the 60 minute chart today after yesterday the contract printed a bounce off $3.76. Another test of that level would leave me suspicious that corn could continue lower., 135434=EXPORTERS SELL 419,000 TONNES U.S. SOYBEANS TO CHINA AND 113,000 T SOYBEANS TO UNKNOWN, ALL FOR 2014/15., 251615=Weekly exports sales were released at\u00a07:30 CST\u00a0this morning showing wheat sales improved 8% on the week, booking 476,300 metric tons of sales which was on the high side of analyst expectations. Corn sales met expectations with 693,500 metric tons, but declined 28% from the previous week. Soybean export sales fell 14% this week booking 696,000 metric tons. Soybean sales met expectations and is still running well ahead of pace to meet this year\u2019s USDA expectations. Cumulative sales for soybeans are now at 41 million metric tons which is well ahead of expectations for this time of year which are around 34 million metric tons., 39058=The Pro Farmer crop tour is entering day 2 this morning with the western leg moving from Grand Island to Nebraska City, Nebraska. The eastern leg will go from Fishers, Indiana to Bloomington, Illinois. The map below shows Crop Reporting District yield forecasts for corn with the Pro Farmer Crop Tour route highlighted in blue. Tour stops are shown as blue dots. As you can see from the map, day 1 and day 2 should produce the \"worst\" yield forecasts, relative to 2013, of the entire trip. Day 3 and Day 4 of the tour will be in Iowa and Illinois where we are projecting yields up sharply from 2013. Expect the corn market to be pressured by reports of exceptional crops on Wednesday and\u00a0Thursday\u00a0of this week., 95617=The USDA attache in Argentina is projecting 2.47 million (5%) additional soybean acres planted than the USDA projected in the September WASDE report. Large South American production will start catching more attention as planting is now underway in Brazil and Argentina. Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay soybean ending stocks are projected to rise 25% in the 2014/15 marketing year., 405247=In the overnight session the grains traded mixed with corn down 1 cent, soybeans up 2 \u00bc cents and wheat up 2 cents going into the morning pause in trade. The Chicago wheat market seems to have held support off $4.96 last Thursday which was the previous low back on February 2nd., 424714=Ethanol production increased week over week by 13,000 barrels per day to 944,000 barrels per day which is still well over last year\u2019s production pace. In the latest WASDE report released on Tuesday\u00a0the 10th\u00a0the USDA cut ethanol production by 50 million bushels. The USDA cited that the new Grain Crushing\u2019s and Co-Products Production report showed corn used for ethanol between October and January occurred at a higher conversion rate than previously assumed.\u00a0, 575933=In the overnight session the grains traded higher with corn up 3/4 of a penny, soybeans up 3 cents and wheat in Chicago up 3 3/4 cents. Yesterday wheat continued trading lower throughout the better part of a day but bounced off support and closed 6 1/2 cents off its intraday lows. Both $4.84 and $4.85 were previous lows from March 6th\u00a0and April 16th\u00a0respectively and provided some buying support during yesterday\u2019s session.\u00a0 During today\u2019s trade session we might see continuation of the bounce seen yesterday, but it is important to remember that wheat is still firmly stuck in a downtrend and that selling pressure is likely to be the more dominant force in the long run., 193236=NOPA crush numbers were released at 11 CST and showed a 58% improvement in crush over last month. According to the National Oilseed Processors Association 157.960 million bushels of soybeans were crushed in the month of October which was well above expectations for only 150.781 million bushels. Soymeal exports increased to 707,934 tons in October from 308,515 tons in September. Following the report, the market was able to rally over 10 cents to break through the 100 day moving average. We feel that the strong NOPA crush numbers are likely to explain why soybeans was able to trade over $10.80 last week, but not provide enough of a case for prices to set new highs in the coming weeks. Although demand is currently quite strong, soybean prices are expensive at these levels and we have a huge soybean crop that is now out of the fields., 361306=Grain basis was mostly stronger on the week even with futures prices trying to rebound off of recent lows. For the week ending February 5, spot corn basis was up 1 cent a bushel while spot bean bids advanced 2 cents on the week., 518403=Ethanol production fell 9,000 barrels per day last week to 921,000 barrels per day. Ethanol stocks slipped 545,000 barrels to 20.8 million barrels this week as well. Ethanol production has been steadily declining since this year\u2019s production highs in November. Typically, we would expect to see a seasonal increase in production between March and May as we head into driving season, but we have yet to observe a relative increase in ethanol production during this time period. Ethanol production is running 5.2 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace which is well ahead of the USDA expectations of an increase in production by 1.3 percent.\u00a0, 633195=In the overnight session the grains traded sharply higher with corn up 10 1/2 cents, soybeans up 19 1/2 cents and wheat up 26 3/4 cents this morning. Wheat has broken through resistance which hovered around $5.36 3/4 and is building momentum to the upside, soybeans has been above its 100 day moving average since Monday and is now trading above 10 dollars. Next resistance level for July soybeans is around $10.42 3/4 which was a previous high back on February 26th. Corn is trading around $3.86 1/2 this morning which is just above its downtrend resistance of $3.81 and the 100 day moving average of $3.79. Keep a close watch on today\u2019s trade action as we could see prices chop around throughout the trade day., 267522=Export sales released at 7:30 AM CST this morning showed exceptionally strong corn sales at 1,705,6000 MT versus trade expectations of 500,000 to 800,000 MT while soybean old-crop sales of 635,800 MT were on the high side of expectations which ranged from 450,000 to 650,000 MT. A new-crop sale of 1,500,000 MT to China had been reported by USDA previously. Wheat was at the mid-po9int of expectations with only 328,6000 MT of sales versus trade estimates of 250,000 to 450,000., 483195=The grains were steady and mostly unchanged in the overnight with corn up 1/4 cent, soybeans up 1/2 a cent and wheat down 3/4 of a penny. The dollar is trading higher and crude oil is mostly unchanged this morning. Yesterday the April USDA supply and demand report was released which seemed to affect soybeans primarily., 35269=\u00a0Corn is trading 3 cents higher this morning, soybeans are up 5 on September and unchanged on November, Chicago wheat is down 6 cents. S&P 500 futures are trading 11 points higher while crude oil is off 80 cents to 96.54 at\u00a08:00 AM\u00a0central time., 339075=In the overnight session corn is trading \u00be of a penny lower with soybeans unchanged and a 2 cent increase in wheat. Wheat prices found support yesterday after touching $5.00 \u00be briefly during the session. Wheat seems oversold at these levels after falling sharply from the $6.77 high on December 28th. Keep an eye out for a bounce in wheat prices during the day session., 254371=Grains fell sharply in the overnight session with wheat leading the slide lower on a 19-cent decline. This follows yesterday\u2019s 24-cent fall from its high on the March contract of 6.77. For corn, prices were off 6 cents in the night trade while beans fell 7 cents., 378848=NOPA Soybean crush data is scheduled at\u00a011 AM CST today. Analysts are expecting 162.673 million bushels which would be a decline from last month\u2019s figures of 165.3 million bushels, but up from last year\u2019s January crush figures of 156.943 million bushels. \u00a0, 415198=Analysts are expecting wheat ending stocks to increase to 699 million bushels from 692 in the February report. Total wheat export sales are running at pace to meet current USDA expectations, but the rise in the dollar continues to hurt U.S. wheat competitiveness on the global market.\u00a0 Corn ending stocks are expected to decline slightly falling to 1.826 billion bushels from 1.827 billion in February, and Soybean ending stocks are expected to shrink down to 376 million bushels from 385 million bushels in February. Soybean sales have run well ahead of last year\u2019s pace, already booking 97.7 percent of forecast export sales., 670503=Strategy Grains cut their EU forecast last Thursday after heat and dry weather damaged crop production prospects. Strategy Grains lowered their corn forecast to 66.7 million metric tons down .7 MMT from the June forecast.\u00a0, 368320=Yesterday, Corn ending stocks were revised 50 million bushels lower from January\u2019s report to 1.827 billion bushels. The current stocks to use ratio is now 13.38 percent. The adjustments to the balance sheet were primarily made up of an increase in corn used for ethanol by 75 million bushels. Ethanol production has been running well ahead of pace increasing 5.6 percent year over year compared January WASDE expectations of a .8 percent increase., 106143=World soybean carryout for 2014/15 was raised by 500,000 metric tonnes. Lower Brazilian ending stocks were offset by a 1.75 million tonne increase for Argentina., 265410=The markets are scheduled for open at 8:30 CST this morning with corn, soybeans and wheat expected to open unchanged to slightly higher with the outside markets providing a positive influence. Export sales are delayed until Monday due to the Christmas holiday., 153943=Corn and wheat futures are trading near unchanged while soybeans drift lower this morning. November 2014 soybeans is down 6 cents while January 2015 is off 7 cents. First notice day for November soybean futures is\u00a0Friday, October 31st. If you need help rolling to a more deferred month please contact our office by calling\u00a0877-472-4607., 211328=SovEcon said in some materials prepared for a conference that Russia\u2019s grain crop may fall to 86 million metric tons in 2015 compared to 104 MT produced this year. Dryness has taken its toll on the wheat crop since it was seeded in late August. The dry conditions are forecast to continue into the first part of December., 446622=Over the weekend some precipitation helped out central to eastern Texas, but that was not enough to provide meaningful relief for the drought that is focused on the panhandle of Texas and Western Oklahoma. Dryness looks to continue over the next two weeks with only expectations for light scattered showers. The Delta was able to dry a bit over the weekend providing some opportunity for seeding after excess moisture has slowed fieldwork recently. The weather should remain favorable in the far south for the remainder of the month with showers expected to return in April. \u00a0, 180717=Yesterday, January soybeans traded as high as 10.86 \u00bc, testing that price level twice before turning lower and finishing off the day around $10.47. There has been talk of two soybean meal cargoes being shipped from Argentina to the eastern U.S to meet short term demand which weighed heavily on the soy complex and pressured soybean meal to close the yesterday below $400. Keep a close watch on soybeans this week as volatile price action often times signals that the existing trend is coming to an end. The\u00a0Monday\u00a0WASDE report provided very little to support a sustained price rally, showing stocks to use stuck around 12%. \u00a0, 427345=The USDA attach\u00e9 stated in a report that it expected China\u2019s 2015 hog imports could jump to 1,200,000 metric tons which would be a 20 percent increase over the latest official USDA forecast. The jump in import demand developed as a result of higher internal corn prices which has stressed profitability and reduced the 2015 hog count. \u00a0, 364505=In the overnight session Australia increased their 14/15 wheat crop estimates to 23.61 million metric tons, up from 23.22 million metric tons in December. Texas winter wheat condition also improved this week with 44 percent of the crop rated good-to-excellent up from 42 percent a week before. \u00a0 \u00a0, 276285=The market is expected to open at\u00a08:30 AM CST today. This morning there was a reportable sale of 210,000 metric tons of corn to Japan for the 14/15 marketing year., 258238=This is a holiday shortened trade week with\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0observing an early close at 12 CST.\u00a0Thursday\u00a0the grain markets will be closed for Christmas and\u00a0Friday\u00a0the markets open at\u00a08:30 CSTwith a regular close. Volume is expected to be light which can allow for unexpected price movement., 167303=U.S. October Payroll showed that employers added 214,000 new jobs this last month only slightly below expectations. Following the release of the report the US dollar held mostly steady only trading up .06% at the time of this writing. With the report missing expectations we could see some short term negative implications but the jobs number\u00a0shouldn't\u00a0\u200bhave\u00a0any larger implications., 330375=Yesterday, the USDA attach\u00e9 report adjusted wheat production to 12.5 million metric tons and 14/15 corn production to 22.5 million metric tons. Both estimates for corn and wheat are 500,000 metric tons over the USDA official estimate in the January Supply and Demand report., 45629=Weekly export sales were released this morning, with very strong new crop corn and soybean sales reported. Corn sales beat out expectations coming into this morning\u2019s report, with FAS reporting 719,300 MT of 2014/15 corn sold. Major buyers were Colombia, Mexico, and unknown destinations. Soybean export sales were a mixed bag, with net cancellations of 89,600 MT reported for 2013/14 and large sales of 1,420,000 MT reported for the new crop. Wheat saw relatively poor sales, with just 209,200 MT reported sold. This was below expectations and down 62% from the 4 week average.\u00a0, 82633=Corn yield will be a focus of\u00a0Thursday's\u00a0report, following a very conservative 167.4 bushel per acre estimate in August. The average analyst is projecting corn yield north of 170 BPA, with many respected analyst looking for even a 173 or 174 figure from the USDA. Early harvest reports have shown exceptional yields across the southern plains and delta, but harvest has not yet reached the key growing states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. Our weather intelligence company, Planalytics, is projecting corn yields to average 168.9 bushel per acre - at the low end of trade estimates.\u00a0Please contact our office if you did not receive the full USDA report analysis sent yesterday afternoon., 68316=\u00a0U.S. grain futures are trading lower in the overnight session follow positive condition ratings released yesterday\u2019s after the market close. At the moment corn is down 4 cents, soybeans if off 6 cents, and wheat continues to March lower \u2013 down 7 cents. The dollar index gave back some of yesterday\u2019s strength in the overnight session but remains very strong and an overall negative influence on grain prices., 23832=\u00a0Grains are sliding lower into this morning\u2019s USDA report. Corn is down 2, soybeans off 4 and Chicago wheat is down 6 cents. Today\u2019s USDA report will be released at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0central time., 386486=The USDA Ag Outlook Forum provided a boost for soybean prices on Thursday after they announced that soybean acres are projected to be 83.5 million acres in 2015, down from 83.7 million acres planted in 2014.\u00a0 This was a surprise to the market which expected acreage to increase year over year for soybeans.\u00a0 Currently Informa\u2019s latest soybean acreage forecast for 2015 is 88.03 million acres.\u00a0 Although this is not a survey based outlook, the market still viewed this as positive news for soybean prices.\u00a0 The USDA forecasted corn at 89 million acres planted in 2015, down from 90.6 million acres planted last year and saw wheat seeding\u2019s losing 1.3 million acres year over year., 315548=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with soybeans leading to the downside by 8 \u00bc cents by the morning pause. Corn slipped 3 \u00bd cents and wheat slid 1 \u00bd cents\u00a0on Tuesday morning. Soybeans are now trading below key support at $9.91 as higher than expected ending stocks coupled with lower than expected December soybean crush weigh on prices. This morning another cancellation from China including 174,000 metric tons of old crop soybeans will weigh on market prices in the early morning. This is the second cancellation in five days following last week\u2019s cancellation of 285,000 metric tons. The USDA will release export inspections\u00a0today at 10 AM CST\u00a0due to the Martin Luther King holiday., 322390=Yesterday, the EIA ethanol production report showed output increased by 1000 barrels per day to 979,000 barrels per day this week. This brings ethanol production to a year over year increase of 5.4% compared to the USDA\u2019s forecast in the January WASDE report which expects corn used for ethanol to increase only .8% year over year. Ethanol stocks also inched higher by 158,000 barrels this week to a total of 20.39 million barrels in this week\u2019s report. Compared to last month ethanol prices have fallen from $2.20 to $1.27 per gallon., 321395=Yesterday the International Grains Council increased its 2014/15 global corn production to 992 million metric tons up from 982 million metric tons in their previous forecast. This revision takes into account the USDA revision lower in the U.S corn crop, but that production loss is was more than offsets with larger production from Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil and Europe.\u00a0, 451355=The overnight was a quiet trade with corn unchanged, soybeans up 1/4 cent and wheat down 3 1/4 cents. The dollar is trading lower by nearly 3/4 of a percent and crude oil is up 34 cents. This morning there were a couple reportable sales that were announced by FAS for 108,863 metric tons of soymeal to Canada for 2015/16 delivery and 114,000 metric tons of old crop corn to Mexico. The markets will be focusing on the 2015 prospective plantings report and the quarterly grain stocks report which will both be released at 11 AM CST., 21884=2014/15 Corn, 430283=In corn, bigger gains were seen along river terminals thanks to a 4-cent boost in export basis at the Gulf. On average, river terminals were up 3 cents a bushel, with the biggest gains occurring along the Ohio River region. For ethanol plants, they were up 1.5 cents for the week, with no significant trends in basis by region. Ethanol production increased week over week by 13,000 barrels per day to 944,000 barrels per day which is still well over last year's production pace. In the latest WASDE report released on Tuesday the 10th the USDA cut ethanol production by 50 million bushels. The USDA cited that the new Grain Crushing's and Co-Products Production report showed corn used for ethanol between October and January occurred at a higher conversion rate than previously assumed., 318641=The European central bank held its policy meeting on Thursday and announced it will buy up to 60 billion euros worth of sovereign bonds from March until September 2016. This is a more aggressive quantitative easing policy than the ECB has undertaken in the past. The move was widely expected by the market and has been a contributing factor to the price slide in the Euro recently. \u00a0, 93335=Thursday\u2019s\u00a0USDA report weighed heavily on futures as yield estimates for corn and soybeans came in above market expectations. The USDA projected U.S. corn yield at 171.7 bushels per acre, 4.1 bushels per acre above their conservative August estimate. Production is now expected at 14.395 billion bushels for 2014/15. Soybeans saw a similar report, with the USDA projecting yield at 46.6 bushels per acre \u2013 0.3 bushels per acre higher than trade estimates. Soybean production is expected at 3.913 billion bushels for the 2014/15 marketing year pushing stocks to use over 13% for the first time since 06/07., 649537=Last night brought between .5-1 inch of precipitation between Oklahoma, north central Texas, Kansas City and Western Indiana. For Missouri, a state that has planted only 73 percent of soybeans as of July 5th, more rain is expected in the forecast throughout today and\u00a0Thursday. Weather should begin to clear in Missouri next week with most of the precipitation focused on the eastern grain belt covering Indiana and Ohio. Temperatures throughout the majority of the Midwest will remain cooler than normal. \u00a0, 416215=The grains traded lower in the overnight session with corn down 3 \u00bc cents, soybeans down 2 cents and wheat in Chicago up \u00bc of a penny. The U.S. Dollar is trading sharply higher to 97.395 after breaking above the previous resistance of 95.85 set on January 26th. The market will be focusing on the March USDA Supply and Demand reports which will be released at 11 AM CST on Tuesday March 10th., 669482=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with December corn down 4 \u00bd cents, November soybeans down 5 \u00bd and December wheat down 5 \u00bd cents. The U.S dollar is trading up a fraction of a percent and crude oil is 46 cents lower this morning. Mexico which normally purchases from the U.S reported a purchase yesterday of French wheat cargoes illustrating just how expensive U.S. wheat is on the global market. A few cargoes of Argentinian soybean meal are expected to be delivered to the south eastern poultry markets in the U.S. which puts pressure on domestic prices. \u00a0, 459517=In soybeans, prices were up in the night trade trying to reverse the last few sessions of lower price moves.\u00a0 Traders are awaiting the release of the Prospective Plantings report on Tuesday, which is expected to show higher soybean plantings by US farmers.\u00a0 Traders polled going into the report look for a 2 million acres increase over 2014., 314793=This morning China announced that its economy had grown at 7.4 percent in 2014 down from 7.7 percent growth in 2013. This year\u2019s economic growth in China has been the slowest in nearly 27 years and increases the chances the government takes steps to stimulate growth to avoid a more serious decline., 373979=In its first corn production estimate of the season Buenos Aires Grain Exchange is expecting to see 2014/15 corn production Argentina to come in at 22.3 million metric tons. This is slightly below both the USDA and the Rosario Grain Exchange which expects to see Argentina corn production at 23 MMT and 23.5 MMT respectively. \u00a0, 244768=In wheat, Russia\u2019s ag minister reiterated overnight that the country has no plans to restrict its wheat exports. In Ukraine, the weather shows signs of a warming trend where cold weather has been the norm. Well-below normal temperatures have been in control across the Ukraine winter wheat region since the crop was planted back in September. Forecasts call for near to above normal temperatures through much of next week., 667322=In the overnight session the grains are trading higher with December corn up 6 3/4 cents, November soybeans up 8 3/4 cents and wheat in Chicago up 4 cents. The U.S dollar is trading up nearly \u00bd a percent and crude oil is up 26 cents this morning., 637131=Crop progress was released yesterday at\u00a03 PM CST\u00a0after the market closed and showed another drop in corn and soybean conditions. The U.S corn rated good-to-excellent slipped 3 percentage points to 68 percent from 71 percent last week.\u00a0 Ohio\u2019s crop conditions declined notably from 61 percent rated good-to-excellent last week to 42 percent this week. Soybean conditions also slipped falling to 63 percent rated good to excellent from 65 percent last week. Soybean planting increased 4 percent this week but planting pace still lags significantly in Missouri which is only 62 percent complete compared to the four year average of 94 percent complete. Wheat plantings increased this week to 38 percent but still lag the four year average of 46 percent complete by the last week in June., 628338=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with corn down 3 1/4 cents, wheat down 2 3/4 cents and soybeans down 6 1/2 cents. Crude oil is trading 10 cents lower and the U.S. dollar is down a fraction of a percent. The market will be focusing on the June 30th\u00a0planted acreage numbers that is expected to have the biggest impact on Soybeans., 410626=China\u2019s finance Ministry stated that it will increase spending by 33 percent year over year on stockpiling grains, edible oils and other materials in 2015. The finance ministry is expecting to spend 154.6 billion yuan which is equivalent to 24.66 billion U.S. Dollars. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0, 327409=Soybeans looks to trend lower this week after falling through $9.91 which held as support since late October. After falling through $9.91 support, soybeans paused its decline but failed to trade back above that level. The price area of $9.91 which acted as support is now a firm resistance level. Considering the bearish surprise in ending stocks in the January Supply and Demand report, the disappointing NOPA crush numbers in December and the significant dip in export sales last week, soybeans may continue to feel selling pressure going forward., 97692=The US Dollar Index continues to slip in the overnight session, having traded down 1.5% in the last four trade days. This market has now broke technically and this represents a sharp change in direction from the strength seen since late June. A weaker dollar index should support grain prices., 601251=Traders will be watching the June WASDE report which is scheduled for release out at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0today. According to a Reuters poll of Analysts the average guess for old crop corn endings stocks is 1.859 billion bushels up from 1.851 billion bushels last month. Analysts are also expecting wheat ending stocks to rise to 712 million bushels which would be up 3 million bushels from May. Old crop Soybean ending stocks are expected to fall by 11 MBU to 339 million bushels., 618956=Beans continue to find it difficult to trade for an extended time above $9.40 basis the new-crop November contract. After trading as low as $8.97 early in the week, the market bolted higher on flooding concerns and planting delays but over the past two sessions that bullish rally has grown tame. \u00a0As Tropical Storm Bill\u2019s impact reaches the Ohio Valley, rainfall totals are not expected to be as large as once feared.\u00a0 In other news, Argentina\u2019s Ag Ministry bumped their old-crop soybean forecast to 61 MMT from its previous estimate of 60 MMT., 569970=UkrAgroConsult announced that it has raised its 2015 forecast for grain harvest to 54.9 million metric tons from 52.3 million in its previous estimate. The increased grain outlook was primarily due to revision higher in wheat production. Ukrainian farmers have planted 95 percent of acreage as of May 25th. SovEcon announced it expects Russia to harvest 95 million metric tons of grain this year down significantly from the 105 million metric tons last year.\u00a0, 363338=The average analyst guess anticipates an increase in corn and wheat ending stocks. In a Reuters poll of 20 analysts, corn ending stocks was seen increasing two million bushels from the January forecast to 1.879 billion bushels. Wheat ending stocks were seen increasing two million bushels as well to 689 million bushels of carryout. Analysts are expecting a decline in soybean ending stocks by around 12 million bushels to 398 million bushels., 102219=For corn, the average analyst guess expects production to be increased to 14.506 billion, up 111 million bushels from the September WASDE report. Yield is expected to come in around 174.685 bushels per acre which would be an increase of nearly three bushels per acre from the September report. The higher yield, combined with the larger than expected Sept. 30th quarterly grain stocks numbers which showed 51 million bushels more corn than analysts were expecting should lift the 14/15 carryout by 128 million bushels from last month's forecast of 2.002 billion bushels., 275360=Ethanol production was released\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0showing that weekly ethanol production dropped 20,000 barrels per day to 972,000 BPD from the marketing year high reported last week. Ethanol stocks increased 479,000 barrels to 18.09 million barrels which was the largest stocks number since October 10th. The decline in production is due to the holiday week, but is also beginning to feel the effects of declining ethanol crush margins. Over the last two weeks ethanol margins fell $1 per bushel and are now $1.50 below the crush margins last year during this time. \u00a0\u00a0, 381540=In the overnight session corn traded down 2 \u00bc cents, soybeans slipped 2 cents and wheat increased 1 \u00be of a cent. Be careful of soybeans hitting resistance during today\u2019s trading session. We are currently trading near resistance from the lows of the soybeans channel that lasted from October through January. Though we could get continuation buying early on in the session, be careful of some selling pressure at these levels.\u00a0, 248789=Yesterday there was talk that China has approved a genetically modified strain of corn developed by Syngenta. This has not yet been confirmed with an official announcement, but the implications of the strain being approved could foreshadow stronger demand for corn or corn based products out of the U.S.\u00a0 Last week Chinese firms bought 900,000 metric tons of DDG\u2019s from the U.S. for delivery between December and March., 420570=Analysts are not expecting this report to bring a significant surprise to the market. In a Reuter\u2019s poll of 20 analysts the average guess for corn ending stocks was 1.826 billion bushels which would be a slight decline from the 1.827 million bushels in the February WASDE report. The average trade guess for soybean ending stocks was 376 million bushels, down 9 million bushels from February. The average analyst guess expects wheat ending stocks to rise by 7 million bushels to 699 million metric tons., 197343=December corn looks to have found some support at $3.62 which also is the 100 day moving average. Strong ethanol numbers yesterday and exceptionally strong export sales this week should help to support corn in today\u2019s trade. Keep in mind that CIF basis at the Gulf has slipped to the lowest levels in three weeks as farmer sales and declining barge rates pressure basis., 164337=The most recent GFS model runs point to a drying pattern developing over Northern Brazil in the next 7 days. European weather models still point to a normal to slightly dryer pattern developing. Rain fall totals in Northern Brazil are at just 110 mm since June compared to 160 mm average for the time period. Dry conditions have severely delayed planting. Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics estimates that planting is 40% complete compared to last year\u2019s pace of 71.5% this week in November., 156169=Soymeal is drifting lower to unchanged this morning in a relatively quiet trade. The CME Group has raised soymeal margins by 25% for speculators and hedgers effective today, leading some trading to believe a further retracement will be seen. Higher margins force traders to liquidate open positions\u00a0or re-margin existing positions. Many longs in the market may opt to liquidate their positions after a huge run up since early October., 391407=The grains are trading mixed this morning with corn down \u00be of a penny, soybeans up 4 \u00bc cents and wheat down 1 \u00bd a cent.\u00a0This Friday\u00a0the 27th\u00a0is the First Notice day for March corn, soybeans, wheat, KC wheat and MN wheat. Hedgers that are not looking to take delivery should exit their March positions or roll into May contracts., 692297=Russia\u2019s largest farming region wrapped up harvest with 9.8 million metric tons of grain, an increase of 650,000 metric tons compared to last year. The Russian grain crop is looking relatively healthy with expectations for 100 million metric tons harvested this year, down 5 percent from 2014., 497395=For soybeans, crushing plants were up a modest 1 cent a bushel but several plants in the Western Cornbelt boosted basis by 5 to 10 cents a bushel. \u00a0In Minnesota, key crushing plants have been steadily ramping up basis with gains of 25 cents a bushel since the first of March. At river terminals, basis levels were up modestly with a 1-cent gain on average, but like corn, bean basis along the Ohio River should greater strengthen the rest of the country., 41893=\u00a0Grains are mixed this morning with corn off 3 cents, soybeans down 4 cents, and Chicago wheat up 2. Exporters sold 110,000 metric tons of soybeans to Vietnam for 2014/15 delivery., 287349=Export sales disappointed this morning for corn and wheat with both grains weekly sales falling 57% from the previous week. Corn booked only 387,000 metric tons, well below expectations of between 600,000 and 800,000 metric tons. Corn has booked 62% of this marketing years expected sales which is ahead of the seasonal pace needed to meet the USDA\u2019s forecast. Wheat sales came in at 151,000 which is a marketing year low and will likely affect prices negatively in this morning\u2019s trade action.\u00a0 Soybeans beat analyst expectations which ranged between 500,000-700,000 metric tons by booking 910,000. Soybean sales were up 49% from last week and are well ahead of pace to meet USDA expectations. With 34 more weeks left of this marketing year soybeans have already booked 90% of USDA forecasted export sales leaving the door open for the USDA to revise expectations higher again in the January WASDE report., 301092=U.S production wasn't the only place ending stocks increased. Brazilian soybean production was also revised higher by 1.5 million metric tons which helped lift global ending stocks by .9 million metric tons. With the current quality of the South American crop, and a continuation of the existing precipitation profile, we could begin to see more revisions higher in South American production over the next month which would weigh heavily on the market. With the South American crop expected to reach the peak of harvest in late February I would expect to see weaker prices over the next couple months., 237959=For wheat, Egypt\u2019s GASC issued a call for wheat tenders on Wednesday but the US will likely be shut out of the business with French & Russian wheat expected to be more competitive. Industry insiders continue to suggest that Russia will not curb its wheat export business. SovEcon has not issued an official forecast for 2015-16 wheat production, but director Andrey Sizov\u2019s personal estimate is for 50 to 55 MMT of wheat, down from 59 MMT this year., 496284=In the overnight session corn is down 3/4 of a penny, soybeans are up a cent and wheat is up 3 1/4 cents. The dollar is trading slightly higher this morning, now hovering at 97.640 while crude oil is trading down nearly a percent after news that OPEC\u2019s production in March added to the burgeoning global supply., 524385=Corn and soybeans appear to be trending lower this morning, cupping over on the lows printed in early April. The grains have been pressured recently by the increase bird flu detection throughout the state of Iowa which have forced the governor to declare a state of emergency. This is the third state behind Minnesota and Wisconsin to declare a state of emergency due to the outbreak in bird flu.\u00a0, 81235=\u00a0Corn, wheat and soybeans are trading lower in the overnight with corn down 2 \u00be soybeans down 5 \u00bd and wheat down 4 \u00bc cents as we go into the morning pause. Corn is now cupping back over on the $3.43 \u00be which was the low printed last Thursday. \u00a0Keep a close watch on that level to see if it holds as it was a previous low back in June 2010 just before the historic corn rally. Soybeans is also cupping back over toward $10 as selling pressure increases as traders expect higher yield forecasts to be released in the September 11th\u00a0WASDE report., 51696=\u00a0This morning the grains are trading slightly lower with corn down 3 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 7 cents and wheat down 1 cent as we go into the morning pause in trading. The spread between the September soybean contract and the November contract has taken another giant leap higher, up 15 cents just in the overnight. The spread is now trading at 139 3/4, up from 15 cents on August 6th., 476781=Traders will also be following South American production which is wrapping up harvest in many areas. Argentina corn production is expected to be revised slightly higher than in March to 23.90 million metric tons from 23.50. Argentina soybean production is also expected to increase to 57.23 million metric tons from 56 last month. Brazil production is expected to be revised slightly lower than March with corn production expected to decline to 74.82 million metric tons from 75.00 in March. Soybean production is also expected to decline to 94.18 million metric tons from 94.5 in March., 204928=First notice day for December grain contracts is on Friday, November 28th. All longs should liquidate before the close of trade\u00a0on Wednesday. The Market will be closed on\u00a0Thursday, November 27th\u00a0to observe the Thanksgiving holiday.\u00a0\u00a0, 409626=In the overnight session the grains moved lower with corn down 1 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 8 \u00bc cents and wheat down 5 \u00bd cents. Minneapolis wheat is down 4 \u00bd this morning after a 15 cent gain in yesterday\u2019s session. The cash market is firming for spring wheat in Portland which saw basis rise 20 cents yesterday. Spot basis is now at 293 off the May contract which is well above the three year average basis of 201. \u00a0\u00a0, 329421=In Brazil, showers are expanding in the central regions this week with the North East parts of the growing region expecting to receive precipitation by next week. Northern Brazil has experienced significant precipitation deficits over the last 30 days, with actual precipitation 61% below the average precipitation for that time period. The lack of precipitation over the month of January has led AgRural to announce last Friday it expects to cut Brazil soybean production forecasts in their February report. Soybeans bounced over 11 cents yesterday and could possibly trade higher today. Overhead resistance is around the $9.91 level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u200b, 462454=The expectations for the quarterly grain stocks as of March 1st\u00a0are as follows. For corn the average analyst guess pegs quarterly grain stocks at 7.609 billion bushels with the highest estimate at 7.8 billion and the lowest estimate at 7.459 billion bushels. Wheat stocks are expected to be around 1.140 billion bushels with a range of analyst guesses from 1.2 billion bushels to 1.083 billion bushels. Soybean stocks are expected to be around 1.346 billion bushels with a range of guesses from 1.404 - 1.273 billion bushels., 352367=In the corn market, Thursday\u2019s export sales were at the low end of expectations but still coming in relatively strong at 844,900 MT this week. Although sales slowed from last week, corn bookings are still running 2.6 MMT ahead of pace to meet the USDA\u2019s expectations. At the National Cattlemen's Beef Association conference in San Antonio, Texas, meteorologist \u00a0Art Douglas, a professor emeritus in the Dept of Atmospheric Sciences at Creighton University, says cool weather will likely delay U.S. crop planting in the spring. He says the U.S. will go through US corn pollination with cool weather and then temps will heat up in August. \u00a0At the same conference, CattleFax projects this year's U.S. corn yield will be in the low 160s, with production of around 13.3-13.5 billion bushels., 304078=Corn sales picked up this week with 818,800 metric tons compared to expectations of 550,000-750,000 metric tons. This week\u2019s corn export sales more than doubled last week\u2019s numbers which only booked 387,648 metric tons, well below analyst expectations. This week\u2019s export sales show corn sales now 63% booked compared to the USDA\u2019s January 12th expectations., 231348=Corn ending stocks are expected to increase by 19 million bushels in the U.S. to 2.027 billion bushels of carryout for 14/15. World grain stocks for corn are expected to decline slightly to 191.42 million metric tons compared to a November forecast of 191.5 MMT. Wheat ending stocks are expected to rise by 10 million bushels in the U.S. to 654 million bushels while the global ending stocks are expected to fall by just over 1 MMT to 191.75 MMT compared to 192.9 MMT in November., 390158=The CFTC commitment of traders report showed that large speculators which includes hedge funds, cut their long corn positions for the week ending February 17th\u00a0and lessened their short wheat and short soybean position.\u00a0, 487800=As a reminder,\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0the March NOPA crush values will be released. Analysts are expecting 155.261 million bushels of soybeans to have been crushed for the month of March, the largest on record since last year\u2019s record of 153.840 million bushels., 256107=For corn, ethanol users backed off on bids by a penny a bushel this week, but there are signs that more weakness could be in store for the ethanol sector. In Iowa, spot ethanol prices tumbled 32 cents a gallon to reach $1.68 a gallon. At the start of December, ethanol prices were as high as $2.42 a gallon. So far, ethanol production continues to exceed last year\u2019s tally at this time of year but that should change as current margin are now a $1 a bushel lower than the same time last year. On the export front, sales have been pace to reach USDA\u2019s export target for their year but recent approval by China to accept Syngenta\u2019s MIR 162 variety may give a slight boost there for corn & DDG exports. Basis levels at river terminals were up 2 cents on average thanks to some weakness in barge rates., 104262=In the overnight session the grains were trading lower with corn down 5 cents, soybeans down 10 cents and wheat down 4 \u00bd cents as traders wait for the October WASDE report. Yesterday, Egypt\u2019s GASC announced it was seeking 55,000-60,000 metric tons of U.S, Ukrainian, Russian and Australia wheat varieties for shipment in November. Traders aren\u2019t expecting the U.S to win much of the sale as Black Sea wheat is currently more competitively priced on the global market., 620773=Weather was the big concern this week as Tropical Storm Bill hit Texas and Oklahoma and made its way into the Ohio Valley by late in the week. Wet conditions are leading to not only planting problems, but shipping delays along the IL & MS River as swollen rivers are shutting down some stretches for barge traffic. In FOB market, export premiums were firmer on Thursday because of high water levels on Illinois and Mississippi rivers. FOB soybean basis offers for July were offered at 105 cents over CBOT July on Thursday, up 10c from Wednesday., 582243=Sunday\u00a0provided precipitation that ranged from 1/4 of an inch to an inch of precipitation throughout eastern North Dakota, South Dakota and eastern Nebraska. In the southern Plains most of the precipitation fell in eastern Colorado with spotty showers spread throughout the western parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and the panhandle of Texas. This week\u2019s weather outlook turns dryer for the southern Plains which is a break from the above average precipitation received throughout May. \u00a0According to the Speedwell US Winter Wheat Index, the southern plains have received precipitation that runs 350 percent above normal throughout May., 313435=Grain futures fell sharply this week following the release of USDA\u2019s revised supply and demand data. As a result, corn futures were off 14 cents, while front-month Mar soybean futures plummeted 57 cents. In the cash market, basis improved on average by 2 cents for soybeans and 3 cents for corn., 481895=Corn ending stocks were increased by 50 million bushels to 1,827 MBU which was below the average analyst guess of 1,854 MBU. This was a result of the decrease in feed and residual use which was revealed in the March 31st quarterly grain stocks report. However, despite the better than expected domestic stocks, global carryout was lifted 3 MBU to 188.46 million metric tons primarily from increased production out of major corn importers. \u00a0, 120775=Crude oil futures continued to march lower in the overnight session, with Brent Crude futures now testing $80 per barrel. Ethanol futures have remained steady in recent sessions despite the sharp move lower in crude. Ethanol production figures will be out today and, considering margin, should show seasonally strong weekly production., 249422=Yesterday was a strong deviation within the grains with corn trading a few pennies lower, wheat showing strength and soybeans sliding 16 cents by the close of the session. Soybeans which traded lower\u00a0on Monday\u00a0following a disappointing NOPA crush report saw more disappointment in export sales after 6 major Chinese buyers bought just over a million metric tons of soybeans for delivery in 2015.\u00a0 Traders viewed these sales as routine considering how widely publicized the sales were. In the overnight session January soybeans went as low as $10.16., 432586=The NOPA crush report will be released at\u00a011 AM CST today. Analysts are expecting 148.537 million bushels of soybeans crushed in the month of February which would be the largest February crush on record and a nearly 7 mllion bushel increase from last year. In a poll of eight analysts the average crush estimate ranged from 143.2 million bushels to 160.5 million bushels. Analysts see soyoil stocks coming in at 1.332 billion lbs which would be up from 1.228 billion lbs last month., 123102=Yesterday\u2019s ethanol report showed sliding production as crush margins continue to sag across the grain belt. Lower crude oil prices have pressured ethanol prices to the downside, but positive price action for cash corn has been the greatest impact on crush margins. Crush margins now sit below $2.00 per bushel in Iowa for the first time since August 2013. Basis at ethanol plants has reflected this weak margin environment, with cash basis for spot corn delivery down an average of 2 cents just yesterday. We will detail the entire move for ethanol in this afternoon\u2019s cash grain report., 587528=In the overnight session the grains are trading slightly lower with corn down 3/4 of a cent, soybeans down 4 1/4 cents and wheat down 1 1/4 cents going into this morning\u2019s pause in trade. Crude oil is down $1.04 this morning and the U.S. dollar has rallied back nearly 1/2 a percent from the sell-off yesterday. ADP numbers, which are generally used as a leading indicator for non-farm payrolls, were released this morning showing payrolls grew to 200,000 jobs in May, up from 169,000 jobs reported in April. ADP payrolls were better than expected and provided strength to the U.S. dollar this morning., 346977=StatsCanada announced this morning that total wheat stocks were at 24.82 million metric tons which is down 13.5 percent from a year earlier and right on par with the average trade guess of 25 million metric tons. Canola Stocks were 11.10 million tons as of December 1st\u00a0which was higher than the average guess of 10.7 million metric tons. Barley stocks were above the average trade estimates with 5.38 million metric tons recorded at the end of the year compared to expectations of around 4.9 million metric tons., 428265=The grains are mixed again this morning with wheat continuing its short covering action, up 3 3/4 cents this morning. Corn is down \u00bd a cent and soybean are trading 6 1/2 cents lower. The U.S. Dollar moved higher by a fraction of a percent this morning after pulling back from its peak on Thursday. Keep in mind NOPA crush numbers will be released at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0on Monday March 16th., 141060=Wheat rallied sharply in the overnight with Chicago wheat up 8 cents while Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat posted 6-cent gains.\u00a0 Weather problems in Australia are expected to curb production there, as farmers begin harvesting there this month. Analysts expect production to total 23.2 MMT in 2014-2015, versus a government forecast of 24.2 MMT and 27 MMT last year.\u00a0 Also, Russia\u2019s 2015 wheat crop is expected to drop with private analyst SovEcon expecting a 15 to 20% output slide based on lack of moisture and poor greenness that they say is the worst in 5 years.\u00a0 Winter wheat is going into dormancy with a lack of moisture and runs the risk of some winterkill damage. In 2009-10, 12.6% of the crop was damaged by winterkill. SovEcon also warned that while farmers were able to get fall planted crops in based on pre-purchased inputs, spring crops could see substantial cuts in acreage as a result of the Russian ruble tumbling 17% in the past 3 months., 657716=Grain basis was mostly stable this week as farmer selling was limited following the sell-off in futures after the June 30th USDA report. On average across the US, both corn and soybean basis was mostly unchanged., 225479=First Notice day for December Live Cattle is\u00a0on Monday., 611956=On Monday, NOPA\u2019s crush forecast for May came in at 148.4 MB, well above analyst estimates of 147.3 MB. However, substantially higher soy oil stocks kept a lid on soybean prices with inventories of soy oil pegged at 1.58 billion pounds versus estimates of 1.40 billion pounds. With ample soyoil stocks and concerns about Chinese defaults on soymeal purchases, there was little need for the soybean market to rally on this news. After the close, USDA estimated that 67 percent of the crop was in good to excellent condition, below the 69 percent level that had been expected. The pace of plantings has stalled as wet weather continues to hamper the last of the crop. As of Sunday, 87 percent of the crop had been planted versus a 90 percent \u00a05-year average for this time of year., 529608=This morning StatsCan announced that total wheat stocks in Canada on March 31st\u00a0was 16.74 million metric tons down 25 percent from the previous year. Durum wheat on stock was reported at 2.32 million metric tons this year which was down from 4.01 million metric tons in 2014. Canola stocks were reported at 7.04 million metric tons down 18.9 percent from the previous year.\u00a0, 212134=Attention: Following the Thanksgiving holiday the markets will open at\u00a08:30 CST\u00a0but close early at 12 CST., 341085=Basis along the river declined more than the rest of the U.S. declining an average of 2 cents despite barge rates declining across all five major river regions. Basis along the gulf slipped 4 cents over the last week helping explain the relative weakness along the river. Soybean basis along the river held steady in the face of declining futures prices, improving 1 \u00bc cents this week. Soybeans moved by barge over the past week was down 35 percent below the same week in 2014. Year to date barge movement of soybeans is 174,000 tons behind where we were at this time last year, while corn moved by barge is ahead of last year\u2019s pace by 143,000 tons., 304705=The weekly export sales were released at 7:30 AM CST this morning showing that wheat met analyst expectations with sales of 284,000 metric tons sold. Wheat sales were up 89% week over week, but even with the improvement that kind of volume will do little to help wheat prices move back toward the high printed on December 18th. Last night Egypt\u2019s GASC set a tender to buy an unspecified amount of wheat from global suppliers, the market will be watching the results closely., 314425=In Brazil harvest has advanced to about 4.1% of the estimated 21.9 million acres only 1% behind the pace of last year\u2019s harvest. Despite the dry spell that occurred in October these early planted crops are showing promising yields. The north eastern part of Brazil, which has been the driest this season looks to remain dry in the 6-10 day forecast. Despite the dry weather in the north, the southern growing regions have received above average precipitation this growing season which has helped offset the dry conditions in the north.\u00a0, 388203=In soybeans, monthly crush numbers for January came in at 162.675 million bushels, up from last year\u2019s January figure of 156.943 million bushels and just over expectations of 162.673 million bushels. For the week, soybean plants were lower by a penny per bushel on basis with losses most apparent in SD, MN & IA. On the export front, river terminals were up half a penny per bushel on average although there was a mix of buyers that were up and others that were down on the week. Export business continues to be stronger than expected as weekly sales of 505,600 MT were at the high end of analyst expectations on the week., 370871=Weekly ethanol production increased 13,000 barrels per day to 961,000 BPD even as weekly ethanol stocks rise again. This week stocks grew 149,000 barrels to 21.14 million barrels. Ethanol production continues to run 5.6 percent ahead of last year\u2019s production pace. In the February WASDE report the USDA increased their corn used for ethanol forecast by 75 million bushels, lifting their ethanol production forecast from .8 percent increase over last year to 2.3 percent. \u00a0, 12919=ALERT:\u00a0USDA report out\u00a0tomorrow at 11:00 AM\u00a0central time (expectations below), 442328=Yesterday, the Buenos Aires grain exchange held their soybean production forecast for Argentina steady at 57 million metric tons. The Ag Ministry did the same, keeping their forecast at 58 million metric tons compared to the March WASDE report which is looking for 56 million metric tons of soybean harvested in Argentina this year. Over the last two weeks temperatures across Argentina have been above normal putting some strain on the southern growing regions which missed out on the increased precipitation throughout February and early March. Overall there is still very little concern over the crop size in Argentina. \u00a0\u00a0, 514881=July Chicago wheat fell through $4.85 support yesterday and continued lower after breaching the level. Precipitation\u00a0on Monday\u00a0helped provide moisture to Western Oklahoma, parts of the Panhandle and southwest Kansas. Dry spots have now been limited to 10 percent of the winter wheat area with more precipitation expected in the 6-15 day forecast. Winter wheat conditions were unchanged this week with 42 percent of the crop rated good to excellent., 406044=A recent crop condition report\u00a0on Monday\u00a0showed that the western HRW regions of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Texas and Colorado have improved their crop conditions ratings due to less than expected winterkill during February. However, Kansas wheat conditions have slipped due to harsh conditions and freezing temperatures throughout February.\u00a0, 555752=NOPA crush numbers were released\u00a0on Friday\u00a0and showed a record April crush of 150.363 million bushels, which was well above the average trade guess of 147.827 million bushels and a significant improvement over last year\u2019s total of 132.667 MBU. Soy oil stocks were reported slightly lower than expected with 1.441 billion pounds on hand in April compared to expectations of 1.461 billion pounds., 158584=Grain prices are moving lower in Chicago, with corn down 4, soybeans off 10 and Chicago wheat down 4 cents. We are past\u00a0first notice day for November 2014 soybean contracts, please begin trading the January contract to avoid any issues with delivery., 490609=An announcement out of Russia also helped support wheat prices this morning with Russian Agriculture Minister announcing that there is no reason to cancel the wheat export tax ahead of schedule. The tax is set to expire on June 30th\u00a0and the ministry has made no decision yet on whether or not to extend the tax., 352717=For beans, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Thursday that Argentina should produce a record-high soybean crop in the 2014/15 season of 57 MMT, giving its first harvest forecast for this crop year. That estimate is quite a bit higher than the latest USDA forecast of 55 MMT., 658721=Global ending stocks for corn fell from 195.19 MMT in June to 189.95 MMT in July. New crop soybean ending stocks fell from 93.22 MMT in June to 91.8 MMT in July. Global wheat stocks saw a surprisingly large increase which was primarily a result of higher beginning stocks and lower feed use out of China. New crop global wheat ending stocks jumped to 219.81 MMT from just 202.40 MMT in June. The increase was well above analyst expectations and played a role in keeping wheat from closing higher\u00a0on Friday. \u00a0\u00a0, 103247=October Expected, 578875=In the overnight session the grains were mixed with corn up 2 1/2 cents soybeans down 1/2 a cent and wheat down 1 1/2 cents. The U.S. dollar is mostly unchanged with crude oil 74 cents higher. Rains are likely to continue in the southern plains over the next few days and then a drying trend is likely to take hold for the first part of June., 234349=USDA Nov Forecast, 208921=The wheat market has been supported recently by the cold weather which has threatened next year\u2019s crop in the U.S, Russia and Ukraine. In the U.S winter wheat conditions dropped 2%\u00a0on Monday\u00a0in the crop progress report bringing good-to-excellent ratings on the crop to 58% percent. A warming trend next week in the 6-15 day will unlikely help germination for Midwest wheat. The Russian wheat crop has also been suffering from a lack of precipitation which started to affect the area as far back as August. Recently, the situation has intensified with precipitation 60% below normal over the last month. Weather models show no relief in sight for the Russian crop with the next 1-2 weeks continuing to point to dryer weather.\u00a0, 210003=ATTENTION: First Notice day is on Friday the 28th. All traders need to be out of their long December grain contracts by the end of today to avoid delivery., 572182=The wheat market is trading lower again today after breaking out of the consolidation pattern printed last week on the 100 day moving average. Wheat is pressured by the stronger dollar, the declining Russian ruble and an announcement by the Russian agricultural minister today that Russia expects grain harvest to exceed the most recent forecasts and reach 2014 levels which totaled to 105 million metric tons of grain.\u00a0, 366417=In the overnight session the grains turned negative with corn down 1 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 2 \u00bc cents and wheat down 3 \u00bd cents on the week. The dollar index is trading higher this morning and crude oil is trading slightly lower. This morning at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0the USDA will release their February Supply and Demand report. \u00a0, 635314=In the overnight session, the grains traded higher with corn up 5 1/2 cents, soybeans up 3 3/4 cents and wheat up 9 cents by the pause of trade this morning. The U.S. dollar is up only a fraction of a percent and crude oil is down 71 cents. All traders in long July grain contracts will need to liquidate or roll their positions by the close of trade today with\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the 30th being First Notice.\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the 30th\u00a0also marks the release of two major USDA reports including the Planted Acreage report and the Quarterly Grain Stocks report., 623330=In the overnight the grains are higher with soybeans leading the charge up 7 1/2 cents, wheat up 4 1/4 cents higher and corn down 1/2 a penny. July soybeans now trades above $9.74 which is the 100 day moving average after closing\u00a0Friday\u00a0below that level. Crude oil is up 22 cents this morning and the U.S. dollar is only a fraction of a percent higher. The USDA crop progress is expected out at\u00a03 PM CST\u00a0today., 156546=Corn, soybeans, and wheat are continuing to drift lower in the overnight session. Coming into the morning trade break corn is down 2, wheat is off 5 cents, and soybeans are down 5 cents. Today is first notice day for\u00a0November 14\u00a0futures, please roll all soybean positions to the January contract., 164923=The U.S. Dollar Index is once again surging higher this morning, up 0.30% in the early going on the December 2014 contract. Good U.S. economic data released this morning is being cited for the strong move. U.S. productivity grew 2% in the third quarter and jobless claims fell 10,000 during the week ending November 1st. This was the eighth straight week jobless claims have been below 300,000 and signal a strong October for hiring., 135261=Soybeans surged another 12 cents higher in the overnight on very light news. A close above 972 \u00bd on the\u00a0November 14\u00a0contract would be a strong technical signal that October\u2019s price rally may have more gas in the tank. Bulls will point to strong export inspections and basis levels at the Gulf that have risen in the last 4 days for December delivered soybeans. The long term fundamentals of this market continue to point to lower prices when taking into account stocks/use for 2014/15 and the production outlook for South America. First notice day for\u00a0November 14\u00a0futures is\u00a0Friday, October 31st. If you need help rolling to January futures please contact our office., 222714=Export sales were released this morning showing wheat booked 319,200 metric tons for delivery in 2014/2015 down 26% from the week before. These sales were on the low side of analyst expectations. Corn booked 1,170,700 metric tons which was up 24% week over week and much higher than the analyst guesses which ranged from 600,000-800,000 metric tons. Soybean sales also beat analyst expectations booking 1,179,700 metric tons compared to expectations between 650,000-850,000 metric tons. Soybean export sales fell 16% compared to last week\u2019s totals but was still considered to be a positive sign of strong demand. Soymeal sales were reported at 226,800 metric tons, well above the analyst expectations which ranged from -50,000-60,000 metric tons. \u00a0, 261454=The head of Russia\u2019s Grain Union said Russia may not be able to supply wheat to Egypt\u2019s GASC in January due to the export curbs now existing in Russia. GASC\u2019s Mamdouh Abdel Fattah responded by stating \u201cTraders have to abide by their contracts.\u201d, 395699=The grains are moving lower this morning with corn down a penny, soybeans down 4 cents and wheat in Chicago down 3 \u00bd cents. Yesterday\u2019s rally in Soybeans sparked some farmer selling after prices rose sharply to an intraday high of $10.29. Keep a close watch on corn today as it trades next to a support level of 3.76 cents which was a previous low on in November, December and the middle of January. This morning a reportable sale of 120,000 metric tons of HRW wheat to Egypt was announced. \u00a0\u00a0, 283844=March Soybeans\u00a0now trading at 10.57 \u00be which is close to the high side of the range it has been trading in since late October. If the market moves higher this morning there should be strong resistance between 10.66 and 10.68 which were both previous highs on December 10th\u00a0and 29th.\u00a0, 10075=This\u00a0report\u00a0will be released at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0Central Time and be the first survey based yield estimate of the year. Yield figures will be the focus of the\u00a0report\u00a0following a July that saw ample moisture in the eastern grain belt but a return of drought conditions in Nebraska and the Dakotas. Below are trade expectations for the\u00a0report\u00a0and our take on the numbers. Please call our office if you have questions about speculative or hedge positions coming into the\u00a0report. Our number is\u00a0877-472-4607\u00a0and we are available between\u00a08AM and 5PM\u00a0central time., 413870=The Buenos Aires Grains exchange warned yesterday that the floods in the northern Pampas region could cause them to reduce their soybean production estimate which currently sits at 57 million metric tons. In the February WASDE supply and demand estimates, the USDA\u2019s pegged Argentina soybean production at 56 million metric tons. Rains are expected in the 6-10 day forecast with most precipitation focused over the central and northwestern parts of Argentina., 573284=Crop progress was released after the close of trade yesterday and showed that 92 percent of corn was planted as of May 24th\u00a0which is ahead of the four year average of 88 percent. Soybeans are also ahead of pace with 61 percent of soybeans planted compared to the four year average of 55 percent. Spring wheat is now 96 percent planted. The USDA released their first crop condition ratings for corn in yesterday\u2019s report which showed 74 percent of the crop was rated good to excellent just two percentage points behind the first crop conditions report of 2014 on June 1st. \u00a0, 247478=Yesterday, NOPA crush numbers were released at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0and came in on the low side of analyst expectation with 161.211 million bushels crushed in November. The average expectation for this report was 165.404 million bushels compared to last year\u2019s November total of 160.145. Analysts ranged from 161 to 176 million bushels. It is important to note that near term demand has been the force lifting soybeans since the beginning of October. Today, more demand news is expected from Chicago as six major soybean buyers from China are expected to sign large purchases. With the first of two major demand stories behind us, soybeans may have a tough time maintaining strength into the end of the week. \u00a0, 675961=This morning there was some export activity with NASS reporting 120,000 metric tons of U.S soybeans to be sold to china for new crop delivery. A tender was also issued this morning by South Korea\u2019s corn processing industry association for 55,000 metric tons of corn from either the U.S, Brazil or Argentina. The corn is to be delivered in November and the tender closes\u00a0on Wednesday.\u00a0, 440067=Yesterday, the FOMC issued their latest statement which indicated that a rate increase will be unlikely in the April meeting. The statement issued announced that they will make a rate hike after they are \u201cReasonably Confident\u201d inflation will move back to the 2 percent target and after further improvement in the labor market. The dollar traded sharply lower following the statement as traders viewed this as continuation of extremely low interest rates and the delay of any interest rate hike that was expected in the near future., 138402=Today is the last trade for November options for Corn, Chicago Wheat, Kansas City Wheat, Minneapolis Wheat and Soybeans. Friday October 31st\u00a0will be first notice for the November soybean contract.\u00a0, 297125=January Ending Stocks Estimates-Analysts are expecting ending stocks to rise for wheat by 12 million bushels to 666 million bushels carryout. Corn and soybean ending stocks are both expected to decline in this month's report. The average analyst guess has corn expected to decline by 71 million bushels to a 1.927 billion bushels carryout and soybeans to shrink 17 million bushel to 393 million bushels as a result of strong export sales which have booked 90% of the current USDA expectation already with 34 weeks left in the marketing year. \u00a0, 603341=Wheat provided the biggest surprise for new crop ending stocks. New crop wheat production was lifted 34 million bushels which was partially offset by a rise in feed and residual by 15 million bushels. This lifted new crop wheat ending stocks from 793 million bushels in May to 814 million bushels of ending stocks in June. Soybean ending stocks fell 25 million bushels to 475 which was primarily a result of smaller beginning stocks, and new crop corn ending stocks increased 25 million bushels which was also a result of smaller beginning stocks. \u00a0, 466642=Quarterly grain stocks also showed more corn on hand as of March 1st\u00a0compared to expectations. Corn stocks were reported at 7.745 billion bushels compared to expectations of 7.609 billion bushels. Soybean stocks were 1.334 billion bushels, 12 million bushels below expectations of 1.346 billion bushels. Wheat ending stocks were also lower than expected with 1.124 billion bushels reported as of March 1st\u00a0compared to expectations of 1.140 billion bushels expected. \u00a0, 170482=EXPECTATIONS FOR 2014/15 WORLD ENDING STOCKS (MMT), 281979=Yesterday\u2019s rally brought soybeans off of the low side of the range it has been trading in since late October. The rally was primarily driven by short covering after four straight days of selling. It was further fueled by an export sale to China for 233,000 metric tons of soybeans and concerns of dryness in Brazil\u2019s north eastern growing area. Recently, weather models have turned drier over the next 15 days causing traders to monitor this region more closely. This morning another reportable export sale of 243,000 metric tons delivered to China was announced., 233147=In wheat, Russia\u2019s assertions that it has no intention of resorting to export restrictions appear to be having a calming effect. Previously, it had been feared that Russia might attempt to increase the quantity of wheat available in the country by prohibiting exports. Domestic demand for wheat is growing in Russia because of the Russian ban on EU imports, yet drought and cold weather are posing a threat to young plants in the 2015 crop. Overnight, Farm office FranceAgriMer raised its forecast for French soft wheat stocks at the end of the current 2014/15 (July/June) season to a 10-year high of 4.55 MMT from 4.3 MMT estimated last month.\u00a0, 254090=In wheat, Russia's Association of Grain Exporters said overnight it had stopped buying grain on the domestic market for export due to what it described as state pressure.\u00a0 Russia has started to restrict exports by toughening quality controls and reducing railway loading of grain to cool local prices as the country tackles a currency crisis linked to plunging oil prices and Western sanctions.\u00a0 Although bullish on its face, the fact that Russia would pull out of the export market has been the driving force behind the price rally in recent weeks, and as such the \u201cbuy the rumor sell the fact\u201d mentality might be kicking in.\u00a0 In Germany, the winter wheat sown area for the 2015 harvest has been expanded by 2.8%, the national statistics office said on Friday., 178107=Corn continues to be a silent follower to the bean complex but has managed to add over 50 cents from its low at $3.20 in early October. Weekly ethanol production will be released this morning with it likely to show a third-week running of greater than 900,000 barrels per day in production. Since\u00a0Sept 1, ethanol production has been up 4.2% over the same period last year signaling a potential high corn usage than what USDA has factored in. Current USDA corn usage for ethanol is pegged at 5,150 MB versus last year\u2019s actual usage of 5,134 MB, only a 0.3% yearly increase., 220898=The grains are down in the overnight with corn down 2 \u00be soybeans down 6 3/4 and wheat down 13 cents. This morning a reportable sale for 196,000 metric tons of corn was announced for delivery to Mexico. Technical selling in soybeans is likely to pressure the soybean market as a major head and shoulders topping formation has been completed for the January contract. Prices have fallen below $10 yesterday and now trade below the 50 day moving average at $9.91. Fundamentally, I believe the reasons for new highs have evaporated and the markets have been left with a large carryout forecasted, dropping crude oil prices hurting veg oil demand and South American growing conditions which have yet to warrant any kind of serious premium in the market., 654646=New crop ending stocks for corn and soybeans are also expected to be revised lower as a result of the heavy rains which has prevented planting throughout Missouri and drowned and damaged crops throughout the eastern grain belt. Analysts are expecting 15/16 corn ending stocks to be 1.54 billion bushels, down from 1.771 billion bushels in the last WASDE report. The average trade guess for soybean ending stocks is 370 million bushels from 475 million bushels in June.\u00a0 Analysts expect yield to be lowered by about a bushel per acre for soybeans and 1.4 bushel per acre for corn. \u00a0, 639671=Corn acreage slid 302,000 acres from the March 31st\u00a0report to 88.897 million acres. This will be the lowest corn acreage since 2010, and is below analyst expectations which averaged 89.292 million acres. Wheat acres surprised the market with 56.1 million acres planted in 2015, which is 233,000 acres above the average trade guess and 733,000 acres above the March 31st\u00a0forecast., 448971=Corn is currently trading at its 50 day moving average and is now at a price level scared by consolidation throughout most of February and March. Be aware that selling pressure at these levels is likely following the strong two day rally that lifted us off the short term lows of $3.67. Soybeans are also near a resistance level where the 20 day simple moving average and 50 day simple moving average converge., 132601=This morning the Ukrainian Agricultural Ministry announced the country may export 11.76 million metric tons of wheat this marketing year compared to 9.2 exported last year. This year the countries wheat harvest increased 6.3% due to a higher number of planted acres and better yield. Currently the USDA has Ukrainian wheat exports pegged at 10 million metric tons in the October WASDE report which was unchanged from the previous report in September., 655657=In a poll conducted by Reuters the average analyst guess was for old crop corn and soybean ending stocks to be lowered substantially which would reflect the lower than expected quarterly grain stocks figure released on June 30th. Analysts are also expecting 15/16 corn and soybean production to be lowered due to the excessive rains over the last few months., 26409=Grains are drifting higher following yesterday\u2019s USDA report. Corn is up a penny, November soybeans is up 3 cents and Chicago wheat is up 4. Bull spreading continues to be a theme in the soybean market, with September soybean trading up 6 cents., 103314=September Reported, 240694=For soybeans, the market continues to be buoyed by strong export demand. Current export commitments for US soybeans have eclipsed 40 MMT while USDA has pegged total exports for the year to reach 47.9 MMT. Traders also look for a large crush estimate in Monday\u2019s monthly NOPA release, which is expected to show a record high of 165.4 MB for November., 21629=July Reported, 49178=Trading opened at 8:30 PM Sunday night, which was 1.5 hours later than expected after the CME ran into unspecified technical problems. Those problems have since been resolved., 43617=NOAA will be releasing their September and 90 day weather outlooks this morning. A major focus of this report will be the potential for an early frost/freeze event.\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a0crop progress report showed just 22% of U.S. corn dented compared to a 5 year average of 27% for this week in the growing season. In Iowa just 16% of corn is dented compared to a 5 year average of 25%. Soybeans remain less of a concern in terms of progress as 83% of the crop is setting pods compared to a 5 year average of 79%. Numerous reports have been made from the Pro Farmer Crop Tour that the soybean crop will need more growing degree days to maintain yield potential., 191183=Last week soybeans dropped nearly 30 cents\u00a0on Friday\u00a0to close out the week trading at $10.20. The sharp drop in soybean prices late in the week took us back below the 100 day moving average which currently sits at $10.32. Trend line support for the rally that started from October 1st\u00a0could support soybeans during the early part of the session as traders eye the NOPA crush numbers which is scheduled for release around\u00a011 AM CST. Expectations for the NOPA crush report are to show that soy processors increased production in October crush to $150.781 million bushels according to a poll of market analysts by Reuters., 320048=Ethanol production and stocks will be released today due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday\u00a0on Monday. Ethanol production increased sharply in last week\u2019s report following two holiday shortened weeks of declining production. As of last week 14/15 ethanol production was running 5.3% ahead of last year. Ethanol production this year is significantly higher than the .8% increase the USDA has factored in. Seasonally, production begins to slow during this time of the year and with depressed crush margins throughout the Midwest there is a strong possibility this week\u2019s ethanol production will be lower than last week. On a more positive note, Brazil\u2019s agricultural minister stated this morning that the government will raise its ethanol blend requirement in gasoline in the first week of February., 407289=The grains are mixed this morning with corn up 1 \u00bc cents, soybeans down 3 \u00be cents and wheat in Chicago down 2 \u00bd cents. Traders should keep an eye on the Informa Economics latest crop estimates scheduled for release at\u00a010:30 AM\u00a0this morning. Also on the horizon is the USDA Supply and Demand report to be released on the 10th\u00a0and the NOPA crush figures on the 16th., 100068=Historically we have not seen soybean prices above $9.00 on the board during years of stocks/use similar to 2014/15. November soybean futures have rallied this week, making puts an affordable pricing option into\u00a0tomorrow's\u00a0report. Our longer term bias is still negative for the soybean market, considering current stock estimates and prices on the board., 677077=In the overnight session the grains traded lower again with corn down 5 \u00bc cents, soybeans down 3 cents and wheat down 8 cents. The U.S. dollar is up 1/5th\u00a0of a percent and crude oil 66 cents lower. Corn is trading just above the 50 percent retracement level at $4.09 from the rally that started June 16th\u00a0and recently peaked at 4.54 \u00bc cents on July 14th. November soybeans is trading around the $10 level with a mild support level around $9.92., 350955=Export sales were mixed this morning with soybeans booking 489,700 metric tons this week which was on the high side of analyst expectations. Soybean sales fell 35 percent week over week, but have booked 94 percent of total export sales forecast by the USDA in the January 12th\u00a0crop report. Wheat sales came in a bit lighter than expected this morning booking only 397,600 metric tons compared to expectations of between 300-500 thousand metric tons. Wheat sales declined 27 percent week over week and continues to struggle gaining a competitive edge on the global market. Corn sales were reported at 844,900 metric tons this week, which was on the low side of analyst expectations ranging between 800-1,000 thousand metric tons. Although corn sales declined 12 percent from last week, sales are still ahead of the seasonally adjusted pace to meet USDA expectations by 2.6 million metric tons. Corn has booked 72 percent of anticipated export sales., 168374=Commodity Weather Group is expecting rains in northern Brazil to mitigate any dry patches by the end of the week. Northern Brazil received just 70% of typical rain fall totals during October, forcing many producers to replant acres., 380554=Egypt has set a tender on Tuesday to buy an unspecified amount of U.S. origin wheat for April delivery. A tender from GASC has been expected to purchase U.S. wheat over recent weeks to take advantage of a 100 million dollar credit line provided by the United States., 100870=U.S. soybean production is expected to increase by 60 million bushels in today\u2019s report, with the trade looking for yield to be bumped to 47.59 bushels per acre. Production for 2014/15 is expected at just under 4 billion bushels. Increases in production are expected to more than compensate for the short\u00a0September 1st\u00a0stocks reported in last week's Quarterly Grains Stocks report. Ending stocks are projected to remain relatively unchanged as a decrease in 2013/14 carryout and increased demand side numbers should chew through added production. The average analyst is looking for 2014/15 ending stocks to be down just 3 million bushels at 472 million bushels. All things told, traders are looking for a relatively neutral soybean report when looking at U.S. ending stocks., 157492=Several private analysts will be releasing their updated crop projections ahead of the November 10th\u00a0USDA report. FC Stone will be out today and Informa will give their updated numbers later in the week. Grains have traded sharply higher over the last month with very little consideration for current 2014/15 ending stock estimates., 213815=River terminals found the greatest strength this week thanks to a continued slide in barge rates. At the Illinois River, barge rates at the start of November were around $1.20 a bushel but have now fallen below 80 cents a bushel for the first time since late summer. River terminals as a group were up 7 cents a bushel. For ethanol plants, basis levels were up 3 cents a bushel as a group but there was noticeable weakness this week with about a third of the ethanol plants posting unchanged to lower basis levels. Production at ethanol plants continued to be strong, posting above last week\u2019s marketing year high coming in at 982,000 barrels per day and sets the year-to-date total at 4.5% above last year., 186815=By comparison, soybean export inspections continue to set a blistering pace with 2,481,000 MT for the week and cumulative exports at 13.5 MMT compared to 11.8 MMT for the same period last year.\u00a0 This is 14.4% higher than 2013 while USDA is only factoring in a 4.4% increase year on year. However, basis levels at the Gulf this week were flat with some river terminals in the Upper Midwest seeing lower basis as barge rates there moved higher.\u00a0 Soy plants were up as a group gaining 3.4 cents a bushel, but some areas of Minnesota and Iowa were weaker with 5 to 10 cent declines being fairly common by plants in this region., 98956=Weekly export sales were released at\u00a07:30 AM CST\u00a0and showed that weekly wheat sales were well below expectations recording 372,400 metric tons compared to expectations between 400,000-600,000 metric tons. This week\u2019s sales were down 50 percent from the previous week. Corn sales were reported at 784,800 metric tons which beat analyst expectations which ranged from 550,000-750,000 metric tons. Soybeans also beat analyst expectations by only a few thousand metric tons but recorded a strong sales figure for the wee at 923,400.\u00a0, 409156=The U.S. Dollar index is pushing higher this morning, closing in on the 95.85 level it traded at back on January 26th. If it closes above that level it is likely that the dollar will resume its upward trend and start another leg higher. Strength in the U.S. dollar is a main reason why U.S. wheat exports have been noncompetitive on the global market., 152689=Northern Brazil is expecting more precipitation today through\u00a0Sunday\u00a0in key growing regions. This comes at a crucial time for planting pace as AgRural projects planting is down 30% compared to last year in northern Brazil. The longer term forecast has turned more dry, with rain events unlikely as we enter the November 6th\u00a0\u2013 November 10th\u00a0time frame. Planting pace in Northern Brazil will be closely watched over the next two weeks., 179996=Wheat found strong buying interest yesterday but showed little follow through in the night session. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia continue to escalate which puts at risk trade movement out of those countries. In addition, dry and cold weather continues to be problematic for the Ukraine crop. Nearly a third of Ukrainian winter grain crops sown for the 2015 harvest are under threat and could be damaged by frosts, the state weather forecaster said\u00a0on Thursday.\u00a0 These are crops that were sown too late - in the second half of October.\u00a0 Also, sub-zero temperatures in Colorado and Kansas pose some risk for winter wheat in the U.S., 561524=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with soybeans leading the charge down 6 \u00bd cents, corn down 1 \u00bc cents and wheat down 4 cents going into this morning\u2019s pause in trade. The U.S. dollar is positive this morning by a small margin and crude oil is up 59 cents. New crop soybeans has broken through 9.27 1/2 support that was its lows back in late September and\u00a0early October. This technical failure could cause additional selling pressure as stops are triggered and momentum traders look to enter positions.\u00a0\u00a0, 338259=Yesterday, it was announced that the USDA\u2019s attach\u00e9 in Canberra Australia pegged the countries 14/15 wheat production at 23.2 million metric tons which is .8 million metric tons below the existing USDA forecast. The forecast was cut due to dryness in late 2014 which especially affected Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Due to the dry weather the USDA is expecting a 16% decline in yields compared to last year and a 14% decline in wheat production compared to last year\u2019s total of 27.01 million metric tons., 550905=This morning Russia announced that they will remove the wheat export duty until a new formula can be introduced on July 1st. By removing the export duty, it is estimated that the country\u2019s exports will increase by 1 million metric tons this marketing year., 636263=In a Reuter's poll of analysts the average analyst guess for the quarterly grain stocks is 718 million bushels for wheat, 4.555 billion bushels of corn and 670 million bushels of soybeans. This would be a draw down in grain stocks from 1.124 billion bushels of wheat, 7.745 billion bushels of corn and 1.334 billion bushels of soybeans reported on\u00a0March 1st. Traders will be watching corn stocks closely to gauge feed demand which could be negatively influenced by the bird flu this year.\u00a0, 292358=Soybean production for 2014 is also expected to see a slight decline by only 2 million bushels. Yield is expected to increase by .1 bushels per acre, but acres are anticipated to drop by 359,000. Neither corn nor soybeans are expecting a sizeable revision in the production side of the balance sheet. \u00a0\u00a0, 445680=China has turned to Ukraine and away from the U.S. to source corn. In January only 13,663 metric tons of U.S. corn was imported into China which was down 93 percent from last year. However, Ukrainian corn imports have surged in February to 574,000 metric tons, up nearly 200 percent from last year.\u200b, 147837=Corn, soybeans and wheat have continued to move higher following yesterday\u2019s technical breakout for soybeans. Coming into the morning trade break soybeans is up 15 cents, wheat is up 7 cents, and corn is up. A surging spot soymeal market as contributed to strength out of soybeans. Just in the last two days the December soymeal contract has broken out and rallied nearly 10%.\u00a0, 353567=Wheat has found continued support thanks to news Egypt\u2019s GASC may be in the market for US-only SRW wheat. However, the decision to buy US-only wheat may not be strictly a result of better prices. Instead, Mamdouh Abdel Fattah, vice chairman of the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), said Egypt has a special $100 million credit line the United States made available to the Egyptian government in recent years for purchases of U.S. wheat. He went on to suggest \"This has been an option for us for some time, so if the prices are right and we feel the need to use that to buy U.S. wheat, we will.\u201d \u00a0Overall, however, US export business remains slow. Thursday\u2019s weekly US sales report showed only 397,000 MT. On Thursday, EU showed a record high week of 1.674 MMT, besting the previous record in 2010 of 1.03 MT, 369798=The Brazilian government\u2019s crop supply agency Conab cut its corn and soybean production estimates for Brazil in a recently released report. Corn production was lowered to 78.4 MMT from 79.1 MMT in January. Soybean production was lowered to 94.6 MMT from 95.9 MMT.\u00a0, 103384=2014/15 Ending Stocks, 127285=Crop progress will be issued\u00a0today at 3.30 PM CST\u00a0with many analysts expecting corn harvest progress to be in the low thirties and soybeans to be around 50% percent complete. The five year average from 2008-2012 is 53% percent harvested for corn and 69% harvested for Soybeans. The weather looks to allow field work early this week with today and\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0dry throughout the entire corn-belt.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0looks to bring some light showers that shouldn\u2019t impact harvest significantly. The 6-10 day forecast looks to be drier than average allowing producers a window to wrap up their harvest., 595465=Traders will be watching the June WASDE report which is scheduled for release out at\u00a011 AM CST on Wednesday. According to a Reuters poll of Analysts the average guess for old crop corn endings stocks is 1.859 billion bushels up from 1.851 billion bushels last month. Analysts are also expecting wheat ending stocks to rise to 712 million bushels which would be up 3 million bushels from May. Old crop Soybean ending stocks are expected to fall by 11 MBU to 339 million bushels., 298060=Soybean Production: Average Analyst Guess-Soybean production for 2014 is also expected to see a slight decline by only 2 million bushels. Yield is expected to increase by .1 bushels per acre, but acres are anticipated to drop by 359,000. Neither corn nor soybeans are expecting a sizable revision in the production side of the balance sheet. \u00a0\u00a0, 246336=This morning wheat prices continue to rise on news from the Russian Agriculture minister after he stated a plan to buy 3.5 million metric tons of grains for state stocks in an attempt to raise Russian grain prices. Yesterday, the slide in the ruble was the largest one-day fall since 1998 and triggered the Russian Central Bank to raise its key interest rate to 17 percent from 10.5 percent. The ruble hit a record low of 80 rubles per dollar.\u00a0, 281001=Informa Economics will release its January crop estimate at\u00a010:30 AM CST\u00a0this morning.\u00a0, 365475=South America will be highly focused on this report as harvest begins to pick up pace in the southern hemisphere. Some traders believe that revisions in Brazil and Argentina production will occur in next month\u2019s WASDE report with such little harvest data available at this time. However, January was an exceptionally dry month for the northern part of Brazil providing 40 percent less moisture than normal over the last 30 days. With the precipitation significantly less than normal it is likely we see at least a minor revision in production in South America. The average analyst expects Brazil soybean production to be cut to 94.67 million metric tons, and corn production to be cut by nearly a half million metric tons. These production cuts will most likely be offset with increases in Argentina corn and soybean production, with the average analyst expecting 22.54 MMT and 55.58 MMT respectively., 306705=Also\u00a0on Thursday, Informa Economics will release its 2015 acreage forecast update which will include implications for U.S. production in the 15/16 marketing year., 110981=NOPA crush numbers will be released\u00a0on Wednesday at 11:00 AM\u00a0central time., 601593=In the overnight session the grains traded higher with soybeans up 4 1/2 cents, wheat up 2 1/2 cents and corn unchanged this morning. The U.S. dollar is helping grains this morning, trading down nearly 1/2 a percent. Crude oil is trading higher by $1.28 this morning after the EIA raised its 2015 oil demand growth forecast., 207125=Today and\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0we will see heavy liquidation of the December contracts as First Notice day is on the 28th\u00a0following the Thanksgiving holiday. Open interest in the December contracts are 147,663 contracts of corn, 26,577 in wheat, 1,822 contracts in oats, 31,029 in soymeal and 25,149 contracts of soyoil., 685789=In the overnight session the grains traded sharply lower with corn down 10 1/2 cents this morning, soybeans down 13 cents this morning and wheat down 5 1/2 cents this morning for the December contracts. The U.S. Dollar is trading over 1/2 a percent lower and crude oil is also lower, losing 80 cents this morning., 436845=China purchased over 600,000 metric tons of corn from Ukraine this year which is not a positive story for the U.S. corn market. China, a country which typically doesn\u2019t import large amounts of corn, has turned to Ukraine to source its needs. In a statement made this month, China intends to double the nearly one million metric tons of corn it imported from Ukraine in 2014. In January Ukraine shipped 470,000 metric tons to China, which was well over the amount exported to China by the U.S., 418668=In the overnight, the grains traded higher with corn up 4 \u00bd cents, soybeans up 2 cents and wheat up 7 \u00be cents. The U.S. dollar is trading sideways this morning after a sharp move higher last Friday.

Rains forecast across the Midwest this week helped lift soybean prices as traders became nervous about the remaining unplanted acreage. Allendale estimates corn planted acreage at 91.742 million acres which is up from the 89.199 million acres forecast by the USDA in March. Allendale expects soybean acreage to increase to 85.105 million acres which is up from 84.635 million acres estimated by the USDA in the March 31st\u00a0report. The July soybean contract is currently above the 100 day moving average but is giving back some of its gains this morning. Look at 974 1/4 as a support level for today and tomorrows trade session. \u00a0\u00a0, 591883=The wheat market has traded sharply higher this week. After opening at $4.78\u00a0on Monday, July Chicago Wheat is now trading at $5.21 with the possibility of trading over resistance near 5.30 1/4 which is set from the previous high back on May 18th. Concerns about hot dry weather in India, the impact of the heavy rains in Oklahoma and Texas last week and dry conditions throughout Europe and parts of Russia has triggered some short covering, despite ample global ending stocks. Even with the rally in futures this week, wheat still remains firmly in its downtrend., 260707=The markets were mostly mixed in the overnight session with corn down \u00bc cent, soybeans down 4 cents on the January contract and wheat up 3 \u00bc cents higher.

Today is the last day to get out of any March grain contracts with first notice day Friday the 27th., 367804=Soybean ending stocks declined 25 million bushels from the January report to 385 million bushels. Both export sales and crushings increased in February\u2019s by 20 million bushels and 15 million bushels respectively., 420973=The grains are trading lower in the overnight session with corn declining 1 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 3 \u00be cents and wheat trading 5 cents lower going into this morning\u2019s pause. The U.S. dollar is up again this morning increasing over \u00bd a percent in the overnight session. This morning at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0the USDA will release their March Supply and Demand Report., 600702=For new crop, analysts are expecting both corn and wheat ending stocks to rise while soybean ending stocks decline from the May report. The average guess for new crop corn ending stocks is 1.779 billion bushels up from 1.746 billion bushels in May. Wheat ending stocks are also expected to rise, with expectations of 798 million bushels from 793 last month. Soybean ending stocks are expected to decline this month with the average trade guess looking for 487 million bushel carryout compared to 500 million bushels in May.\u00a0, 538997=Keep a close watch on South America production as both Argentina and Brazil has had better than expected harvests. The average analyst guess expects Argentina corn production to increase nearly 1 million metric tons to 24.95 MMT and soybean production to increase 1.5 MMT to 58.5 MMT. Brazil corn production is also expected to increase to 76.87 MMT from 75MMT in the April report. Brazil soybean production is expected to stay mostly unchanged at 94 MMT. \u00a0, 23324=This\u00a0morning\u2019s USDA report will be the\u00a0first survey based yield estimate of the year. Yield figures will be the focus of the\u00a0report\u00a0following a July that saw ample moisture in the eastern grain belt but a return of drought conditions in Nebraska and the Dakotas. Below are trade expectations for the\u00a0report\u00a0and our take on the numbers. Please call our office if you have questions about speculative or hedge positions coming into the\u00a0report. Our number is\u00a0877-472-4607and we are available between\u00a08AM and 5PM\u00a0central time., 423369=The dollar index continues to rally in the overnight reaching 99.145 in a rally that started after breaking through 95.90 on March 4th. The grains are also moving higher in the overnight with corn up 3 \u00be cents, soybeans up 5 \u00be cents and wheat up 6 \u00bd cents this morning. Be aware that the May Corn chart has resistance from the 100 and 50 day moving averages at 3.94 \u00bd and 3.95 \u00be., 372701=Corn export sales beat analyst expectations by increasing 19 percent week over week and booking 1,003,100 metric tons. This week\u2019s sales were well above the 600,000-800,000 metric tons expected by the market. Soybeans also had a fantastic week booking 745,400 metric tons which is up 52 percent from last week and nearly double the 250,000-450,000 metric tons expected by the market. Soybean sales are still well ahead of pace even after accounting for the 20 million bushel increase in the February WASDE report. Wheat sales improved only 3 percent over last week with a weekly total of 409,300 metric tons compared to expectations of 300,000-500,000 metric tons., 437706=In the overnight session the grains rebounded a bit after breaking through key support yesterday. The dollar index remains steady and crude oil has fallen a dollar overnight. Corn is up 2 1/4 cents, soybeans are up 6 cents and wheat is up 2 1/2 cents this morning.

Traders are watching the statement closely for indication that the first rate hike since 2006 may be near., 321837=The Agricultural ministry in Argentina announced an increase in their wheat production estimates after harvest has wrapped up. Argentina is expected to have harvested 13.9 million metric tons of wheat in the 2014/15 season up from its previous estimate of 13.2 million metric tons. The ministry also lowered its planted acreage for corn and soybean\u2019s by .1 million hectares and .2 million hectares respectively. \u00a0\u00a0, 271456=Wednesday the 31st is the first notice day for January Soybean, Soyoil and Soymeal contracts. To avoid delivery make sure all long positions have been liquidated by the close of trade today. Thursday January 1st, the market will be closed. Trading will resume on Friday at 8.30 AM CST. The USDA will release the weekly export sales report on Friday January 2nd., 615961=On the river systems, high water is causing issues with barge traffic and the result has been a sharp increase in barge costs.\u00a0 In ethanol news, output for the week was off 12,000 barrels per day to 980,000 barrels per day but the big change was a large jump in ethanol stocks, which were up 472,000 barrels to 20.72 million barrels, the highest point since May 1., 427838=Analysts are expecting 148.537 million bushels of soybeans crushed in the month of February which would be the largest February crush on record and a nearly 7 million bushel increase from last year. In a poll of eight analysts the average crush estimate ranged from 143.2 million bushels to 160.5 million bushels. Analysts see soyoil stocks coming in at 1.332 billion lbs which would be up from 1.228 billion lbs last month., 8299=August Expected, 562930=Yesterday, the EIA weekly ethanol report showed a sharp jump in production by 46,000 barrels per day to a total of 958,000 barrels per day. This decisively ends the two week slump in ethanol production that brought weekly totals below 2013 levels. However, routine facility maintenance played a big role in the early may production slump and it appears production is picking back up again as we move into driving season. Ethanol production year to date is up 4.8 percent compared to the USDA\u2019s expectations which only show a 1.3 percent increase YOY. Ethanol stocks also climbed by 135,000 barrels to 20.43 million barrels this week. \u00a0, 105694=This report met trade expectations for soybeans and will do little to firm new crop prices on the board. Expectations for this report were relatively bearish, and traders were provided confirmation of their yield and production expectations. At the moment,\u00a0November 14\u00a0soybeans are off 2 cents., 546662=In the overnight session the grains traded higher with wheat up 4 cents, soybeans up 5 1/2 cents and corn unchanged going into the morning pause in trade. The U.S. dollar is trading down sharply this morning after retail sales revealed no growth in April.

Wheat in Ukraine and Russia received widespread rain over the weekend, accumulating .25-1.5 inches of rain over the past four days leaving only 15 percent of Russian wheat lacking adequate moisture. \u00a0\u00a0, 431636=Weather this week is expected to be wetter for the Plains which have been experiencing excessive dryness. Although the precipitation is expected to be light throughout the next 10 days the added moisture should provide some benefit to the region\u2019s wheat. Brazil continues to get precipitation in the north which has slowed harvest in the region. Despite the rains, there are no significant concerns for that region yet. Argentina looks to see drier weather over the next 6-15 days which should help the northern fields which have been saturated by heavy rains throughout February and March. \u00a0 \u00a0, 422364=Global ending stocks for corn fell by 4.36 million metric tons in March as a result of higher U.S. usage and a 2 million metric ton production decline out of South Africa from hot dry weather conditions. Argentina production was increased by .5 MMT, but the rest of Argentina corn and soybean production was left unchanged., 401509=In the overnight the grains traded higher with corn up \u00bc of a cent, soybeans up 3 \u00bd cents and wheat up 6 \u00be cents going into this morning\u2019s pause.

This included the large sale to Mexico reported on October 10th. Corn\u2019s sales number was on the high side of expectations. Soybeans sold 935,000 metric tons which was also on the high side of analyst expectations, with China being the primary buyer., 691020=In the overnight session the grains traded slightly lower with corn down 5 1/4 cents, soybean down 3/4 of a cent and wheat trading down 5 cents this morning as nearly ideal Midwest weather continues to be the focus. December corn is now only 18 cents off the lows it printed on June 15th\u00a0and 16th. The U.S. dollar is trading a fraction of a percent higher and crude oil is down 43 cents. Asian markets traded higher\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0with Shanghai closing up 3.44 percent., 5903=2014/15 Soybeans, 303433=Today we will also see Informa Economics\u2019 projected acreage for the 2015/16 marketing year., 202010=For soybeans, basis levels mostly improved and the falling barge rates helped push basis levels higher there. However, soybean sales were on the light side of expectations with only 483,000 MT of new business as compared to expectations of 700,000 to 1,000,000 MT. For bean plants, basis levels were mostly flat but overall slightly improved with a 2-cent gain.

This would be a draw down in grain stocks from 1.124 billion bushels of wheat, 7.745 billion bushels of corn and 1.334 billion bushels of soybeans reported on March 1st. The Quarterly Grain Stocks report will be released at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0tomorrow., 165683=Wheat export sales showed only 265,800 MT were sold between October 24-30th, which was down 40 percent from the previous week and missing analyst expectations of between 325,000-525,000 MT. Yesterday, GASC announced that France and Ukraine won the international wheat tenders showing that U.S wheat is struggling to maintain competitiveness on the global market., 381077=NOPA crush numbers were within analyst expectations for the month of January. In the report released at 11 AM CST, the National Oilseed Processors Association announced that 162.675 million bushels of soybeans were crushed in January compared to expectations of 162.673 million bushels.

This is the 3rd\u00a0straight week of ethanol production increases despite the lagging energy sector. Seasonally, it is normal to see an increase in ethanol production from March through June. Ethanol ending stocks were also increased this week by 497,000 barrels per day to 21.32 million barrels., 308234=The grains continued their selling in the overnight after a sharp day lower caused by significant fund liquidation. Going into the morning pause in trading corn is down 6 cents, soybeans is trading down 6 cents and wheat is 5 \u00be cents lower.

This month's corn yield estimates were reported at 174.2 bushels per acre which was only \u00bd a bushel per acre less than the average trade guess. Production was bumped by 55 million bushels reflecting the quarterly grain stocks report on September 30th. Production was increased to 14.475 billion bushels which was 31 million bushels less than the average trade guess. After feed use was increased by 50 million bushels and imports were decreased by 5 million bushels the ending stocks were forecast to be 2.081 billion bushels for the 14/15 marketing year which was 49 million bushels under the markets expectations., 450123=Lanworth released their latest planted acreage forecasts this morning raising its U.S. soybean seedings estimates to 85.5 million acres and its U.S. corn planting estimate to 88.2 million acres. This compares to Informa Economics estimates of 88.5 million acres of corn planted and 87.5 million acres of soybeans planted in the 2015 growing season.\u00a0, 252035=In the overnight session the grains are trading sharply higher with corn up 5 \u00bc cents, soybeans up 7 \u00bc cents and wheat up 15 \u00bd cents this morning. This morning we saw large single day reportable sales of 126,000 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations, 1.5 million metric tons of soybeans to China for 15/16 and an 89,264 metric tons sale of spring wheat to Mexico for 2014/15., 103674=The USDA will release their most recent supply and demand numbers today, October 10th. Below are trade expectations coming into the report and our bias on the numbers., 663532=The charts are also raising a warning flag for corn in particular. December corn reached a critical resistance level of $4.54 yesterday which was near a previous low set back in January and again in June of 2014. That price level which acted as support in 2014 acted as strong resistance\u00a0on Tuesday. Furthermore, the 100 period moving average on the weekly chart is currently at $4.40, and could also provide some resistance to any attempted move higher. With the weather turning positive and the charts showing clear resistance around these levels we are concerned that prices could come under pressure over the next few weeks.\u00a0, 685458=December corn gapped lower this morning opening at $3.99 after closing\u00a0on Friday\u00a0at $4.02. It will be important to pay close attention to the close of today\u2019s session since there are many levels of support that cross at $3.98 including the 62 percent retracement, the 100 day moving average and a trend. A rebound this morning with a close above $3.98 could signal a short term bottom in prices., 515204=In the overnight session the grains were mixed with corn up 1 1/2 cents, soybeans up 9 1/4 cents and wheat down 2 1/4 cents. First notice day for May grain contracts is\u00a0Thursday\u00a0the 30th. Be sure to either liquidate or roll those may contracts by the close of trade\u00a0on Wednesday., 362826=Traders will be focusing on any South American revisions to corn and soybean forecasts as harvest begins to pick up pace in the southern hemisphere. Analysts are expecting both Argentina corn and soybean production to increase by a half million metric tons, while Brazil production is expected to decline. The average analyst guess expects Brazilian soybean production to shed .8 million metric tons from the January forecast due to the dry conditions in the northern part of the growing region. Brazil corn production is also expected to decline .5 MMT to 74.56 million metric tons., 219532=Wheat gains have been capped by falling corn prices as the spread between Chicago March wheat and Chicago March Corn climbed to $2.20 yesterday. The premium has risen rapidly since November 11th, increasing 75 cents as concerns about Russian trade barriers helped wheat rally to 20 week highs. There will be freezing conditions in the Volga valley this week with temperatures last night creating a winter kill scenario that likely damaged crops. Limited snow in that region will lead to damage to as much as 15% of FSU wheat.\u00a0, 233606=Overnight, CONAB pegged Brazil\u2019s soybean crop at 95.8 MMT up sharply from their previous forecast in November of 90.5 MMT. This compares to analyst estimates of 93.4 MMT going into the USDA report this morning. For corn, analysts expect USDA to cut their output projection for Brazil to 74 MMT from last month\u2019s projection of 75 MMT. A late soybean planting season has analyst\u2019s looking for a smaller second-crop of corn in Brazil this year., 662449=In the overnight session the grains were mixed with corn down 1 3/4 cents, soybeans up 4 1/2 cents and wheat up 1 1/2 cents this morning. Soybeans traded as high as 10.45 3/4 in the overnight session which was a recent high set back on July 1st. Traders will preparing for the NOPA crush numbers which will be released out at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0on Wednesday, July 15th. \u00a0Monday\u00a0the USDA announced private export sales of 91,445 metric tons of corn for the 15/16 crop year and another 30,482 metric tons for deliver to Mexico in 16/17., 411159=Ethanol production dropped again this week, declining 16,000 barrels per day to 931,000 barrels per day. Despite the decline in production we are still well ahead of the pace of production seen last year. Ethanol stocks declined as well, falling 66,000 barrels to 21.53 million barrels. Traders will be watching the next WASDE report on March 10th\u00a0to see if the USDA will increase their corn used for ethanol line item to reflect the strong pace we have seen in the first half of the marketing year., 306520=Although the U.S. wheat market hasn\u2019t been able to find any traction after printing highs of $6.77 on December 18th\u00a0it appears French wheat has been benefiting the Russian curb in exports. Farm office FranceAgriMer cut French 14/15 soft wheat ending stocks to 4.34 million metric tons from 4.55 million metric tons last month. Exports were also increased to 8.8 million metric tons compared to 8.5 million metric tons last month.\u00a0, 279161=There have been fresh inquiries by China into buying U.S. DDG\u2019s following purchases last month. In each of the last two years China has purchased over 4 million metric tons of DDG\u2019s from the U.S. However, in late 2013 and early 2014 nearly one million metric tons of DDG\u2019s were rejected by customs because of trace amounts of the unapproved GMO strain MIR-162.\u00a0 China has since approved the strain but many traders are still expecting a much larger down payment for DDG\u2019s to be purchased and shipped to China.\u00a0, 157927=Northern Brazil received precipitation over the weekend but the trade remains concerns about output moving forward. Rainfall totals have been 30% behind normal during October, delaying planting and forcing some producers to replant. The 7 day outlook has turned a bit more dry over the weekend \u2013 we will continue to monitor the pace of planting in Mato Grasso.\u00a0, 291116=December, 167779=Monday\u00a0the 10th\u00a0the USDA will release its November WASDE report.\u00a0, 640483=The June 30th\u00a0planted acreage report showed lower than expected planted acreage estimates for corn and soybeans. For the second year in a row the U.S. is planting record soybean acreage estimated at 85.139 million acres which was higher than the March 31st\u00a0acreage numbers, but slightly lower than analyst expectations which averaged 85.171 million acres. The USDA followed their acreage report with an announcement that they will be resurveying Cotton, Soybeans and Sorghum acres in Texas, Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri after excessive rain caused planting delays., 622882=On Friday, Informa Economics lowered its estimate of U.S. soybean plantings this year to 86.760 million acres down from 87.185 million acres in its previous forecast. Despite the downgrade, Informa is still above the current USDA estimates of 84.635 million acres which was released in March. The USDA will revise its Planted Acreage estimate on June 30th., 389082=For corn, export demand and ethanol use continue to be strong demand stimuli. Friday\u2019s export sales report showed over 900,000 MT of old-crop sales, surpassing analyst expectations of 650-900,000 MT. Physical exports of only 696,000 MT meant that outstanding sales, or the amount of grain left to be shipped, continuing to grow to 17.4 MMT. River terminals appear to be bidding more aggressively for March delivery versus spot, with March premiums fetching 7 to 9 cents over most spot deliveries. This likely will help improve basis in the coming weeks. For ethanol, weekly production grew by 3,000 barrels per day and continues to eclipse last year\u2019s pace. Year-to-date production is up 5.7 percent from the same period last year, while USDA is only looking for a 2.3 percent increase in corn use for ethanol., 419998=This morning Brazil\u2019s government crop agency cut 14/15 soybean production forecasts to 93.3 million metric tons down from 94.6 million metric tons reported in February. The most recent USDA forecast pegs Brazilian production at 94.5 MMT. Conab also revised expected corn production lower to 78.2 million metric tons from 78.4 in its February report. \u00a0, 477380=The average analyst expectations for the WASDE report according to a Reuters poll of 20 analysts is as follows. The average guess among the analysts polled for wheat ending stocks is 692 million bushels, up one million bushels from the March report. Corn ending stocks are expected to be reported at 1.854 billion bushels up from 1.777 billion bushels reported in the March WASDE report. Soybean ending stocks are expected to come in around 370 million bushels which would be a decline of 15 million bushels from the March report., 177318=Ukraine\u2019s farm ministry projects that farmers there will sow 6.3 million hectares of winter wheat for the 2015 grain harvest as of Nov. 10, exceeding the original forecast of 6.2 million and last year\u2019s acreage of 6.1 million. Overnight, Russia announced it was in talks with China over possibly supplying grain. The move comes as China pledges to strengthen control over its grain imports to try to cut oversupply., 290017=In the January WASDE report analysts are expecting ending stocks to rise for wheat by 12 million bushels to 666 million bushels carryout. Corn and soybean ending stocks are both expected to decline in this month\u2019s report. The average analyst guess has corn expected to decline by 71 million bushels to a 1.927 billion bushels carryout and soybeans to shrink 17 million bushel to 393 million bushels as a result of strong export sales which have booked 90% of the current USDA expectation already with 34 weeks left in the marketing year.\u00a0, 231687=Wednesday,\u00a0the USDA Supply and Demand report will be released at\u00a011:00 AM CST. In a survey of 20 analysts by Reuters these are the average analyst expectations., 149006=Soybean meal is trading higher this morning, up another 1.15% going into the morning pause. Soybean Meal has been the leader to the upside since the beginning of October increasing from $300 per ton to $379 per ton this morning. The soybean meal spread has inverted since October 1st\u00a0showing that supply concerns for soybean meal delivered in December has become a big concern. Prices for soybean meal have traded as high as $399.8 per ton yesterday as strong meal exports combined with the slower than normal harvest, rail issues and less active farmer selling has slowed pressured the cash soybean meal market domestically.\u00a0, 307430=Thursday\u00a0the 15th\u00a0will be another important day for traders to watch closely. NOPA crush numbers for December will be released at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0and are expected to show a record for number of bushels crushed for that month. Analysts expect to see 166.9 million bushels of soybeans crushed in the month of December above the previous record of 165.384 in December of 2013. The analysts crush guesses range from 164.263-171.135 million bushels. Analysts expect the average soyoil stocks to reach 1.122 billion pounds up from 1.005 billion pounds in November., 264757=Russia has officially introduced grain export duties starting February 1st. The duties will be roughly 15% of the customs price plus an additional $7.5 euros with a minimum duty set at 35 euros per metric ton. Grain exports are continuing out of Russia in the near term despite talks on Wednesday that grain movement had halted as a result of export restrictions., 284497=Yesterday, Informa economics released their January crop estimates at\u00a010:30 AM CST. They lowered their soybean yield by .3 BPA to 47.6 on par with the USDA\u2019s estimate of 47.5 BPA. Informa also lowered their production 22 million bushels to 3.969 billion bushels which compares to the December WASDE report showing 3.958 billion bushels. Corn yield was cut by 1.7 bushels per acre to 172.7 BPA, dragging down their production estimates by 68 million bushels. Informa\u2019s production estimates are 18 million bushels higher than the December WASDE forecast. All together the market reaction to these numbers was minimal at the release., 250906=Yesterday ethanol production was released showing another increase in weekly production. Production jumped 2,000 barrels per day, setting another marketing year high at 990,000 barrels per day.\u00a0 Despite the strong production numbers this week there seems to be a slowdown on the horizon. The average ethanol prices in Iowa have been declining over the last couple weeks with late November ethanol prices going from $2.31-$2.52 dollars per gallon to around $1.88-2.15 per gallon. Crush margins have fallen accordingly from $3.42 per bushel to around $2.90., 467667=In the overnight session corn was mostly steady up 1/2 a cent, soybeans were up 5 3/4 cents and wheat in Chicago traded down 1 1/2 cents. Today we will most likely continue to see fallout from the Prospective Plantings report which was more bullish for soybeans and more negative for corn. Some buying interest has appeared in the overnight when a South Korean company announced they will be purchasing 140,000 metric tons of corn in an international tender and the Japan\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture saying it will seek 120,000 metric tons of feed wheat and 200,000 metric tons of feed barley for September delivery., 398252=Exports sales for corn were weaker than expected, while wheat and soybeans reported sales on the low side of analyst expectations. For the week ending February 19th corn export sales totaled to 715,800 MT which was down 23 percent from last week. Analysts were expecting to see corn sales between 900,000 and 1,100,000 metric tons. Soybean export sales were on the low side of expectations booking 459,200 MT compared to expectations between 450,000-650,000 metric tons. Soybean sales are still well ahead of the pace needed to meet USDA expectations. Wheat sales were reported 328,300 metric tons of sales, within the analyst expectations and up 23 percent from the previous week., 248296=Note:\u00a0Friday\u00a0Informa Economics will issue its 2015 acreage update. \u00a0, 244277=For soybeans, traders will be watching today\u2019s monthly NOPA crush estimate. Industry analysts expect a large crush estimate, which is expected to show a record high of 165.4 MB for November. In South America, production prospects still look promising for a bumper crop. Although USDA left their soy crop estimate for South America unchanged in last week\u2019s report, private analysts continue to predict higher production levels. In Brazil, rainfall across the region has been above normal over the past 30 days., 695010=The latest Planalytics corn and soybean yield forecast was released\u00a0on Friday, which is based on satellite imagery and uses the NDVI index which basically measures the greenness of the crop. Planalytics corn yield was revised higher by 1.3 bushels per acre to 166.7 BPA. Soybean yield held steady from the previous forecast of 45.6 bushels per acre on July 15th. This forecast is updated every two weeks.\u00a0, 383166=The USDA Ag Outlook Forum begins today and continues through\u00a0Friday\u00a0the 20th. Traders were watching the release of acreage estimates this morning which showed corn at 89 million acres planted from 90.6 million acres planted last year. The USDA projected soybean acres at 83.5 million acres from 83.7 million acres planted in 2015. Soybean acres were a bit of a surprise to traders who were expecting acreage to increase year over year. Informa\u2019s latest soybean acreage forecast for 2015 was 88.03. Planted acreage for U.S. wheat estimated to decline 1.3 million acres. \u00a0\u00a0, 319174=Ukraine Farm Ministry announced that they have an agreement with traders to limit the amount of milling wheat exports to 1.2 million metric tons between January and June of this year and have a preliminary agreement that overall wheat exports will be limited to 12.8 million metric tons in the 2014/15 marketing year which is 1.8 million metric tons higher than the USDA currently forecasts. So far Ukraine has exported 8.5 million metric tons this marketing year., 235600=Traders will look for better guidance today when USDA releases their monthly Supply & Demand Report at 11 am CDT. Analysts as a group expect USDA to increase corn and wheat carryout projections in this month\u2019s report compared to the November forecast. But, for soybeans, the average trade estimate shows analysts looking for a cut in US carryout from 450 MB in November to 427 MB this month. Strong export demand for soybeans is helping fuel expectations of slimmer stocks. On Monday, representatives of six Chinese soybean buyers said they would sign an agreement later this month with U.S. exporters to buy an unspecified amount of soybeans. China, the world's largest soybean importer, is forecast by USDA to buy 74 MMT of the oilseed from global suppliers this year. A similar signing ceremony in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in September yielded purchase agreements for 4.8 MMT.\u00a0, 547693=Ethanol production jumped week over week by 25,000 barrels per day bringing total weekly production to 912,000 bpd. Despite the weekly improvement ethanol production is still in a downward trend that began in December. This week\u2019s figures mark only the third time this marketing year that weekly production fell below 2013 levels. Cumulative ethanol production is up 4.8 percent from 2013, which is ahead of USDA expectations for an increase of 1.3 percent over last year. The May WASDE report left corn used for ethanol unchanged on the balance sheet., 660317=In the overnight session, the grains are trading slightly lower with corn down 1 1/4 cents on the September contract, soybeans down 7 1/4 cents and wheat down 4 3/4 cents going into this morning\u2019s pause in trade. The U.S dollar is trading up 1/2 a percent and crude oil is down 70 cents this morning., 439467=Export sales were within analyst expectations for soybeans and wheat, but on the low side of expectations for corn. Wheat booked 391,900 metric tons for the week ending March 12th, up 12 percent from the previous week. Corn sales were reported at 502,300 metric tons up 20 percent from last week but on the low side of expectations which ranged from 500,000-700,000 metric tons. Soybean sales fell within analyst expectations with 342,000 metric tons booked for 14/15 delivery. Expectations for soybean sales ranged from 250,000-450,000 metric tons., 655983=In the overnight session the grains continued higher with corn up 3 cents, soybeans up 8 1/4 cents and wheat trading 6 1/2 cents higher. The U.S. dollar is trading 1 percent lower and crude oil is up 48 cents this morning. Keep in mind that the July Supply and Demand report will be released at 11 CST today., 486114=On Wednesday April 15th\u00a0the March NOPA crush numbers will be released. Analysts are expecting 155.261 million bushels of soybeans to have been crushed for the month of March, the largest on record since last year\u2019s record of 153.840 million bushels. Analysts are also expecting soyoil stocks to come in at 1.383 billion pounds, up from 1.322 billion pounds last month.\u00a0, 21373=August Expected, 374452=The market is awaiting the NOPA crush numbers\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0which are expected to decline from last month\u2019s report to 162.673 million bushels in January. This would be a sharp increase from January 2014 crush numbers which were 156.943 million bushels. Soyoil stocks are expected to come in at 1.170 billion pounds in the\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0report, up from 1.067 billion pounds the previous report., 262791=In the overnight session corn traded \u00bc cent higher, soybeans is down 4 cents and wheat in Chicago is down 3 \u00bd cents. The market closes early today at\u00a012:00 CST today\u00a0and will reopen at 8:30 CST on Friday\u00a0morning. \u00a0, 327855=AgRural said in a report issued\u00a0on Friday\u00a0that they plan on cutting their forecast for Brazil\u2019s soybean production in their February report due to the dry weather which has damaged soybean development in the northern part of the country. Over the last 30 days northern Brazil has received 60% less precipitation than its average during the same period in time. \u00a0, 540127=Traders will be watching the May supply and demand report due out\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0at\u00a011 AM CST. The average trade guess expects old crop wheat and corn stocks to increase since last month\u2019s WASDE report.\u00a0 Wheat ending stocks are expected to climb to 693 million bushels from 684 million bushels in April. Corn ending stocks are also expected to climb to 1.864 billion bushels from 1.827 billion bushels last month. The average trade guess expects to see soybean ending stocks fall by 10 million bushels to 360 million bushels as strong weekly export sales force the USDA to revise demand numbers higher. The average trade guess pegs new crop ending stocks for wheat at 750 million bushels, corn at 1.752 billion bushels and soybean carryout at 443 million bushels., 631571=In other parts of the world dry weather is beginning to be a concern. The conditions of French wheat declined this week according to the FranceAgriMer who cited dry weather as the main reason. As of June 22nd\u00a0the good to excellent ratings fell to 81 percent compared to 85 percent a week earlier and 87 percent on June 8th. Weather in France is expected to remain hot and dry with temperatures forecast to hit record highs next week in many parts of the country.\u200b, 107422=Soybean harvested acres were dropped by 700,000 acres to 83.4 million. Yield was raised to 47.1 bushels per acre, 0.5 bushels per acre below trade expectations coming into the report. Production was raised to 3.972 billion, just 4 million bushels below trade expectations. Usage was unchanged from the September report. These small additions to production were offset by 2013/14 carryout being lowered by 38 million bushels. This change to 2013/14 carryout was known following theSeptember 1st\u00a0stocks report which was released on September 30th. All things told, ending stocks were lowered to 450 million bushels for 2014/15, 22 million bushels lower than trade expectations coming into the report., 27882=November soybean futures traded lower in the overnight session before rebounding into the morning trade break.Yesterday marked an important technical move for the contract as prices closed below $10.55 for the first time. This was a price level that acted as support on both July 22nd and August 4th, and bearish signal opens the door to another move lower. Considering the 15 million bushel surprise on Tuesday, it is our opinion that undersold producers should put on some downside protection on any bounce we can find., 542354=The average trade guess for the May supply and demand report expects old crop wheat and corn stocks to increase from last report.\u00a0 Wheat ending stocks are expected to climb to 693 million bushels from 684 million bushels in April. Corn ending stocks are also expected to climb to 1.864 billion bushels from 1.827 billion bushels last month. The average trade guess expects to see soybean ending stocks fall by 10 million bushels to 360 million bushels as strong weekly export sales will most likely force the USDA to revise demand numbers higher. The average trade guess pegs new crop ending stocks for wheat at 750 million bushels, corn at 1.752 billion bushels and soybean carryout at 443 million bushels., 120297=\u00a0The latest Strategie Grains forecast for the 14/15 European Union corn crop was increased to 73.3 million tons up from 71.3 million tons expected in their last month\u2019s forecast. The company\u2019s 2015 acreage estimates showed expectations for European Union soft wheat acreage maintain 2014 levels, while winter wheat, barley and corn slip 2 percent each. Strategie grains expects Durum acreage to increase 6 percent in the European Union. \u00a0, 637777=In a poll of analysts conducted by Reuters the average forecast for corn acreage is 89.292 million acres. This is up from the 89.199 million acres of corn forecast on March 31st. For soybeans and wheat, analysts are expecting to see a half million acre increase from the March 31st\u00a0report to 85.171 million acres and 55.867 million acres respectively. However, whatever the USDA releases this morning will likely come under scrutiny since the survey was conducted in early June. With slower than average soybean planting pace and saturating rains throughout the Midwest some fields may not get seeded., 296491=Quarterly Grain Stocks Expectations-Quarterly grain stocks are expected to be substantially larger than last years levels at this time due to the record yields this year. If the expected corn stocks are realized, this will be the largest amount of corn stocks ever in the U.S during this time of the year. However, with grain at discounted prices in the 4th quarter of 2014 we may see a healthy amount of grain used for feed which could provide some surprise in the market. \u00a0, 472693=On Thursday April 2nd\u00a0the latest drought monitor showed the plains has gotten drier, leaving nearly 36 percent of the plains in moderate to exceptional drought. Kansas wheat rated good to excellent has slipped 5 percent over the last month to 39 percent good to excellent. In the 6-10 day outlook the central and southern plains expected to continue receiving warmer than normal temperatures. With temperatures hitting 90 degrees in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas this early there is a lot of concern for next year\u2019s crop. Wheat is breaking dormancy right into a drought that is intensifying throughout the plains, causing traders to question short positions as uncertainty grows about next year\u2019s wheat crop.\u00a0, 544738=Global carryout for the 2015/16 marketing year looks to be higher than the expectations for soybeans and wheat. Global wheat ending stocks were pegged at 203.32 MMT up from 200.97MMT in 14/15 and above the average trade guess of 193.53 MMT. Global corn ending stocks are expected to hold mostly steady at 191.94 MMT compared to old crop carryout of 192.5 MMT. Global soybean carryout is expected to rise significantly to 96.22 MMT, above expectations of 95.17MMT and last years ending stocks of 85.54 MMT. \u00a0\u00a0, 536810=In soybeans, basis levels continue to be flat and most buyers are discounting basis for June/July delivery versus spot, suggesting limited chances of big basis rallies in early summer. For river terminals, they did find some strength this week, with a modest 2-cent advance. But, soybean plants were off 1-cent a bushel on average.\u00a0, 199087=In the overnight session corn increased 2 \u00bc cents, soybeans increased 1 \u00be cents and wheat fell 3 cents as we go into the morning pause in trade. Export sales which were released at\u00a07:30 CST\u00a0caused soybeans to give back most of the gains it had achieved in an overnight bounce., 481381=This morning Brazil\u2019s Conab increased its forecast for the 14/15 soybean crop to 94.28 million metric tons from 93.26 in March. The corn forecast was also increased to 78.99 million metric tons compared to 78.21 million metric tons a month earlier.\u00a0, 95924=In the overnight session South Korea\u2019s Daehan Flour Mill announced a tender for 122,300 metric tons of wheat for delivery in February to May. Included in the wheat tender was 25,600 metric tons of milling wheat to be sourced from the U.S., 360045=New-Crop 2015 Average Basis by State\u00a0\u00a0, 76746=\u00a0Grains gave back most of\u00a0Friday\u2019s\u00a0gains in the overnight session. Currently corn is down 6, soybeans off 8 and Chicago wheat is down 7 cents. Technical support on December corn sits at 3.46 \u00be while looking at the soybean daily chart, support would not be expected until 10.02., 159992=Trade rumors that the U.S. will be importing soymeal from Argentine have continued to weigh on soymeal futures. December meal futures are down $4 per ton to $368.70 in the early going. Expect significant support at $3.60, as the 200 day moving average and highs during July and August should support price action from a technical standpoint. Exports from Argentine\u00a0may\u00a0be delayed as port workers in Rosario, Argentine have threatened a strike for later this week., 689908=Yesterday, we saw some grain buyers in the eastern grain belt lift soybean basis sharply to help draw in any unpriced grain still stored on the farm. Sales have slowed in recent weeks as November soybean prices have slid nearly a dollar from their highs on July 14th. As prices declined, producers have become less willing to sell their soybeans triggering processors and elevators to increase soybean basis. Since July 1st\u00a0we have observed spot soybean basis in Claypool Indiana increase 50 cents, providing an opportunity for producers in the area who still have grain in the bins.\u00a0To see what basis opportunities may be in your area click here and take a 14 day free trial at Grain Hedge.\u00a0Grain Hedge clients have access to a cash market intelligence platform that allows them to monitor basis opportunities within 200 miles of their farm.\u00a0, 26016=Two sales of U.S. corn were reported this morning, with Mexico purchasing 107,600 and unknown destinations purchasing 130,000 tonnes. Both sales were for the 2014/15 marketing year and we could be seeing some end users trying to price grain after the USDA came up short (relative to expectations) on their yield number yesterday., 418188=Analysts are expecting wheat ending stocks to increase to 699 million bushels from 692 in the February report. Total wheat export sales are in line with meeting current USDA expectations, but the rise in the dollar continues to hurt U.S. wheat competitiveness on the global market.\u00a0 Corn ending stocks are expected to decline slightly, falling to 1.826 billion bushels from 1.827 billion in February. Soybean ending stocks are expected to shrink down to 376 million bushels from 385 million bushels in February. Soybean export sales have run well ahead of last year\u2019s pace, already booking 97.7 percent of forecast export sales., 288238=For a full report on January 12th expectations take a Grain Hedge 14 day free trial by clicking here.\u00a0, 103770=USDA REPORT TODAY AT 11:00 AM CENTRAL TIME, 98340=The USDA will release the October WASDE report\u00a0on Friday. Corn production is expected to be increased by 100 million bushels to 14.506 billion for the 2014/15. Corn ending stocks are expected to reflect the production revision higher at 2.130 billion bushels. Soybean production is expected to be raised 60 million bushels to 3.97 billion. Ending stocks are expected to be unchanged at 472 million bushels. Wheat ending stocks are expected to be raised slightly to 704 million bushels. We will be sending out a full breakdown of trade expectations this morning by e-mail., 310702=NOPA crush numbers were released\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0showing that the total number of soybeans crushed in the month of December was 165.383 million bushels falling just shy of 165.384 which is the monthly crush record set in December 2013. Despite the fact crush was near record highs, this report disappointed many analysts whose average guess was to see 166.9 million bushels crushed last month. This surprise further pressured soybeans causing the oilseed to close out the day at $9.91 \u00be just a fraction of a cent above the extreme lows of the range soybeans has traded in since late October. Producers should be alert in this trading environment looking to hedge prices if soybeans were to fall below $9.91 on strong volume., 191602=In the overnight session the grains traded slightly lower with corn down 2 \u00be cents soybeans down \u00bc cent and wheat down 1 \u00be cents going into the morning pause in trade. Exporters reported a sale of 111,095 metric tons of U.S soybeans to China for 14/15 delivery. The U.S Dollar index is trading higher this morning within the range it has been trading since October 6th., 363727=In the overnight session corn soybeans and wheat are all trading slightly lower with corn down 1 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 1 \u00bc cents and wheat down 3 \u00bc cents. The U.S. Dollar index and crude oil are both trading higher this morning. Today the market will be positioning for the release of the February 10th\u00a0USDA Supply and Demand report., 143369=Crop progress and conditions will be out this afternoon at\u00a03:00 pm\u00a0central time. Expectations are for sizable improvements on harvest pace following a week of near ideal harvest conditions across the grain belt. Crop conditions are expected to remain unchanged., 613541=For soybeans, new-crop November futures posted its largest daily gain since February closing up 23 cents. It continued higher in the overnight session but met some selling pressure going into the break. Although planting delays are a moderate concern, excess moisture at this time of year may not be a catalyst for a sustained rally. This year is still expected to be another year of record production and acreage so any slip in acres would likely be muted by the beneficial soil moisture for much of the country., 111360=China has announced plans to stop weekly soybean sales from state reserves as harvest nears. China has sold 2.48 million metric tons of soybeans since May in their most recent round of sales. A halt in state sales would be generally positive for prices, but since this news comes just as harvest peaks domestically it should have limited impacts on U.S. prices., 665892=June NOPA crush numbers were higher than expected with 142.473 million bushels crushed in the month of June. This beat the average guess of 141.478 million bushels and is up substantially from last year\u2019s June crush number of 123.117 mbu. Soyoil stocks were reported at 1.574 billion pounds.\u00a0, 8479=July Reported, 641222=Yesterday\u2019s quarterly grain stocks and planted acreage reports pushed the market sharply higher within sight of some important chart resistance levels.\u00a0 September corn resistance is at $4.30 where the market closed back on December 29th. \u00a0September wheat resistance is at $6.60 where the market closed back on December 18th\u00a0and soybeans traded up to a high of $10.45 1/2 in the overnight which is an area that acted as resistance multiple times between November and January of last year., 534790=China is expected to produce 232 million metric tons of corn for 2015/16 which is up 7.6 percent year over year. Farmers have had incentive to plant more corn as a result of Beijing\u2019s high price stockpile policy which has kept domestic corn prices as much as 30 percent higher than global prices. As a result of the excellent crop this year Chinese corn imports are expected to fall 2 million metric tons this year, while sorghum imports are expected to grow to 8.2 million metric tons from 8 million metric tons this year. \u00a0, 450806=The expectations for the quarterly grain stocks as of March 1st\u00a0are as follows. For corn the average analyst guess pegs quarterly grain stocks at 7.609 billion bushels with the highest estimate at 7.8 billion and the lowest estimate at 7.459 billion bushels. Wheat stocks are expected to be around 1.140 billion bushels with a range of analyst guesses from 1.2 billion bushels to 1.083 billion bushels. Soybean stocks are expected to be around 1.346 billion bushels with a range of guesses from 1.404 - 1.273 billion bushels., 240276=In corn, export business was on par with expectations last week, but overall commitments year-to-date are on par with the pace needed to reach USDA\u2019s annual forecast. Ukraine is said to be having problems meeting corn contracts signed with China in. Private feed mills in China signed contracts in October to 1.1 MMT but the Ukraine supplier is unlikely to be able to ship all of the contracted volume before the February deadline.\u00a0, 94061=The national weather service has issued a frost advisory for parts of the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin tonight. Commodity Weather group is still reporting that there is a \"very low risk of freeze damage\" as a result of this frost warning and the low temperatures projected over the weekend. The corn crop is roughly 10% behind in terms of maturity for this week in September. At the moment, the freeze concern remains in the back of trader\u2019s minds but has been unable to help grains find a bottom.\u00a0, 543735=In the overnight session the grains traded lower with corn down 2 1/4 cents, soybeans down 3/4 of a cent and wheat down 1/2 a penny. The U.S. dollar is trading over half a percent lower and crude oil is up 83 cents. Traders are preparing for the May WASDE report which will be released at\u00a011 AM CST\u00a0this morning., 18342=2014/15 Soybeans, 550214=Keep a close watch on NOPA crush numbers today which will be released out at\u00a011 AM CST. Analysts are expecting to see April crush at 147.827 million bushels up from last year\u2019s 132.667 million bushels. The average analyst guess pegs soyoil stocks to be at 1.461 billion pounds., 385769=On Thursday after the close, Egypt\u2019s GASC bought 240,000 MT of wheat with 180,000 MT of that going to French suppliers and the remainder going to Romania. On Friday, Egypt's Supplies Minister Khaled Hanafi said Egypt\u2019s strategic wheat reserves will last until the end of May., 174249=Tuesday, November 11th\u00a0the Brazilian Government Conab narrowed their 14/15 soybean production forecast from between 88.8-92.4 million metric tons to between 89.3-91.7 million metric tons. Conab narrowed their corn forecast to 77.3-78.9 from last month\u2019s forecast of between 76.6-79 million metric tons. \u00a0, 586024=According to the most recent WASDE report, India is forecast to produce 90 million metric tons of wheat. However, other organizations such as the India Pulses and Grains Association have forecast output to fall to 80 million metric tons. It has been wet in India throughout March and April but recent dryness and exceptional heat has sapped the moisture from the soil making it all the more important for the June-September rains to return. \u00a0, 581536=After a week of hard selling, corn and wheat are closing in on support. July Kansas City Wheat has a previous low of 4.60 3/4 cents and July Corn is approaching the low set last September of 3.46 3/4 cents. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0, 546342=Yesterday the USDA released its May WASDE report which had little effect on corn and wheat, but sent soybeans into a tailspin by the end of the day. \u00a0Old crop soybean demand was revised higher by 20 million bushels to 350 million bushels after crushing and exports were increased by 10 million bushels each. The bullish old crop surprise was overshadowed by increased South American production and ominous new crop ending stock projections of 500 million bushels. The average trade guess expected new crop carryout to total 443 million bushels., 661127=NOPA crush numbers will be released\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0with expectations for June crush to be 141.478 million bushels. If realized, this would be well over the 123.117 million bushels crushed in June 2014 and the second largest crush number for the month of June on record.\u00a0, 57519=This morning the Taiwan Flour Millers Association rejected all offers for U.S wheat for a 99,410 metric ton tender which closed on Wednesday. The rejection came on the basis that prices were too high. Yesterday, the Russian Agriculture Ministry stated that they expect the 2014/15 grains exports to be at a record-high 27.5-30 million metric tons, up around 3 million metric tons from their previous forecast. GASC awarded the 175,000 metric ton wheat tender to Russia and Romania., 337666=Central Brazil continues to benefit from precipitation which is expected to expand north beginning next week. The northern part of Brazil\u2019s growing region has received 61% below normal precipitation over the last 30 days which will negatively impact crop yields in this growing region. Southern parts of Brazil are currently experiencing more showers and are expected to receive more precipitation in the 11-15 day forecast. A grains analyst out of Brazil, Safras & Mercado, lowered their Brazil soybean production forecast to 95 million metric tons from 95.9 previously expected in December. They also lowered their Brazil corn forecast to 74.7 million metric tons from their previous forecast of 75.5 million metric tons.\u00a0, 241382=Grains extended their gains in the overnight session with front-month March wheat futures climbing above $6 a bushel but hitting resistance at $6.10. Corn and soybeans were also up posting 5 cent advances at the end of the night trade., 750091=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 USDA Report\u00a0Today at 11:00 AM\u00a0Central Time., 532002=Ethanol production\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0fell 35,000 barrels per day to 887,000 barrels per day. The decline was the smallest weekly production data since the second week in November and was partly due to routine facility maintenance. Ethanol stocks declined 35,000 barrels to 20.76 million barrels this week. Despite the decline in production this week, overall ethanol production is still running 5 percent over last year., 629058=New crop sales were strong for corn however, booking 297,500 metric tons which was above the 100,000-200,000 metric tons expected this week. Soybeans booked 202,500 metric tons to be delivered in the 2015/2016 marketing year.\u00a0, 175301=In the overnight session corn is up \u00bd a penny, soybeans are trading 3 \u00bc cents higher and wheat is down 1 \u00be cents. Yesterday, the USDA released its November WASDE report which had a slightly more supportive reaction for corn and wheat than it did for soybeans. Corn yield was lowered to 173.4 BPA which was 1.8 BPA below the average analyst guess. Ending stocks for corn were also revised lower than expected to 2,008 million bushels with the average guess expecting 2,135 million bushels., 468935=On Wednesday\u00a0the EIA ethanol production data showed that output slid 1,000 barrels per day to 952,000 BPD. Ethanol production typically trends higher from February through May but we have not yet observed a notable increase in production during that time frame. Ethanol stocks also fell 770,000 barrels to 20.55 million barrels. \u00a0, 575204=The International Grains Council raised its forecast for global 2015/16 corn and wheat output\u00a0on Thursday. The council raised wheat production to 715 million metric tons up from a previous projection of 705 million metric tons. Although this is a substantial jump from previous forecasts, it is still below last year\u2019s production levels of 721 million metric tons. The world corn crop was revised higher by 10 million metric tons to 961, below last year\u2019s production levels of 997 million metric tons., 477691=In the overnight session the grains traded slightly higher with corn up 1/2 a cent, wheat up 1 3/4 of a cent and wheat up 1/2 a penny. The market will be receiving the EIA ethanol production numbers today and the monthly WASDE report will be released on April 9th\u00a0at 11 AM CST., 317214=Brazil\u2019s crop analyst Celeres increased production estimates for Brazil\u2019s soybean crop to 94.2 million metric tons up 2.8 million metric tons from its August forecast. Growing conditions have been positive in Brazil except for the north-eastern growing region which has experienced a moisture deficit for most of the growing season. Despite the dryness in parts of the country the main growing regions have experienced adequate to surplus moisture which has more than offset the negative impacts on yield caused by dryness in parts of the country. More rains over the next two weeks should continue to aid crop development.\u00a0 The current USDA production estimate for Brazil is 95.5 million metric tons which increased 1.5 million metric tons from the December Supply and Demand report., 31932=\u00a0The grain market is moving higher again in the overnight with December corn trading up 4 \u00bd cents, November soybeans trading up 8 1/2, and December wheat trading 4 cents higher. The dollar index moved lower in the overnight, providing some short covering support for the grains. A reportable sale of 110,000 metric tons of soybeans was reported by FAS to be delivered to China during the 14/15 marketing year., 653195=In the overnight session the grains traded higher with corn up 2 3/4 cents, soybeans up 14 1/4 cents and wheat up 6 1/4 cents. The U.S dollar is up a fraction of a percent and crude oil is up $1.50. Traders will be positioning themselves for the July WASDE report which will be released out on Friday, July 10th., 8658=2014/15 Corn, 297582=Note: The average analyst guess from the Reuters Poll suggests production to be lowered for both corn and soybeans. However, of the last 20 years there have been 4 record yielding crops for corn and 5 record yielding crops for soybeans. In every record yielding crop the USDA has increased its production forecast in the January report. Perhaps this January report will be no different.\u00a0, 223007=In the overnight session the dollar pulled back a quarter percent, corn moved 2 \u00be cents higher and soybeans climbed 7 \u00bc cents higher and is now over $10.00 on the January contract. Wheat fell 6 \u00bc cents, showing relative weakness in the overnight session., 332960=Yesterday was the first day newly harvested Brazil soybeans arrived into crushing plants and northern ports and market the start of the first vessel being loaded at the port of Paranagua. However, news out of South America is not all positive after an announcement yesterday that the Tiete River, a key waterway in Brazil will be closed for the start of the season due to the low draft caused by a much drier than average January. Although this may not immediately affect the U.S. grain prices, the fact that Brazil delayed much of its planting due to dry weather in the fall could mean the crop comes out of the field at the same time. If this were to happen it would put increased strain on the transportation of crops to export facilities. If ports get congested and significant delays begin to occur, the U.S may see further export sales announcements that would have otherwise gone to South America. \u00a0\u00a0, 659408=In the July WASDE report old crop ending stocks were slashed more than expected for both corn and soybeans. Corn ending stocks fell 97 million bushels to 1.779 billion bushels and soybeans fell 75 million bushels to 255 million bushels. For corn, old crop demand revisions included a 50 million bushel increase to feed use, a\u00a0 25 million bushel increase to exports and a 25 million bushel increase to corn used for ethanol.\u00a0 The revisions in soybean demand included a 15 million bushel increase in exports, a 15 million bushel increase in crushing\u2019s and a 44 million bushel increase to the residual category., 207688=In the overnight session the grains moved higher with corn trading up 2 cents, soybeans traded 11 \u00be cents higher and wheat in Chicago up 1 cent. In the hourly chart January soybeans seemed to consolidate between $10.20 and $10.40 yesterday as the range narrowed toward the end of the day. Today, prices have broken out of the $10.40 resistance. Be cautious here if you intend to get long as this week\u2019s low volume may cause more of a fake out than a push to new highs. For January Soybeans overhead resistance is at 10.59 \u00bc. \u00a0, 125689=Informa released their most recent 2015/16 acreage estimates\u00a0on Friday, once again showing expectations for a\u00a0very\u00a0large 2015/16 soybean crop. Soybeans were projected at 88.5 million acres while corn was projected at just 87.8 million for the upcoming growing season. This compares to 90.9 million acres of corn and 84.2 million acres of soybeans planted this year, per the USDA\u2019s October estimate. November 2015 soybeans are still trading at a 17 cent premium to the front month,\u00a0November 14, contract. Last trade on November 2015 this morning was $9.55. If you need help adding new crop 2015 contracts to your trading platform please call our office., 115826=Corn and wheat are unchanged overnight while soybeans continue to surge higher, up 12 cents trading at 957 1/4. This move has now made it through heavy resistance at $9.55 and indicates a change in the trend observed during July, August, and September looking at the\u00a0November 14\u00a0daily chart. Further short liquidation is certainly possible during today's day session. Coming into this week funds were sitting on a massive short soybean position. The next area of resistance would be at $10.00 on the November contract, but we will be waiting to see how the trade reacts during the day session for confirmation of the move. This move in the overnight was made on just 21,000 contracts traded. Soybean fundamentals remain unchanged and our bias remains bearish long term., 602745=More bearish news was released this morning from Conab, Brazil\u2019s government supply agency. The organization lifted their 2014/15 corn and soybean production forecast for Brazil. Corn production is expected to jump from 78.59 million metric tons to 80.21 million metric tons and soybean production is now forecast at 96.04 million metric tons., 268916=In wheat, Russia has stated they will impose their wheat export tariffs starting Feb 1 which will be roughly $40 per metric ton. In addition, Russian railways will begin imposing a tariff on freight of 134% beginning January 29. Overnight, Iraq\u2019s state grains board purchased 200,000 MT of hard wheat to be sourced from Canada (100,0000 MT) , the United States (50,000 MT) and Australia (50,000 MT). Russian wheat was not offered in the tender competition. In the US Plains, bitter cold is expected to bring temperatures in the minus double digits to some areas of NE, KS & CO but snow cover is expected to help insulate the winter wheat crop., 491728=In the overnight session the grains were mixed again with corn down 2 cents, soybeans up 1 3/4 cents and wheat in Chicago up 3 cents. The NOPA crush numbers will be released at\u00a011 AM CST this morning which is expected to show a record amount of soybeans crushed for the month of March. Analysts are expecting March soybean crush to be reported at 155.261 million bushels with a range of estimates from 150.5 to 159.5 million bushels. In the same poll conducted by Reuters the average guess for soyoil stocks was 1.383 billion pounds. Estimates for soyoil stocks ranged from 1.275 to 1.463 billion pounds of oil on hand.\u00a0, 584760=Yesterday, crop progress showed that all planting for corn is nearly complete with 95 percent done as of May 31st. This is on par with the average of 94 percent complete during this time of the year and up from 92 percent complete last week.\u00a0 The condition of the corn crop remained unchanged from last week., 607712=In soybeans, rains in the Southern Midwest continue to be a mixed bag. On the one hand it is slowing farmer planting but on the other hand it is providing beneficial moisture to benefit the crop long term. Traders are currently betting on the benefits of moisture and are less worried about the crop getting in the ground. Today at 11 am CDT NOPA is going to announce its May crush estimate which is projected to be 147.299 MB. If realized this would be a record for May crushing., 479359=Here\u2019s what to watch for in the WASDE report scheduled for release this morning. According to a Reuters poll of 20 analysts, the average guess for wheat ending stocks is 692 million bushels, up one million bushels from the March report. Corn ending stocks are expected to be reported at 1.854 billion bushels up from 1.777 billion bushels reported in the March WASDE report. This would reflect the higher than expected quarterly stocks number reported on March 31st. Quarterly grain stocks showed 7.745 billion bushels on hand compared to 7.609 billion expected by the market which suggests either lower than expected feed usage or larger than previously stated 14/15 production.\u00a0 Soybean ending stocks are expected to come in around 370 million bushels which would be a decline of 15 million bushels from the March report.\u00a0Quarterly grain stocks showed fewer soybeans as of March 1st, with 1.334 billion bushels compared to expectations of 1.346 billion bushels. \u00a0, 228035=Broader economic concerns were introduced to the market after the General Administration of Customs showed that imports dropped 6.7%, and exports rose only 4.7% from last year. Imports unexpectedly dropped the largest amount since March leaving market participants concerned that this may signal a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\u00a0, 659999=On Friday\u00a0the USDA released their July WASDE report which showed no yield revisions from the previous month. The average trade guess, however, was expecting to see a 1.1 bushel per acre decrease in soybean yield and a 1.4 bpa decrease in corn yield. Traders seemed to brush off the absence of any significant yield revision with expectations that yield is more likely to be revised in the August report anyway. There will be increased focus on today\u2019s crop conditions report as traders look for confirmation that heavy rains have damaged crop development. \u00a0\u00a0, 655146=Analysts are expecting old crop corn ending stocks to be revised lower by 65 million bushels to 1.811 MBU reflecting the smaller than expected quarterly grain stocks reported in the June 30th quarterly grain stocks report. Soybean ending stocks are also expected to decline to 287 million bushels from 330 million bushels in the last WASDE report., 630215=The EIA ethanol production numbers showed that last week\u2019s production was the largest this marketing year. Weekly production increased 14,000 barrels per day to 994,000 BPD. Ethanol stocks dropped 878,000 barrels to 19.840 million barrels helping to paint a more bullish picture. This marketing year ethanol production is up 4.7 percent compared to 2013/14., 541573=Keep a close watch on South America production as both Argentina and Brazil has had better than expected harvests. The average analyst guess expects Argentina corn production to increase nearly 1 million metric tons to 24.95 MMT and soybean production to increase 1.5 MMT to 58.5 MMT. Brazil corn production is also expected to increase to 76.87 MMT from 75MMT in the April report. Brazil soybean production is expected to stay mostly unchanged at 94 MMT., 286369=Ethanol production fell 23,000 barrels per day in an EIA report\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0bringing total ethanol production for the week to 949,000 barrels per day. Ethanol stocks rose to 18.85 million bushels, which is the largest ethanol stocks we\u2019ve seen since March of 2013. Despite the decline over the past two weeks, this marketing year\u2019s ethanol production is up 4.9% compared to 2013-14 compared to a .3% increase projected by the USDA.\u00a0, 498021=In corn, the biggest movement occurred at the Gulf where export bids were up 3 cents a bushel on nearby basis, but river terminals as a group posted only a 2-cent improvement. Strength was more prominent along the Ohio River areas were many terminals were up a nickel on basis. For the ethanol sector, production levels continue to slip along normal seasonal lines but plants as a group managed a modest 1-cent advance. In eastern Nebraska the two big plants continued to jockey for corn, raising nearby basis by 7 cents a bushel and currently stand at 10K, which exceeded the recent high of 8K in mid-March., 320512=In the overnight session the grains traded slightly higher with corn up 3/4 of a cent, soybeans up 3 1/4 cents and wheat up 3 \u00be cents. Soybeans are trading at $9.87 \u00bd just below $9.91 which is the low side of the sideways range it traded in since late October. The low side of the range which acted as support multiple times since late October will likely act as resistance since prices broke below $9.91 on January 20th., 271761=In the overnight session corn traded down 3 \u00bc cents, march soybeans slipped \u00bc cent and wheat fell 5 \u00be cents as it tests the 20 day moving average on the daily chart. This morning a reportable sale of 157,500 metric tons of corn was sold to Mexico for 14/15 delivery., 422926=Yesterday, the USDA revised the corn ending stocks lower by 50 million bushels to 1,777 million bushels. The revision was a result of increased feed and residual use, increased export sales and a decreased ethanol production. Soybean ending stocks were held steady at 385 million bushels despite the strong pace of export sales this year. Analysts were expecting a cut in ending stocks by around 9 million bushels. Wheat ending stocks were cut to 691 million bushels down from 692 in February., 455966=Ukraine had planted 744,000 hectares of spring grain by the 24th\u00a0this year which was behind last year\u2019s pace of 1.4 million hectares. Analysts have already warned that production could fall from last year\u2019s record due to decreased yields as a result of unfavorable weather during last fall\u2019s planting season. UkrAgroConsult stated that 85 percent of the winter wheat is rated good to satisfactory compared to 93.4 percent last year. They also estimated that total grain production could decrease to 53 million metric tons from 59.2 million metric tons harvested in 2014., 578515=Yesterday, the weekly ethanol production numbers showed an increase in production by 11,000 barrels per day to 969,000 barrels per day. Stocks declined this week by 337,000 barrels to 20.1 million barrels. Ethanol production has picked up sharply in the late part of May which is typical going into the driving season. Ethanol production is up 4.8 percent over last year compared to the USDA\u2019s corn used for ethanol balance sheet item which suggests only a 1.3 percent increase., 12454=Grains are trading sideways to lower this morning in Chicago. Corn is down a penny, November soybeans down a penny, and Chicago wheat off 4 cents. Bull spreading is once again a theme in the soybean market, with September trading up 5 cents., 136874=Brazil is expected to receive rain across their grain belt today and into the weekend, easing dryness concerns for the key growing state of Mato Grasso. Dry conditions have hampered planting across the country with Mato Grasso receiving 10 centimeters less rain that normal during the last month. Soybean bulls have pointed to this story as helping soybeans in the near term. A close above $9.67 on the November 2014 soybean contract would indicate that this run might still have gas in the tank from a technical perspective. First notice day for the November contract is Friday, October 31st., 492776=Ethanol production declined for the second week in a row bringing weekly ethanol production to 924,000 barrels per day. This week\u2019s 12,000 barrel per day decline in ethanol production marks the first time since October that weekly 2014-15 production has fallen below 2013-14 levels.\u00a0 Despite falling below last year\u2019s weekly production level, cumulative ethanol production this year has increased 5.4 percent compared to a USDA expected increase of 1.3 percent. This year\u2019s ethanol stocks increased 162,000 barrels to 20.65 million barrels this week.\u00a0, 627062=Winter wheat harvest is behind the average pace during this time of the year.\u00a0On Monday,\u00a0the crop progress announced that only 19 percent of the crop had been harvested which is behind the 31 percent harvested we typically see. Harvest prospects look to be mostly uninterrupted in the near term with some scattered storms expected\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0and\u00a0Friday. However, the forecast turns wet again for the beginning of July which is likely to continue to disrupt harvest pace. Traders are also concerned about the wheat quality after the plains received significant moisture late in the growing season. Head scab has spread rapidly in the winter wheat fields of central Kansas.\u00a0, 309624=Chinese flour mills purchased 83.6% of the 2 million metric tons of high protein wheat offered to lock in import quotas for high-protein wheat. Another 630,000 metric tons of Chinese wheat will be offered at regular auctions on the 20th. It was also stated in an announcement today that China will sell 139,000 metric tons of imported high protein wheat from state reserves on January 21st\u00a0in an effort to provide relief to a tight domestic market. U.S. wheat has closed lower for seven consecutive sessions and since December 19th\u00a0has only posted four days out of eighteen where the contract closed higher than it opened. \u00a0, 442897=In the overnight session the dollar pulled back slightly helping grains push higher. Going into the morning pause corn was up 2 1/4 cents, soybeans were up 3 1/4 cents and wheat was up 5 3/4 cents. Keep in mind that at\u00a010:30 CST\u00a0this morning Informa will release their latest crop planting forecasts. A recent survey from Farm Futures Magazine forecast soybean acreage at 87.25 million acres, up 4.2 percent from the last year. The farm futures poll also saw corn plantings at 88.34 million acres versus 90.6 million acres planted last year., 435341=NOPA crush numbers showed 146.970 million bushels of soybeans crushed in the month of February, the largest recorded since 2010. This figure was lower than the average analyst guess of 148.537 million bushels, but up from last year\u2019s figure of 141.612 million bushels. The trade reaction to the report was relatively mute with little action following the release of the NOPA numbers. \u00a0, 594965=For new crop, analysts are expecting both corn and wheat ending stocks to rise while soybean ending stocks decline from the May report. The average guess for new crop corn ending stocks is 1.779 billion bushels up from 1.746 billion bushels in May. Wheat ending stocks are also expected to rise, with expectations of 798 million bushels from 793 last month. Soybean ending stocks are expected to decline this month with the average trade guess looking for 487 million bushel carryout compared to 500 million bushels in May.\u00a0, 117923=Septembers NOPA crush data will be released at\u00a011 AM\u00a0central time with the average analyst expecting 107.553 million bushels crushed. Stocks are estimated to be around 476,730 metric tons. These numbers will most likely be market moving as the expectations for soybean crush would be the largest amount of soybeans crushed since late 2009., 170823=In wheat, Russia\u2019s cash prices fell in the last week thanks to better weather which brought warmer temperatures and rain in some regions which helped improve winter wheat conditions.\u00a0 International tenders were mostly quiet overnight with only Jordan announcing a tender for 100,000 MT of wheat which closes on Nov 12., 370324=The Rosario Grain Exchange lifted its forecast for corn and soybean production forecast for Argentina significantly in their latest report. Corn production was raised to 23.5 million metric tons compared to their last forecast of 22.4 MMT. Soybean production was increased to 58 million metric tons from 54.5 MMT. Both estimates were higher than the February WASDE report which estimated Argentina corn production at 23 MMT and soybean production at 56 MMT., 366044=Analysts are expecting a 2 million bushel increase to both corn and wheat ending stocks, while soybean ending stocks are expected to decline 12 million bushels to 398 MBU carryout. Soybean export sales continue to run well ahead of pace, building traders\u2019 expectations that the USDA will revise export sales higher in this month\u2019s report. Looking at the last five February WASDE reports we have seen the USDA revise ending stocks on average 56 bushels lower for corn and 9 bushels lower for soybeans., 591161=On Wednesday\u00a0the 10th\u00a0the USDA will release its June USDA Supply and Demand report. According to a poll of Reuters analysts old crop wheat ending stocks are expected at 712 million bushels a slight increase from last month. Old crop corn ending stocks are expected to show 1.859 billion bushels up eight million bushels from the May report and soybean ending stocks are expected at 339 million bushels down from 350 million last month. Soybean export sales continue to run hot in the second half of the marketing year when sales usually taper to nearly nothing as buyers switch over to South America.\u00a0\u00a0\u200b, 24879=NOPA crush numbers will be out\u00a0Friday, detailing soybeans going to crush during the month of July. Spot crush margins remained favorable for much of the month, averaging 60 cents per bushel on the board. NOPA numbers will be out at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0central time., 399882=Yesterday Brazil\u2019s Agro consultant released their latest forecast of 14/15 Brazilian soybean production pegging the crop at 94.7 million metric tons compared the USDA\u2019s forecast in February of 94.5 MMT., 299947=Corn prices were mostly stable following the report after yield was slashed to 171 bushels per acre and harvested acres were left unchanged. However, despite the decreased production, quarterly grain stocks were larger than expected revealing weaker than expected feed usage. Ending stocks were revised 121 million bushels lower providing a positive surprise for bulls. With a bullish revision in supply behind us, and demand weaker than expected in this round of reports, I am concerned prices will not be able to make new highs in the rally that began back in October. We will need to see a strong increase in demand to be the backbone behind any further rally, especially with no foreseeable threat in South American production.\u00a0, 330025=Wheat continues to experience selling pressure as the market looks for some signs of life in the export sector. Since the sharp run-up in wheat prices which peaked on December 26th, the market has been searching for a pickup in wheat sales that would have otherwise gone to Russia. \u00a0However, U.S. wheat has struggled to gain competitiveness in the global market with the sharp decline in the Euro and the U.S. Dollar continuing to gains strength., 438765=Yesterday, the EIA announced that ethanol production increased 3,000 bpd to 947,000 barrels per day. This is the second consecutive week of ethanol production gains. This year\u2019s ethanol production is now up 5.7 percent compared to last year\u2019s production during the same time period. In the March WASDE report the USDA lowered its corn used for ethanol to only a 1.3 percent increase year over year. Recently, there has been talk of Brazilian ethanol being imported into the U.S. due to the strong shift in currency rates. This news is a negative sign for the ethanol and corn markets.\u00a0, 554196=Weather turns dryer throughout Russia over the next 1-7 days which is stoking some concerns that this year\u2019s weather patterns share a close similarity to the 2010 and 2012 growing seasons which resulted in lower yields.\u00a0}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{113346=June 1 Wheat stocks 8 million bushels below expectations (590 Million Bushels), 106827=\u00a0Alert:\u00a0Grain Markets close at\u00a0noon\u00a0central time on July 3rd, 2014.\u00a0, 82075=New crop soybean ending stocks missed analyst expectations, showing 415 million bushels instead of the anticipated 418 million bushels. The difference was not significant enough to cause any kind of bullish move and the market quickly sold into the report. The USDA revised total supply up 180 million bushels over the June report and increased demand a bit over 4% adding 40 million bushels to crushing and 50 million bushels to export sales. Overall this is a report met trade expectations for 2014/15 ending stocks. World soybean ending stocks were raised by 2.43 million metric tons, but this was almost entirely made up of increases to US ending stocks. Overall a neutral report for soybeans but the argument can still be made that $10.70 futures will not hold through harvest with ending stocks at 415 million bushels for the upcoming marketing season., 83397=\u00a0Alert: USDA Report out at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0Central Time today, 202048=June Difference, 124597=Traders expect the USDA to report 2014/15 soybean acres at 82.15 million acres, up nearly 700,000 acres from the record\u00a0acreage\u00a0projected in the\u00a0March 31st\u00a0Planting report. Assuming yield potential remains favorable, this\u00a0acreagefigure would push U.S. production to 3.7 billion bushels for 2014/15, up 12% from 2013/14. It is important to keep in mind that this surge in U.S. production is coming at a time when global ending stocks are expected to increase 22% in 2014/15., 20915=French milling wheat futures are surging higher overnight as delivery houses have considered increased standards for wheat coming out of the fields. Quality issues have been a concern following a very wet summer, and many bushels are not meeting milling wheat quality standards for export. U.S. wheat futures may find export business as a result if France is unable to provide milling quality wheat to end users within Europe and abroad. This morning $5.74 per bushel is the next area of resistance when looking at the September Chicago wheat contract.\u00a0, 246184=This appears to be a replay of the same events that occurred at the end of last year when China rejected nearly 250,000 metric tons of U.S DDG\u2019s due to presence of Syngenta\u2019s MIR 162. Following the rejections at the end of the year DDG imports rebounded sharply in China surging to a near record high in April at 613,678 metric tons. The latest move out of China will continue to negatively impact corn especially as the market was digesting a great start to this year\u2019s crop., 74059=\u00a0Alert: NOPA soybean crush numbers out at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0central time, 27496=\u00a0We are seeing green across the board with September corn trading up 3 \u00bc cents, September wheat up 11 \u00bc cents and September soybeans up 13 \u00bc cents going into the morning pause in trading. It looks like grain markets are trading higher on dryness concerns, as this weekends rain event was mixed and saw very light coverage. Scattered rains fells over the weekend, with 30% of the grain belt receiving light precipitation. The 5 day forecast is looking more promising for rain fall with 60% of the grain belt expected to receive rain. Areas of concern remain western Iowa, Nebraska, Southeast South Dakota.\u00a0, 192962=June Expected, 95396=Grain export sales have been being reported on a relatively regular basis as prices continue to ratchet lower. This morning two reportable U.S corn sales were sold to Japan (101,600 MT) and unknown destinations (107,696 MT) for new crop delivery.\u00a0Also, Egypt\u2019s GASC issued a tender yesterday for 55,000-60,000 metric tons of U.S wheat, Ukrainian milling wheat, Russian milling wheat and Australian standard white wheat. The price of Chicago wheat has dropped sharply since\u00a0May 9th\u00a0when the local U.S supply concerns were eventually trumped by growing global stocks. Since the open of trade on that\u00a0Friday, the September wheat contract has fallen $1.89 cents., 120891=June 30th Expected\u00a0, 131366=Traders expect the USDA to report the smallest June 1 soybean stocks since 1977. Corn stocks are expected to expand by nearly 1 billion bushels from June 1st 2013 following the large 2013 crop. Wheat stocks are expected to be down just over 100 million bushels from 2013 levels. Soybean usage is mostly known between NOPA crush numbers and export sales, but considering the exceptionally tight stocks the old crop soybean market will be very sensitive to any surprises out of today\u2019s stock report., 84239=With the crop good-to-excellent ratings on soybeans at a 20 year highs, yield will likely be left alone from the June report. This means 14/15 soybean supply is likely to come out 169 million bushels over last month's WASDE report and up 425 million bushels from last year. The average analyst expects ending stocks to be reported at 418 million bushels which would imply that demand would increase nearly 76 million bushels from June's report, less than half the expected supply increase. Looking back over the last 14 years we would expect the majority of the demand gains to come from exports which responds more readily to large changes in supply and price. In 2006/07 when supply increased 10% year-over-year, export sales made up nearly 3\u20444 of the demand response to the increased production. In 2009/10, another year with a 10% increase in supply, we saw export sales account for 70% of the demand response year-over-year.\u00a0, 178654=July soybean futures move 5 cents higher in the overnight session as traders prepare for today\u2019s NOPA crush report at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0central time. The market expects today\u2019s report to show 126.984 million bushels of soybeans crushed during May, nearly 10 million bushels fewer than the April report. Crush figures have been strong during the last part of the marketing year, prompting the USDA to raise their marketing year projection by 5 million bushels\u00a0on Wednesday., 54155=\u00a0This morning the grain markets are mostly unchanged to slightly higher here with September corn up \u00bd a cent, September wheat up 2 cents and august soybeans up 2 \u00be cents., 109307=August soybeans found some technical support after it touched briefly on its 200 day moving average at 1304. August, which is now the front month for soybeans sold off 48 \u00bc\u00a0\u00a0cents\u00a0on Monday\u00a0following the report as stocks showed 27 million more bushels on hand\u00a0June 1st\u00a0than analysts were expecting., 188906=Wheat traders will be watching the result of an Egyptian tender today. The tender is for July delivery and will be another test of US export prices on the global front. US wheat at the gulf is now being offered at a 13$ per tonne discount to Ukranian wheat \u2013 indicating that export business may return to US shores in the coming weeks.\u00a0, 69067=Soybeans met analyst expectations for both old and new crop. Old crop sales were small, but at least they were positive which kept soybean sales well ahead of pace to meet analyst expectations. This weeks 37,700 MT pushed old crop sales now 38.7 million bushels ahead of existing export projections which indicates that net cancellations must occur between now and August 31st\u00a0to meet USDA projections. New crop sales were slightly lower than expected with only 495,000 MT booked, compared to expectations between 500,000-700,000 MT. However, a reportable sale announced this morning of 708,000 MT of U.S soybeans to China should help lift the market. Wheat sales missed expectations to the low side only booking 320,700 MT compared to expectations of 400,000-550,000 MT., 125304=Corn remains a different beast in the upcoming marketing year, with few\u00a0acreage\u00a0revisions expected in\u00a0Monday's\u00a0report. On average, analysts only expect the USDA to raise corn acres by 25,000 acres from their projection in the Prospective Planting report. This slight increase would still have overall corn acres down 4 million acres year over year, and leave overall production unchanged from 2013 assuming good current yields. World corn stocks are expected to only increase 8% year over year, well below the surge in global ending stocks expected for soybeans., 85372=Trade estimates for 14/15 U.S. soybean ending stocks do not factor in a robust response from the demand side as seen in 2009/10 or 2006/07. This sets up the soybean market to possibly miss demand expectations in the report report today in a way that could provide some strength to the market following weeks of sharp selling. However, we feel any bounce should be used as a pricing opportunity as the long term fundamentals look undoubtedly bearish. During the 2006/07 marketing year prices approached $9.00 per bushel and looking back to 1975 soybean prices have found support around the $9.00 per bushel level. These historical benchmarks are important as we enter a very different marketing year from what traders have become accustomed to in recent growing seasons., 170655=Wheat is trading a bit higher here this morning as weather favors growing conditions for corn and soybeans but complicates the situation for wheat. Moisture that could have been much more helpful a couple months ago is slowing the harvest for the winter wheat and causing quality concerns for the already suffering crop. Kansas, Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle should receive more rain\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0and\u00a0Friday\u00a0and the 6-10 day forecast looks to bring the region above normal precipitation. The wheat market went into this morning\u2019s trade pause at $5.96 after having erased 86% of the bullish move that occurred between February and the\u00a0May 9th\u00a0WASDE report.\u00a0\u00a0, 134054=Today\u2019s trade session will mostly be focused on Monday\u2019s reports with market participants building and adjusting positions going into the weekend. Wheat should be affected by the Canadian acreage numbers which came out 7.4% below last year\u2019s seedings. Canada reported 24.1 million acres of wheat planted, while market expectations were for 24.5 million. The lower acreage surprise could act as a supporting factor in today\u2019s trade, but certainly isn\u2019t hugely bullish considering the large global ending stocks this year. Canada also reported that Canola planted 20.2 million acres which was slightly above trade expectations and up from the 19.9 million acres in 2013., 18394=Ethanol production figures were reported\u00a0on Wednesday, showing a sharp week-over-week decline in production. For the week 902,000 BPD were produced \u2013 down from 952 during the previous reporting period. Corn going to ethanol still remains 10-20 million bushels ahead of pace to meet USDA expectations for the 2013/14 marketing year., 207861=Corn ending stocks were left unchanged from the May report, coming in below trade expectations for ending stocks to be raised by 30 million bushels. Similarly to soybeans, today\u2019s numbers are supporting the July corn contract with respect to the new crop, December, contract., 68020=\u00a0The grains shed a couple pennies in the overnight session with old crop corn down 2 cents, Chicago wheat down 1 cent, and august soybeans down \u00be of a cent. Expectations at the office here are for a continuation of yesterday\u2019s bounce, but we are concerned that the upside potential will be limited as strong selling pressure will likely meet any sharp rally. A strong new crop soybean sale to china should also help support the market this morning. \u00a0, 42029=\u00a0Alert: First Notice for August Soybeans is on\u00a0Thursday, July 31st\u00a0, 240365=June Expected, 113632=Crop conditions were released yesterday after the market close, showing corn conditions now rated 75% good to excellent. This was up a percent from the previous week and shows that a large portion of the corn crop benefited from heavy rains over the last 2 weeks. Soybean conditions were unchanged at 72% good to excellent.\u00a0While many areas received more rain than needed, we continue to feel that the rains from the later portion of May should not be viewed as a long term bullish factor for the US grain market., 201218=May Reported, 119460=2014/15 U.S. Planted Acreage (Million Acres), 146396=The cash basis at the gulf has increased 20 cents in the last week as moisture during flowering has elevated the levels of Vomitoxin. The quality of SRW wheat does not meet quality standards leaving exporters willing to pay a premium for high quality wheat. The Kansas City wheat market was also supported by confirmation that Brazil has postponed the usual 10% import tariff for up to 1 million tonnes of wheat through\u00a0August 15th, a terrify that usually applies to U.S. and Canadian wheat. Brazil was forced to take action after concern about supplies from Argentina which is Brazil\u2019s primary source of wheat., 240622=May Reported, 89404=Yesterday\u2019s ethanol production report showed that production was down week-over-week at 927,000 barrels per day. Stocks continued to grow and are once again at levels seen in early 2013. Seasonally we would expect ethanol crush to slow from July moving forward, but crush margins remain very strong relative to the last 5 years. Basis opportunities continue to exist at ethanol facilities across the grain belt, even as corn basis has sagged in recent days., 79689=Grains are continuing lower after this morning\u2019s USDA report. Corn is down 9 cents and soybeans is trading 20 cents lower for the new crop contracts. This report was generally in-line with expectations for soybeans, but 2014/15 corn ending stocks were roughly 25 million bushels above trade expectations., 69990=The European Union will begin taxing corn imports at a rate of $7.2 per metric ton. This was announced following U.S. export prices at the gulf moving below levels required by the European commission. Imports of corn have not been taxed since August 2010 and this is viewed as negative news for U.S. corn prices., 127393=June 1 2014, 136467=March 31st Reported\u00a0, 280845=Soybeans are continuing their move higher this morning, up 4 \u00be cents for July and 2 \u00bc cents on November. Thursday\u2019s export sales report confirmed that international demand remains strong for old crop U.S. soybeans even with prices near $15.00 per bushel. Net old crop sales were reported at 73,600 metric tonnes, well above the 100 \u2013 150,000 tonne cancellations traders were expecting. Weekly cancellations are needed for the USDA\u2019s current export projection to hold, with accumulated exports now above the 1.60 billion bushels in exports projected for the\u00a0entire marketing year\u00a0in the May USDA report. Demand rationing will signal the top of this market, and many soybean bulls feel that this week\u2019s export figure and current crush data point to a market that still has some legs as we enter the summer months. New crop futures continue to follow the July contract higher, with\u00a0November 14\u00a0soybeans futures up 4% so far this week. With large carryout expected for the 2014/15 marketing year we still feel this is a good pricing opportunity for a portion of new new crop bushels., 126823=June 1 2013\u00a0, 179949=Technically, July soybean futures are ripe for a rebound. The 100 day moving average held\u00a0Thursday\u00a0and\u00a0Friday\u00a0of last week as this market reached severely oversold territory. Continue to watch the July/November spread for indications that July is ready to make another move lower .Coming into the morning trade break we see July gaining 6 cents on the November contract, the largest daily gain since June 6th.\u00a0, 191254=2014/15 U.S. Ending Stocks (Million Bushels), 81145=\u00a0The old crop balance sheet was one of the items that fueled soybean selling in the wake of the USDA supply and demand report. Ending stocks jumping 15 million bushels from last month\u2019s report catching some traders off guard and triggering selling throughout the soybean complex. The ending stocks increase was primarily driven by a negative residual number of -69 million bushels. In the last 21 growing seasons and most likely further back than that we have only seen one year with a negative residual number and that was the 2011/12 growing season when we recorded a -2 million bushel residual. We did have an increase in both crushing\u2019s and exports by 25 million bushels and 20 million bushels respectively to eat through some of the beans but ending stocks were raised to 140 million bushels in the end. This has weighed heavily on the bull spread between August and November futures., 72163=Argentinian port workers will begin an indefinite strike on Wednesday, demanding higher salaries to compensate for inflation nearing 30%. This comes at the peak of Argentina\u2019s corn and soybean harvest and is expected to impact ports across the country. Argentina is the world\u2019s largest soyoil and soymeal exporter and this morning we are seeing September soymeal futures trade up 1.3% in Chicago., 120204=March 31st Reported\u00a0, 111166=Yesterday morning the planted acreage numbers shocked the market, with soybeans adding over 2.6 million acres more than the trade was expecting. Soybean acreage was reported at 84.839 million acres, which is a record by over 7.4 million acres. States such as Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ohio all recorded record high soybean acreage in Mondays report. In response to the shockingly high soybean acres the November soybean contract sold off more than 70 cents, dragging down corn and wheat as well. Stocks numbers also had a bearish story to tell for both corn and soybeans with both commodities having more 13/14 grain on hand than traders were expecting.\u00a0, 141181=Soybeans Traders expect the USDA to report 2014/15 soybean acres at 82.15 million acres, up nearly 700,000 acres from the record acreage projected in the\u00a0March 31st Planting report. Assuming yield potential remains favorable, this acreage figure would push U.S. production to 3.7 billion bushels for 2014/15, up 12% from 2013/14. It is important to keep in mind that this surge in U.S. production is coming at a time when global ending stocks are expected to increase 22% in 2014/15., 34107=Non-farm payrolls were released this morning, coming in slightly below market expectations. The U.S. economy created 209,000 jobs in July, below the 235,000 expected by the market. This was the sixth straight month with job creation above 200,000 \u2013 the first time that has happened since 1997. Unemployment increased a percent to 6.2%. In 2014 the economy has created 230,000 jobs per month on average, up 19% from the pace seen in 2013. S&P 500 futures are trading up a percent following the report. To add the September S&P 500 futures to your trading platform, add the symbol ZSU4., 107881=Corn traders will be watching today\u2019s ethanol crush report, out at\u00a09:30\u00a0central time. Helped out by surging crude oil prices, ethanol production reached record levels in mid-June and has been a supportive story for the old crop corn market. Overnight tenders were issued from both the South Koreans and the Taiwanese for U.S. origin corn. Considering a corn crop now rated 75% good to excellent, any strength moving toward pollination will need to be helped out by export sales and domestic usage numbers., 78394=Corn futures have continued lower in the overnight session following Friday\u2019s negative report. 2014/15 ending stocks were reported 25 million bushels higher than expected and we saw global ending stocks raised 3% for the upcoming marketing year. Demand side numbers will indicate the bottom on this market and over the weekend we have Israeli tendering for 108,000 metric tons of optional origin corn. Considering the recent price slide U.S. corn will be very competitive in any tenders moving forward. $3.80 is the next area of technical support looking at the weekly chart. This is from trend line support looking back to September 2012. If you\u2019d like help adding this trend-line to your trading software just call the office, 877-472-4607, 133596=First notice for July contracts is Monday, June 30th. Please roll into August/September, 186959=Grains are trading unchanged to higher following yesterday\u2019s USDA report. Old crop soybeans are leading the grain complex, up 6 cents on the July contract. Yesterday\u2019s 17 cent decline may have been overdone, considering the 5 million bushel revision lower to 2013/14 carryout projected by the USDA. Corn and wheat are both trading near unchanged after receiving negative reports yesterday for old and new crop ending stocks., 66116=The Ukrainian situation and weather will be the major driver into next week\u2019s trade. We now have a sizeable portion of the US corn crop silking and, for the moment, weather conditions look near ideal entering August. NOAA released their updated weather projection and their models indicate average precipitation with slightly below average temperatures through August. The next major weather event for this market could be towards the end of September as an early freeze becomes a concern. We continue to feel that producers who find themselves under-sold on the new crop should price grain on any rallies and use a call strategy if they are still bullish the longer term outlook. If you would like to discuss your specific marketing situation please feel free to call our office. Our number is 877-472-4607 and we are available between\u00a08AM and 4PM\u00a0central time., 80029=Old crop corn carryout was raised 100 million bushels, bringing 2013/14 carryout to 1.246 billion bushels. 2014/15 production was lower 75 million bushels as planted acres and harvested acres were lowered from the June report slightly. Yield was left unchanged at 165.3 bushels per acre. On net, supply for 2014/15 was raised 25 million bushels as a result of larger old crop carryout. Feed and residual use was down 50 million bushels and all other demand side numbers were left unchanged. On net, 2014/15 ending stocks were raised 75 million bushels to 1801 million bushels \u2013 25 million bushels above trade expectations coming into the report. The USDA did not aggressively increase demand numbers for 2014/15 as some traders had expected coming into the report. Overall negative report for corn and we are now testing technical support at $3.80. Adding to the bearish sentiment was world corn ending stocks which were raised 5.4 million metric tons (3%) from the June report., 153007=The USDA will release updated acreage expectations next Monday, June 30th. Below are USDA figures from the prospective planting report, and trade expectations for Monday\u2019s Planted Acreage report. On average, analysts expect 91.73 million acres of corn, 82.154 million acres of soybeans, and 55.82 million acres of wheat reported planted. The soybean market looks the most vulnerable coming into the report, as prices have remained respectively strong even as traders expect 500,000 or more acres added to the 2014/15 planting estimate. Considering current prices and potential downside, we would be more aggressive pricing soybeans than corn coming into this report., 149576=(March 31), 110866=\u00a0In the overnight session corn traded down 4 \u00bd cents on the December contract, wheat fell \u00bd a penny and soybeans dropped 14 cents for November. Today\u2019s session will likely continue the movement that we saw yesterday with selling being the major theme.\u00a0\u00a0, 90273=September corn has now been trading below four dollars for two full sessions. Bearish sentiments continue to weigh on the market in recent weeks as open interest continues expanded in Tuesdays down day, indicating that new short positions are being added. Forecasts continue to show ideal weather looking out two weeks as the crop enters a critical yield determining phase of pollination. Also weighing on corn was the announcement out of Brazil yesterday that it\u2019s better than expected corn yields are expected to produce 78.2 million metric tons compared to last month\u2019s estimates of 77.89 million metric tons. \u00a0, 102738=\u00a0ALERT:\u00a0Grain Markets close at\u00a0noon\u00a0central today, markets re-open at\u00a08:30 AM on 7/7/2014, 257357=Corn traded sideways in the overnight session on very light news. The December 2014 corn contact is also due for a snap-back following the move from $5.10 to $4.55. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 28.5, which is the most oversold market condition we have seen (using the RSI) since October 2013. The excellent condition of this crop has trumped any technical buy signals in recent weeks but this may be a good area to take a \"wait and see\" approach on pricing new crop corn., 142395=In light of these bearish fundamentals, the new crop soybean market has remained\u00a0 relatively strong in recent weeks. With November 2014 soybeans closing at $12.40 this morning we feel there is more downside, than upside, looking toward harvest prices. With this in mind, it is our opinion that now is a good time to protect a portion of expected production using a futures or option strategy. \u00a0, 187854=Export sales reported that wheat had a good start to the 2014/15 marketing year which began June 1st, selling 570,000 MT for the above 450,000 MT which was the high side of analyst expectations. \u00a0Old crop corn also had a good week, posting 409,000 MT up sharply from the previous week and on the high side of analyst expectations. New crop corn was reported at 150,000 MT which was around the average analyst guess. Soybeans posted another week of old crop export sales totaling to 86,700 MT which pushes soybean exports 103 million bushels ahead of pace to meet the current USDA forecasts. Traders continue to monitor for cancellations but have seen only one week where sales were in the negative in the last 10 weeks of sales., 45552=\u00a0The grains are mixed this morning with corn trading 3 cents higher, wheat 3 \u00be cents lower and August soybeans 12 cents higher this morning.\u00a0 The August soybean contract is trading at $12.24 \u00bd cents and has first notice on Thursday the 31st. Currently, the spread between Augusts and September Soybeans is 96 \u00bd cents, down from over $1.40 at the beginning of July., 209651=Traders are looking for the USDA to make\u00a0slight\u00a0revisions to 2014/15 ending stocks in today\u2019s USDA report. On average the trade is expecting a 10 million bushel cut in corn ending stocks and an 11 million bushes cut soybean ending stocks for the new crop marketing year. Considering the pace of planting and emergence, few acreage changes are expected from the May report. Yield is a similar situation, with nearly ideal growing conditions supporting the 165.3 BPA for corn and 45.2 BPA for soybeans projected in the last report., 245292=Yesterday corn was blindsided by news that China has stopped issuing permits of DDGs from the United States on concerns they might contain an unapproved GMO. This had immediate impact on the cash market here in the U.S. where export barge bids dropped by about 10 percent\u00a0on Monday\u00a0to the lowest levels since January.\u00a0\u00a0, 38385=\u00a0This morning the grains are mostly lower with September corn trading down 2 \u00bd cents, September wheat trading up \u00bd a cent and soybeans pulling back another 7 \u00be cents in the overnight. In the overnight session, November soybeans was able to fill a gap that it printed on Monday\u2019s open and it will be interesting to see if that support area will hold., 147498=For corn and soybeans traders are mostly focusing on the USDA acreage report and quarterly stocks numbers. Soybeans quarterly stocks will be closely watched as analysts expect the smallest stocks since 1977. \u00a0This morning soybeans is trading higher, moving up through its 100 day moving average, but still within the consolidation range that we have traded in since the 13th.\u00a0, 201632=June Expected, 193385=June, 170271=Corn is up a penny on very light news in the overnight. Good to excellent ratings continue to weigh on December futures., 256488=In the cash market we are starting to see grain merchandisers roll their spot bids from the July soybean contract to August. This morning July holds a 67 cent premium to the August contract forcing grain merchandisers to compensate for that inverse by raising basis significantly after they roll. The elevators that have rolled to the new contract however, did not fully compensate for the discount only raising basis by 50 to 60 cents. This means that producers still looking to sell old crop soybeans, this roll period will most likely hurt the cash prices in your area. The roll period has just begun and many elevators are still bidding off July so there are still opportunities to price off the July contract. For tools to help you keep track of basis changes in your area give the office a call at 877-472-4607 or take a demo at grainhedge.com., 44315=This morning Ukragroconsult raised its 2014 corn and wheat harvest forecasts for Ukraine. The wheat forecast was raised to 21 million tons from 20.5 million tons and the corn forecast was lifted to 27 million tons from 25.5 million tons, both of which are now in line with the estimates released in the July WASDE report. As of July 28th, Ukrainian farmers have harvested over 17.04 million acres and gathered a total of 23.6 million metric tons of grain. Of the grain harvested, the agricultural ministry said 16.3 million metric tons of it was wheat and 6.8 million metric tons of it was barley. \u00a0, 184062=The results of Egypt\u2019s wheat tender were announced yesterday following the market close. In that sale Egypt purchased 180,000 tonnes of wheat for July delivery from Romanian and Russian traders. No signs yet of international interest in US what even after a month of declining U.S. futures., 35359=\u00a0Grains traded sideways to lower overnight, with corn down 2 cents, soybeans off 3 cents, and wheat trading a penny lower. November soybeans were trending lower before finding some strength on concerns about Argentine exports in the new crop year., 266433=It was a very large week for old crop corn sales, with the USDA reporting 621,300 MT sold. This was well above trade expectations and should work to firm July corn futures. With July futures 50 cents off their highs and technically oversold, end users should view this as a buying opportunity., 77589=Friday's USDA supply and demand report left many traders scratching their heads last week as old crop soybean ending stocks was lifted 15 million bushels primarily due to negative residual use, which surprised analysts, while new crop ending stocks came in a couple million bushels shy of analyst expectations. The result was a sharply lower trade, and a rapid unwinding of the bullish calendar spread between the August and November contract. On Friday morning that spread opened at 139 \u00bc cents and printed a low of 94 \u00bc cents before rebounding back close at 120 3/4. This morning that spread has gained another 6 cents and now hovers around its 200 day moving average. Keep a close watch on tomorrows NOPA crush numbers which will be released tomorrow at 11 AM CST.\u00a0, 60597=\u00a0This morning all the grains are trading lower as ideal weather during pollination weighs heavily on the market. September corn is trading down 6 cents, September wheat is down 3 \u00be cents and August soybeans is trading 4 \u00be cents lower., 98730=Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers incurred damage to both newly planted fields and stockpiled grain as heavy rains of up to 10 inches soaked and flooded Canada\u2019s main growing region last week. Estimates on the total damage ranged significantly with some analyst guessing 1 million acres ruined while others suggested up to 6 million acres of crops were ruined across Canada due to the excessive rain this season. Much of the Eastern Saskatchewan and Western Manitoba recorded record amounts of precipitation since\u00a0April 1st\u00a0leaving many farmers with flooded and damaged crops. This year Canadian wheat crops are well behind their normal development due to the cool and excessively wet weather this year. \u00a0, 112982=June 1 Soybean stocks 27 million bushels above expectations (405 Million Bushels), 169671=Soybeans are leading the grain market higher this morning on a technical bounce following yesterday\u2019s sharp selling. Unwinding of the July/November bull spread has been a contributor to weakness on the old crop, and this morning we are finally finding footing in the July/November spread. This morning it was reported that exporters sold 140,000 metric tons of U.S soybeans for old crop delivery. Traders have been keeping a close for signs of increased export activity after prices turned lower in the last week of trade.\u00a0, 183213=NOPA crush numbers will be out\u00a0on Monday\u00a0and are expected to show 126.984 million bushels of soybeans crushed during May. This would be down roughly 5 million bushels from the 132.6 million bushels crushed during April. The USDA raised their 2013/14 soybean crush estimate in the June USDA report by 5 million bushels following several months of stronger than expected crushings., 132848=USDA Acreage Report on Monday, June 30th, at\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0central time, 137153=June 30th Expected\u00a0, 118494=The USDA will release the Planted Acreage and June 1st\u00a0Quarterly stocks\u00a0today at 11:00 AM\u00a0Central Time. The planted acreage report will give the new crop contracts direction into the summer months. In general, traders expect large soybean sowings and a corn number down 4 million acres from 2013. Have questions about hedge or speculative positions coming into the report? Our number is\u00a0877-472-4607\u00a0and we\u2019d be happy to speak with you., 94282=Friday, July 11th, will bring the July USDA report. This will be the first report to use planted acreage expectations from the June 30th\u00a0Planted Acreage report. That report shocked the soy complex, with 2014 acres projected at 84.8 million acres. Traders expect soybean carryout to be projected at 418 million bushels in the coming marketing year. This market has sold off significantly since June 30th, but a 400+ million bushel carryout implies there is still great downside risk in this market. Next area of technical support lies at $10.95 on the\u00a0November 14\u00a0soybean contract., 238995=Grains traded sideways in the overnight session with corn up a penny, wheat down a penny, and soybeans trading six cents higher on the July contract. New crop beans were off a penny. The overnight session was very light in terms of news and trades continue to eye tomorrow\u2019s USDA numbers. Below is a table detailing trade expectations for the new crop., 172493=Planalytics will be hosting a special Webcast on Thursday, June 26th as Jeff Doran, Planalytics Sr. Business Meteorlogist, and will provide an update on the latest status of El Nino, a major weather system currently developing in the Pacific. Temperatures in equatorial waters extending from east Africa to the shores of Ecuador in South America are trending above normal. While this warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific is an indicator that an El Ni\u00f1o event may well be on the horizon \u2013 NOAA gives it a 70% probability \u2013 it hasn't arrived yet. There are a number of factors at play that may impact the intensity of this cycle and its impact on North America's agriculture in the coming months., 255802=Wheat futures are trading higher across the board this morning as fundamental and technical factors have combined to support prices. With yesterday\u2019s decline, U.S. export prices for Chicago (SRW) wheat are now nearly in-line with Black Sea exporters for the first time in months. This will open the door to export business in the weeks to come from buyers who have remained on the sidelines. Technically, the July 2014 Chicago wheat contract is now resting on the 61.8% retracement when looking at the lows on January 31st\u00a0and the highs printed May 6th., 143153=Corn Corn remains a different beast in the upcoming marketing year, with few acreage\u00a0 revisions expected in Monday's report. On average, analysts only expect the USDA\u00a0 to raise corn acres by 25,000 acres from their projection in the Prospective Planting\u00a0 report. This slight increase would still have overall corn acres down 4 million acres year over year, and leave overall production unchanged from 2013. World corn stocks are expected to only increase 8% year over year, well below the surge in global ending stocks expected for soybeans. Considering a corn market which has traded lower in recent weeks and the questions surrounding new crop acreage, we feel corn has a larger chance of holding a bullish surprise in Monday's report. Call the office to discuss pricing strategies as we come into Monday's USDA report. Our number is\u00a0877-472-4607\u00a0and can be reached between\u00a08AM and 4PM\u00a0central time each day., 113164=June 1 Corn stocks 132 million bushels above expectations (3,854 Million Bushels), 61481=The longer term outlook remains favorable, with the 8-14 day forecast from Planalytics projecting below average temperatures and above average precipitation for the majority of the grain belt. This is confirmation of NOAA\u2019s projections from last week for a cool, wet, August for the U.S. grain belt., 290480=Wheat is trading lower this morning after shedding 45 \u00bd cents last week. In the overnight, Wheat traded as low as 6.65 \u00bd which is around the 38% retracement measured from the February lows, 56989=\u00a0The grain markets moved a couple cents higher in the overnight after trading down for the better part of yesterday. September corn is up 1 \u00bc cents September wheat is up 4 \u00bd cents and august soybeans is up 14 cents this morning., 199984=2013/14 U.S. Ending Stocks (Million Bushels), 209044=\u00a0USDA REPORT OUT AT\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0CENTRAL TIME, 287748=The grains traded higher in the overnight with July corn trading up 2 cents bouncing off its 100 day moving average, soybeans up 6 \u00bc cents on strength out of soymeal and Chicago wheat rebounding 7 cents off of technical support., 150225=\u00a0(June 30th), 107447=U.S. grain markets are trying to find bottom today, two days after the June USDA report sent markets sharply lower. Coming into the morning trade break we have corn down 2 cents, soybeans off a penny, and Chicago wheat down a cent. Old-crop soybeans are again taking ground on the new crop, with August up 4 cents., 207380=For the old crop balance sheet, crushings were raised 5 million bushels for old crop soybeans, the only balance sheet item changed from the May report. This lowered projected ending stocks by 5 million bushels to 125 million for the 2013/14 marketing year. This was slightly below trade expectations and is working to strengthen the July contract compared to November. At the moment we see the July/November soybean spread widening by 6 cents to $2.37 per bushel., 192541=May Reported, 288001=July and new crop soybeans both traded higher in the overnight supported by the strength in soymeal which has maintained a strong up-trend since February, recently making fresh contract highs. Adding to the soymeal strength has been talk that crushing plants around the Midwest are running low on soybean stocks. In the last week the average U.S soybean basis has jumped 4 \u00bc cents supported by strength at processing plants and along the river., 132527=\u00a0June 27th, 2014 Morning Comments, 247309=This morning July corn is trading down 5 \u00bd cents, soybeans down 2 \u00bd cents and wheat is down 1 \u00bc cents., 185381=July soybeans sold off 37 cents in the last two days following the June WASDE report. The cash market has responded to the sharp drop in prices by lifting basis to attract any remaining grain out of the farmer\u2019s bins. The U.S FOB gulf soybean basis climbed 6 cents\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0alone, but the Gulf wasn\u2019t the only place basis has jumped. In the last two days we have seen the National soybean basis average jump 7 cents, with the largest gains focused on Nebraska, Iowa, North East Kansas and Eastern South Dakota.\u00a0\u00a0Soy crushing plants have increased their bid 10 \u00be cents in the same time period., 86339=Traders expect the USDA to add 48 million bushels to new crop corn ending stocks, bringing the total for 2014/15 to 1.774 billion bushels. This would be the largest carryout since the 2005/06 growing season as yield is expected to make up for a relatively small acreage figure. 75% of the crop remains good-to-excellent and with each passing week of near ideal weather the \"pollination weather premium\" is leaving the market. Trend-line supports sits at $3.80 looking at the daily\u00a0December 14\u00a0corn chart. Looking longer-term we would expect support around $3.25 on December futures based on price action from 1975 to present. This market has already sold off substantially but it is important to look at the big picture when pricing grain coming into today\u2019s USDA report. This month's sell-off has been dramatic on the daily corn chart but is a relatively small move when looking over a longer time frame., 23292=\u00a0This morning the grain market is retracing the gains seen yesterday with corn down 3 \u00be cents wheat down 2 \u00be cents and soybeans dropping 17 cents on the September contract., 135675=2014/15 U.S. Planted Acreage (Million Acres), 48451=\u00a0This morning we have the markets trading lower here with September corn down 3 cents, September wheat unchanged, and September soybeans down 8 \u00be cents as better than expected precipitation covered a good portion of the Midwest last night., 33266=\u00a0This morning we have September corn trading down 2 cents, September soybeans trading down 5 \u00bd cents and September soybeans down 10 \u00bc cents. \u00a0, 237962=\u00a0JUNE USDA REPORT\u00a0TOMORROW\u00a0AT\u00a011:00 AM\u00a0CENTRAL TIME, 199546=New crop soybean ending stocks were lowered by 5 million bushels to a projected carryout of 325 million bushels for the new crop. Yield and planted acreage were left unchanged, and the lower carryout number was a result of 5 million bushels being taken from old crop carryout. This morning\u2019s report provided little direction for soybean traders and the next major report will be the June 30th acreage numbers., 91255=Fridays report is will be focused on soybean demand revisions for the 2014/15 crop after the June 30th\u00a0report showed acreage 3.6 million acres higher than last year. With the crop conditions for soybeans at a 20 year high it is expected that 169 million bushels could be added to total supply since just last month\u2019s WASDE report and up 425 million bushels from last year. \u00a0Traders will be watching how the demand numbers are adjusted with surge of supply hitting the market this fall. The average analyst expects ending stocks to be reported at 418 million bushels which would imply a demand increase of nearly 76 million bushels from June\u2019s report. Much of the demand increase is expected to be seen in the export column which seems to be more responsive to large supply increases. \u00a0, 53146=Even before this morning\u2019s export sales report, November soybean futures were trading 21 cents higher on some concerns about final yield. Concerns are starting to circulate through the trade that a cooler / dryer August leaves questions about final yield as we enter the pod setting stage for much of the crop. Non-commercial traders held a near record short soybean position \u2013 making the market ripe for a short covering rally., 198742=New crop corn ending stocks were left unchanged from the May report. Not surprisingly given crop conditions, yield was left unchanged at 165.3 bushels per acre for corn. This report will do little to support sagging corn futures, with key technical support being tested at $4.40. This market has traded steadily lower since the May 9th WASDE report so be cautious around these support levels. Despite the fact that we missed the average analyst expectation for this June report, the market has already been baking ideal growing conditions into price over the last month. As we get closer to major support at $4.34, be cautious of a sharp bounce or short covering rally. If however, we do close below $4.34 chances are good this corn market is ready to move another leg lower., 239611=2014/15 Ending Stock Estimates, 145350=\u00a0Soybean export sales were reported at 317,200 \u2013 well above trade expectations for around 150,000 tonnes sold. This morning\u2019s report included the large reportable sale of 140,000 tonnes to unknown destinations from last week . This was a very strong week for U.S. soybean exports, considering the fact that excluding the large reportable sale it would have been the largest week for U.S. soybean sales since March. Keep an eye on the July and August soybean contracts as the market opens this morning., 97738=The USDA released crop conditions yesterday afternoon which showed little changes from the previous week. Corn is still rated 72% good to excellent while soybeans held steady at 72% good to excellent. At this week in the growing season this is the highest rated corn crop in 15 years and the highest rated soybean crop in 20 years. Winter wheat is now 57% harvested and the spring wheat crop is rated 70% good to excellent. The 6-10 day forecast from Planalytics is showing wet conditions across the eastern corn belt and dryer conditions in Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Mean temperatures should be cooler than normal beginning July 13th, just as a large portion of the corn crop will be silking. In yesterday\u2019s report the USDA showed 15% of the corn crop in the silking stage., 104100=Export sales were released this morning showing that old crop corn and soybean sales met expectations while wheat sales came in better than expected. Despite meeting analyst expectations this week the 290,000 MT of 13/14 corn sales and 40,600 MT of 13/14 soybean sales wasn\u2019t enough to move either grain any further ahead of pace to meet USDA forecasts. According to our models, corn slipped to 137 million bushels ahead of pace, down 7 million bushels from last week\u2019s projections. Our soybean models also slid 6 million bushels to 102 million bushels ahead of pace to meet USDA expectations. New crop sales for both corn and soybeans were adequate with both grains recording sales within expectations. Wheat sales of 567,500 MT beat analyst expectations with a significant amount of sales going to Brazil. Strong wheat sales may provide some support to the market which has experienced hard directional selling since the beginning of May.\u00a0}",
    "textBeforeTable": "2014/15 U.S. Ending Stocks (Million Bushels) Grains are trading lower in Chicago following this morning\u2019s USDA report.

Old crop ending stocks came in below expectations for corn and soybeans while wheat was reported larger than trade expectations. \u00a0 USDA REPORT REACTION Jun 11, 2014 WASDE Report Reaction Comments (0) From a production standpoint, wheat may be pressured in the weeks to come following revisions higher to Chinese, European, and Russian production estimates in yesterday\u2019s USDA report. This was partially offset by decreases for US production, but global wheat supplies have remained a negative factor on US and international prices over the last month.\u00a0 Wheat traders will be watching the result of an Egyptian tender today. The tender is for July delivery and will be another test of US export prices on the global front.
