    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{107757=This embodiment as discussed above is part of an exemplary XML schema for a word processor application 202. The exemplary schema may be incorporated as part of a broad-based schema used as part of a word processor application 202, such as the XML schema used for WORD 2003, which is used to represent a word processor document. According to an embodiment of the invention, the schema, among other things, operates to persist information about one or more data bindings 205 associated with one or more content regions 207 in a word processor document 204., 44495=The term \u201ccontent region\u201d refers to a bounded and/or optionally labeled region of a document which serves as a container for a type of content entered by a user. See \u201cMethods, System, and Computer-Readable Medium For Managing Specific Types of Content In An Electronic Document,\u201d filed on Sep. 30, 2004 and assigned U.S. Ser. No. 10/955,612, by the present assignee, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 98422=An illustrative word processor schema is described in application Ser. No. 10/187,060, filed Jun. 28, 2002, entitled \u201cWord-Processing Document Stored in a Single XML File that may be Manipulated by Applications that Understand XML\u201d, which is herein incorporated by reference, and includes details on how a word processor application operates to save out contents of a word processor document in XML file format. According to an embodiment of the invention described herein, an XML schema 210 is operable to represent a data binding 205 in a word processor document 204. The word processor application 202 preferably includes a schema 210 which recognizes and acts upon data bindings 205, including defining how data bindings 205 are saved and loaded by the word processor application 202., 66175=The one or more data bindings 205 can be used to \u201cbind\u201d content of a data source (XML data 209 in the data store 208), herein termed XML data 209, to locations in the document 204. XML data 209, as used herein, includes any type of content such as text (plain or richly formatted), images, content of a specific type (dates), etc. The structure of a data binding 205 may be described as an XPath link, which allows the word processor application 202 to connect to/synchronize with/persist links to XML nodes 213 in an XML data store 208 associated with a document 204. The XML data store 208 is most preferably a part of the document 204 (i.e. the store 208 is saved to with the word processor file and travels or associates with the particular document 204). A data binding 205 may also contain information to control how the data 209 should be transformed between the presentation (the word processor's document surface 203, for example) and the data store 208. A user of the word processor application 202 can allow the data 209 stored in the data store 208 (the data that is manipulated by the backend applications) to be stored in a standard format, but present the same information in a word processor document 204 in a friendlier format (e.g. the user sees Jan. 29, 2004, but the data is stored in dateTime format as 29-01-004T12:00:00.0000). As another example, the data binding information can contain an image\u2014to the data 209 this image is represented as a seemingly meaningless string of characters, but the same transformation principle described above means that the user will see an image in the content region 207 of the word processor document 204. The user can add/change the image and the XML-encoded representation will be persisted to the XML data 209 so that any backend process can store/manipulate that information., 26787=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/030,423, owned by Microsoft Corporation and filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jan. 6, 2005, entitled \u201cData Binding in a Word Processing Application,\u201d which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.}",
