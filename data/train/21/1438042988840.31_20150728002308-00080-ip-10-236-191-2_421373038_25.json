Note The config directory has always contained Virgo configuration files. When Virgo Nano and its support for p2 provisioning was introduced in Virgo 3.5.0, a configuration directory replaced the old config one. Now all Virgo configurations are assembled in that directory providing a single point of configuration. The directory name configuration in the installation's root is used by default in p2 to configure the OSGi framework during provisioning. This chapter makes it clear which configuration goes in each directory. Why is there both a config and a configuration directory?
