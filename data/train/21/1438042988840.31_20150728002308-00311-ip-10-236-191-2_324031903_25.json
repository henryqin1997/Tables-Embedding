The TI spectrum is on the bottom, and the TI of the complementary side is on the right. In this figure, the horizontal axis indicates the centre of the input sub-sequence with length that equals the aligned TFBSs of the specific factor. The data shows two embedded pseudo-gal4 TFBSs in the sequence. We can see that there are two TI peaks that are distinct but do not reach the threshold.

The short lines on the top mark the position of the real TFBS, and the red lines are TI values from the complementary strand; the long lines in the middle denote the MTI of the specific factor. There are 4 TFBS on the strand from 5\u2019 to 3\u2019, and the highest peaks are almost precisely the real TFBSs.
