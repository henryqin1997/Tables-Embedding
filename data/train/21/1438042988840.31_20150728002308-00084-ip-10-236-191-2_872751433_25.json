    "textAfterTable": "Vector Vengeance[edit] Myth statement Status Notes Throwing an object backward off a moving vehicle at the same speed as the vehicle is traveling forward will cause the object to drop straight to the ground. Confirmed For their first test, the Build Team used a treadmill running at 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h) to launch a weight off the back of a truck, and saw that the weight was propelled 6\u00a0ft (2\u00a0m) away. Next, the Build Team repeated the experiment, but had the truck driving at 10 mph, and the weight seemed to drop straight down. They then repeated the experiment at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) using an air cannon to fire a soccer ball. However, they couldn't get the ball to drop straight down and decided to change their method of firing the ball. They tested a soccer ball pitching machine and Grant's ball kicking robot against the air cannon. In the end, they decided to stay with the air cannon after finding out it performed the most consistently among all three machines. The Build Team attempted the experiment again, and after a number of tries, finally managed to get the ball to drop straight down.
