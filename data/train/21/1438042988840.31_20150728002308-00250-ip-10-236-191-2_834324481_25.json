These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit., 1200287=total revenue in 2005.

The 2004 revenue growth primarily resulted from our 2004 acquisitions of SCB, Ascent and Novasoft, plus the full year benefit of our 2003 acquisitions of ECsoft and AlphaNet.

In 2005, the Compensation Committee of CIBER's Board of Directors consisted of James C. Spira, Archibald J. McGill and James C. Wetherbe. None of these directors has ever been an officer or employee of CIBER. No current executive officer of CIBER has ever served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee., 1003602=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August\u00a01, 2005, we sold the portion of our IBM operation that was covered by IBM's national staffing contract to a third party. We recognized a gain of $1.0\u00a0million in other income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2005 as a result of this transaction. The agreement also specifies future payments may be made to CIBER in the event that performance of the transferred operation exceeds specified thresholds at the end of each of the next three\u00a0years., 1077047=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amortization expense for future periods as estimated at December\u00a031, 2005 consists of the following (in thousands):, 1102493=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries, and the net assets of those subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. In December\u00a02005, we entered into a one-year cross-currency swap arrangement to partially hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain Euro-based foreign operations (\"net investment hedge\"). The notional amount of the swap is \u20ac42.0\u00a0million/$50.0\u00a0million. During the term of this transaction, we will remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 0.11% and three-month U.S. LIBOR rates, respectively. At December\u00a031, 2005, CIBER pays interest at a rate of 2.60% and receives interest at a rate of 4.53% on the notional amount, and such rates are reset quarterly. These payments will be recorded as an adjustment to our reported interest expense during the periods. Gains and losses in the net investment in the Company's subsidiaries due to foreign exchange volatility will be partially offset by foreign exchange losses and gains related to this net investment hedge, both of which will be recorded within \"accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during 2005 related to this swap increased shareholders' equity by $219,000., 978168=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ECsoft Group plc (\"ECsoft\")\u0097Effective January\u00a023, 2003, we completed our acquisition of ECsoft. Prior to the acquisition, ECsoft's shares were publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. We acquired all of the approximately 10.0\u00a0million outstanding shares of ECsoft, not already owned by CIBER, for cash consideration of 305 pence (approximately $4.94) per share, or approximately $50.2\u00a0million in the aggregate. In addition, we had previously acquired approximately 1.1\u00a0million ECsoft shares in the open market at a cost of approximately $3.2\u00a0million, bringing our total cost for all of ECsoft's shares to approximately $53.4\u00a0million, excluding transaction-related costs. At the time of the acquisition, ECsoft, (now named CIBER Europe Limited) which is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales had approximately 440 consultants and operations in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom that provided IT consulting services similar to CIBER.

The results of this company are reported within our Commercial Solutions segment. The purchase price paid on July\u00a01, 2005 was approximately $2.5\u00a0million and the purchase agreement includes the possibility of future earn-out payments totaling $600,000 to be paid over the next two\u00a0years. The purchase price was allocated as follows: $244,000 to net tangible assets acquired, $50,000 to other intangibles and $2.2\u00a0million to goodwill., 1099799=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bank Term Loan\u0097On April\u00a09, 2004, we entered into a term loan with Wells Fargo for $6.0\u00a0million that matures on September\u00a030, 2006. The term loan bears interest at the same rate as our line of credit. This term loan is secured by certain computer hardware. The outstanding principal balance of the term loan is due in equal monthly installments of $200,000. At December\u00a031, 2005, the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $2.0\u00a0million., 249679=NOTICE OF THE 2006 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, 715947=Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u0097Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u0097KPMG LLP Consolidated Statements of Operations\u0097Years Ended December\u00a031, 2003, 2004 and 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheets\u0097December\u00a031, 2004 and 2005 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity\u0097Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\u0097Years Ended December\u00a031, 2003, 2004 and 2005 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 1080369=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Future minimum lease payments and sublease receipts as of December\u00a031, 2005 are:, 642809=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Package Solutions (\"Package\") 2005 revenue increased by approximately 17% compared to 2004, and 2004 revenue decreased approximately 6% compared to 2003. The 2005 increase was due to organic growth of approximately 10%, resulting from continued improved demand following the completion of the acquisition of PeopleSoft by Oracle. The decrease in 2004 revenues was primarily due to a decrease in PeopleSoft-related services offset in part by an increase in Oracle-related services. The market for PeopleSoft implementation services was hindered in 2004 due to the uncertainty around Oracle Corporation's bid to acquire PeopleSoft. Firms that had purchased PeopleSoft software licenses were reluctant to engage firms like CIBER to implement that software until there was clarity around the outcome of Oracle's takeover attempt. In addition to organic growth in the Package segment, 2005 revenues also benefited from our first quarter acquisition of a single office operation specializing in SAP implementations. This acquisition closed at the beginning of January\u00a02005 and contributed revenue of approximately $6.5\u00a0million in 2005. Other revenue is derived from our Technology Solutions practice and represents commissions on the resale of third party IT hardware products. In 2005, other revenue increased by approximately 30% to $13.0\u00a0million compared to $10.1\u00a0million in 2004. Heavy fourth quarter demand for IT hardware sold to customers for their enterprise package software implementations along with successful cross selling efforts accounted for much of the increase., 282143=DEADLINE FOR STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2007 ANNUAL MEETING, 557704=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In total, our gross profit percentage decreased to 26.9% of revenue in 2005 from 27.5% of revenue in 2004. The overall decline represents a mix of higher margins on other revenue, which improved by 570 basis points combined with a decline in services margins which fell by 90 basis points. The other revenue margin improvement is primarily due to a full year of high margin product sales from our Ascent acquisition combined with improved margins within the Technology Solutions practice in our Package Solutions segment. The 90 basis point year over year services margin decline is attributed primarily to execution issues in our European Operations and State\u00a0& Local Solutions segments. In our European Operations segment, cost overruns on two fixed-price Danish projects, along with poor performance in the first half of the year in one of our U.K. offices accounted for approximately 70 basis points in overall services margin decline. In our State\u00a0& Local Solutions segment, project cost overruns and a fourth quarter project cancellation and project delay negatively impacted overall services gross margins by approximately 20 basis points. Positively impacting services gross margins in 2005 was the full year benefit of Ascent and Novasoft, which combined, incrementally contributed approximately $60\u00a0million of services revenue. This incremental revenue yielded a gross margin of approximately 32.5%, positively impacting CIBER's overall services gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. The balance of the services gross profit percentage decline, about 40 basis points, was the result of higher labor costs in our Commercial Solutions and State\u00a0& Local Solutions segments, and investments in our onshore and offshore CIBERsites locations., 247245=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included with the Proxy Statement are excerpts from our Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2005.

In 2003 and 2004, we issued 8,220 and 1,542 shares, respectively, of common stock under this plan., 1160201=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIBER,\u00a0Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan (the \"2004 Plan\")\u0097On April\u00a027, 2004, our shareholders approved the adoption of the CIBER,\u00a0Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan to replace the 1994 Employees' Stock Option Plan and the Directors' Stock Option Plan, both of which expired on January\u00a031, 2004, and the Directors' Stock Compensation Plan, which had no expiration date. As part of this adoption, 5,000,000 shares of CIBER,\u00a0Inc. common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The plan administrators may grant restricted stock, stock options, performance bonuses or any combination thereof, to officers, employees and consultants. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number, nature and vesting of such awards. The 2004 Plan also implements a formula stock plan for non-employee directors. Under the formula plan, each non-employee director will receive a non-statutory option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock upon election to the Board of Directors, and an option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on each anniversary of election to the Board of Directors. Anniversary options will be exercisable one year from grant, and initial option grants will vest in equal annual increments over a two-year period. All other options granted under the 2004 Plan become exercisable as determined at the date of grant by the Board of Directors and all 2004 Plan options must expire no later than 10\u00a0years from the date of grant. The 2004 Plan further provides for a grant of shares to each non-employee director having a fair market value of approximately $2,500 for attendance at each meeting of our Board of Directors. As of December\u00a031, 2005, there are approximately 1,898,000 shares available for future grants under the 2004 Plan., 1079916=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have non-cancelable operating leases for our office space. We also have certain office locations that we have subleased to other parties. Net rent expense for operating leases totaled $13.7\u00a0million, $12.1\u00a0million and $13.4\u00a0million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Net rent expense included accrued lease losses of $1.3\u00a0million in 2003., 506777=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Novasoft AG (\"Novasoft\")\u0097In late 2004, we acquired approximately 94% of the net outstanding shares of Novasoft, headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, for total consideration of approximately $61.0\u00a0million in cash and $16.0\u00a0million of CIBER common stock. In 2005, we increased our ownership of Novasoft to approximately 95% for an additional $1.8\u00a0million for consideration and expenses and we expect to acquire the remaining shares in 2006. The cash portion of the payment consideration was primarily funded by borrowing under our bank revolving line of credit. Novasoft is a provider of implementation and other consulting services related to SAP software products. Novasoft is an SAP Alliance Partner and implements all of SAP's ERP products, including mySAP.com products and industry specific applications. At the time of the acquisition, Novasoft had approximately 425 consultants, located mainly in Germany, the U.K. and Spain. We acquired Novasoft to expand both our international presence and our capacity to deliver SAP-related services. When combined with our existing European operations, we now provide SAP related consulting services from 10 European countries. At the time of the acquisition, we expected Novasoft to contribute approximately $78\u00a0million in annualized revenue. For 2005, Novasoft recognized revenue of approximately $84\u00a0million., 465604=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternative Delivery of 2007 Proxy Materials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that it costs the Company approximately $5.00 per Stockholder to print and mail the Annual Report, Proxy Statement and Proxy voting materials? Did you know that you can help the Company reduce these costs while also being environmentally responsible? If you are interested, there are two ways you can help., 564546=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In total, our gross profit percentage decreased to 27.5% of revenue in 2004 from 27.9% of revenue in 2003. This decrease is due to lower gross margins on services revenue, partially offset by increased gross margins on other revenue. The decline in gross profit on services revenue was primarily due to expected lower margins on the incremental revenue contributed by SCB, as well as lower profitability on three projects that experienced cost overruns. Our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased to 36.6% in 2004 from 27.3% in 2003 due to increased sales of higher-margin proprietary software products contributed by Ascent. In addition, consultant utilization in 2004 was 88% compared to utilization of 89% in 2003., 1157852=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2005, we have approximately $15.5\u00a0million of net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards for U.S. Federal tax purposes resulting from acquisitions. Annual usage of these U.S. NOL's are limited under U.S. tax rules, however, they do not begin to expire until 2020. There is no valuation allowance for U.S. NOL's as we expect to fully utilize them.

The implementation of the provisions of SFAS\u00a0123R will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share. We estimate that the adoption of SFAS\u00a0123R will reduce our 2006 net income by approximately $1.3\u00a0million to $1.5\u00a0million; however, actual results may vary depending on our future stock price, number of options issued and any future changes to our employee stock option programs. In the fourth quarter of 2004, CIBER's Board of Directors authorized the Company to accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding stock options in order to minimize the future expense anticipated upon adoption of SFAS\u00a0123R. During 2004 and 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting on the majority of its outstanding stock options and, in total, decreased CIBER's future option expense by approximately $6.0\u00a0million., 249450=CIBER,\u00a0Inc. 5251 DTC Parkway, Suite\u00a01400 Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, 566690=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other income, net was $2.2\u00a0million in 2004 as compared to $162,000 in 2003.

The cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the instruments, and is required to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Under the \"modified prospective\" transition method that we expect to apply upon adoption, compensation cost will be recognized for all awards granted, 909826=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a0123, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation\" (\"SFAS\u00a0123\"), we account for stock-based employee compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" (\"APB 25\"), and related interpretations, including Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.\u00a044, \"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB 25).\" We measure stock-based compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of CIBER common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. We recorded compensation expense of $74,000, $56,000 and $179,000 in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Generally, no compensation expense is recorded for stock options as all options typically have an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of issuance., 563174=approximately $165\u00a0million in incremental revenue to 2004 and the full year benefit of our 2003 acquisitions added another $13\u00a0million in incremental revenue to 2004. Excluding the incremental revenue contributed by the 2003 and 2004 acquisitions, 2004 revenues would have decreased by approximately 4% from the prior year. Approximately one fourth of the decrease was due to a reduction in services from a large telecommunications client in September of 2003, which negatively impacted revenue on a year over year basis by approximately $8\u00a0million. Revenue in 2004 was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in our Federal Government Solutions and European Operations segments that was offset by decreased sales in our Commercial Solutions, State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions and Package Solutions segments. Our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased 26% to approximately 6,450 in 2004 from approximately 5,100 in 2003. Other revenues increased to $33.9\u00a0million in 2004 from $28.0\u00a0million in 2003 due to our acquisition of Ascent and sales of their proprietary software product. The Ascent increase was partially offset by decreased domestic hardware and software sales.

The impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment.

A Right is also attached to all shares of Common Stock issued after the dividend date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series\u00a0A Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.01, at a purchase price of two hundred fifty dollars, subject to adjustment. The Rights become exercisable ten business\u00a0days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock. In the event the Rights become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder, other than the Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement), to that number of shares of our Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In the event the Rights become exercisable because of a merger or certain other business combination, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase common stock of the acquiring company having a market value, 927864=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comprehensive income (loss) includes changes in the balances of items that are reported directly as separate components of shareholders' equity.

At December\u00a031, 2002, we owned approximately 10% of ECsoft Group plc (\"ECsoft\") that we had acquired in the open market that was accounted for as a marketable security at market value. In January\u00a02003, as a result of our acquisition of all of the remaining shares of ECsoft, the total ECsoft purchase price, including the shares held at December\u00a031, 2002, have been accounted for based on actual cost. Accordingly, the unrealized gain on ECsoft shares of $2.2\u00a0million that was recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income at December\u00a031, 2002, was reversed in 2003., 1097418=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bank Line of Credit\u0097We have a $60\u00a0million revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A that expires on September\u00a030, 2007. The line of credit will remain unsecured, unless borrowings exceed $40\u00a0million for two consecutive fiscal quarters, or, if certain financial covenant thresholds are exceeded, in which case, substantially all of CIBER's assets would secure the line of credit. The interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest (\"prime\") less 1.00% to prime less 0.30%, depending on CIBER's Pricing Ratio and changes, as required, on the first day of each quarter. CIBER's Pricing Ratio is defined as the ratio of CIBER's Senior Funded Indebtedness at the end of each quarter, divided by CIBER's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Funded Indebtedness means the sum of our liabilities for borrowed money, excluding our Debentures and any liabilities under any swap contract. On December\u00a031, 2005, the bank's prime rate was 7.25% and our rate for borrowing was 6.45%. We are also required to pay a fee per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit. This fee ranges from 0.25% to 0.50%, depending on CIBER's Pricing Ratio and changes, as required, on the first day of each quarter. The line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants including: a maximum senior leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a maximum asset coverage ratio. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December\u00a031, 2005. The terms of the credit agreement also contain, among other provisions, specific limitations on additional indebtedness, liens and acquisitions, purchases of treasury stock, investment activity and prohibits the payment of any dividends. The line of credit provides for the issuance of up to $15\u00a0million in letters of credit. Any outstanding letters of credit reduce the maximum available borrowings under the line of credit.

At the time of the acquisition, ECsoft had operations in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. that provided IT consulting services similar to services provided by CIBER. We acquired ECsoft to increase the size of our European operations and add depth to our European management team. At the time of the acquisition, we expected ECsoft to add approximately $55\u00a0million in annual revenue. For 2005, CIBER Europe Limited recognized revenue from prior ECsoft operations totaling approximately $50\u00a0million. These revenue results include our Denmark operation which incurred significant cost overruns on two fixed-price projects that constrained revenue and operating income results in that operation by approximately $4.5\u00a0million during 2005.

The impact of these accelerations is reflected in the 2004 and 2005 stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method presented above. All of the options accelerated in 2004 and approximately 2.5\u00a0million of the options accelerated in 2005 were accelerated on\u00a0days when their exercise prices were greater than the market price of our stock and, 714111=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December\u00a02005, we entered into a one-year cross-currency swap arrangement to partially hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain Euro-based foreign operations. The notional amount of the swap is \u20ac42.0\u00a0million/$50.0\u00a0million. A 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro would result in a $5\u00a0million change in the value of our hedge instrument. During the term of the cross-currency swap, we will also remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to the three-month EURIBOR rate plus 0.11% and the three-month U.S. LIBOR rate, respectively. At December\u00a031, 2005, CIBER pays interest at a rate of 2.60% and receives interest at a rate of 4.53% on the notional amount, and such rates are reset quarterly. Therefore, changes in the EURIBOR and U.S. LIBOR rates will impact our net interest expense., 1159203=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries. At December\u00a031, 2005, these undistributed earnings totaled approximately $52.2\u00a0million. If some of these earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes; in addition, as foreign taxes have previously been paid on these earnings, we would expect to be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed on such distribution. As such, it is not practicable to determine the net amount of the related unrecognized U. S. deferred tax liability., 1191626=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repurchase Program\u0097In 1999, we began a share repurchase program.

In total, as of December\u00a031, 2005, approximately 11,479,154 shares have been repurchased under this program since its inception. In December\u00a02005, the Board of Directors revised the Company's share repurchase program to authorize the Company's management to repurchase up to $7.5\u00a0million of either common shares or convertible debt, whichever is determined to be more advantageous. In 2005, we repurchased 1,470,000 common shares under this program at a cost of $10.5\u00a0million. We did not repurchase any of our convertible debt during 2005. At December\u00a031, 2005, there was approximately $6.9\u00a0million remaining for future repurchases under this program., 468500=Bobby G.

Effective July\u00a01, 2005, 50%-100% of the annual retainer must be paid in stock, with the percentage to be set by the individual director on a semi-annual basis. The Chairmen of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees of the Board receive an additional retainer amount of $15,000, $10,000 and $5,000, respectively, due to the additional time needed to fulfill these responsibilities. All directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred to attend meetings. The retainer was increased to its current annual level and a meeting fee of $1,500 per committee meeting attended (previously $1,000) was approved in May\u00a02005 with an effective date of July\u00a01, 2005.

Historically, we have used our operating cash flow, borrowings under our line of credit, periodic sales of our common stock, as well as the sale of Debentures, to finance ongoing operations as well as business combinations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our operating cash flow and our available line of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year., 1005980=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For purposes of our 2003 and 2004 diluted earnings per share calculations, we assumed that the Debentures had been fully surrendered for conversion, the result of which would require us to issue approximately 12,830,000 shares of our common stock. In 2003, however, the Debentures were outstanding for only one month, thus their dilutive effect was 1,069,000 shares. On January\u00a04, 2005, we made an irrevocable election to settle not less than 30% of the principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for conversion in cash and not in shares. As a result, our calculations of diluted earnings per share thereafter assumed conversion of only 70% of the Debentures, which would require us to issue approximately 8,981,000 shares of our common stock. On July\u00a020, 2005, we amended our irrevocable election to settle 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for conversion in cash and not in shares. As a result, our calculations of diluted earnings per share thereafter assumed conversion of none of the Debentures. Due to the irrevocable elections mentioned above, our calculations of diluted earnings per share for 2005 were calculated on a pro rata basis and resulted in approximately 4,978,000 shares being included in our diluted weighted average shares for the year. Subsequent year's calculations of diluted earnings per share will not include any shares related to the conversion of the Debentures., 509643=consideration and to repay Ascent's debt.

In 2004, we also used our cash to repay $52.6\u00a0million of debt acquired in connection with our SCB and Ascent acquisitions. We purchased $10.5\u00a0million of treasury stock during 2005, as compared to $11.2\u00a0million in 2004. At December\u00a031, 2005, we had authorization for the repurchase of an additional $6.9\u00a0million of common stock or convertible debt under our current repurchase plan. We may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock or our convertible debt, whichever is more advantageous. The cash provided by sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and options exercised decreased to $5.7\u00a0million in 2005, as compared to $8.6\u00a0million in 2004., 665640=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gross profit percentage on services decreased 160 basis points in 2004 and 70 basis points in 2005.

In 2005, continued project cost overruns on the two fixed-price projects in our Denmark operation mentioned above, along with poor performance in the first half of the year in one of our U.K. offices negatively impacted services gross profit by approximately 250 basis points. Positively impacting European services gross profit in 2005 was the full year benefit of Ascent and Novasoft which combined, added approximately $60\u00a0million of incremental services revenue yielding gross margins of approximately 32.5%; positively impacting services gross profit percentage by approximately 140 basis points. The remainder of the 2005 fluctuation in services gross margin, approximately 40 basis points, is due to an approximate 400 basis point improvement in gross margins in our Netherlands operation. The remainder of the fluctuation in gross profit percentage for both 2003 and 2004 was due to a change in the mix of our business resulting from our various acquisitions during those\u00a0years of companies that operated at more traditional industry levels. The gross profit percentage on Europe's other revenue decreased from 56.2% in 2004 to 46.9% in 2005 due to unusually high gross profit on Ascent software sales in 2004 related to Ascent's proprietary CRM product, whereas the majority of other revenue in 2005 related to lower margin re-selling activity of other non-proprietary products., 623746=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions (\"State\u00a0& Local\") revenue in 2004 and 2005 significantly benefited from our March\u00a02004 acquisition of SCB. Excluding the impact of that acquisition, total revenue for 2005 increased on an organic basis by approximately 4% compared to 2004, and 2004 total revenue decreased organically by approximately 8% compared to 2003. 2005 consulting services revenue grew organically by approximately 10%, while other revenue, which in the State\u00a0& Local segment consists of low margin, third-party hardware and software product re-selling activity, fell by over 50%. The organic growth in 2005 services revenue was attributed to growth in our security practice, as well as our ability to leverage our expertise in certain State\u00a0& Local verticals. The decrease in 2004 organic total revenue was due primarily to IT budget constraints in the state and local government marketplace resulting from overall state and local budget deficits., 900633=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We account for the development cost of software intended for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a086, \"Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed\" (\"SFAS 86\"). SFAS 86 requires product development costs to be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is attained. The Company determines technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a working model or a detailed program design as specified by SFAS 86. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product. At December\u00a031, 2005, unamortized software development costs were $2.5\u00a0million and are included in \"other assets\" on the balance sheet. There was no related amortization expense for the twelve\u00a0months ended December\u00a031, 2005 as the product under development has not yet been released., 509916=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCB Computer Technology,\u00a0Inc. (\"SCB\")\u0097Based in Memphis, Tennessee, SCB provided IT services similar to CIBER, including consulting, outsourcing and professional staffing, with a particular focus on federal and state government clients. The aggregate purchase price included $44.3\u00a0million in cash and $12.7\u00a0million in CIBER common stock. In addition, SCB had certain debt obligations, totaling approximately $33.1\u00a0million that we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition. We used a portion of the cash raised from our Debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay SCB's debt. This acquisition expanded our Federal Government Solutions and State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions segments and added beneficial customer relationships to our Commercial Solutions business. We acquired SCB so that a combined CIBER and SCB would be able to compete more effectively for larger public sector contracts. At the time of the acquisition, we expected SCB to contribute approximately $120\u00a0million in annualized revenue; however, SCB's operations generally had lower average billing rates and slightly lower gross margins than our historical averages, which lower our measurements in these areas. It is difficult to measure the incremental revenue recognized in 2005 from our 2004 acquisition of SCB since many of the SCB offices were combined with existing CIBER offices. However, each of the CIBER reporting segments to which SCB contributed, Commercial Solutions, State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions, and Federal Government Solutions, all realized organic revenue growth during 2005. Our Commercial Solutions segment, which received approximately 15% of SCB's revenue, realized organic growth of approximately 1% in 2005. Our State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions segment, which received approximately 35% of SCB's revenue, realized organic growth of approximately 4% in 2005. Finally, our Federal Government Solutions segment, which received approximately 50% of SCB's revenue, realized organic growth of approximately 2% in 2005. We believe the acquisition provided an opportunity to realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling, general and administrative costs, primarily by reducing SCB's corporate administrative costs., 322564=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board met seven times in 2005, including four regularly scheduled meetings (held quarterly) and three special meetings. Each director, including incumbents, participated either in person or by conference telephone in at least seventy-five percent (75%) of all the board meetings and committee meetings (of which such director was a member) held in 2005. Each director attended the annual meeting of Stockholders last year. Each director is expected to attend the Annual Meeting. The Company has a regularly scheduled Board meeting on the same day as the annual meeting of Stockholders each year, and all directors are generally in attendance at both meetings., 896812=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cash and cash equivalents includes bank demand and time deposits, money market funds, and all other highly liquid investments with maturities of three\u00a0months or less when purchased. Substantially all of our cash balance at December\u00a031, 2005 and 2004 was maintained by our European subsidiaries, of which, approximately $27.1\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2005 was held by our Novasoft subsidiary. Until we acquire 100% ownership of Novasoft, our use of their cash, outside of their business opportunities or needs, is limited under German corporations law., 1100411=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wholesale Financing Agreement\u0097In connection with our operation as an authorized remarketer of certain computer hardware and other products, we have an Agreement for Wholesale Financing with IBM Credit LLC. Outstanding amounts under this agreement, which totaled $7.9\u00a0million and $8.6\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2004 and 2005, respectively, are included in accounts payable. Our payment of individual amounts financed is due within normal trade credit payment terms, generally 45\u00a0days, and are without interest.

We used only $9.6\u00a0million of our cash for acquisitions in 2005, as compared to $120.3\u00a0million for acquisitions in 2004. Spending on property and equipment increased to $10.8\u00a0million in 2005 from $7.4\u00a0million in 2004, as we made investments in our CIBERsites locations, and purchased client project-related assets., 422881=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth information concerning options exercised in 2005 and outstanding options held by the Named Executive Officers as of December\u00a031, 2005.

On July\u00a020, 2005, we increased our irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for conversion. As a result, upon conversion we will deliver cash in lieu of our common stock., 565901=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.2\u00a0million in 2004 from $2.7\u00a0million in 2003 due to additional amortizable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, resulting from our recent acquisitions., 1004297=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On May\u00a031, 2003, we sold our DigiTerra Broadband subsidiary for $2.3\u00a0million, net of expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $643,000, which has been included in other income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2003. As consideration, we initially received $2.0\u00a0million in net cash proceeds and the remaining $300,000 was received in 2004. DigiTerra Broadband was a wholly owned subsidiary of CIBER,\u00a0Inc., that provided technology to automate the sale and management of broadband, wireless and digital video services. Prior to its sale, DigiTerra Broadband generated revenue of $795,000 and a net operating loss of $156,000 for the five\u00a0months ended May\u00a031, 2003., 408046=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table sets forth information regarding options granted to the Named Executive Officers during the year ended December\u00a031, 2005., 932913=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2005, we acquired the interest held by a minority shareholder in one of our foreign subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $1.7\u00a0million, which included approximately 20,000 shares of CIBER common stock valued at $186,000. This increased our European segment goodwill balance by $1.7\u00a0million., 254337=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Proxy Statement and the accompanying Proxy are sent to you on behalf of the Board of Directors of CIBER,\u00a0Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company,\" \"we\" or \"us\"), in connection with the solicitation of Proxies for use at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Annual Meeting\" or \"Meeting\").

This registration statement enables us to raise funds from the offering of common stock from time to time, subject to market condition and our capital needs., 555406=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total revenue increased 13% to $956.0\u00a0million in 2005 from $843.0\u00a0million in 2004. The 2005 revenue growth primarily resulted from our 2004 acquisitions of SCB, Ascent and Novasoft along with the 2005 acquisition of a small, single office SAP practice, and was offset by the August\u00a02005 sale of the staffing component of our IBM operation. Collectively, these acquisitions, offset by the divestiture of our IBM staffing operation, added approximately $90\u00a0million in incremental revenue to 2005 as compared to 2004. Excluding the revenue associated with the 2004 and 2005 acquisitions and divestiture from both periods, 2005 revenue would have increased by approximately 3% compared to 2004. Revenue in 2005 was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in all five of our reporting segments, ranging from approximately 1% in our Commercial segment to approximately 10% in our Package segment. Our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased 10% to approximately 7,065 in 2005 from approximately 6,450 in 2004. Other revenue increased to $38.6\u00a0million in 2005 from $33.9\u00a0million in 2004 due to our acquisition of Ascent and sales of their proprietary software product. The Ascent increase was partially offset by an approximate $4.6\u00a0million decrease in domestic hardware and software sales, due in part to a decrease in sales to a large State\u00a0& Local Solutions segment client. Our average billing rate increased to $76 per hour in 2005 compared to $73 per hour in 2004. Higher billing rates in our European Operations segment, now a larger percentage of the overall revenue total, plus higher billing rates in our Commercial Solutions segment, accounted for the majority of the increase. Consultant utilization was 87% in 2005 as compared to 88% in 2004., 1162153=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01994 Employees' Stock Option Plan\u0097Prior to this plan's expiration on January\u00a031, 2004, the plan administrators could grant to officers, employees and consultants, restricted stock, stock options, performance bonuses or any combination thereof. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined the number and nature of such awards. Options issued under this plan are set to become exercisable as determined at the various dates of grant by the Board of Directors and will expire through 2020., 939113=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCB Computer Technology,\u00a0Inc. (\"SCB\")\u0097On March\u00a01, 2004 we acquired SCB Computer Technology,\u00a0Inc. and Subsidiaries. SCB, based in Memphis, Tennessee, provided IT services similar to CIBER, including consulting, outsourcing and professional staffing, with a particular focus on federal and state government clients, and has been combined with our existing operations. At the date of the acquisition, SCB had approximately 1,250 consultants. This acquisition primarily expanded our Federal Government Solutions and State\u00a0& Local Government Solutions segments, and to a lesser extent, added beneficial customer relationships to our Commercial Solutions business. We acquired SCB because we expect that a combined CIBER and SCB will be able to compete more effectively for larger public sector contracts. The acquisition provided an opportunity to realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling, general and administrative costs, primarily by reducing SCB's corporate administrative costs. The total consideration paid by CIBER for all of SCB's outstanding shares, options and warrants was approximately $57.3\u00a0million consisting of $44.3\u00a0million in cash, 1,353,000 shares of CIBER common stock valued at approximately $12.7\u00a0million and replacement employee stock options valued at $271,000. The value of the CIBER shares issued was based on the average closing price of CIBER stock for the five trading\u00a0days ended three\u00a0days prior to the closing date. Prior to the acquisition by CIBER, SCB common stock was publicly traded in the over-the-counter market., 680759=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 73.3138 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.64 per share, subject to adjustments, prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances: (1)\u00a0during any fiscal quarter commencing after December\u00a031, 2003, if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading\u00a0days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; (2)\u00a0during the five business\u00a0days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures for each day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures; (3)\u00a0if the Debentures have been called for redemption; or (4)\u00a0upon the occurrence of, 1136306=No.\u00a05 (\"SFAS 5\"), \"Accounting for Contingencies,\" we establish the reserves based upon our assessment of the exposure associated with certain tax positions. The tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjusted, as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves, such as when the statutory period for assessing tax on a given tax return or period expires, the reserve associated with that period is reduced. In addition, the adjustment to the reserve may reflect additional exposure based on current calculations. Similarly, if tax authorities provide administrative guidance or a decision is rendered in the courts, appropriate adjustments will be made to the tax reserve. At December\u00a031, 2005, we have recorded a tax reserve of $2.5\u00a0million that is included in \"other accrued expenses and liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheet., 662838=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our European Operations (\"European\") segment revenue increased dramatically in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Our acquisition of ECsoft in January\u00a02003 and our acquisitions of Ascent in May\u00a02004 and Novasoft in September\u00a02004 contributed significantly to the increase. ECsoft (now named CIBER Europe Limited) contributed revenue of approximately $55\u00a0million in 2003, $60\u00a0million in 2004, and $50\u00a0million in 2005. The 2005 ECsoft revenue results include our Denmark operation which incurred significant losses on two fixed-price projects that constrained revenue and operating income results in that operation by approximately $4.5\u00a0million. The two Denmark fixed-price projects are for a public sector client and are still ongoing. The cost overruns are the result of poor price estimating during the bidding phase, an initial poor technical design on one of the projects, resulting in a re-write of the application, poor project management and resource allocation and an inefficient change control process resulting in an expansion of the project scope without any incremental increase to the fixed price. We currently anticipate that both of these projects will be complete early in the second quarter of 2006. Ascent and Novasoft contributed approximately $25\u00a0million and $27\u00a0million in 2004, respectively, and $38\u00a0million and $84\u00a0million in 2005, respectively. Excluding acquisition related revenue, organic increases in European segment revenue were 33% in 2004 and 6% in 2005. The 2004 organic revenue increase includes the impact of favorable changes in foreign currency rates vs. the U.S. Dollar, which we estimate contributed approximately $3\u00a0million. In 2005, however, the U.S. Dollar was relatively neutral for the year against the foreign currencies that impact our European operations, though the U.S. Dollar did strengthen in the last six\u00a0months of 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our European Operations had organic revenue growth of approximately 17% in 2004 and 6% in 2005. The 2004 organic growth rate is somewhat distorted by the large percentage of overall revenue contributed by acquisitions in 2003 and 2004. Other revenue in 2004 and 2005 represents Ascent's sales of proprietary and third party software products., 1163750=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCB Employee Inducement Award Plan\u0097Effective March\u00a01, 2004, we established the SCB Employee Inducement Award Plan. This plan was established to provide new CIBER employees who joined the Company as a result of the SCB acquisition with CIBER stock options. This is a single-purpose plan approved by CIBER's Board of Directors under which options for approximately 275,000 shares were issued. No further options may be granted under this plan., 332061=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Board determined that, with respect to their Committee assignments for 2006, Mr.\u00a0Cheesbrough, Mr.\u00a0Jacobs, Mr.\u00a0McGill and Mr.\u00a0Sissel have the requisite independence to serve as members of the Company's Audit Committee under both the Exchange Act and NYSE requirements, that Mr.\u00a0Spira, Mr.\u00a0McGill and Dr.\u00a0Wetherbe have the requisite independence to serve as members of the Company's Compensation Committee and that Mr.\u00a0Sissel, Mr.\u00a0Jacobs, Dr.\u00a0Wetherbe and Mr.\u00a0Stevenson have the requisite independence to serve as members of the Company's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee pursuant to the NYSE requirements., 439834=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2005, pursuant to the report of the Committee's external consultant, Mercer Consulting, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend options to purchase 600,000 shares of stock. The option awards were based on the consultant's review that his long term incentive awards trailed the average of similarly situated individuals and to incent future performance. Option grants were also made to Messrs.\u00a0Girard and Durham to purchase 250,000 shares and 30,000 shares, respectively, over the course of 2005 for the same reasons.

As of December\u00a031, 2005, we had $42.6\u00a0million of outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. The line of credit will remain unsecured, unless borrowings exceed $40\u00a0million for two consecutive fiscal quarters or if certain financial covenant thresholds are exceeded, in which case, substantially all of CIBER's assets would secure the line of credit. The interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest (\"prime\") less 1.00% to prime less 0.30%, depending on CIBER's Pricing Ratio and changes, as required, on the first day of each quarter. CIBER's Pricing Ratio is defined as the ratio of CIBER's Senior Funded Indebtedness at the end of each quarter divided by CIBER's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended. On December\u00a031, 2005, the bank's prime rate was 7.25% and our rate for borrowing was 6.45%. We are also required to pay a fee per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit.

Other intangible assets include, among other things, customer-related assets such as order backlog, customer contracts and customer relationships. Determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment, assumptions and estimates. We often use third parties to assist us with such valuations. At December\u00a031, 2005, we had $24.7\u00a0million of other intangible assets. In addition, these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life., 1260414=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following tables reconcile 2005 organic revenue growth by segment to the most comparable GAAP measure, reported revenue growth by segment., 713427=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During 2005, approximately 23% of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations. Our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short-term intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies. Foreign sales are mostly made from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. Our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well, which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations., 625566=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 320 basis points in 2005 as compared to 2004. The lower gross profit percentage on services revenue in 2005, explained above, partially offset by lower SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue, accounted for the operating income percentage decrease. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively flat between 2003 and 2004, and thus the, 437568=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding bonus compensation for 2005, after considering the elements above, the Committee determined the maximum target bonus compensation target for the Chief Executive Officer to be $330,000. The actual cash bonus earned by the Chief Executive Officer was $142,087 as a result of achieving a percentage of the financial targets and achieving the maximum target for the subjective factors determined by the Committee. The target goals for the Chief Financial Officer, Mr.\u00a0Durham, were the same as the goals for the CEO, however, the maximum bonus earnable was $150,000. Mr.\u00a0Durham earned a bonus of $64,585. Mr.\u00a0Girard, the Company's Chief Operating Officer effective September\u00a09, 2005, was given the opportunity to achieve a maximum bonus of $75,000 for 2005 based upon four\u00a0months of integration and assimilation of his responsibilities. The actual cash bonus earned by Mr.\u00a0Girard was $75,000. Mr.\u00a0Birdseye was given the opportunity to achieve a bonus in 2005 of $175,000 based upon revenue and net operating income goals. Mr.\u00a0Birdseye also had the opportunity to earn an additional bonus based on the number and size of certain types of new business opportunities that were sold. Mr.\u00a0Birdseye earned a total bonus of $163,519. Mr.\u00a0Laugerud had the opportunity to earn a bonus of $158,000 based on the operating performance of European business units, including revenue and operating income and a subjective factor; Mr.\u00a0Laugerud earned a bonus of $71,882., 463098=ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO SEC REPORTS ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE And ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF 2007 PROXY STATEMENT, 253919=PROXY STATEMENT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS MAY\u00a02, 2006, 1162805=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directors' Stock Option Plan\u0097Prior to its expiration on January\u00a031, 2004, this plan provided for the issuance of stock options to non-employee, non-affiliate directors.

The minority shareholders' proportionate share of the equity of these subsidiaries is reflected as \"minority interest\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income or loss of these subsidiaries is included in \"other income, net\" in the consolidated statement of operations.

Based on their evaluation as of December\u00a031, 2005, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule\u00a013a-15(e)\u00a0under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms., 249915=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CIBER,\u00a0Inc., a Delaware corporation, will be held via the Internet at www.ciber.com/cbr/annualmeeting on Tuesday, May\u00a02, 2006 at 9:30\u00a0a.m. Mountain Daylight Time for the purposes stated below.

These derivative financial instruments generally have maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk. These foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify as hedges and, accordingly, gains and losses from settlement of such contracts, as well as changes in fair value of any open contracts are included in \"other income, net\" in the consolidated statement of operations. Net gains of $376,000 and $748,000 were recorded in 2004 and 2005, respectively. There were no open forward contracts at December\u00a031, 2005., 929764=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December\u00a02004, the FASB issued SFAS\u00a0123R, which is a revision of SFAS\u00a0123. SFAS\u00a0123R also supersedes APB 25 and its related implementation guidance, and amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a095, \"Statement of Cash Flows.\" We will adopt SFAS\u00a0123R effective January\u00a01, 2006. SFAS\u00a0123R requires companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the grant-date fair value of all awards of equity instruments, including stock options, to employees. Expense is to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service. Under the modified prospective transition method we expect to apply, compensation cost will be recognized after the date of adoption for: 1)\u00a0the portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS\u00a0123R for which service has not yet been rendered, and 2)\u00a0all subsequent share-based awards. The implementation of the provisions of SFAS\u00a0123R will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share. We estimate that the adoption of SFAS\u00a0123R will reduce our 2006 net income by approximately $1.3\u00a0million to $1.5\u00a0million; however, actual results may vary depending on our future stock price, number of options issued and any future changes to our employee stock option programs., 1102085=value of the borrowings under our bank line of credit and bank term loan approximate their fair values due to the variable interest rates on these borrowings. We estimate the fair value of our $175\u00a0million Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures to be approximately $149.0\u00a0million based on the trading price for our debentures on December\u00a031, 2005., 430316=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March\u00a01, 1996, the Board, on behalf of the Company, entered into a Salary Continuation Retirement Plan with Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend where it agreed to make certain post-employment payments to him or to his designated beneficiaries, except in the event of a termination for cause. The plan was revised effective May\u00a02004, November\u00a02004 and March\u00a02005, to align payments with the current cost of living and to delete outdated segments of the vesting table. The plan provides that payments will be made for 15\u00a0years after Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend's termination of employment with the Company, beginning at age 60, and will range from $137,500 at this time to $200,000 per year, based on Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend's age at the time of termination of employment. The plan also provides that, should Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend's employment terminate subsequent to a change of control of the Company, the payments will be 150% of the amounts payable at age 60 or 61 multiplied by the number of\u00a0years Mr.\u00a0Slingerlend has been employed by the Company, not to exceed twenty (20)\u00a0years., 1157474=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on our evaluation of current and anticipated future taxable income, we believe sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax assets.

The 2005 amount was primarily comprised of a $1.0\u00a0million gain on the sale of our IBM staffing operation during the third quarter and gains on foreign currency forward contracts of $748,000, offset by foreign currency losses of $1.2\u00a0million and minority interest expense of $341,000. Other income in 2004 included foreign currency gains of $1.2\u00a0million, $376,000 of gains on foreign currency forward contracts and minority interest income of $70,000. Our effective tax rate was 36.0% in 2005 compared to 37.3% in 2004. Our effective tax rates in both 2005 and 2004 were favorably impacted by a Federal research credit. The lower rate in 2005 was due to an adjustment to the expected benefit of the research and experimentation credit that CIBER first recognized at the end of 2004. Absent the adjustment to the expected benefit of this tax credit, CIBER's effective tax rate for 2005 would have been approximately 39%., 252327=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You are cordially invited to join us via audio webcast at CIBER's 2006 Annual Meeting., 565365=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SG&A increased to $176.7\u00a0million in 2004 from $158.2\u00a0million in 2003, due to the incremental costs associated with our 2004 acquisitions. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 20.9% in 2004 from 22.8% in 2003, as we continued efforts to contain costs and leverage our existing overhead infrastructure. Contributing to this was a combined $2.0\u00a0million decrease in office rent and SG&A depreciation expense in 2004., 586494=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commercial segment's operating income percentage declined to 7.2% in 2005 from 8.3% in 2004 due to the previously discussed gross profit decline combined with higher SG&A costs. The higher SG&A costs are primarily due to the investment we are making in CIBERsites, our low-cost application development and support centers., 719219=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u0097Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February\u00a027, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon., 680148=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures\u0097In a private placement on December\u00a02, 2003, we issued $175\u00a0million of 2.875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures (\"Debentures\") due to mature in December\u00a02023. The Debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities.

(\"AlphaNet\")\u0097On June\u00a025, 2003, we completed our acquisition of AlphaNet. Prior to the acquisition, AlphaNet's shares were publicly traded on the NASDAQ. We acquired all of the approximately 6.3\u00a0million outstanding shares of AlphaNet for cash consideration of $4.05 per share. The aggregate purchase price for all of AlphaNet's shares, including stock options, totaled approximately $28.5\u00a0million, excluding transaction-related costs. CIBER paid to the holders of vested AlphaNet stock options having an exercise price of less than $4.05 per share, the amount of $4.05 minus the exercise price of each vested stock option. A significant consideration in arriving at the purchase price was AlphaNet's cash balance of $19.0\u00a0million at closing. AlphaNet, located in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, provided IT consulting services similar to CIBER and had 120 consultants at the time of the acquisition.

Our effective tax rate in 2004 was favorably impacted by a Federal research credit while 2003 was largely impacted by tax benefits resulting from the closure of certain subsidiary operations. Our acquisition of Novasoft in late 2004 has also slightly increased our effective tax rates, as Novasoft operates in foreign countries with higher tax rates., 320638=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a016(a)\u00a0of the Exchange Act requires that the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own greater than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities file initial reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities with the Commission and the Company. Based solely upon its review of copies of the Section\u00a016(a)\u00a0reports received by the Company, and written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during the year ended December\u00a031, 2005, all of its directors, executive officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners were in compliance with their filing requirements, including the accelerated filing requirements under Sarbanes-Oxley, with two exceptions.

Several factors were responsible: first, the Company put a heavy dependence on high-priced subcontractors, particularly for the work associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in New Orleans; second, we experienced lower average billing rates and lower utilization elsewhere in the segment; and third, we experienced a project cost overrun and a fourth quarter project cancellation and delay that negatively impacted our service growth profit percentage by approximately 170 basis points., 1093219=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December\u00a02, 2003, in a private placement, we issued $175\u00a0million of 2.875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures (\"Debentures\") due to mature in December\u00a02023.

Gross profit percentage on services revenue improved by 50 basis points in 2004 to 26.3% compared to 25.8% in 2003 due to our continued shift away from IT staffing toward higher-margin project-based work. Our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased by 280 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004, which was due to the mix of products sold and our focus on the sale of higher margin products. In 2004, we experienced a 170 basis point decline in our gross profit percentage on other revenue as compared to 2003, which was due to the pricing pressures and increased competition mentioned above., 723178=Denver, Colorado February\u00a06, 2004, except as to Note\u00a019, which is as of March\u00a010, 2005, 605678=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal gross profit percentage decreased by 50 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004 and by 300 basis points in 2004 compared to 2003. Federal gross profit percentages were 23.4% in 2005, 23.9% in 2004 and 26.9% in 2003. Revenue and gross profit contributed by our March\u00a02004 acquisition of SCB accounted for the entire decline. The average gross profit percentage associated with the revenue contributed by SCB for ten\u00a0months of 2004 and a full year in 2005 was approximately 18%. This compares to gross profit margins associated with \"non-SCB\" Federal segment revenue of approximately 28% over that same two-year period. The majority of the Federal revenue contributed by SCB consists of long-term contracts with low bill rates and low gross margins. Although gross margins are low on, 603510=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal Government Solutions (\"Federal\") revenue increased significantly in 2004 and continued the upward trend in 2005, though at a much slower pace. Our acquisition of SCB in March\u00a0of 2004 contributed to both the 2004 and 2005 revenue increases, adding incremental revenue of approximately $50\u00a0million in 2004 and approximately $10\u00a0million in 2005. Excluding the impact of the SCB acquisition, Federal revenue grew organically by approximately 28% in 2004 and 2% in 2005 compared to the prior\u00a0years. The 2004 organic revenue increase is primarily due to increased spending, particularly in the areas of defense and homeland security within existing government agency clients, as well as the successful penetration of new agency accounts resulting in new contract wins. In 2005, while revenue grew organically for the year compared to 2004, during 2005 revenue declined by approximately 10% in the last half of the year compared to the first half. The decrease is due primarily to the loss of revenue from an outsourcing contract where CIBER was a subcontractor to a larger prime vendor. The term of the outsourcing contract ended, and it was required by the Federal agency for which the work was being performed that the contract be re-bid. CIBER and the prime vendor with whom we partnered were unsuccessful in our effort to continue providing services under the contract. Loss of this contract resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $8\u00a0million in the second half of 2005. In addition, the Federal segment recognized approximately $2\u00a0million less revenue in the last six\u00a0months of 2005 compared to the first six\u00a0months on a telecommunications outsourcing arrangement where we provide maintenance services on a time and materials basis. This contract remains in place, and the maintenance services associated with it will continue to fluctuate up and down based on demand. Revenue for the remaining Federal operations grew by approximately 1% in the last six\u00a0months of 2005 compared to the first six\u00a0months., 584225=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Commercial Solutions (\"Commercial\") revenue increased slightly in 2005 despite the negative impact from the August\u00a02005 sale of our IBM staffing operation. The sale negatively affected services revenue by approximately $5\u00a0million in 2005 compared to 2004. Incremental revenue contributed by our 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately $4\u00a0million. Absent the acquisition and divestiture activity, organic growth was approximately 1% during 2005 and was achieved mainly because of our continued shift away from IT staffing and toward more project-based work. Commercial revenue was negatively impacted in 2003 and 2004 because of a large telecommunications client that significantly reduced the use of our services in September\u00a0of 2003. This client reduction negatively impacted revenue by approximately $7\u00a0million in 2003 and by $8\u00a0million in 2004. Other revenue for our Commercial segment represents the resale of third-party hardware and software products. In 2004, the substantial decrease in other revenue as compared to 2003 was the result of continued downward pricing pressure on hardware and software, resulting from increased competition from the direct sales channels of hardware and software manufacturers., 559581=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased to $204.6\u00a0million in 2005 from $176.7\u00a0million in 2004, primarily due to our 2004 acquisitions. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 21.4% in 2005 from 20.9% in 2004. The increase is due primarily to expected higher SG&A costs in our European Operations segment, now a larger percentage of our overall business due to our acquisitions of Ascent and Novasoft. Excluding Europe, SG&A as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by approximately 20 basis points., 1195343=of two times the exercise price of the Right.

On July\u00a020, 2005, we increased our irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for conversion. As a result, upon conversion we will deliver cash in lieu of our common stock., 1178246=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Summary information about CIBER,\u00a0Inc. stock options outstanding and exercisable at December\u00a031, 2005 is as follows:, 251432=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board of Directors of the Company fixed the close of business on March\u00a06, 2006 as the Record Date for determining those Stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.

In 2005, operating income declined by 60 basis points to 12.7% from 13.3% in 2004, which is a combination of the lower SCB gross margins throughout the year combined with lower operating margins in the last six\u00a0months resulting from the decline in revenue previously discussed., 442662=Copyright \u00a9 2006, Standard\u00a0& Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,\u00a0Inc.

As an inducement for the Shareholder to enter into the Lockup Agreement, CIBER granted the Shareholder an option that under certain circumstances, the Shareholder could require CIBER to repurchase up to 805,000 shares of CIBER common stock at $7.25 per share. In May\u00a02003, the Shareholder exercised this option.

Higher labor costs accounted for the majority of the services gross profit percentage decline. The 400 basis point decrease in 2004 in gross profit percentage on services revenue was due to constrained demand because of the Oracle takeover attempt of PeopleSoft previously mentioned, which caused billing rates to compress slightly. In addition, cost overruns on a PeopleSoft project in the first half of 2004 also negatively impacted gross profit margins on services revenue. Gross profit on other revenue, which consists of commission dollars earned on the resale of certain hardware products, increased by 480 basis points in 2005 over 2004 related to higher commission rates on higher revenue volumes. Overall, gross profit percentage, after suffering a 350 basis point decline in 2004 related to the PeopleSoft takeover and surrounding uncertainty, improved by 40 basis points in 2005. The improvement was constrained by the higher labor costs mentioned above., 937030=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ascent Technology Group Limited (\"Ascent\")\u0097On May\u00a024, 2004 we acquired Ascent Technology Group Limited and Subsidiaries.

Ascent also developed and sells their own proprietary customer relationship management software. At the time of the acquisition, Ascent had approximately 130 consultants. This acquisition expands our existing U.K. presence and allows us to achieve economies of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of revenue.
