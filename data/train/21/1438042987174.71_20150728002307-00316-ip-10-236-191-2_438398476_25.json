            "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SENDING, ROUTING, AND RECEIVING INFORMATION USING CONCISE MESSAGES - A system and method are provided for communication between a communication device and a content provider associated with an internet domain name and a server. The system includes a network with a user interface, an internet connection, and an interface to the content provider's internet domain. A communication device user enters a concise message request which includes a channel, a designator and, optionally, a request instruction. The combination of the channel and the designator specify a location on the internet at which routing instructions reside for responding to the concise message request and generating a concise message response for output to the communication device. Concise message documents can be generated for effecting financial transactions such as purchases and payments via SMS. CMRL can also be used to route person-to-person messaging through a content provider's internet domain at which the users may be registered.",
