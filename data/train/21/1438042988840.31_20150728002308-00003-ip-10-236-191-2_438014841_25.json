He made a flying start to the domestic 2005-06 season, with three centuries, and was soon in his country's limited-overs side. In only his third match, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007. But in both matches he suffered from cramps and would be keen to eradicate that problem as he strives for more lengthy innings. He scores heavily from the pull and from slog-sweeping the spinners and his free-flowing game has made him a hit with crowds. There was evidence of that during the IPL and Champions League when the Bangalore crowds cheered him as their 'local' hero., 73632=New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year 2009, 70689=Jun 23, 2015, 66316=Given New Zealand's lack of Tests it wasn't until the 2007-08 tour of South Africa that Taylor made his debut and he struggled against the extra bounce. Back at home he was dropped against Bangladesh, but return in style against England with his maiden century, 120, at Hamilton and then followed that with a memorable 154 at Old Trafford, confirming he now carries New Zealand's batting hopes. A leadership role wasn't too far away and he was named captain for the tri-series in Sri Lanka in 2010 after Vettori and McCullum opted out., 35397=Born March 8, 1984, Lower Hutt, Wellington, 72338=Jun 14, 2015}",
