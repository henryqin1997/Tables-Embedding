Also, apply for Financial Aid well in advance (as close to Jan. 1 is possible). Research your professors so that your class experience can be better. Most of all, stay on track! Try to take classes that you know will definitely transfer if you're looking to transfer. If needed, make more than one counselor appointment.

Tips for prospective students Register as soon as possible, classes fill up quick. Make sure to do the research yourself or speak with a counselor before you register. It's easy to plan out your classes well in advance to ensure you either get your degree, make your transfer requirements, or do both within two years but it's also very easy to stay at Solano for up to five without transferring. Be careful! Bang for the buck It's a community college. It costs less than car insurance.
