The 10-play, 66-yard march featured five Pierce runs totaling 37 yards and a 22-yard strike from Flacco to Torrey Smith, but stalled after Baltimore got inside the Indianapolis 10., 78785=That score wouldn't remain for long. Bernard Pierce got loose for a 43-yard run three plays after Vinatieri's miss to place Baltimore back into the red zone, and Boldin won a jump ball with Darius Butler in the end zone for an 18- yard score two snaps later to increase the margin to 15 points with 9:14 remaining., 73957=Inspired by the return of emotional team leader Ray Lewis, the Ravens defense held the upstart Colts to three Adam Vinatieri field goals and spoiled the playoff debut of rookie quarterback Andrew Luck and the return of Indianapolis head coach Chuck Pagano to Baltimore, where he spent four years as an assistant under John Harbaugh before taking over the Colts last January., 74344=Playing for the first time since mid-October due to a torn triceps and just days after announcing his retirement at season's end, Lewis was credited with 13 tackles in his final game at M&T Bank Stadium to spearhead Baltimore's effort. Outside linebacker Paul Kruger came up with a big game as well, registering 2 1/2 of the Ravens' three sacks of Luck and causing one of three takeaways with a forced fumble., 75160=The Ravens now advance to a meeting with Manning's top-seeded Denver Broncos in next Saturday's Divisional Round. The Colts bested Baltimore twice with the four-time MVP under center in previous Divisional matchups, earning a 15-6 road win in 2006 and a 20-3 home decision in 2009. Manning also led Denver to a 34-17 victory over the Ravens in Baltimore on Dec. 16., 80682=Luck managed just 31 yards on 5-of-13 passing over the Colts' first four drives, but hit on two big completions to Dwayne Allen for 22 and 13 yards on Indianapolis' next touch to put the team in position for Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal that tied the game with 2:25 left in the half., 79200=After getting down to the Baltimore 18 on the first of those drives, Luck's pass in Wayne's direction was deflected by Corey Graham and intercepted by Cary Williams. Indianapolis then turned it over on downs in the waning stages, with the Ravens proceeding to run out the final 2:10 and prevail.}",
