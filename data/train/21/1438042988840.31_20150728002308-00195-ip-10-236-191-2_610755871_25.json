    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{4643=The\u00a0g7-2007sg comes with a 750 GB hard drive\u00a0and\u00a08 GB RAM (two\u00a04 GB modules of DDR3-1600 RAM from Nanya)., 19532=One of our main points of criticism when we reviewed the\u00a0Pavilion g7 before was the very disappointing display. Did HP improve the display for the expensive Intel version? The specs are identical: a 17.3-inch display with a resolution of\u00a01600 x 900 pixels. As a result, the pixel density is fairly low at 106 dpi., 34455=After evaluating two of the less expensive models with AMD's Trinity APU (g7-2053sg\u00a0with A6-4400M and\u00a0g7-2051sg\u00a0with A10-4600M) in the last few weeks, we decided to take a look at the most powerful member of the series - the\u00a0g7-2007sg. This model retails for over 700 Euro and features a speedy\u00a0Intel Core i7-3612QM, 8 GB RAM, and a 750 GB hard drive. The\u00a0Radeon HD 7670M\u00a0should offer enough performance for gaming, although the card might have some issues with the native resolution of the 17-inch display (1600 x 900 pixels).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{3642=Let's start with the\u00a0Single-Thread performance. The\u00a0A10-4600M\u00a0(2806 points in the\u00a0Cinebench R10 64 Bit) ranks at the very bottom of the g7 performance list. The\u00a0A6-4400M\u00a0features a better Turbo Boost mode and outperforms the 4600M easily (3165 points). Compared to the 5236 points the Core i7 managed to score here, both APUs systems don't stand a chance., 129687=The\u00a0AMD Radeon HD 7670M\u00a0is essentially a newly released version of the\u00a0Radeon HD 6650M\u00a0(introduced January 2011). Its processor is still based on the older 40 nanometer process and uses the\u00a0VLIW5 architecture. The DirectX 11 accelerator has\u00a0480 ALUs, separated in 96 blocks, and a frequency of\u00a0600 MHz. The memory interface has a 128 bit interface to\u00a01 GB DDR3-VRAM\u00a0(900 MHz)., 130322=The performance of the\u00a07670M makes the card a direct competitor of the\u00a0GeForce GT 630M, as the\u00a0results are very close. Running\u00a03DMark 11, the Radeon card scored\u00a01205 points\u00a0- more than OK for the price bracket of this notebook. Although the less expensive\u00a0Pavilion g7-2051sg\u00a0seems to offer better graphics performance due to its\u00a0Crossfire combination of APU and Radeon GPU (2047 points), it has to be said that it suffers from micro stutters and driver issues (these issues are not reflected in the higher score)., 156342=As far as gaming performance is concerned, the\u00a0g7-2007sg delivers what we expected from the combination of\u00a0Core i7-3612QM\u00a0and\u00a0Radeon HD 7670M. Using the maximum display resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels while playing any of the current titles, pushes the graphics card quickly to its limits. The user is then forced to either lower the details or to select a lower resolution. The particularly demanding Battlefield 3 requires the lowest quality setting and a resolution of 1024 x 768 \u00a0to remain playable without any stutters., 107745=The review system with the Intel processor scores 2760 points in PCMark 7 and outscores the models with Trinity APU (it's about 50 to 80 percent faster). Running the older PCMark Vantage, the differences are even more pronounced. The\u00a0g7-2007sg performs about as well as the\u00a0Dell Inspiron 17R-SE, which also features a quad-core processor.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Noise Level Even during idle and low ambient temperatures, the fan in the notebook is always on (albeit spinning slowly). The result is a system noise level of\u00a033.1 to 34.2 dB(A) - definitely noticeable in quiet environments. We don't think it's necessary: other notebooks remain passively cooled when the temperature of their processor is between 30 and 40 degrees Celsius (86 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit). The hard drive of the system is barely audible. During 3D applications, noise level only increases about 3 to 4 dB and reaches\u00a037.6 dB(A). Compared to other 17-inch systems, the\u00a0g7-2007sg does well here and remains fairly unobtrusive even during longer gaming sessions. The noise level peaked at a surprisingly high\u00a048.2 dB(A) when we ran our stress test - a value that won't be reached during normal use though. Under full load, the fan system emits fairly high frequencies, but when the load decreases, the noise level drops back down within a few seconds. Noise Level Idle 33.1 / 33.2 / 34.2 dB(A)",
