Play it safe though and always walk out with a buddy after dark. Great for these types of students Bellevue is great for non-traditional students like me; 49 years old, 5 children, changing careers! What to do for fun No matter what your age, if you are a student at Bellevue, you can join any of the sports! There are always special events going on and others students to chat with. Food and Dining The cafeteria is conveniently located and has pretty good food. The atmosphere is nice with a beautiful fountain and is also a good place to hang out between classes.
