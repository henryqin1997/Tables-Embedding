In addition, the complexity of the writing system often daunts newcomers, as Chinese is one of the few languages in the world that does not use an alphabet or a syllabary; instead, thousands of characters are used, each representing a word or a part of a word. However, most complex Chinese characters are composed of only a few hundred simpler characters and many contain phonetic hints. There is a common Western misconception of Chinese writing as having thousands of distinct and idiomatic symbols each representing a single word, however, Chinese writing is surprisingly mnemonic, granted it is not as simple as the writing of Romance languages. The government of China has developed a system of writing Standard Mandarin pronunciation in the Roman alphabet, known as Hanyu Pinyin, or simply, pinyin (\u6c49\u8bed\u62fc\u97f3/\u6f22\u8a9e\u62fc\u97f3, \"spelling according to sounds\"). Hanyu Pinyin is used to write out Chinese words phonetically in an effort to help learners of Chinese with their pronunciation. This wikibook will teach you Hanyu Pinyin first, before any actual sentences. All examples and new vocabulary will always be given together with Hanyu Pinyin., 35955=This textbook will assume that you have no prior knowledge of Chinese, but are willing to take Chinese as a serious subject of study. Each lesson contains a combination of new vocabulary and new grammar in a gradual progression, building on previous lessons., 257635=There are no articles in Chinese grammar. While English noun clauses often begin with \"a\", \"an\", or \"the\", Chinese is less verbose., 683678=An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008., 684036=The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing., 36226=Each lesson should be appropriate for a week's worth of daily classes, so don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of material per lesson. Learning to write new characters will probably be your limiting factor, so split up the memorization of a lesson's characters over two or three days and use class time mostly for work on grammar and speaking skills., 544454=Here's a list of some nations and regions, with their names in Chinese. Note that the country's name can also be used as an adjective. For example, \u65e5\u672c\u8d27 (r\u00ecb\u011bn hu\u00f2) means \"Japanese goods,\" and is derived from \u65e5\u672c (r\u00ecb\u011bn; Japan) and \u8d27 (hu\u00f2; goods). As an aside, China imports a good number of products from Japan. Between 2001 and 2007, it was the greatest exporter to China, beating the European Union, South Korea, and Taiwan.[1] You could also say \u65e5\u672c\u6905\u5b50 (r\u00ecb\u011bn y\u01d0zi; Japanese chair), \u65e5\u672c\u98df\u54c1 (r\u00ecb\u011bn sh\u00edp\u01d0n; Japanese food products), and \u65e5\u672c\u52a8\u753b\u7247 (r\u00ecb\u011bn d\u00f2nghu\u00e0 pi\u00e0n; Japanese cartoons). Terms like these can be shortened, for example, \u65e5\u8d27 means the same thing. You can see \u65e5 is an adjective which means \"pertaining to Japan,\" i.e., \"Japanese.\" Another way to describe its function is that it acts like a \"root,\" much like in English. Headlines are often abbreviated this way. For example, \u4e2d\u4fc4\u5408\u4f5c (zh\u014dng \u00e9 h\u00e9zu\u00f2) can mean \"China and Russia cooperate\" or \"Sino-Russian cooperation.\" In common conversation, however, excessive abbreviation is undesirable, because it often leads to ambiguity., 635725=The Chinese Wikibook was started 2003 December 13. Below is a list of users who have contributed greatly to the authoring of this Wikibook. Please add your username if you have made substantial additions and/or revisions to this textbook. Use *{{user|username}} to add a name., 652320=Not so with an elementary language text. All the grammar and vocabulary that you learn is cumulative, so everything can only stack one way. Flipping ahead (or falling behind) more than a few chapters and you're lost. Order matters, so we use the a sequential naming scheme (Lesson 1, Lesson 2,...), not a topic-based one (Asking Questions, Giving Directions,...).}",
