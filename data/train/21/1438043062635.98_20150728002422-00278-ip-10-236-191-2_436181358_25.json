            "Description",
            "LINEAR INDUCTIVE POSITION SENSOR - A linear position sensor having a transmitter coil which generates electromagnetic radiation when excited by a source of electrical energy and wound in a first direction. A receiver coil is contained within the transmitter coil and the receiver coil includes both a first loop wound in a first direction and a second loop wound in the opposite direction. A coupler element linearly moves along a first direction relative to the transmitter coil which varies the inductive coupling between the transmitter coil and the receiver coil as a function of the linear position of the coupler element to thereby vary the electrical output signal from the receiver coil when excited by the transmitter coil. The first and second loops of the receiver coil are linearly aligned with each other along the first direction.",
            "INDUCTIVE POSITION SENSOR - A rotary position sensor having a transmitter coil energized by a high frequency current source. A first receiver coil includes an even number N of loops wherein adjacent loops of the first receiver coil are oppositely wound. A second receiver coil also includes N loops where adjacent loops are oppositely wound. Furthermore, the second receiver coil is angularly offset from the first receiver coil by 180/N degrees. A noncircular coupler constructed of an electrically conductive material is rotatably mounted relative to the coils so that the coupler element overlies at least a portion of the first and second receiver coils. A circuit processes the output signals from the first and second receiver coils and generates an output signal representative of the rotational position of the coupler.",
            "COMPACT FLY-BY-WIRE PEDAL ASSEMBLY - The electronic pedal assembly includes a housing configured to mount onto a fire wall of a vehicle. The housing includes a pair of spaced apart side walls extending outwardly from an elongated center portion, a first housing portion axially aligned with a second housing portion. A pedal arm is rotatably disposed in the first housing portion. The pedal arm includes an end portion. A rotatable member disposed in the second housing portion and is pivotably mounted to a second pivot rod. The rotatable member is mechanically linked to the end portion of the pedal arm so as to rotate about the second pivot rod upon depression of the pedal arm. A position sensor is connected to the rotatable member. The position sensor is operable to detect the degree of rotation of the rotatable member upon depression of the pedal arm.",
            "TORQUE SENSOR - A torque sensor which detects a deflection angle between an input and an output shaft which are aligned with a shaft axis. An annular sine ring, annular cosine ring, and annular flux return ring, each constructed of a ferromagnetic material, are coaxially disposed around the shaft axis. A sine spoke has one end attached to the output shaft and its other end closely adjacent the sine ring and, similarly, a cosine spoke is secured to the output shaft at one end and is positioned closely adjacent the cosine ring at its other end. A pair of flux return spokes are also secured to the output shaft, each diametrically opposed from the sine or cosine spoke, and have their outer ends closely adjacent the return ring. A magnetic flux bridge is formed between the return flux ring and the sine ring as well as the cosine ring while magnetic sensors determine the magnitude of the flux across each bridge. A magnet is attached to the input shaft and positioned midway between the cosine spoke and sine spoke so that deflection between the input shaft and output shaft varies the magnitude of magnetic flux across each bridge.",
            "MICRO INDUCTIVE SENSOR - An inductive sensor includes a sensor package and a coupler package. The sensor package includes a signal processor, an integrated capacitor, a ferrite layer, a transmitter coil, a two part receiving coil, and a plurality of discrete components. The coupler package includes an integrated capacitor, a ferrite layer, and a coupler coil. The transmitter coil in the sensor package is energized by an external power source which in turn energizes the coupler coil in the coupler package. The sensor then measures the rotational position of the coupler package relative to the sensor package by detecting and measuring, with the two part receiving coil, the signal returned by the coupler coil. The signal processor calculates the position of the coupler package relative to the sensor package by comparing the coupling factors between the coupler package and the sensor package.",
            "INTEGRATED BRAKE CONTROL SENSOR - A sensor assembly for a vehicle electronic braking system including a housing, at least one linear sensor, the at least one sensor contained within the housing, the linear sensor adapted to measure the linear distance traveled of a brake pedal. The assembly further includes a rotary sensor, the rotary sensor also contained within the same housing, the rotary sensor adapted to measure rotary motion of a DC motor in an the electronic braking system. The rotary sensor and the at least one linear sensor each in communication with a brake control unit. The at least one linear sensor and the at least one rotary sensor is encapsulated, either together or separately. The at least one linear sensor is a Hall-effect sensor. A wake up switch circuit is integrated with at least one of the linear sensors to wake up the system when the driver depresses the brake pedal in the electronic braking system. The rotary sensor is an inductive sensor."

A first and second receiver coil, each having at least two oppositely wound loops, are rotatably positioned electrically 90 degrees relative to each other. The receiver coils are positioned so as to be inductively coupled with the transmitter coil while a coupler constructed of an electrically conductive material is rotatably positioned over and inductively coupled with the first and second receiver coils. The outputs from the first and second receiver coils are coupled through a high pass filter and a low pass filter, respectively, thus creating a 90\u00b0 phase shift in the resultant signals. These signals are summed together and coupled as an input signal to a PWM circuit together with a signal from the transmitter coil. 20120293166 09-06-2012 STEERING POSITION AND TORQUE SENSOR - A sensor circuit for use with a shaft assembly rotatably mounted in a housing and having an input shaft, an output shaft and a torsion bar which connects the input and output shafts together. A CR coil mounted to the housing around the shaft assembly is energized and generates an electromagnetic field. An RX coil is mounted to and rotates with the shaft assembly and has an output connected to a power circuit to generate electrical energy when excited by the electromagnetic field from the first coil. The power circuit powers an angle",
