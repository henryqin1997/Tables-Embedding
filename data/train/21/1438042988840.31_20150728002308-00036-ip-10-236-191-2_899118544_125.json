            "I never felt unsafe at CU. There are those blue lights all over campus and the police are around too. Just be smart and don't walk by yourself at night, etc.",
            "I wasn't a part of it, but it definitely looked like a lot of fun. There are many different ones, and I've heard each has its own personality. There is also a Christian sorority and fraternity too.",
            "There are so many things to get involved in. EVERYONE could find something they would love doing! There's events, concerts, activities on campus all the time (often free) so there is always something to do.",
            "Those who love the outdoors...are interested in Greek life...excellent engineering program.",
            "The Hill is the hot spot closest to campus - great food and little shops. It does get really crowded on the weekends.",
            "For in-state students, it's a fantastic deal! For out-of-state, unless you can get some scholarships/grants/etc., I feel like it's pretty pricey.",
            "Ski, snowboard, rock climb, hike, bike, run...anything and everything outdoors! Boulder also has a great dinner theatre (the university shows are great too) and Pearl Street is a great place to shop, eat, hang out, or hit the bars. Chataqua Park is amazing for hikes, runs, etc. I also loved biking and running along the Boulder Creek Path.",
            "The dorm cafeterias aren't too bad (though I only ate at them a handful of times.) The food options at the student center are great and a central location. There are also lots of great restaurants on The Hill across the street from campus. The new community/admin building has the best food on campus - many different cuisines, all delicious!",
            "I actually did not attend CU my freshman year so I cannot attest to what life is like in the dorms. From what my friends told me, most had a decent experience, a few absolutely loved it, and then of course there were some occasional horror stories.",
            "The classes obviously vary in the amount of homework and effort required, but rigorous coursework is common at all levels, but especially the 4000-level classes.",
            "People in Colorado in general are more fit and health-conscious, and Boulder is even more so. This is a great place to live/work/study if you love an active and outdoor lifestyle!",
            "CU-Boulder has one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen, and is located in a very fun college town. It may have a rep as a party school, but a great education from fantastic professors is available to those who actually go to class. I had a fun and rewarding experience at CU through classes, extracurriculars, and community organizations/events."

Every Halloween, students can participate in the Nearly Naked Mile and run downtown in their underwear or costumes. St. Patrick\u00e2??s Day is known for parties on The Hill, Boulder\u00e2??s college and Greek neighborhood, with parties in excess of 1000 people and couches burning in the streets. (Don\u00e2??t worry \u00e2?? violence is pretty rare.) 4/20 is one of the most popular yet controversial events, with large gatherings of students on campus to smoke marijuana. However, CU has recently banned smoking on campus and took measures to prevent the tradition last year. Marijuana is now legal to possess in Colorado, although it is still against the Federal Law. It is legal to possess in Boulder, and illegal to smoke in public, although many Boulder police don\u00e2??t seem to mind., 106206=Watch out when applying for the dorms. If you aren't sure you want to, then don't apply too soon. If you do apply and then decide you don't want to live in the dorms, get out quickly and petition for staying somewhere else. Also, watch out for the fees like the health care plan and such. They add up to well over $2000 sometimes., 167326=For students from Colorado, the university is easily the most expensive public choice and it is difficult to see why. The rec center was literally built before my parents graduated from CU and many of the buildings are poorly prepared for academics such as my programming classroom which did not have a projector despite the professor's repeated requests. More, the university creates a facade of monies well spent while essentially throwing student funds down the drain. A new and unneeded dining hall and an athletic center for losing teams were recently given funding over an expansion for the crammed and nationally ranked engineering school and the unchanged-since-the-1970's environmental design building. And the dorms aren't cheap, nearly $1000 a month per person for a 12x12 room with shared bathrooms is hardly a steal even in Boulder and $8 a meal is above eating out. Verdict, unless you have a major you can't do anywhere else, find somewhere else. Coming from out of state? forget it, tuition is more than many private schools., 901246=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 544907=The oldest structure on campus, it was built in 1876, is this gorgeous building called Old Main. Because it is so beautiful, people get married there and it hosts special events. Also every October, CU Boulder hosts the Nearly Naked Mile for homeless shelters. Every runner donates 5 items of clothing and then we run a mile through campus in \u00e2??minimal\u00e2?? clothing. It is so much fun! During football season, Ralphie, our REAL buffalo mascot, leads the football team into Folsom Field at the beginning of games and the \u00e2??Ralphie Runners\u00e2?? run him around the field. This also happens at the end of half-time. Then every Thursday, there is a glow in the dark bike ride through campus. They play music, decorate their bikes in neon strips, and ride everywhere through campus!, 184609=Boulder is a wonderful place to live. The weather is gorgeous, the people are friendly, anything a student needs whether it be a place for school or living supplies, books, food, entertainment, or a great coffee shop to study or just relax at, is within a 1 mile radius of campus. On top of that, there are 5 major ski resorts under 2 hours away and they are very easy to drive to. It's great to be able to get up early on a weekend morning, get to the mountain by 8:30 when the lifts open, ski all day, and be back in time to study at night!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot CU Boulder has a variety of classes with levels you can choose from that suite you. No doubt, some classes are a little more challenging than others, but it's great feeling after you've accomplished a semester. The professors know what they are talking about, and they have a passion for their field of study. If you have any questions, most professors are easy to get a hold of over email or during office hours.
