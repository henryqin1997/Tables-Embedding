The supported graphics file formats depend on the installed conversion filters for your Microsoft Office applications. If you select a non-graphic file (for example, a Word document), the Office application will attempt to convert it to a graphic. If this fails, an error is reported and nothing is inserted. Please note that the inserted images are not linked to their respective content items on the server. This means that the image in the document is not updated automatically if the source image is updated on the content server, or vice versa. The Image panel of the Insert Content Item dialog enables you to select one or more image files on an Oracle WebCenter Content Server instance and insert these images into the current Microsoft Office document. You search for files using the standard search features of the content server (browsing or criteria-based query, if available).
