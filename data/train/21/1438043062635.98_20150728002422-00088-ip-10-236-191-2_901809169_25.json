            "This school is very much worth the money. It's about the same price of most state schools and of course is more expensive if you're an out of state student. They are very good about giving out scholarships though to help take a little bit off of the price, especially for out of state students.",
            "The campus is absolutely gorgeous. You walk around and can't help bu think how lucky you are to be attending such a beautiful school. The people are so nice and friendly too. It is just a great atmosphere to be in and makes the whole college experience even better and more enhanced.",
            "The professors here are really fantastic. They give good lectures that you are able to take good notes on. Every once in awhile, like in general education classes, you'll get a bad professor. Don't let that discourage you though because the majority of them are great!"

Houses are usually all gone by June, 432253=It's a beautiful campus with more clubs and opportunities than anybody could ever hope for. Diversity, and creativity are two words to describe life at OSU. With over 1500 students from all over the world and 450 student organizations, there is something for everyone., 316252=One thing I wish I would've done before I got here is wait to come here. I transferred from a jucco in the spring of January 2012 and its been a bumpy ride since then but I'm handling the reins now; so if you transfer make sure you have a plan on what to do and when to do it. If not, wait till the Fall., 467394=I've enjoyed all of the food here on campus, and there are many options to choose from. The restaurants in the dorms are going to be open later than anywhere else so if you're craving something from the union, get it early! Also, go a random times during the day like 3:00 to avoid dinner and lunch rushes., 210724=one of the traditions is going to the student union. another tradition is before a home game the band and all the students march to the stadium ,having a big pep ralley., 737677=OSU police share jurisdiction with Stillwater police so real officers are on campus at all times. The emergency light system also allows students to feel safer when walking alone. OSU is also implementing a new system fall 2013 that has OSU students work in an escort program. If you don't feel safe walking home at night you can call them and they'll send someone to pick you up at your class and walk you back to your dorm., 152104=Tip #1: Rain boots are always helpful when you ahve a test at 5:30 in the afternoon and it is pouring Tip #2: Eat on campus as much as possible, your meal plan only carries over so much. Tip #3: Set aside time everyday for homework and studying. College is not necessarily harder, but definitely time consuming Tip#4: NEVER skip class unless you are seriously ill. The information from class is always helpful on tests. Tip #5: Don't be afraid to ask mom and dad for money. You can't always have all the money you need, but you can't be asking them every week either., 1131950=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1095864=The amount of food here at OSU is incredible. The student union has many restaurants that handle the student flow pretty well. Around 11:30 until 12:30 the student union is a crazy maze of people, but otherwise very good., 17140=While room and board is a little bit on the pricey side, OSU is the best buy in the big 12, so says the OkState homepage. Where you live on campus determines how much you pay a month. Meal plan is a great deal for freshmen! However, you do have a minimum of $1000 a semester your first year. Meal plan can be spent at any place that sells food including the markets. With the fees that you pay it includes the gym (which is top notch), all of the computer labs and printers (if you have your own printer great.. but you already pay for the ink in the school ones), lab fees depending on your schedule and upkeep of the sidewalks and reconstruction of the buildings., 201623=i am a readmitted student planning on returning in the fall of 2012. i miss the atmosphere and school spirit of osu as it was very uplifting in several ways. oklahoma state is a great school academically as well as the many clubs and activites it has to offer; it is an overall outstanding choice to attend., 352049=OSU received 2011 Big 12's Safest Campus. There are several lights and safety towers all over campus. The police line is always on if someone is walking home at night and would feel more comfortable with them taking them home!!, 637198=First years have a mandatory food card they must purchase, the cheapest being $1000.}",

Also, we have an amazing fitness center and we are the most spirited campuses I've seen. Am learning a lot This school has an amazing teaching staff with teacher's assistants in a lot of the classes to help you understand and learn the material. Also, there are free tutoring services taught by current students who have taken the classes you are enrolled in that are included in tuition.
