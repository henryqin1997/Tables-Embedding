It is selective, with an acceptance rate of 69.4 percent., 203795=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 43073=Dorm life is really fun! WT has many dorms to choose from, some older some newer. The cheaper dorms usually don't have air conditioning but the family and community aspect of those certain dorms trumps the need for air conditioning. The dorms with air conditioning have perks like air conditioning but don't seem to be as friendly. All the dorms on campus are really nice though. Every other Wednesday all the dorms host either 9:59 or Hall Council which is a great way for residents to get to know each other, get involved on campus, and get to know their RA's. At these meetings there is always free food and fun. There is an honors dorm for the honor students and there is a quad dorm. The honors dorm has private rooms. The quad dorm which is called Buff has four rooms with a connecting living rooms, kitchen, and two bathrooms. The rest of the dorms are two person to a room and the whole floor shares a bathroom with multiple stalls and showers. Dorms are a great way to get to know people!}",

Dorm life could be a little less noisy, but it's worth it. Am learning a lot I am ALWAYS learning something new. There isn't a day that hasn't gone by that I haven't obtained newly acquired knowledge. Being an General Studies Art Major, I have found that many of my classes are very interesting and are always sparking my interest. Login to rate or flag the reviews Marisa from Canyon, TX",
