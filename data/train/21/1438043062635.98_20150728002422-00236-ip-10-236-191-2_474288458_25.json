The emulsifying agents can also be added as individual components in ratios of cetyl phosphate to stearic acid ranging from about 1:4 to 4:1. This hydrophilic combination of ingredients is advantageously included in the dental foams of the invention and also contributes to maintaining the pH in the desired acidic range. For example, dental foams containing concentrations of about 2% of this hydrophobic emulsion combination result in foam pH's ranging from about 2.5 to about 3.5 which are desirable for acidulated fluoride foam products. Furthermore, this combination of ingredients can reduce or even eliminate the need to include separate acidulating agents such as phosphoric or citric acids which are often required in prior art dental foams. Alternative emulsifying agents can be selected from the non-limiting list including trideceth-7 carboxylic acid, Incrodet TD-7-C available from Croda, acid forms of ethoxylated fatty alcohols, oleth 3, oleth 5, oleth 10, oleth 20, steareth-10, celeth-20, mixtures thereof and the like. Thus, acidic emulsifying agents are preferred in some aspects of the invention to provide dental compositions with a pH of from about 2.5 to about 3.5., 27340=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser.

The Dymel 22:142(b) blend at a level of 4.4% by wt. with 95.6% by wt. of formulation #6 reacted in dispensing a shiny foamy surface, stable with micro-cell formation. As was experienced with the A-70 foams, it can be seen that the moisture loss was above about 2.3% by wt. This compares very favorably with the A-70 propellant blend that was produced with the same formulation. The A-70 blend had a moisture weight loss of about 2.8% and was in line with the other test data. As can be seen, a 5% by wt. concentration of A-31 in formulation #6 continues to show a high degree of moisture loss (7.2%) after 20 minutes at room temperature. The dispensed foam had a dull color, was light with airy cells. Thus, this experiment demonstrates that higher vapor pressure propellants yield stable, micro-cell foams which are preferable. In this example, the role of another propellant which achieves a good stable micro-cell fluoride foam product was used. For this test, Dymel foam (HCFC 22:HCFC 142(b) (40:60% by wt.) blend was",
