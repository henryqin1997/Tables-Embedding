    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I really enjoy being a student here at WSSU at. At first I was very skeptical being a new freshman. I had alot of questions running around in my head like how will i meet new people, will I fit in, or is this even the right place for me to be. By the end of my first year I had answers to all of my questions, and yes they were good ones! Am learning a lot At Winston Salem State University I have learned a ton of new things, and also I have fun while learning and that's the best part! Some of the new things I have learned are the proper ways to write persuasive essays,how to act as an adult (being responsible), and being a team player to just name a few. Not only do I learn things from the professors but also the students that I am around daily, and that helped me a lot with it being my first year there.
