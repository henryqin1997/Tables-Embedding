    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53229=Byproduct and sealed sources are used for medical, industrial, and academic purposes. Medical uses include medical procedures, medical research, and other diagnostic tests. Industrial uses of nuclear materials include industrial radiography, irradiators, well-logging, gauging devices, other measuring systems, and research and development. Additionally, universities, colleges, high schools, and other academic institutions use byproduct and sealed source nuclear materials in classroom demonstrations, laboratory experiments, and research. NRC (or the responsible Agreement State) has regulatory authority over the possession and use of byproduct, source, or special nuclear material. In the post-September 11, 2001, environment, Congress continues to maintain interest in oversight of nuclear materials. An August 2004 letter to NRC from a member of Congress expressed concern regarding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by terrorists seeking to attack the United States., 43223=The objectives of the audit are to evaluate the (1) adequacy of NRC\u2019s information security programs and practices for NRC major applications and general support systems of record for FY 2005, (2) effectiveness of agency information security control techniques, and (3) implementation of the NRC\u2019s corrective action plan created as a result of the 2004 FISMA program review. (Addresses Management Challenge #2), 65041=In addition, OIG determined that on December 19, 2003, the agency transmitted two letters to OMB which forwarded the NRC Performance and Accountability Report (signed by the NRC Chairman) and a copy of the NRC management representation letter (signed by the NRC Chairman and the NRC Chief Financial Officer). These documents asserted in part that the agency had effective internal controls and that all material transactions were properly recorded. However, OIG found that the DFM managers who concurred on these letters on December 18, 2003, were aware of the $500,000 underbilling error for the reactor plant licensee, that its cause was unknown, and, consequently, that it was possible the error was the result of an internal control deficiency. As a result of the underbilling errors, NRC had to restate its FY 2003 financial statements and the independent auditors changed the NRC audit opinion for FY 2003 from unqualified to qualified. Addresses Management Challenge #6), 99233=The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (1988), specifies reporting requirements for semiannual reports. This index cross-references those requirements to the applicable pages where they are fulfilled in this report., 24916=The President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) recognized two OIG multidisciplinary teams in 2004 by awarding them the prestigious Award of Excellence. The first team to be acknowledged was the NRC/OIG Computer Crime Unit (CCU), which consisted of members William Stumme, Senior Special Agent; Michael Ross, Special Agent; Robert Norman, Special Agent; and Cheryl Windsor, Investigative Analyst. This team was cited for its outstanding ability in establishing and building a highly specialized and valuable investigative capability. The CCU has efficiently and effectively provided critical evidence and data for OIG investigations, proactively initiated numerous investigations, and professionally supported the investigative needs of other investigative agencies. For example, the CCU\u2019s efforts have continued to directly support NRC\u2019s newly enhanced role in ensuring the security of the Nation\u2019s nuclear facilities. The CCU recently uncovered an unapproved process used by a regional office to remove Safeguards Information (SGI) regarding sensitive physical security measures at nuclear power plants from unsecured computers that attach to the Internet. In addition to demonstrating that the office violated NRC instructions regarding the handling of SGI, the CCU was able to demonstrate that the process failed to work as intended and left SGI information and data present on the computer., 47356=Audit of NRC\u2019S FY 2005 Financial Statements, 56207=Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), Federal agencies are required to schedule, conduct, and report on program evaluations in selected areas. OMB developed the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to assess and improve program performance so that the Federal Government can achieve better results and to help inform funding and management decisions. It builds on GPRA by encouraging agencies to integrate operational decisions with strategic and performance planning. To decide which programs will be reviewed using the PART for the coming year, agencies and OMB work together., 69601=This investigation was referred to the Montgomery County Maryland States Attorney\u2019s Office. The subject was prosecuted in Montgomery County District Court. On December 6, 2004, she was found guilty of misdemeanor theft., 30116=On January 24, 2000, Congress enacted the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 to provide financial and performance management information in a more meaningful and useful format for Congress, the President, and the public. The act requires that the Inspector General of each Federal agency summarize what he or she considers to be the most serious management and performance challenges facing the agency and assess the agency\u2019s progress in addressing those challenges. The Inspector General in his submission defined serious management challenges as mission critical areas or programs that have the potential for a perennial weakness or vulnerability that, without substantial management attention, would seriously impact agency operations or strategic goals., 12644=On December 1, 2004, Maryann L. Grodin, the General Counsel to the NRC Inspector General and Alexandra B. Keith, the Counsel for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Inspector General, taught at the Inspectors General Institute Certification Class held in Tallahassee, Florida. This class is part of the Association of Inspectors General Certification Program for Federal, State, and Municipal Inspectors General., 61686=OIG completed an investigation concerning an allegation that an NRC manager sexually harassed a female NRC employee on three separate occasions during a conference at NRC headquarters in June 2004. OIG determined that the manager inappropriately touched a female employee on three occasions while he was attending the conference. OIG also established that the manager made inappropriate sexual advances towards this same NRC employee during a conference at NRC headquarters in 2003., 68519=On August 16, 2004, between 11:30 a.m. and 11:47 a.m., a female posing as an NRC employee gained unauthorized entry to NRC headquarters and wandered through the One White Flint North and Two White Flint North buildings taking cash from unattended cubicles and offices of nine NRC employees. The subject\u2019s entry into the NRC buildings took place during a \u201cCode Orange\u201d (heightened terrorist alert) day., 42373=The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was enacted on December 17, 2002. FISMA permanently reauthorized the framework laid out in the Government Information Security Reform Act, which expired in November 2002. FISMA outlines the information security management requirements for agencies, including the requirement for an annual review and annual independent assessment by agency Inspectors General. In addition, FISMA includes new provisions such as the development of minimum standards for agency systems, aimed at further strengthening the security of Federal Government information and information systems. The annual assessments provide agencies with the information needed to determine the effectiveness of overall security programs and to develop strategies and best practices for improving information security., 72952=Disposition of Allegations \u2014 October 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005, 38009=Audit results. The agency develops and collects data to align resources with strategic goals and the budget is prepared in alignment with the Strategic Plan. Further, as required by OMB, the agency conducted Program Assessment Rating Tool evaluations during the budget formulation cycles for FYs 2005 and 2006. NRC continued to improve the internal coordination of the budget formulation portion of the PBPM process with program and support offices., 26398=The second team to be acknowledged by the PCIE/ECIE was the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Evaluation Team, which consisted of Beth Serepca, Audit Team Leader, and Vicki Foster, Senior Management Analyst. This team was cited for identifying weaknesses in and recommending improvements for NRC\u2019s information security program. By conducting the FY 2003 FISMA evaluation, the audit team found vulnerabilities in NRC\u2019s information security program. Because the agency took action on the numerous report recommendations to strengthen the program, the agency received an A from Congress\u2019 Federal Computer Security Report Card in 2004. The grade was up from a C for the 2003 report card., 2009=In 1978, the United States Congress passed the Inspector General (IG) Act to ensure integrity and efficiency within the Federal Government and its programs. NRC\u2019s OIG was established as a statutory entity on April 15, 1989, in accordance with the 1988 amendment to the IG Act., 31596=Audit results. The auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on the agency\u2019s FY 2004 financial statements and changed their opinion on the agency\u2019s FY 2003 financial statements from unqualified to qualified because there was insufficient evidence to support the completeness of accounts receivable and revenue balances. Specifically, because of a computer error in NRC\u2019s License Fee Billing System, $3 million in underbilled license fees were not included in the FY 2003 NRC financial statements which caused NRC to restate the FY 2003 statements in FY 2004. However, even with this restatement, NRC could not be assured that it had identified all underbilled license fees associated with the computer error., 66462=OIG conducted an investigation into information that the NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) staff used undocketed calculations in its review of a technical specification amendment (TSA) request submitted by Niagara Mohawk in 1998 concerning Nine Mile Point - Unit 1 Nuclear Power Plant. The alleger claimed that the NRC used the undocketed calculations in an associated safety evaluation of the license amendment request., 9276=From October 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005, OIG reviewed more than 240 agency documents, including approximately 55 Commission papers (SECYs) and 185 Federal Register Notices, regulatory actions, and statutes., 70448=Source of Allegations \u2014 October 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005, 18868=The 2004 HAPCOA National Training Conference was well attended and received favorable comments from participants. Special Agent Rivera found that the conference provided him with a great opportunity to exchange information with other Hispanic law enforcement personnel and gain valuable insight into the issues facing law enforcement officers today., 63826=OIG learned that in July 2003, a licensee advised DFM staff that there was a possible error in a reactor inspection bill for FY 2003. By December 10, 2003, the DFM staff determined that the licensee was underbilled by approximately $500,000, but the staff could not determine the cause of the error., 1136=The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 which separated the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s regulatory functions from its military and promotional functions and assigned the regulatory functions to the NRC. NRC thus inherited part of the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s mission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \u2014 to regulate the civilian commercial, industrial, academic, and medical uses of nuclear materials in order to protect the public health and safety and promote the common defense and security. In so doing, Congress made it NRC\u2019s mission to enable the Nation to use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that public health and safety, common defense and security, and the environment are protected., 31190=Audit of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s FY 2004 Financial Statements, 58439=OIG determined that the former employee filed a claim with OWCP in August 1991 claiming he suffered an NRC work-related injury in February 1986. The former employee subsequently reported to OWCP that his affliction prevented him from performing his job. In June 1993, the former employee began receiving medical and compensation payments from DOL based on his claim., 63041=OIG completed an investigation into an allegation that the Division of Financial Management (DFM), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), staff failed to report 75 underbilled reactor inspection invoice errors totaling $2.4 million during FY 2003 to OIG independent auditors. Under the Chief Financial Officers Act and the Government Management and Reform Act, OIG is required to annually audit NRC\u2019s financial statements. An independent public accounting firm conducted audits, with OIG oversight, of the FY 2003 and FY 2004 NRC financial statements. The OIG independent auditors advised that during their May 2004 fieldwork for the FY 2004 audit, they discovered the 75 reactor inspection invoices for FY 2003 which had been corrected and reissued by DFM OCFO., 20390=In the morning, the Japanese delegation gave a presentation on \u201cQuality Management Systems as Regulatory Requirements and Practices of NSC Regulatory Review Focus on Quality.\u201d They explained the background for the introduction of quality management systems into Japan\u2019s regulatory requirements after a 2002 case involving utility control inspection results. The presentation outlined NSC practices and procedures for the regulatory review focus on quality. This included audits performed by the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) on utility quality assurance. NISA has oversight for nuclear power plants as well as refining, fuel fabrication, spent fuel storage, reprocessing, and waste disposal related to nuclear power generation. In particular, the presentation focused on the administrative structure of nuclear regulation in Japan; NSC responsibilities, mission, organization, and major activities; the framework and evolution of regulation review, the methodology for and examples of sampling type reviews and quality audit type reviews; and NSC audit criteria., 32345=The auditors cited a material weakness in NRC\u2019s Fee Billing System for the FY 2004 audit. The auditors otherwise concluded that, except for this material weakness, management\u2019s assertion about the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was fairly stated as of September 30, 2004, in compliance with internal control objectives in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 01-02., 20155=On February 9, 2005, representatives from the Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) met with members of the NRC/OIG. The purpose of this meeting was to exchange information about regulatory review and audit practices., 37578=In 1998, NRC established the Planning, Budgeting, and Performance Management (PBPM) process to link resources with strategic goals and performance. OIG conducted an audit to determine whether the budget formulation portion of the PBPM process is (1) effectively used to develop and collect data to align resources with strategic goals and (2) efficiently and effectively coordinated with program and support offices., 55551=NRC continues to regulate commercial nuclear reactors, fuel cycle facilities, and NRC material licensees after they are permanently shut down and begin decommissioning. Decommissioning is defined as removing a facility or site safely from service and reducing residual radioactivity to a level that permits (1) release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license or (2) release of the property under restricted conditions and termination of the license. In FY 2005, NRC plans to conduct decommissioning licensing and inspection activities at 20 power reactors and at 30-35 complex materials and fuel facilities sites., 24220=The Federal Information Security Management Act Evaluation Team receives its 2004 PCIE/ECIE Award for Excellence plaques. Pictured from left to right are: Hubert T. Bell, Inspector General; Vicki Foster, Senior Management Analyst; Stephen Dingbaum, Assistant Inspector General for Audits; Beth Serepca, Audit Team Leader; and David C. Lee, Deputy Inspector General., 17680=NRC OIG Special Agent Rodolfo (Rudy) Rivera attended the 2004 Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association (HAPCOA) Annual National Training Conference and Exhibition from November 8-11, 2004 in San Antonio, Texas. Established in 1973, HAPCOA is the largest and oldest national association of Hispanic American command officers from law enforcement and criminal justice agencies at the municipal, county, State, and Federal levels. With members in hundreds of agencies across the United States and Puerto Rico, many of whom are active in local chapters, HAPCOA is a national organization with a local presence., 35166=NRC\u2019s scope of responsibility includes regulation of commercial nuclear power plants. To carry out that responsibility, NRC conducts inspections at the Nation\u2019s 103 operating nuclear power reactors. Beginning in April 2000, the NRC Reactor Inspection Program and Reactor Performance Assessment Program were combined into a single program for commercial nuclear power plants. This combined program implements the revised reactor oversight process (ROP) and is a critical part of NRC\u2019s ability to ensure the safe use and control of radioactive materials. An integral part of the ROP is the baseline inspection program that was developed using a risk-informed approach to determine a comprehensive list of areas to inspect within seven established cornerstones of safety. The baseline inspection program evaluates licensee performance in areas not measured, or not fully measured, by licensee-reported performance indicators in order to remain cognizant of plant status and conditions., 16220=On November 11, 2004, Russell Irish, the Senior Level Assistant for Audit Operations, presented a briefing to engineering students at the University of Missouri. The purpose was to provide them with an overview on the role and responsibility of an OIG in supporting the mission of the agency and to facilitate student interest in possible career opportunities in the NRC OIG., 50023=Under 10 CFR Part 50, NRC must receive reasonable assurances from nuclear reactor licensees that funds will be available for the decommissioning process. In the Review of NRC\u2019s Decommissioning Fund Program, issued in February 2000, OIG reported weaknesses in the management controls over NRC\u2019s decommissioning process., 58821=OIG obtained copies of the forms filed annually with OWCP by the former employee from 1995 to 2004 certifying his eligibility to receive workers\u2019 compensation payments. In each instance, the former employee certified that he was not involved in any business enterprises and that he had not generated any income from employment activities or personal involvement in business enterprises. OIG\u2019s review of records maintained by the Division of Corporations for the State of Florida identified the former employee as a 50-percent shareholder in and corporate secretary for a private company during the time he was collecting compensation from OWCP., 14652=On March 1 and 2, 2005, the General Counsel to the NRC Inspector General provided new OIG employees with training on Legal Issues, Organization, and Functions of the NRC OIG. Ten major topic areas addressed IG legal authority, responsibility, and functions under 5 U.S.C. App. 3, the IG Act, and other relevant statutes and regulations, including applicable Management Directives. The presentation included information on:, 64141=OIG determined that on December 16, 2003, DFM managers became aware of the $500,000 underbilling error for FY 2003 for the reactor plant licensee. The error indicated a potential internal control deficiency within the NRC license fee billing system. Additionally, in February 2004 the DFM managers became aware that the License Fee Team had reviewed all reactor license fee invoices issued during FY 2003 and identified an additional 74 invoices to NRC reactor licensees that were underbilled a total of $1.9 million. These DFM managers were also aware that the billing errors indicated an internal control weakness which could impact the reliability of NRC\u2019s FY 2003 financial statements. Although there were a number of opportunities to do so, the DFM managers never reported the initial $500,000 billing error or the additional 74 billing errors to OIG or its independent auditors., 45728=With a FY 2004 budget of $5,390,000 and 6 FTE, NRC\u2019s headquarters telecommunications staff support agency long distance and headquarters local telecommunications services to meet current business needs and the related services to implement and maintain the telecommunications services. Services provided include telephone calling cards, cellular phones and pagers, maintenance for common carriers, and other specialized services., 16610=The presentation began with a brief history of the Inspector General Act of 1978 and OIG\u2019s role in the agency. Other topics included the distinctly different, but complementary roles and responsibilities of auditors and investigators; the operational independence of OIG; access to information; and the office\u2019s role in relation to the agency and other facets of the Government. Various types of public reports generated by the office were circulated for review. Also discussed were specific past and current audits and topical engineering-related investigative event inquiries., 21491=In the afternoon, OIG staff discussed the Inspector General Act of 1978 as the cornerstone for the existence of Inspectors General. They further explained the role of OIG\u2019s audit component in meeting the requirements of the act. Of particular interest to the NSC representatives was an explanation of the operational independence of the OIG, its access to information, and its role in relation to the Government Accountability Office. In describing the OIG infrastructure, OIG staff highlighted the differences between audits and investigations and the different types of reports generated by the office. Staff discussed specific past and current audits and the NSC delegation asked insightful, probing questions related to the methodology employed in completing these assignments., 23279=The Computer Crimes Unit team receives its 2004 PCIE/ECIE Award for Excellence plaques. Pictured from left to right are: Rossana Raspa, Investigative Team Leader; William Stumme, Senior Special Agent; Michael Ross, Special Agent; Robert Norman, Special Agent; Cheryl Windsor, Investigative Analyst; and David C. Lee, Deputy Inspector General., 51085=The objective of this audit is to evaluate NRC\u2019s actions on the FY 2000 OIG audit of NRC\u2019s decommissioning fund program. (Addresses Management Challenges #3 and #6), 33250=The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees can pose a serious health and safety threat to members of the public and to other Federal employees. In recognition of this concern, Executive Order 12564, Drug-Free Workplace, was signed on September 15, 1986, to improve the efficiency of the Federal workforce and help prevent the use of illegal drugs in the workplace. The Order requires that each agency head develop a plan for achieving a drug-free workplace while maintaining the rights of employees, the public, and the Government and to establish a program to test for evidence of illegal drug use by employees in sensitive positions. The objective of this audit was to assess the agency\u2019s implementation of its drug testing program., 51435=In April 2002, NRC established the Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response (NSIR) to consolidate and streamline selected NRC security, safeguards, and incident response responsibilities and resources. The office reports to the Deputy Executive Director for Homeland Protection and Preparedness. The formation of the office is one result of the Commission\u2019s ongoing top-to-bottom review of its safeguards and physical security program in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001., 89486=2The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for the management decision on these questioned and unsupported costs. GSA has advised that the decision will be made sometime in early 2006., 50356=Among the weaknesses identified were lack of consistency in reported data and the need to determine the best method of assessing decommissioning costs at nuclear power plant sites. OIG reported that NRC\u2019s decommissioning formulas were developed in 1986 and could be outdated. The report noted that significant differences exist between two different methods used to calculate estimates for decommissioning costs. In response to OIG\u2019s finding, the Deputy Executive Director for Reactor Programs took no immediate action. Instead, implementation was delayed until a future time when more cost data would be available. Nineteen nuclear power plants have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning.}",
