            "One of the biggest things I have realized is that it is ok to ask for help. Every person I have met here so far has had my best interests at heart, sincerely. While I know I need to do my part to study and take the courses seriously, I feel comfortable knowing that if I truly need help, I will get it.",
            "Moorhead State provides a wonderful opportunity for the online student. I work full time, and must earn my degree online. The teachers, academic advisors, financial aid advisors, and tech support people have been accomodating, helpful, and supportive throughout my entire experience thus far."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Laid back personalities, politically liberal mindset, these majors: art, theatre, film studies, mass communications, political science, biosciences, accounting/finance, business Tips for prospective students Live on campus the first year! It's not required, but freshman who live off campus never feel a connection to campus and make fewer friends. Also, get involved! There are so many clubs and organizations on campus, that something will interest you. Clubs are a great way to meet people, and if you graduate with nothing on your resume besides a degree, you might not get hired. Bang for the buck MSUM is one of the least expensive schools in the country, but it's still a quality education. Even if a student put their entire tuition on student loans, they'd still graduate with significantly less debt than students who go to private schools or more expensive state schools. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere on campus is great. The school is big enough to offer many options for classes and majors, but small enough that you will always recognize people in your classes. The students are very friendly and laid back, and are continually holding doors for each other. Minnesota Nice is definitely",
