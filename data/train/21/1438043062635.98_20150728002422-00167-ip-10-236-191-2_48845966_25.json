    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{112557=The climate day at first order or primary observing sites is defined by the 24-hour period ending at 0600 UTC. The climate at volunteer observing sites ends at around 8:00 am local time and can vary somewhat from location to location., 103246=Most observing locations in Canada do not have complete records for the 30-year period. To estimate this uncertainty we conducted some trial calculations for locations with a complete record for the 1971-2000 period. For mean temperature and total precipitation, means were calculated for each sub-period representing consecutive years of length from 1 through 30 years for each month and annually. Then the standard deviation of the differences between the mean of each sub-period and the full 30-year mean was calculated. For example, for sub-periods having lengths of 10 years, 21 monthly and annual mean values were calculated for the overlapping sub-periods 1971-1980, 1972-1981,....,1991-2000. The standard deviation of the differences between these means and the mean for the 1971-2000 period represents a measure of uncertainty due to an incomplete record. Results are provided in Figures 1 and 2., 105613=In Figure 1, the standard deviation is significantly higher for January for all periods than for the other selected months or the annual period. For the 15 year period (the shortest period for which normals are provided on our web site), the January standard deviation is about 0.7 \u00b0C whereas the other selected months range from 0.2 to 0.3 \u00b0C, and the standard deviation for the annual period is 0.2 \u00b0C. Note that winter months are more variable and uncertainty for January temperature normals is higher than for other months., 139496=Note: The calculation for wind chill has been updated since the calculation of the 1971-2000 Normals. For the updated calculation please refer to the Glossary., 130557=Conversion factors: 1 nautical mile = 1852 metres or 1.852 km therefore 1 knot = 1.852 km/h and 1 km/h = 0.54 knot., 96779=The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends that countries prepare climate normals for the official 30-year normals periods ending in 1930, 1960 and 1990, for which the WMO World Climate Normals are published. In addition, WMO recommends the updating of climate normals at the end of every decade as provided here for 1971 to 2000., 138501=The standard Wind Chill formula for 1971-2000 Canadian Climate Normals is:, 100019=Once the qualifying months were determined, the \"3/5\" rule was also applied to the number of months used to calculate average mean or average total within the thirty-year period. For instance, the \"normal\" value of a monthly element, such as normal maximum temperature for May, can have no more than 3 consecutive or 5 total missing months of May between 1971 to 2000., 97417=There are many ways to calculate \"climate normals\"; the most useful ones adhere to accepted standards. The WMO considers thirty years long enough to eliminate year-to-year variations. Thus the WMO climatological standard period for normals calculations are computed over a 30 year period of consecutive records, starting January 1st and ending December 31st. In addition, the WMO established that normals should be arithmetic means calculated for each month of the year from daily data with a limited number of allowable missing values. For normals values representing averages, such as temperature, a month was not used if more than 3 consecutive days or more than a total of 5 days were missing. This rule is referred to as the \"3 and 5 rule\" established as a guideline for completeness by the WMO. Furthermore, its corresponding year-month mean should not be computed and should be considered missing. For normals values representing totals, such as precipitation, degree-days, or days with, an individual month was required to be 100% complete in order for it to be included in the normals calculation., 163010=*Normal indicates that all available data between 1971 and 2000 which qualified under the appropriate completeness rule for this element was used., 63654=Statistics listed below are provided as a guide to determine the validity of Normals and Extremes calculations. For example, a station with 30 years of record between 1971 and 2000 with no missing years would be a more reliable normal than a station with 15 years of record and 2 missing years. Less than 100% possible observations indicates that out of the total number of observations used, some records were missing., 126956=Freezing occurs whenever temperatures fall to 0 \u00b0C or lower. Freezing data normals are based on the occurrence of freezing temperatures as recorded from minimum thermometers. The \"Freezing-free Period\" is defined as the number of days between the last occurrence of frost in spring and first occurrence of frost in the fall for a given year. For the purpose of these calculations, \"spring\" is defined as days on or before July 15, \"fall\" is defined as days after July 15 and freezing or frost occurs on any day where the daily minimum temperature (Tmin) is observed to be less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C., 108791=Besides the monthly averages and totals, extremes for selected elements by month including the daily maximum and minimum temperature, and the daily rainfall, snowfall, and total precipitation, and the dates of occurrence, were compiled and provided along with the normals elements. Extremes are compiled from the entire period of record of each location and not restricted to just the 1971-2000 normals period. In each case, the first or oldest date of occurrence is recorded below the extreme value. Values which occur more than once are identified with a (+). Bolded values and dates indicate the extreme for the year. Because no completeness requirements apply, no normals codes are assigned to extreme elements., 133531=Note: The Direction/Range for wind direction has been updated since the calculation of the 1971-2000 Normals. For the updated Direction/Range please refer to the Technical Documentation., 124755=Measurements of soil temperature are made in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations at the standard depths of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150 and 300 cm. They are measured daily as close as possible to 08:00 LST and again at the shallowest depth at 16:00 LST., 126073=Lake Evaporation normals for the 1971 to 2000 period were calculated as means of daily means for a given station. This in effect is a measure of the rate of evaporation per day rather than a measure of total evaporation as was calculated in the 1961 to 1990 normals. To make the 1971 to 2000 lake evaporation normal values comparable to previous calculations, multiply the 1971 to 2000 value by the number of days for a given month to obtain an equivalent estimate., 127727=\"Freezing-free\" elements are calculated only for stations where daily minimum temperature observations are 100% complete from the period of July 15 to the last occurrence of Tmin less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C in \"spring\", and from July 15 to the first occurrence of Tmin less than or equal to 0 \u00b0C in \"fall\". At least one complete period must occur within 1971 to 2000., 99401=Note: The \"3 and 5 rule\" is extracted from: \"Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30 Year Standard Normals\", Prepared by a meeting of experts, Washington, D.C., USA, March 1989. WMO-TD/No. 341 (WCDP-No. 10), Page 5., 98641=First, the average or total, as appropriate for the element, for all individual months was calculated for all locations. Normals values were then calculated as the mean for each month from all the individual months in the period that sufficiently fulfilled the requirement for completeness for 1971 to 2000. With the exception of the annual standard deviation (see calculations below), the annual normal value was calculated as the mean or total of monthly normals values only for stations where means or totals for every month of the year were available.}",
