            "It really depends on the weekend. I've had no trouble since I've been here but like I said it really depends.",
            "I would say join the sorority or frats. Im not in one but you get to know a lot of people from doing so, and they are a big thing here at WIU.",
            "They have a ton of clubs and wide vast variety of different things from: Tennis to Zombie. They have a lot of intramurals here as well.",
            "If you love clubs, trust me they have so many clubs here.",
            "The only tradition is painting rocky the dog by the football field. And homecoming.",
            "The school is okay, its just that its stuck in the middle of nowhere. The only plus is that its 4 hours away from Chicago and about 1-2 hours away from Peoria. and 2 hours away from STL.",
            "The best thing to do for fun here at WIU-Macomb, is go to Wal-Mart and go party, as well as the games.",
            "The food here is not good I blame the provider, which is Sodexo. I do not like the food they give to us students. So I prefer not to eat on campus.",
            "For my freshman and sophomore year I lived in the regular dorms, it wasn't very good only because you shared a bathroom with 30 other girls and other people they have over, and it becomes very disgusting really quickly. And they don't clean the bathrooms on the weekend. Also, I didn't like the fact you could hear the cars going off in the morn. But also you would have a lot of people being loud at like 2 am, which was very annoying. Junior year, so far is good Im in the suites so I have to clean my own bathroom but the good thing is, is that Im sharing it with only 2 other people, and I am able to control the air conditioning.",
            "They pile a lot on you during the beginning and the end of the school year, but you especially have to watch out before your holiday breaks. You can have many tests the same day, sometimes hard to keep up with.",
            "Go to class, and be on time not at exactly but atleast 15-10 minutes early, because if you don't they can close and lock the door and you won't be able to come to class.. Study would be a great one, because they pile a lot on you and you have random tests and quizzes all the time. But also get to know your teachers because it helps for references as well as they get to know who you are and they can help you more into depth if they get to know you and know your learning level.",
            "To me Western Illinois would rate for student activities as a 6, because there is really nothing to do here. I would rate the academics possibly an 8, good teaching so far, but then it all depends on your teaching and their style The University as a whole I would rate them about a 7, which is average."

Besides the ratings i believe that if a student is serious about their academics they will do just fine. The professors are great and it is up to the student on what kind of grades they would like to obtain., 494398=Western is roughly $21,000 for a student coming in for Fall 2013. The rates adjust with every new class. The rate is locked in meaning it will never increase so you will always know what to expect depending on how many credit hours you take. For the price of $21,000 you are receiving exactly what you're paying for. Students often complain about the stuff we don't have but we're not exactly paying a lot of money. We have free transportation to and from Walmart and the other stores in our city and the computer lab offers free printing. The bookstore is an arm and a leg but that's at most schools. Western doesn't offer a lot of book vouchers., 526114=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 166193=Who like a crowd but not too big of a crowd. Great Class Sizes 22:1, 153799=At Western Illinois, these are referred to as Residence Halls. They are currently renovating multiple Residence Halls at WIU because most of them were built in the 1970's and were not built to last. The biggest downfall of the Residence Halls is the inconsistent temperature control in the rooms. WIU will not turn on Air Conditioning until June, leaving the spring semester finals to be dreadfully hot. The Resident Advisers, or RA's do a great job of holding educational meetings for the students to attend and see what the town and university have to offer. If there is a problem with roommates or others on the floor, the office of Student Development works well with the students to accommodate their needs. Most incoming Freshmen are excited to experience college in the only way they have seen, by drinking. Office of Public Safety makes regular rounds on the weekends down the halls of the buildings and will not be afraid to look into open rooms. Most of the Residence Halls are Dry meaning alcohol cannot be brought into the building, this means even empty bottles will result in a fine or violation. If there are any damages on your floor, you and everyone else will be fined, I would advice working together with the other floormates to ensure that does not happen.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Great for any student probably, but most likely for those who are used to small-town settings, or want a quieter environment to learn and study in. Tips for prospective students I'd probably get your dorm room or apartment as soon as possible, because housing in Macomb/Western fills up fast, and there are a lot of students living in the dorms. I'd also visit the Scholarship early and often, and apply for any scholarships as soon as possible. Bang for the buck Western is probably one of the most affordable of Illinois' public state schools, and probably in general. They have a tuition lock, so your tuition and even your room and board freezes at the cost of the first year you enroll. Western is the only school in Illinois I think to offer this, and one of the few in the whole country. It is definitely worth taking advantage of. Am enjoying being here Macomb may seem like a boring small town to most people, and well, it pretty much is. But I come from a small town myself, so I guess I'd probably prefer that to a big city any day, and it is only 3 hours away from",
