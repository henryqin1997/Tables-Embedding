            "Novel Macromonomers and Hydrogels - Macromonomers capable of both physical crosslinking and chemical crosslinking. The combination of chemical crosslinking and physical crosslinking provides the ability to generate rapidly gelling hydrogels for many different applications. Moreover, the macromonomers may incorporate functional groups that allow for two different gelation mechanisms\u2014thermal gelation and ionic gelation\u2014further improving mechanical stability of hydrogels formed from the disclosed macromonomers.",
            "Novel Gene Delivery Vectors for Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells - Novel gene delivery vector compositions that interact with human mesenchymal stem cells are provided, as well as methods of synthesizing and using such compositions. Such compositions may comprise a plurality of hyaluronic acid hexamers covalently attached to a branched polyethylenimine. Such methods of synthesis may comprise providing a plurality of hyaluronic acid hexamers and a branched polyethylenimine, and allowing a hexamer of hyaluronic acid to covalently attach to a branched polyethylenimine to form a conjugate. Such methods of use may comprise providing a conjugate comprising a plurality of hyaluronic acid hexamers covalently attached to a branched polyethylenimine, and administering the conjugate to a cell."
