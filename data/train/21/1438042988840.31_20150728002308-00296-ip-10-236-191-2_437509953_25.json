These assumed values do not have any real empirical basis; rather they are (we believe) plausible values and relatively neutral assumptions that provide plausible results. Figures 6 and 6a illustrate the sensitivity of our estimates to these assumptions. In each figure, we show estimated positions for values of and from -.01 to .02. As shown in the two figures, varying the errors over this range has a modest effect in the early part of our sample, when the period between surveys was two years or more. Since the advent of annual surveys in 2003 the estimated positions are essentially insensitive to changes in the error assumptions over this range.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{1164625=As would be expected, the standard deviations are much smaller in this sample, although there is still considerable dispersion. A total of 137 observations, out of 2242, were dropped. Comparing by security type, the descriptive statistics indicate that on average, the gaps are somewhat negative for agency bonds (the estimated positions tend to overstate the measured survey positions), slightly positive for Treasuries and stocks, whereas those for corporate bonds tend on average to be zero. For a given security, the gaps also tend to vary in size and sign from year to year., 1263181=Forecast from June 2005 constructed from adjusted monthly net transactions, valuation adjustments, and moving average of scaled gaps. Includes Channel Islands and the Isle of Man., 1199179=In order to address these concerns we adopt another admittedly ad hoc approach: we use the average of the scaled gaps for the most recent liabilities surveys starting with the first annual survey in 2003. This is also the period for which we have asset-backed repayment estimates for agency and corporate bonds, which may introduce a break in the behavior of the gaps. For our in-sample forecasts of 2006 we use the average of three gaps (2003, 2004, and 2005), and going forward from 2006, four gaps.16, 1262937=Figure 9.\u00a0\u00a0Forecast of U.K. holdings of U.S. long-term securities, June 2006, 1262357=As it happens, the \"na\u00efve\" estimate derived from applying flows and valuation changes to the 2005 survey value generates a slightly better forecast for June 2006, but such a fortunate outcome cannot be counted on. Furthermore, many individual countries have gaps that are consistently negative or positive, and our procedure takes this somewhat into account. For example, Figure 9 shows that while the forecast positions for the United Kingdom still overestimate the measured survey amounts, they do so by considerably less than the na\u00efve estimates., 1165698=Table 3a.\u00a0\u00a0Correlation matrix for gaps by survey years, 1989 - 2005 (full sample, 235 observations), 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 910, November 2007 --- Screen Reader Version*, 4985=We work with three sets of cross-border securities data collected by the Treasury International Capital (TIC) system. First, foreign holdings of U.S. securities are measured in the comprehensive surveys of U.S. liabilities to foreigners. These data are available by country of holder, by security type (Treasury bonds, agency bonds, corporate bonds, and equities), and by type of holder (official or private) for nine different dates: December 1984, December 1989, December 1994, March 2000, June 2002, June 2003, June 2004, June 2005, and June 2006.1 There are about 80 countries in the sample.2 Second, on the claims side, surveys of U.S. holdings of foreign securities were taken in March 1994, December 1997, December 2001, December 2003, December 2004, December 2005, and most recently for December 2006. Claims data are available by country of issuance for U.S. holdings of foreign bonds and foreign equities. We combine these periodic survey data with the third set of data, monthly transactions data on cross-border purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury, agency, corporate bonds, U.S. equities, and foreign stocks and bonds (the TIC S data).3 Although the most recent liabilities and claims surveys provide considerable detail on the types of securities held (e.g. currency of issue, \"straight\" debt versus asset-backed, zero-coupon, or convertible debt, public versus private issuer, common stock versus preferred stock or mutual funds), the monthly transactions data limit our analysis to the broad characterizations listed., 1200973=Figure 8.\u00a0\u00a0Forecast of total foreign holdings of U.S. long-term securities, June 2006, 8142=There are several reasons for the discrepancy between the reported survey holdings and cumulated monthly positions from the net transactions data. One is that the underlying monthly transactions data cannot account for all changes in holdings of securities included in the periodic surveys. For example, the transactions data for agency bonds do not include repayment flows of principal on asset-backed agency securities. We are able to adjust the transactions data starting in 2002 for these and other discrepancies, including principal repayment flows on asset-backed corporate securities, acquisitions of equity through stock swaps, and transactions in nonmarketable treasury bonds; the results using adjusted net flows for agency bonds are shown in Figure 1a. (See Appendix A for details on the adjustments for stock swaps and asset-backed securities.), 598785=Thus far, we have considered the challenges in constructing estimates of holdings of U.S. securities by all foreigners. An additional complication arises in constructing estimated positions for individual country holdings based on the reported monthly transactions by country because of the geographic distortion caused by financial center transaction bias (see Griever, Lee, and Warnock (2001) and Warnock and Cleaver (2002)). By design, the monthly transactions data are recorded according to country of the first cross-border counter-party, and not the country of the ultimate buyer or actual seller or issuer of the security. As a result, the monthly transactions data report purchases and sales that are concentrated in major international financial centers. For example, in 2005, nearly two-thirds of reported purchases and sales of U.S. long-term securities were recorded against the United Kingdom and Caribbean financial centers. Thus, constructing estimated positions based on the country-level monthly transactions data will tend to generate estimates of holdings by residents of such financial center locations that considerably overstate actual holdings as reported in the next survey, and will tend to underestimate holdings by residents of other countries., 1201225=Forecast from June 2005 constructed from adjusted monthly net transactions, valuation adjustments, and moving average of scaled gaps., 1170115=Table 3b.\u00a0\u00a0Correlation matrix for gaps by survey years, 1989 - 2005 (truncated sample, 194 observations), 1324228=Figure 10.\u00a0\u00a0Forecast of euro area holdings of U.S. long-term securities, June 2006, 1195156=The coefficients for agency and corporate bonds enter with a negative signs (although only the coefficient for agency bonds is significant at the 5 percent level; that for corporate bonds just misses significance at the 10 percent level), providing some statistical confirmation for the observation that on average the estimated positions for agency and corporate bonds tend to overstate the measured survey values for these securities. Of the survey year dummies, we find significant (negative) coefficients for 2002, 2003, and 2005. Most country dummies are not significant; we list a few that are: the U.K. and the Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands and Hong Kong (although only at the 10 percent level for the last two). Although point estimates for many of the dummy variables seem sensible, confidence bands around them are large. For the U.K. dummy variable, for example, the 95% confidence interval around the point estimate of .421 is -.683 to .158., 1386871=Figure 11.\u00a0\u00a0Forecast of holdings of U.S. long-term securities by foreign officials, June 2006, 1385494=The same approach to generating between-survey position estimates and forecasts by country can be applied to generate position estimates for holdings of U.S. securities by foreign official institutions. Official investors hold an increasing share of asset-backed securities (especially ABS agency securities), and thus their net transactions should be subject to the same ABS repayment flows.17 On the other hand, measured official holdings in a new survey typically exceed those expected from summing transactions since the previous survey, even after accounting for valuation changes. This result often occurs because chains of intermediaries can obscure both the type and the country of the foreign holder in the reported transactions data.18 Figure 11 shows the survey-consistent measures of foreign official holdings of each of the four types of U.S. securities as well as the forecasted value for June 2006. The effect of official net purchases through foreign private intermediaries is especially apparent for official holdings of Treasury and agency bonds since 2002. Although the forecasted values still understate the measured official holdings in June 2006, they do so by less than the \"na\u00efve\" estimates., 799589=Figure 4 presents our monthly estimated positions for agency bonds held by all foreigners (cf. Figure 1).11 As discussed above, the path of the estimated positions coincides with the survey values for years in which surveys were taken. In recent years, as the time between surveys has been reduced, the difference between positions estimated with unadjusted net flows and those estimated with the correction has also tended to fall. Figure 4a shows the same series from 2003, in more detail., 1200561=Figure 8 shows estimated positions based on the June 2005 survey for total foreign holdings of U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds in June 2006 made using the procedure just described (the black line) and for comparison, the \"na\u00efve\" estimates made using flows and valuation changes only (the red lines). Actual holdings as measured in the June 2006 survey are also shown for comparison., 1197632=We are left with something of a dilemma: for most countries, there is no clear statistical basis for projecting the survey gaps forward, but for practical purposes we need to make the best forecasts we can. Forecasting the gaps at zero may be appealing on methodological grounds, in the absence of a well-estimated model, but it is clearly unsatisfactory for policy purposes. Even without significant statistical results, we have strong prior beliefs that a large positive or negative gap for, say, the 2002 survey in a given country will not immediately revert to zero in 2003., 3440=Cross-border holdings of securities between the United States and the rest of the world are growing in size and importance. As of end-December 2006, U.S. residents held about $5.6 trillion in foreign stocks and bonds, compared with holdings of $2.1 trillion five years earlier, while foreign residents held about $8 trillion in U.S. long-term securities, more than double their holdings in 2001. Periodic surveys of holdings provide our most accurate and detailed information on cross-border securities holdings, but these surveys have several disadvantages. First, the surveys are relatively infrequent: until recently, surveys were as much as five years apart. They are now conducted annually, but a higher frequency time series of positions is desired by market participants and policy analysts. Second, survey results are available only with a considerable lag: it takes about 8-9 months to get preliminary results and 10-12 months to get final results, after the nominal date of the survey. We would like a reliable way to base current estimates of holdings on the latest monthly securities transactions data, which are available with a lag of only 45 days, approximately. Finally, the surveys alone do not provide a basis for decomposing changes from one survey to the next into net transactions, valuation effects, and other adjustments, all of which would be helpful in analyzing the data. By estimating monthly positions using monthly transactions and valuation adjustments, we can estimate the desired decomposition as well., 7478=There is a substantial discrepancy between the reported survey positions and position estimates derived from the monthly transactions data as published by the Treasury. This discrepancy is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the total foreign holdings of U.S. agency bonds. The round dots show the reported survey holdings for seven surveys from 1994 to 2006. The lines starting from each dot show the cumulated monthly transactions starting from the survey value and continuing up until the subsequent survey. As the figure shows, in every case the cumulation of the monthly positions noticeably overstates the position at the time of the next survey.}",

Actual holdings as measured in the June 2006 survey are also shown for comparison. We identify outliers by the same criteria we used to exclude observations from the regression exercise above, but rather than omitting them, we bound both positive and negative gaps at twice the magnitude of the estimated position. While it might be conceptually more appealing to discard these observations entirely, this would in some cases leave us with little data to form an average, and it seems better to try to extract some information from these points. Once the end-of-period gap has been determined (and the assumed end-of-period position has been derived), constructing the monthly positions going forward is straightforward. (By an analogous procedure, one can also extend the estimated positions back, from the earliest survey date to the beginning of the transactions data.) In order to address these concerns we adopt another admittedly ad hoc",
