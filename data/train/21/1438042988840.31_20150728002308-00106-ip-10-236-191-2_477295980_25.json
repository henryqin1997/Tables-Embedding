MAG-11, P. 1039 (1975) by D. A. Thompson et al. (Magnetic recorder for storing magnetic data on this magnetic storage medium: Thompson). In a magnetic head using the AMR effect, a vertical bias is often applied in order to suppress Barkhausen noise. Antiferromagnetic materials such as FeMn, NiMn or nickel oxide are often used as materials to apply this vertical bias., 27297=Early Japanese Patent Publication H. 2-61572 discloses a laminated magnetic structure for producing a high MR change generated by antiparallel alignment of magnetisation in magnetic layers. The examples given in this publication of materials that can be used in the laminated structure include ferromagnetic transition metals and alloys. Also, a construction is disclosed in which an antiferromagnetic layer is added to one of at least two ferromagnetic layers separated by an intermediate layer, and it is disclosed that FeMn is suitable as this antiferromagnetic layer., 24557=This application is a division of copending application Ser.
