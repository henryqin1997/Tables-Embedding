For example, the following message is displayed to report that a cable has been connected, and the status is changed to \"up\" for FXO port 0/2/0: 000118: Jul 14 18:06:05.122 EST: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Foreign Exchange Office 0/2/0, changed state to operational status up due to cable reconnection, 97785=Codec, 428390=This command was modified. The ds0-group argument was added for the Cisco 2600 series and Cisco 3600 series., 434085=The ds0-group command automatically creates a logical voice port that is numbered as follows on Cisco 2600, Cisco 3600 series, and Cisco 7200 series routers: slot / port : ds0-group-number. Although only one voice port is created for each group, applicable calls are routed to any channel in the group., 281126=The following example shows the channel capabilities of the different types of codecs on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:, 430468=This command was modified. This command was implemented for direct inward dial (DID) on the Cisco IAD2420 series., 74204=The show voice call command does not display the codec and VAD fields because this information is in the summary display. If you use the show voice call statuscommand by itself, an immediate list of all the active calls is shown. You can use the call-id argument to request that the DSP associated with the call-id be queried for run-time statistics twice, once immediately, and a second time after sample seconds., 430832=This command was modified. Support for enhanced Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) voice gateway interoperability was added to Cisco CallManager Version 3.1 for the Cisco 2600 series, Cisco 3600 series, and Cisco Gateway 200 (Cisco VG200)., 265953=The following sample output shows the current status of the codec, set for modem relay, on channel 1:, 431325=This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(11)T and Cisco CallManager Version 3.2.

The contrast between platform types is as follows: Platform Regular PRI (T1) NFAS PRI (T1)* -------------------------------------------------------------- non-AS5xxx 3/0:23.TS 3/1:23.TS AS5xxx 3/0:D.TS Ser3/1:(TS-1) * Assumes T1 3/1 is a member of an NFAS group with T1 3/0 as the primary NFAS member, and TS is the time slot counted from a base of 1 (for example 1, 2, 3)., 298947=Codec Type, 97888=Codec., 278884=The following sample output shows the DSP Type, DSP number, channel number, codecs running, DSP firmware version, and current state of the channels running on the SPA-DSP inside the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:, 267900=The following is a sample output of this command on a Cisco 1750 router:, 263228=This command was implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router., 72002=If no call is active on a voice port, the show voice call summary command displays only the VPM (shutdown) state. If a call is active on a voice port, the show voice call summary command displays voice telephony service provider (VTSP) state. For an on-net call or a local call without local bypass (not cross-connected), the codec and voice activity detection (VAD) fields are displayed. For an off-net call or a local call with local bypass, the codec and VAD fields are not displayed., 417476=Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 Series Router with Analog Voice Ports, 261725=The command was modified. The command output was enhanced to display the codec setting for modem relay operation., 87789=The following is sample output from the show voice call statuscommand on the Cisco 2600 series. You can use this command rather than the show call active briefcommand to obtain the caller ID; the caller ID output of the show voice call statuscommand is already in hexadecimal form., 416449=Cisco 1750 Router, 264354=Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers}",
