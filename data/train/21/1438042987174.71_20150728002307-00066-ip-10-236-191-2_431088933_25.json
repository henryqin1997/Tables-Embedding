    "textBeforeTable": "Randy Breen, Mill Valley, CA US 12-11-2014 SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO EDIT A HIERARCHICAL TREE STRUCTURE - Media items in a media library are organized into a hierarchical tree so that a particular media item can be found by referencing similar media items. The hierarchical tree has nodes that are the media items and each node further includes a prominence level that indicates a relative popularity of the media item. Systems and methods described herein allow a user to edit or modify the hierarchical tree by changing a position of a media item in the hierarchical tree or by changing a prominence level of the media item. If the edit or modification affects the integrity of the hierarchical tree, the hierarchical tree is automatically further modified to preserve the integrity while reflecting the edit or modification made by the user. 20140365530 09-18-2014 Methods and Systems to Organize Media Items According to Similarity - Users collect digital media items such as songs, images, and videos into media libraries. Over time, the user can collect a very large number of media items making organization and use of the media library difficult and time-consuming. The systems and methods described herein alleviate this task by collecting metadata about the media items from multiple sources, determining a similarity between the media items, and clustering the media items with like media items. The systems and methods described herein can position the media items relative to one another in a",

Breen, Fremont, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20110234339 Waveguide distortion mitigation devices with reduced group delay ripple - Disclosed are waveguide distortion mitigation devices that produce reduced group delay ripple in communication systems in which they are used. The devices comprise a first and second tapered waveguide sections, a first coupling device coupled to the first tapered waveguide section, and a second coupling device coupled to the second tapered waveguide section and the first waveguide coupling device. A waveguide isolator may optionally be coupled between the first and second waveguide coupling devices. The first and second coupling devices may comprise waveguide circulators or waveguide-hybrid couplers. The tapered waveguide sections may embody a single transition comprising a single waveguide wall, a single transition comprising two waveguide walls, or a plurality of transitions comprising a plurality of waveguide walls. 09-29-2011 Scott M. Breen, Grand Rapids, MI US Patent application number Description Published 20090193865 Guided keeper assembly and method for metal forming dies - A guided keeper assembly and method for metal forming dies includes a base having a mounting face, a connector portion and a central aperture. A guide pin has a cylindrical center portion closely received in the central aperture of the base for reciprocation, an enlarged first end with an alignment member, and an outwardly opening circumferential groove. A retainer ring is removably mounted in and",
