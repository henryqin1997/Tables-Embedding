            "There are securities everywhere on these campuses. In the Main campus, the security come around to each hall every hour and there is a security office right at the dorms. At the downtown campus, some building require HPU id, so you know it's safe here.",
            "There are many honor societies, however there aren't many sororities. I actually didn't hear about any while I was on campus.",
            "They offer clubs for the different majors like a pre-med club and a law club. They really tailor to every type of interest you may have.",
            "Anyone willing to learn with hands-on learning. You really have to be dedicated to school to resist going to the beach everyday. This school is great for anyone who knows exactly what they want to do in life and they know what they want to study.",
            "They have a lot of activities like movie nights downtown and they offer a lot of clubs to join. They also have what's called Da Freakshow which is a talent show for the school. It's really big for HPU and so fun to watch.",
            "Overall great location, great teachers, and great environment! There's always people to meet and things to do. Taking a hike or relaxing on the beach offers as some stress relievers.",
            "Shuttles will take students who live on campus to different parts of the island. Friday they will take you to a local mall and shopping center, Saturday goes to the Waikiki area, and Sunday will take you to a nearby city and beach, Kailua. They run every hour to every two hour. There's plenty to do if you're willing to explore.",
            "Food is okay. They have a salad bar all the time and they also have a grill. The food choices range from 4 or 5 different items. They have an off-campus meal plan and in the food in the downtown campus is AMAZING.",
            "Dorm life is really good! The halls are three levels and you share a bathroom between 4 people. The dining commons aren't the best, but it's tasty a majority of the time. The Views are great everywhere and you're close to the beach, you really can't complain. Shuttles will take you to different places like Waikiki, Ward Center, and Windward mall.",
            "The teachers do not ask too much of you. They know what you can handle and what you can't. They're also always willing to offer help and office hours. You should just stay on task and plan out your homework and classwork accordingly.",
            "I think it's important to talk to other students about classes, especially people who have taken a class before. Also, study groups help a lot. Make friends and get help!",
            "Hawaii Pacific University offers an environment that makes you comfortable learning about different subjects and areas because they allow you to ask questions and take the time to really make sure you understand what you are learning. The teachers here are passionate about what they teach and are always willing to stay after class or come early to help an individual in any way possible. The other students are friendly and always willing to give a hand whether its study time, down time, or carrying some stuff to your room; they are constantly willing to help out a fellow college-mate."

But please, please, please, don't give in to your feelings of wanting to go home. They pass, I promise. I'm 6,000 miles from home. Believe me when I say that I was homesick but I came home for summer and could not wait to return. You will too., 259786=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7592=Although this is just my first semester and third month at Hawaii Pacific University, I must admit that it has been, so far, the greatest three months of learning I have ever received since grade school. I am currently taking five courses: COM 1200, WRI 1100, CSCI 1011, ARTS 1000, and MATH 1105. The instructors I have are profoundly passionate about what they teach. Furthermore, HPU instructors remarkably do their best to help when students are in need of assistance. Students are free to let the instructor know whether or not the pacing of the lecture is too quick, too slow, or just right. When students are stressing before a test, HPU instructors carefully explain to the students what to know and review what will be on the test. In COM 1200, I have learned that mid-terms, finals, and other tests are a \u201ccelebration of knowledge.\u201d With that in mind, I became more excited to learn about new concepts, new lessons, and further my knowledge than simply skim at through the surface of new ideas. One of the most important things that I have learned in all my classes is the importance of understanding. I realized how each of my professors has taken into account that not all students are at the same level of understanding. Therefore, each professor would ensure that they are teaching at the level to which all students are able to understand what is going on in the class. Especially since there are foreign exchange students, I condemn my instructors for clearly explaining the syllabus and what is expected to earn an A for their class. HPU professors really take the time to ensure that students receive the full education and learning they paid for., 147622=Current dorm life is less appealing than one would wish for a school in Hawaii. The dorms are located on the Windward side of the island where it is more isolated and rainy. It is not east to get anywhere from here, so most students opt to live in apartment buildings near the downtown campus. However, HPU has recently acquired Aloha Tower, and iconic center right on the water near the downtown campus. The university plans to build dorms there for students to live. These dorms are expected to open by 2016. Aloha Tower would be a prime location for student life., 51913=hpu is quite expensive but the experience here is priceless. for example during my final exam in my mars 1020 class on the boat, we all stopped the exam to follow a group of manta rays and green sea turtles. what other school can offer that?, 245876=If you don't get into the actual dorms at the Hawaii Loa campus you end up living in basically a motel in Wailkiki. I've heard rumors of a new dorm location in 2015, they are converting an old shopping center called Aloha Tower. Walking distance from the downtown campus! Don't count on it being available until it's officially announced however, things here are often on Hawaiian Time.}",
