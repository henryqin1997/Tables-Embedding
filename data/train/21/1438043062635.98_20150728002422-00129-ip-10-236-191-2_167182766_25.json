    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{19993=About 11 percent of all health care spending for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 1997 was for injury-related conditions., 7260=The average total expense for injury-related conditions was lowest for children under 16 ($467 per person with expense). However, as a proportion of total health care expenditures in 1997, injuries imposed a relatively high burden on people ages 16-24 years; about one-quarter of their total health care costs were attributed to injury-related conditions, a significantly higher share than for most other age groups. Furthermore, injury-related health care for this age group accounted for about 40 percent of all inpatient care expenses (about $4.6 billion),2 higher than for any other age group. Injury prevention strategies targeted toward this group of older teenagers and young adults may well be cost effective., 7709=Approximately $57.9 billion was spent on injury-related care in 1997, constituting 10.8 percent of all health care spending during that year. This amount does not include payments for over-the-counter-drugs, alternative care services, telephone contacts with medical providers, or expenses for durable medical equipment or other miscellaneous items such as eyeglasses or ambulance services., 14902=In 1997 expenses for injury-related care received by the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in office-based settings and clinics, hospital outpatient departments, emergency rooms, and clinics owned and operated by hospitals amounted to approximately $29.7 billion, representing 16.4 percent of the ambulatory care expenses for all conditions (Table 3). The per capita expense for ambulatory care for injury-related conditions was $109. For those with an injury-related expense, the mean cost of ambulatory care for injury-related conditions was $787 and the median expense was $234. Injury-related expenses for ambulatory visits accounted for about one-quarter of all ambulatory expenses for people ages 16-24 (26.4 percent) and 25-44 (24.5 percent), a higher proportion than for the other age groups. Per capita expenses for ambulatory care were highest for people ages 25-44 ($146) and 45- 64 ($152). For persons with injury-related expenses, mean injury-related ambulatory care expenses also were highest for people ages 25-44 ($968) and 45-64 ($991)., 8708=Figures 3 and 4 summarize the percent distribution of expenses by source of payment for injury- and non injury- related conditions in 1997. Workers\u0092 Compensation covered 14.4 percent of injury-related expenses. The proportion paid out of pocket was smaller for injury-related conditions than for non-injury-related conditions (11.5 percent vs. 19.1 percent). In contrast, the proportion of expenses paid by private insurance was similar for both injuries (45.2 percent) and noninjuries (44.0 percent), despite the noteworthy proportion of expenses for injuries paid by Workers\u0092 Compensation., 28522=Research Findings #19: Health Care Expenses for Injuries: Estimates from the 1997 MEPS, 23767=The estimates are representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States during calendar year 1997. A technical appendix at the end of this report provides definitions of the variables used in this report. It also gives a detailed description of the MEPS HC, including data collection methods, sample size, variable construction, and statistical procedures used to derive estimates. The standard errors for the tables and figures discussed in the text of this report are also shown in the appendix. Only differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 0.05 level are discussed in this report., 5793=The impact of injuries on national health care expenditures raises important public policy issues. The extent of expenses for injury-related care is particularly significant when one considers that, unlike many major conditions, injuries often can be prevented or avoided by relatively inexpensive intervention programs (Bernstein and Schur, 1990). In Healthy People 2010 (Department of Health and Human Services (U.S.), 2000), the reduction of unintentional injuries, as well as violence and abuse, was identified as a priority area. Achievement of these national goals requires timely and accurate measures of the incidence of injury and expenses, including data on cause of injury and type of injury sustained, to form the basis for planning, analysis, and evaluation of injury control efforts (Miller and Lestine, 1996)., 21155=This report focuses on overall expenses in 1997 associated with injuries, as well as on expenses for ambulatory care and for inpatient hospital care, and estimates injury-related expenses as a proportion of total expenses for all care provided in these settings., 4138=Cohen JW, Krauss NA. Spending and service use among people with the fifteen most costly medical conditions, 1997. Health Aff 2003 Mar./Apr.; 22(2):129-38., 2680=Thorpe JM, Machlin SR. Health care expenses in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population, 1997. Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; 2000. AHRQ Pub. No. 01-R086., 38967=This report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality uses data from the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component to examine the health care costs of injury-related conditions. An estimated $57.9 billion was spent on injury-related conditions for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Approximately 62 million people were reported to have had an injury-related condition. Seventy percent of the people with an injury-related condition (43 million people) had a medical expense related to that condition. This report gives estimates of injury-related expenses for inpatient hospital services and ambulatory medical care services by age, sex, race, health insurance, and poverty level. Injury-related expenses as a proportion of total medical expenses, and mean and median expenses are also discussed. The proportion of expenses for injury and noninjury medical care paid by various sources, including out-of-pocket, Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and Workers\u0092 Compensation, are also compared. The estimates in this report are based on the most recent data available at the time the report was written. However, selected elements of MEPS data may be revised on the basis of additional analyses, which could result in slightly different estimates from those shown here. Please check the MEPS Web site for the most current file releases., 2869=Miller TR, Lestine DC. Patterns of U.S. medical expenditures and utilization for injury, 1987. Am J Public Health 1996; 86:89-93., 3385=Department of Health and Human Services (U.S.). Healthy People 2010. 2nd ed. With Understanding and Improving Health and Objectives for Improving Health. 2 vols. Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office; Nov. 2000., 24690=This report presents estimates from the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS HC) of spending for direct medical care provided for conditions caused by injuries among the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Because direct medical costs do not include reduced or lost productivity in the working-age population or the nonmonetary cost of the disability and emotional stress caused by injuries, this report does not analyze the total economic burden attributable to injuries. Emphasis is placed on injury-related expenses for ambulatory care and inpatient hospital care., 4910=Workers' Compensation paid for about 14 percent of injury-related expenses in 1997., 17871=An estimated $57.9 billion was spent on injury-related conditions for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 1997 (Table 2). This was 10.8 percent of all health care spending during that year. For people with an injury-related expense, the mean expense for injury-related conditions was $1,330 but the median expense was only $241. As a proportion of total expenses for all health care in 1997, injuries presented a greater burden for people ages 16-24 (25.6 percent) than for those under 16 or 45 and over. The mean expense for injury-related conditions was lowest for children under age 16 ($467)., 11737=The inpatient expense estimates shown in Table 4 include room and board charges, all hospital diagnostic and laboratory expenses associated with the basic facility charge, payments for separately billed physician inpatient services, and emergency room expenses incurred immediately prior to inpatient stays for injury-related conditions. Estimated expenses for inpatient services for injury-related conditions in 1997 were about $21.4 billion, which constituted 10.2 percent of expenditures for all inpatient care. The mean inpatient expense per person for people with an injury-related inpatient expense was $9,510, while the median expense was $5,473., 19457=Approximately 23 percent of the population (about 62 million persons) had a medical condition in 1997 that resulted from an injury (Table 1), and approximately 70 percent of those people (about 43 million) had some medical expense for that condition. About 16 percent of children under age 16 had at least one injury-related condition, compared to about one quarter of people 16 years of age and over. People ages 16-24 were less likely to have an expense associated with an injury-related condition than those under 16 or 45 and over., 22637=The standard definition of injury is the occurrence of sudden external forces resulting in trauma. Furthermore an injury may be unintentional (an accident) or intentional (violence or abuse). A single injury episode may result in several injuries or conditions. For example, a person may fall (the injury episode) and receive a concussion and a broken hip (the conditions related to the injury episode). This report examines 1997 expenses for medical treatment of conditions resulting from an injury episode regardless of whether the episode occurred in 1997 or prior to 1997. Approximately 41 percent of the injuries for which households reported receiving treatment during 1997 actually occurred in a prior year (data not shown)., 17164=An estimated $35.3 billion was spent on health care for injury-related conditions for males, higher than the $22.6 billion spent for women. The proportion of total expenses associated with injuries was about twice as high for males (14.9 percent) as for females (7.5 percent). Per capita expenses were about 62 percent higher for males ($266) than for females ($163), and mean expenses for people with injury-related conditions also were higher for males ($1,536) than for females ($1,101). Per capita injury-related expenses for whites were $246 in 1997, higher than for blacks ($122) or Hispanics ($137)., 3108=Hoyert DL, Arias E, Smith BL, et al. Deaths: final data for 1999.

Percent distribution of expenses for non-injury-related conditions, by source of payment: United States, 1997, 105841=This report provides estimates of expenditures in 1997 for the treatment of conditions that were reported to be attributable to an injury. The estimates include expenditures for conditions associated with injuries that occurred in 1997 as well as in prior years. Expenditures refer to payments for health care services, including out-of- pocket payments and payments by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Workers\u0092 Compensation, and other sources. Ambulatory visits to medical providers in office and hospital settings, hospital inpatient care, home health care, and prescribed medicines are included in total expenditures, while payments for over-the-counter drugs, alternative care services, and telephone contacts with medical providers are not included. In contrast to other reports containing MEPS expenditure estimates, expenses for durable medical equipment and other miscellaneous items (eyeglasses, contact lenses, ambulance services, orthopedic items, hearing devices, prostheses, bathroom aids, medical equipment, disposable supplies, and other miscellaneous items or services) are also excluded because it was not possible to determine from the survey questions which of these expenses were associated with injuries., 203636=Source: Center for Financing, Access, and Cost Trends, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1997., 182451=Table D. \u00a0Standard errors for inpatient medical expensesa for injury-related conditions, United States, 1997, 77140=Source: Center for Financing, Access, and Cost Trends, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1997., 210313=Source: Center for Financing, Access, and Cost Trends, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component, 1997., 100086=Source: Center for Financing, Access, and Cost Trends, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1997., 210924=Suggested Citation: Krauss, N.

Ambulatory medical expensesa for injury-related conditions: United States, 1997, 118611=Each person was classified according to the total 1997 income of his or her family. Within a household, all individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption were considered to be a family. Personal income from all family members was summed to create family income. Possible sources of income included annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, and commissions; business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and Workers\u0092 Compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, individual retirement account (IRA) withdrawals, Social Security, and veterans\u0092 payments; Supplemental Security Income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of other income. Poverty status is the ratio of family income to the 1997 Federal poverty thresholds, which vary by family size and age of the head of the family.

They are weighted to develop population estimates for a total of 271,278,585 persons who were in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population for part or all of 1997. For persons who were in the target population for the full year, all expenditures from January 1 through December 31, 1997, were included in the estimates. People with part-year information include newborns, people who died during the year, and people who resided in an institution, were in the military, or lived outside the country for part of the year. Expenditures for deceased persons were measured for the period from January 1 through the date of death, while those for newborns were measured from the date of birth through December 31. Expenses incurred during periods of full-time active-duty military service, institutionalization, or residency outside the country were not included., 3311=Figure 3. Percent distribution of expenses for injury-related conditions, by source of payment: United States, 1997, 102674=Data in this report are based on the combined samples for the second year of the 1996 panel of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS HC) and the first year of the 1997 MEPS HC. MEPS is cosponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The focus of the MEPS HC is to collect detailed data on demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical care services, charges and payments for those services, access to care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. In other components of MEPS, data are collected on the use, charges, and payments reported by providers (Medical Provider Component) and the supply side of the insurance market (Insurance Component)., 9335=Table 1.
