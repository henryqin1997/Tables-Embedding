    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40844=On March 26, 2015, NOAA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register proposing to expand the boundaries and scope of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) (80 FR 16224). This document adds two additional hearings to the public hearings listed in the proposed rule. The end of the scoping period remains June 19, 2015., 25646=\u00a7 1436 - Prohibited activities, 7559=NOAA published a final rule to prohibit the introduction of introduced species into the state waters of Gulf of the Farallones and Monterey Bay national marine sanctuaries, and to revise the corresponding sanctuary terms of designation on February 19, 2015 (80 FR 8778). Pursuant to Section 304(b) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1434(b)) the final regulations take effect after 45 days of continuous session of Congress beginning on February 19, 2015. Through this notification, NOAA is announcing the regulations became effective on May 15, 2015., 25982=\u00a7 1440 - Research, monitoring, and education, 26428=\u00a7 1444 - Authorization of appropriations, 25287=\u00a7 1433 - Sanctuary designation standards, 27729=Title 15 published on 2015-01-01, 22011=On March 18, 2013, NOAA proposed to prohibit the introduction of introduced species into the state waters of Gulf of the Farallones and Monterey Bay national marine sanctuaries (GFNMS and MBNMS, respectively). The proposed prohibition included exceptions for the catch and release of striped bass and for introduced species of shellfish as part of commercial aquaculture activities in the Tomales Bay region of GFNMS (the only geographic area within sanctuaries offshore of California where aquaculture occurs). On March 27, 2014, NOAA amended the proposal to allow GFNMS and MBNMS to consider authorizing the introduction of certain introduced species of shellfish, those considered to be non-invasive, from commercial aquaculture culture projects in all state waters of the sanctuaries. NOAA's final action allows MBNMS to authorize state of California permits or leases for commercial aquaculture projects in state waters involving introduced species of shellfish that a) the state management agencies and NOAA have determined to be non-invasive, and b) will not have significant adverse impacts to sanctuary resources or qualities. For GFNMS, NOAA will not adopt authorization authority for similar projects in state waters at this time and will revert to the proposal from March 2013, which prohibits introduction of introduced species, exempts state permitted commercial shellfish aquaculture activities within Tomales Bay only, and provides an exception for the catch and release of striped bass., 26178=\u00a7 1442 - Cooperative agreements, donations, and acquisitions, 65386=In accordance with section 304(e) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as amended, (NMSA), the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is initiating a review of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS or Sanctuary) boundaries, based on the recommendation contained within the Sanctuary Expansion Action Plan of the FGBNMS Management Plan (April 2012). The review process, as required by the NMSA, will be conducted concurrently with a public process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This document also informs the public that NOAA will coordinate its responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) with its ongoing NEPA process, including the use of NEPA documents and public and stakeholder meetings to also meet the requirements of section 106. The public scoping process is intended to solicit information and comments on the range and significance of issues related to the expansion of the FGBNMS boundaries. The results of this scoping process will assist NOAA in formulating alternatives for the draft environmental impact statement for the proposed revised sanctuary boundaries., 25738=\u00a7 1437 - Enforcement, 25077=\u00a7 1431 - Findings, purposes, and policies; establishment of system, 25205=\u00a7 1432 - Definitions, 26960=16 U.S. Code \u00a7 1181 to 1187 - Omitted, 26530=\u00a7 1445 - U.S.S.

NOAA is also changing the name of Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary., 16811=The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is reinstating missing paragraphs of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) regulations that pertain to the issuance of permits. NOAA inadvertently excluded the paragraphs in the publication of a November 2011 final rule revising OCNMS permitting regulations. The reinstatement of these paragraphs will ensure continued coordination with the treaty Indian tribes whose cultural and treaty resources may be affected by activities of regulated entities. In addition, these provisions provide notice to the regulated community of NOAA's responsibilities to treaty Indian tribes whose cultural and treaty resources may be affected by a permittee's proposed activities., 11979=NOAA published a final rule to expand the boundary of Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary (TBNMS or sanctuary), clarify the correlation between TBNMS regulations and Indian tribal fishing activities, and revise the corresponding sanctuary terms of designation on September 5, 2014 (79 FR 52960). The new boundary for TBNMS increases the size of the sanctuary from 448 square miles to 4,300 square miles and extends protection to 47 additional known historic shipwrecks of national significance. Pursuant to Section 304(b) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1434(b)) the final regulations take effect after 45 days of continuous session of Congress beginning on September 5, 2014. Through this notification, NOAA is announcing the regulations became effective on February 3, 2015., 25505=\u00a7 1435 - Application of regulations; international negotiations and cooperation, 26088=\u00a7 1441 - Special use permits, 26300=\u00a7 1443 - Destruction or loss of, or injury to, sanctuary resources, 25820=\u00a7 1438 - Repealed., 25389=\u00a7 1434 - Procedures for designation and implementation}",
