On the twenty-second of June, the northern hemisphere would thus, at first sight, seem to have attained its maximum heat, and the temperature of the earth might be supposed to decrease regularly toward the poles. It is found, nevertheless, that the highest heat is reached, at all latitudes, about the end of July or beginning of August, and at that time the temperature, instead of diminishing from the equator toward the pole, actually varies in the opposite direction--the pole being considerably hotter than the equator itself. This singular effect is owing to the sphericity of the earth, and is due to the accumulation of heat. If the earth suddenly ceased to turn upon its axis, a universal conflagration would soon rage upon its illuminated surface, and the ocean would be turned into solid ice upon the other, or dark one. By revolution, the earth's surface successively receives heat, and allows it, at night, to pass off into space. In summer, heat is gradually accumulated, and in winter gradually dissipated. The heat of the earth's surface is consequently determined by the duration of the sun's action, and is measured by the number of hours of sunshine in a day or season, diminished by an opposing number of hours of darkness. The hottest period of the, 1519249=days, and from the records of twenty-five successive years, 1832-1857--in days., 11900=MAY 15, 1861., 16792=Charleston, September 20, 1861., 8704=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resolved, That the Memorial be referred to a committee of three, who shall recommend to Council proper persons to take a complete Census of the City, together with such statistical information as may be necessary to exhibit the condition and prospects of the City, to superintend the management and publication of the same, and to apportion to the several Wards their representation in Council, in conformity to the Act of the General Assembly, passed June 1st, 1838., 1522543=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August is the least cloudy month of the year; and since it is also the least fair, more rainy days occur in this month than in any other; in August, rain almost always falls upon a cloudy day. Fairness inducing a notable augmentation in the proper temperature of a month, the remarkable fairness of October, with us, explains that gentle diminution of the heat which is frequently perceptible, 1520143=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0October is our fairest month; August the least fair of the summer months. We also present a table in which the moiety of the cloudy days is not added to the sum of the fair days, that their influence may be separately observed., 1523047=only in the increasing coolness of the nights. The mean fairness, it will be perceived from the foregoing tables, regularly increases, if the mean be deduced from a series of years, from July until November. The regular fall of temperature, dependent upon increased length of the nights, is thereby counterbalanced, to a certain extent, and the real temperature remains for a long time stationary, or sinks slowly. This law belongs, however, to the mean of many years, each season exhibiting a progression which varies more or less according to the power of collateral agencies. In certain years the fairness regularly increases, the season is retarded, the mean temperature sinks gradually, and frost falls late. At other times the progression is stationary, or even reverse, the season is interrupted, or may become more and more unfair, the mean temperature will fall quickly or even suddenly, and frost may be looked for early. Thus, in 1854, the number of fair days successively increased in August, September and October, and the temperature, therefore, continued above its mean., 1500143=accomplished is sooner done; the season of growth and reproduction is shorter, and, by compensation, more intense. At Bogota, 4\u00b0 35' N. L., the difference of temperature between the hottest and coldest month is only 3\u00b0 Fahr.; in the City of Mexico (19\u00b0 25' N. L.) this difference is 14\u00b0; in Paris (48\u00b0 50') it is 48\u00b0; and, in St. Petersburg, 57\u00b0. As we progress northward or southward, the difference between the extreme length of the days and the extreme temperatures of summer and winter regularly increase--little such variation occurring at the equator. In the United States, about the middle of July, the temperature of the Cities of New York and Boston, and, in Canada, of Quebec and Montreal, is greater than that of Charleston or of the equator., 1491712=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On account of the ellipticity of its orbit, the earth is three millions of miles nearer the sun on the first of January, or thereabout, than on the first of July. The increased amount of heat received, due to this approach, according to Sir John Herschell, is no less than one-fifteenth of the whole mean temperature; this fraction being added to the heat of winter, in the northern hemisphere, but substracted from that of summer; and conversely for the southern, 3562=Text scanned (OCR) by Apex Data Services, Inc.

Ford, Esq., for the purpose, who immediately commenced the work, under the plan agreed upon, and having now finished his labors, has delivered the same in manuscript, ready for publication., 21280=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the report made to the City Council of the Census taken in 1848, the population of the city, as it appears by the United States Census, is brought down to the year 1840. The population as returned for the years 1850 and 1860 (the subsequent decades) appears by the following Tables obtained from the office of the Marshal of the Confederate States for the District of South Carolina, the Census of 1850 having been taken previous to the annexation of the neck to the city, and the Census of 1860 after the annexation., 1514427=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will be observed that the temperature begins to rise in February, reaches its highest point in July, descends slowly in the two following months, but rapidly in the latter part of October; the coldest and hottest months being those which follow the solstices. The march of the temperature is well exhibited by an iconographic table and curve based upon the preceding data. The mean temperature of the City of Charleston for the whole year, from the above table, is 65.93; that of Charleston harbor (lat. 32\u00b0 42'), (Tuomey's Geo. Rep.), 64.31; of Madeira in about the same latitude (32\u00b0 37'), 64.56; of Rome (lat. 41\u00b0 54'), 60.70; of Paris (lat. 48\u00b0 50'), 51.50; and of Augusta, in the State of Georgia (lat. 33\u00b0 28'), 65.24., 1500945=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the summer solstice, although the days are shortening in consequence of the sun's recession, their diminution is for some time scarcely perceptible, and as the days are still much longer than the nights, more heat is imparted to the earth than is lost by night-radiation. The temperature thus continues to rise; the augmentation ceasing as soon as the quantity of heat gained is entirely given off during a longer night, when the acme of temperature is reached, and the earth soon begins to cool. Conversely, the earth does not attain its lowest temperature until a corresponding period after the winter solstice, when the sun has for some time been again advancing toward the pole. The greatest heat is reached in Charleston about the end of July, the thermometer then showing 81\u00b0 as the mean for a series of years; at the same time the temperature of Jacksonville, Florida, is 88\u00b0 5'; of Philadelphia, 90\u00b0 4'; of the upper part of Newfoundland, 89\u00b0 5'; of the southernmost point of Greenland, 88\u00b0 4'; at Baffins Bay, 90\u00b0 8'; and at the pole, by calculation, 96\u00b0; while at the equator, it is as low as 72\u00b0., 4154=Source Description: (title page) Census of the City of Charleston, South Carolina, For the Year 1861.

But we find, on reflection, that whilst this plan has its advantages, it is not certain that it may not cause delay, and in the result disappoint our expectations, as we would have necessarily to engage the services of some competent person in the end, to compile and arrange the publication of the several returns made under this plan. We have, therefore, deemed it best that this system should not be adopted, but that the work be placed under the supervision of a competent person, to prepare and compile an accurate Census of the City, with such statistical information as, we trust, will meet the wants of the community, and to apportion to the several Wards their proper representation in Council, in conformity to the Act of the General Assembly, passed June 1st, 1838. And in order to ensure this result, your committee recommend that authority be given them to engage the services of Mr. FREDERICK A. FORD, at the sum stated in his communication to the Committee, feeling assured he is fully competent to accomplish the work satisfactorily, which your committee are sanguine will result in exhibiting an increase in population, enterprise and growth, in all the essentials that make up a flourishing community., 1521409=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As by the preceding table, October is the fairest month, and August the least fair of the Summer months. We also present:, 18381=the Census taken in 1848, that Ward has become entitled to one additional Alderman, and Ward No. 2 loses one--the other Lower Wards retain their present representation; and Wards No. 5 and 6, by increase of population and taxation, have each become entitled to one additional Alderman. The number, therefore, of Aldermen for the ensuing ten years will be eighteen instead of sixteen, the present number., 1520431=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A TABLE showing the mean number of fair days in each month, computed from twenty-five successive years, 1832-1857--in days., 1524849=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While in 1853 the fair days did not increase toward the end of the season, and the temperature was lower than the serial mean.}",
