I believe that might be love bouquest. but i dunno if you get a star as well. i know some quest gives random 1 of 2 or 3 prizes chooses bt the system. (for example off topic) the mushroom quest in holy the grannie gives you 1, 2 or 3 amity chocolates. i noticed the lower the character the more they get if under lvl 10 but it still random.
