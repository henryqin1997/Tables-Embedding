STBotI 23:47, 6 October 2007 (UTC), 16467=Noticed your improvements to the Callaway article. Good so far. Remember when uploading images that unless you provide a Fair-use rational for images you get from other web sites, they will probably be deleted by an administrator. I also fixed the image page for the picture of the school building because you didn't choose a license for it.

As always, feel free to contact me if there's anything more I can do from you; I'm happy to hear from you, especially if I can help you in some way.

Good night. --Sopoforic 08:07, 9 October 2007 (UTC), 31945=I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian!

You may link to the images (by placing a colon before the name, like Image:Wikipedia.png), but not display them. I've converted them to links in this way; you may remove them entirely if you desire. --Sopoforic 02:35, 9 October 2007 (UTC), 1893=Well, the {{WWE-photo}} template is inappropriate--it isn't an official publicity photo, it's a screenshot; I've removed that. I also modified the FUR slightly; you'll want to replace the 'source' with whatever the title of the video you took the screencap is--probably Royal Rumble 2007 or something, but I don't know. Otherwise this doesn't seem too bad. I'm not familiar with this event in particular or PPV events in general, but I am going to assume that the people attending (shown in Image:Undertaker winning the Rumble.jpg) were not allowed to bring cameras with them. If people were allowed to take photos of the event it's a little less clear, since we might hope to get free photos. Still, at present it seems to me that you just need to be a little more clear about the source of the image.}",
