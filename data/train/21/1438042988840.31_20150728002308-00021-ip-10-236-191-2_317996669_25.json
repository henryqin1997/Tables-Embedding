            "The Twins announcers of course bring up Mark Prior. I checked the minor league stats, and he only had the one game since joining the Rangers. I guess that's not too surprising. (Colin Wyers)"

How he does in those will go a long way in determining if he can ever get back to that previous level. The upside is that he's still young and still has talent somewhere in that arm. How he gels with the Padres staff is also going to be a big key in his comeback. (Will Carroll) Care to hazard a guess or prediction on Mark Prior's contributions to the Padres in 2008?
