            "ANTENNA OF MOBILE PHONE - An antenna is embedded in a mobile phone and comprises a receiving sheet structure, a high frequency radiation part, a low frequency radiation part, and an extending part. The receiving sheet structure comprises a main body and a branch portion, and one end of said branch portion is connected to the main body and another end is connected to a curved part. Therefore one end of the high frequency radiation part is connected to a terminal of the curved part with a curved angle formed thereof, and another end of the high frequency radiation part is an open end and parallel to the branch portion. One end of the low frequency radiation part is connected to the main body, and another end of the low frequency radiation part is an open end. The extending part is connected to a terminal of the receiving sheet structure, and perpendicularly extended to the terminal of the receiving sheet structure.",
            "VOICE CONTROL ON MOBILE INFORMATION DEVICE - A method for controlling a mobile information device based on verbal input from a user is presented. The method comprises waiting for a predetermined verbal input from a user. The method further comprises controlling a functional module of the mobile information device to determine a value within a predetermined range for a functional parameter in response to a first portion of the verbal input. Finally, the method comprises executing a functional operation by the functional module based on a determined value, in response to a second portion of the verbal input, wherein the second portion follows the first portion."
