    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{145628=A workflow engine of Exchange server 2008 has an accompanying graphical workflow designer that allows execution of logic and invocation of components in and outside of Exchange, via COM, that provide message routing, approval, and state transitions. Thus, transportable applications of application server 202 may participate and drive these workflows., 577708=Computer system, 1900 may be coupled via bus 1902 to a display 1912, such as a cathode ray tube (\u201cCRT\u201d), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device 1914, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 1902 for communicating information and command selections to processor 1904. Another type of user input device is cursor control 1916, such as a mouse, a trackball, touch screen, keypad of a cellular telephone or PDA, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 1904 and for controlling cursor movement on display 1912. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane., 328854=Invitation. Displays the details of an event, including title, description, time, and location. May be combined with a Poll building block to allow participants to respond and add comments., 517716=Operation of functions of toolbar 2207 are described further herein in connection with a description of a server structure that may be used to implement the processes described herein., 428995=Message broker 1734 determines whether the event is persistent, as shown by block 1736. If so, then control passes to block 1738 in which the event is stored in the database or otherwise made persistent. Thereafter, and if the event is determined as not persistent at block 1736, control is passed to block 1740, in which one or more coarse-grain filters are located. The filters are selected based on the message type, and applied to the event message., 556931=In block 2720, the system tests whether all data in the field definition has been resolved to static form. If not, then control is transferred to block 2712 to resolve any remaining references. If so, then in block 2722, any business rules in the field definition are applied to compute the final field value., 335769=The user may add one or more survey building blocks by selecting the Insert Building Block link 1018 at a point in the page where the user wishes to have a building block appear. In response, a list of available building blocks is displayed. In one embodiment, the list comprises:, 325685=The user may then add one or more building blocks to the page, or simply save the page in its current form. To save the page, the user selects the Save As button from among function buttons 1019, navigates to a folder in which the user wishes to save the page, enters a name for the page, and selects a Save button. The user may save the page in this manner at any time, and can discard the changes made to the page at any time by selecting the New button from among function buttons 1019., 526055=Selection of the \u201cmore pages\u201d navigation region 2250 causes the server or other element to re-generate message body pane 2104 such that one or more of the other message navigation regions are displayed, and such that previously visible message navigation regions scroll or slide to the side, up or down to make room for the newly displayed message navigation regions. Such re-generation may result in removing the \u201cmore pages\u201d navigation region 2250 from the display., 140098=In this configuration, Outlook client 2004 communicates over a mail application programming interface (MAPI) or remote procedure call (RPC) link 2006 with a MAPI processor 2012 of the Microsoft Exchange server 2008. The Microsoft Exchange server 2008 further comprises an SMTP agent 2010, OWA agent 2014, event handling system 2016, and Exchange OLE Database agent 2018. The SMTP agent 2010 can communicate with SMTP-compatible mail servers to enable the system to transport e-mail messages across a network. Event handling system 2016 receives events generated by application server 202 or its applications and processes them by, for example, storing information in mailbox store 2022 and public stores 2024 of Web storage system 2020. Database operations by or on behalf of application server 202 are facilitated by Exchange OLE Database agent 2018, which is communicatively coupled to Web storage system 2020., 552617=In block 2606, the system determines if the list generated in block 2605 contains a reference to another list. If so, in block 2608 the current recipient list is expanded to include all recipients who are named in the referenced list, and duplicates are removed. In block 2610, the system determines if the recipient list generated in block 2605 contains a reference to an individual. If so, then the individual is added to the current recipient list, and duplicates are removed. In block 2614, the system determines if the recipient list generated in block 2605 includes instructions to exclude a user or list. If so, then in block 2616, the referenced list is expanded, and its members are removed from the list generated in block 2605. If the list generated in block 2605 has more instructions, then they are processed in similar manner. As a result, a new recipient list is generated, as indicated in block 2620., 322487=Default Page Settings screen 1000 also comprises a Require This Page checkbox 1008. If it is checked, then the associated page is required in any transportable application that is built based on the associated template, and cannot be deleted., 345085=All images may be sent in a transportable application at the same time. Alternatively, if the checkbox 1159 is selected by the author, then participants who receive a transportable application that contains building block 1150 may add their own images at any time. Conversely, if checkbox 1159 is not checked, then participants may not add additional images to the gallery., 510072=Each message page comprises a page navigation region and a page body. For example, a first message page 2106 comprises a page navigation region 2108 and a page body 2110., 556067=In block 2710, a field definition and value within a message are interpreted to identify a link or other reference to other messages. In block 2712, the system determines whether the field definition comprises a link to data in another field. If so, then in block 2714, the system verifies that the linked field is updated, and fetches data from the linked field. Block 2714 may involve dynamically retrieving field data from database 208. In block 2716, the system tests whether the field definition contains an instruction to embed data from another field. If so, then the embedded field is identified and tested to determine if it is updated, as in block 2718. Data from the embedded field is fetched, and the field definition property is cleared since the data is then embedded., 428614=In block 1722, the event handling system determines how to route the event message. For example, in block 1724, the event handling system determines whether the event is synchronous or asynchronous. If the event is synchronous, then it is sent to a message broker 1734 that is defined by the event broker framework 1704., 583753=Computer system 1900 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 1920 and communication interface 1918. In the Internet example, a server 1930 might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet 1928, ISP 1926, local network 1922 and communication interface 1918. In accordance with the invention, one such downloaded application provides for collaborative communications, multiple-part messages, and linking and aggregating messages as described herein., 354998=One or more Vote Options check boxes 1336 may be provided. In one embodiment, the author may instruct the system to allow recipients and participants in the poll to change a vote by selecting a first check box. The author may instruct the system to allow participants to vote anonymously by selecting a second check box. The author may specify when the poll results are available for viewing by the participants by selecting one of a plurality of radio buttons 1338. In one embodiment, the author may specify that the poll results are available to participants always, after a participant has voted, after the poll closes, or never. In one embodiment, the author may require all ratings to be submitted on an anonymous basis (\u201cforced anonymity\u201d), by selecting an option or check box when the Poll building block is added to an application., 343770=The user may also add a name value in Image Name field 1146, and a description value in Image Description field 1148., 582811=Network link 1920 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link 1920 may provide a connection through local network 1922 to a host computer 1924 or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d) 1926. ISP 1926 in turn provides data communication services through the worldwide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d 1928. Local network 1922 and Internet 1928 both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 1920 and through communication interface 1918, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 1900, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information., 561973=If a new message web member is requested, then in block 2822, a new message is sent to the recipient list, and appropriate links are created to insert the new message into the message web. If a new part of the same message is selected, then in block 2820, the new content is added to the current message. Recipients of the current message notified appropriately, and the new content is highlighted when such recipients read the message. In either alternative, as shown by block 2824, the new message may be associated with a new tab in the current message., 71817=The period 1973 to 1989 saw development of several computer systems that featured graphical user interfaces rather than character displays, such as the Xerox Alto, the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and personal computers using Microsoft Windows. During this period, users developed interest in the ability to send messages having elements other than text. Examples of such multimedia e-mail systems include Slate, from BBN Software Products, and the first release of Lotus Notes, from Lotus Development Corporation., 330234=Schedule. Participants specify their availability for one or more proposed dates or times. The Schedule building block can export data to programs that support a calendar data interchange format. May be used, for example, to determine the best time for a meeting or event., 327928=Information Fields. Enables creating named fields to build forms to display names, dates, locations, etc. May be combined with other building blocks to capture information about the state of a project, names of participants, address information, or outstanding issues., 538151=In block 2336, a change occurs to one or more objects to which automatic links can be made. For example, a building block or page of a transportable application is deleted, modified, renamed, or created. In block 2338, block 2342, and block 2346, branch points are carried out in accordance with the kind of change that occurred. In block 2338, if the object is deleted, then in block 2340, links are removed from messages and from the list of links in the message. For example, the list building block of the message is updated to delete links. In block 2342, if the object is edited or renamed, then the list of automatically generated links is reviewed. For each link that is identified in the list, the link is followed to the linked message. Any link in the list of linked messages that contains the old name is updated with the new name, as shown by block 2344. If a new object is created, as in block 2346, then in block 2348, its content is marked as changed. A background task or process is scheduled and dispatched to look for references to the new object., 341987=In one embodiment, when a user is interacting with a transportable application having a page that contains File sharing building block 1130, and the user elects to upload a new file for sharing or discussion, the system prompts the user to decide whether versioning should be enabled for the document. A versioning value is stored as a file attribute data value in the database in association with the file. In another embodiment, the Enable File Versioning check box 1134 is displayed in association with every file link for each file that has been uploaded. Thus, a user who is the author of the transportable application or otherwise acting in an owner role may elect to apply versioning at any time., 513454=If a message has a plurality of message pages, and message display window 2100 has insufficient space to display all the message navigation regions associated with the message pages in a row, then the message body pane 2104 may comprise an indicator that additional message pages and navigation regions are available for display and selection. For example, message body pane 2104 can display an arrow, dot, or other icon adjacent to the right-most message navigation region. Selection of the arrow, dot, or other icon causes a server or other element to generate message body pane 2104 such that one or more of the other message navigation regions are displayed, and such that previously visible message navigation regions scroll or slide to the side, up or down to make room for the newly displayed message navigation regions., 566710=In block 2902, a message in a message web is marked for deletion. In block 2904, the system determines what kind of deletion to carry out. In an embodiment, deletion may involve complete elimination of the deleted message, or retaining a message shell as a placeholder. If a placeholder is retained, then in block 2908, the content of the message is deleted, and the existing message web links are retained. Optionally, a summary or decision portion of the message may be retained., 142485=Application server 202 further comprises an Active Data Objects (ADO) process 2030 that is communicatively coupled to Exchange OLE Database agent 2018 and to database 208 and host integration server 2034. These communication paths enable functions of application code 202 to set and retrieve values of data objects that are stored in database 208, in external legacy systems that are accessed using host integration server 2034. Further, the application code 202 can set and retrieve values of data objects that are stored in Web storage system 2020 by appropriate messages to Exchange OLE Database agent 2018., 511388=When a particular page navigation region is selected, the message page associated with the selected page navigation region becomes fully visible. For example, if the Bookings Pie Chart message page 2114 is selected, it becomes fully visible and appears to be the top page in a stack of pages. The message body 2110 of message page 2106 becomes hidden, although its page navigation region 2108 remains visible. Processing operations to carry out such functions may be executed by a server that is communicatively coupled with a client that is displaying the message window 2100, according to processes that are described further herein., 359499=The author may modify the size and appearance of the table using buttons 1368. In one specific embodiment, buttons 1368 comprise an insert button, delete button, and properties button. A user selects a particular row or column by selecting its associated radio button, and then selects one of the buttons 1368. In response, if the insert button is selected, the system will insert a row or column adjacent to the selected row or column; delete the selected row or column; or enable the user to modify properties of the selected row or column. In one embodiment, such properties include column width, text alignment (left, right, center), cell format, etc. In still another embodiment, the requested changes may be applied to all rows and columns in the table by selecting a separate check box., 72361=To support transmission of formatted images, sound, files, folders, and video attachments, in 1992 the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a multi-media messaging standard known as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). Using MIME, users of different kinds of computers can exchange e-mail messages that include formatted images, sound, files, folders, and video attachments. Further, a single MIME e-mail can contain alternative representations of the same data. For example, there can be an attachment in text form followed by one containing bitmap page images of the same information., 542774=In block 2370, a user finishes a step in a task that is defined as a message. For example, a user completes providing input to a building block of a transportable application. In response, in block 2372, the input is analyzed and the user is presented with a list of other messages that are likely to following the completed step, ordered by context-determined relevance. For example, if the user has completed rating a job applicant in a poll building block of a human resources transportable application, the system determines that a salary offer application is likely to follow next. Therefore, the user is presented with the salary offer application in the list. Alternatively, a new message is created by the user, or automatically, while the user is in the context of another message., 523030=Dynamic content region 2210 operates as a discrete window within message page 2210. If the content associated with the dynamic content region 2210 overflows the dynamic content region 2210 when it is displayed, a user may select a navigation tool 2212 to view additional content., 534780=After selecting a linking method and a linked method, in block 2318, the user is prompted to change one or more link attributes, as appropriate. Such attributes may include cross-linking, link labels, link description, access control, etc., 144222=Exchange server 2008 includes instant messaging support with presence detection API's. Thus, application server 202 may determine, by an appropriate API call, if participants in transportable applications are actually online, and utilize instant messaging for communications, and record such sessions at user request. Transportable applications can include NetMeeting features for initiating and storing data conferences, such as virtual white board, application sharing, video conferences, audio conferences, etc., through Exchange server 2008., 361650=In addition, data values for table cells may be imported from a data file by selecting an Import link 1366. For example, data values may be imported from a spreadsheet file, delimited file, comma-separated file, tab-separated file, or the equivalent., 328521=Inline Web Page. Displays a fully interactive Web page within a page of a transportable application, including browser-like navigation controls. May be combined with, for example, a Poll or Ratings building block to capture and share responses among participants without launching a separate browser., 516774=Message toolbar 2207 may be implemented separate from toolbar 2201 in embodiments that interoperate with unmodified e-mail processing applications. For example, in an embodiment that interoperates with Microsoft Outlook as an e-mail processing application, the toolbar 2201 is generated by Microsoft Outlook and controls its functions, whereas message toolbar 2207 is generated as part of a displayed message by a separate server. This arrangement enables use of the electronic media, group collaboration applications, and multi-page electronic messages disclosed herein without modification of the e-mail processing application. Alternatively, the electronic media, group collaboration applications, and multi-page electronic messages may be integral to the e-mail processing application, and the functions of toolbars 2201, 2207 may be combined in a single toolbar., 304725=In block 1608, the container invokes an appropriate building block method for the action. In block 1610, a presentation data object is received from the building block method. In block 1610, based on information collected at registration time, the application server forwards the presentation data object to the presenter that was registered for the current action. The system then invokes a presentation method on the presenter., 64921=Domestic priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) from prior Provisional application Ser. No. 60/230,037, filed Sep. 5, 2000, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 507485=According to this embodiment, a user interface display window 2100 is generated by an e-mail processing application. The user interface display window 2100 includes a toolbar 2101, a message header display pane 2102, and a message body display pane 2104. Toolbar 2101 displays one or more buttons, links or other user interface widgets for selecting commands, options or tools of the e-mail processing application. Conventional commands such as File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Tools, Actions, and Help may be provided for carrying out operations with respect to a message that is displayed in window 2100., 232543=In one approach, the transportable application client interacts with one or more electronic mail client programs (\u201ce-mail clients\u201d). The e-mail clients may comprise Microsoft Outlook 98, Outlook 2000, Outlook Express, Lotus Notes, Eudora, Netscape Messenger, etc. Typically one of the foregoing is installed in client 102 and the transportable application client interacts with it using shared dynamic linked libraries (DLLs), public APIs, or other programmatic communications mechanisms. The transportable application client also interacts with a network browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc., as well as with the operating system of client 102, which may be Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, etc., 352175=An author of a page that contains building block 1300 may select a style for the graphical appearance of the building block using a Select Invitation Style link 1302. In response, the system displays a list of one or more pre-defined styles for invitations. The author selects one of the styles, fills in the foregoing event data, and saves the building block., 353175=As recipients interact with the building block, the author may view a graphic image of the results in graph or chart form. The author may select the specific form of the results by selecting one of a plurality of radio buttons 1326, each of which is associated with a different presentation format such as pie chart, bar chart, etc. The author may enable recipients to attach comments to their responses by selecting Comment check box 1328., 533921=In one method., the user may copy the URL of another message to the clipboard provided by the operating system, in block 2308. Control returns to block 2304, and the user then pastes the copied URL to a link field that is provided in the prompt of block 2306, as shown by block 2310. Alternatively, the user may select one or more messages from a personal folder or list, or from a group folder or list, as shown by block 2312. In another alternative, the user may search for messages and select the right ones, as indicated by block 2314; this may involve opening another window that has a personal folder or list of messages. In another alternative, the user may drag a message from another context into the current message or into the dialog box or wizard, as in block 2316., 509213=The message header display pane 2102 displays message header information. For example, the message header display pane 2102 may display the name of the sender of the message, the names of recipients, the subject of the message, the date that the message was sent, etc., 147083=Browser 2005 and Outlook client 2004 may carry out HTML display functions using a shared DLL., 223268=Each building block data access object provides access to tables of database 208 through interface objects. In one embodiment, the interface objects include a QuestionInsert object 1504, QuestionXMLInsert object 1510, QuestionResult or ResponseInsert object 1514, and QuestionXMLResult or ResponseXMLInsert object 1516. The interface objects communicate with database 208 through one or more stored procedures 1512. In one embodiment, the stored procedures act, in part, to convert user data received from the interface objects to XML format for storage in database 208; metadata that is not received from a user-created building block, or otherwise internally generated, is stored in conventional database columns. A pre-defined method may be used to store any building block-specific programmatic object as a string value in the database. For example, in one embodiment, the method setFieldValue(fieldName, value) is used to store a Java object as an XML string in the database., 330005=Ratings. Respondents share their ratings with each other on one or more questions on a discrete scale, e.g., ratings from 1 to 10. May be used to collect feedback or gauge group members' opinions., 71313=In the early 1980s, international standards bodies began work on electronic messaging with the goal of ensuring interoperability among different systems. In 1984, CCITT adopted a standard for store-and-forward messaging services called X.400 Message Handling Services (MHS). The International Standards Organization (ISO) created a competing standard called Message Oriented Text Interchange Standard (MOTIS). Differences among the versions were largely overcome by 1988., 351942=The value in the deadline field 1318 may be used, programmatically, to automatically trigger closing a transportable application or page that includes the Invitation building block 1300., 329710=Poll. Participants vote for one or more of a plurality of listed options, and the results are displayed in a pie chart, bar chart, etc. May be combined with, for example, an Image Gallery, File Sharing, or Schedule building block to help make business decisions., 70946=Construction of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in 1969\u20131975 initiated extensive research in store-and-forward communication techniques. An outgrowth of this research was the development of electronic messaging facilities, including electronic mail. Such facilities supported transport of simple text messages., 530325=The interconnection between messages enables serialized and parallel decision making within a messaging system. Further, since the URL is not dependent upon the position within the messaging system, such as within a folder or on a web page, the position of the message may be changed without destroying the link between messages. For example, message 9 may be moved from Folder 4 to Folder 5 and still maintain a link from Web page 2050., 584373=The received code may be executed by processor 1904 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 1910, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system 1900 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave., 329331=Image Gallery. Displays a plurality of graphical images, e.g., in \u201cthumbnail\u201d format, within a page.

A modem local to computer system 1900 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 1902. Bus 1902 carries the data to main memory 1906, from which processor 1904 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 1906 may optionally be stored on storage device 1910 either before or after execution by processor 1904., 508174=Toolbar 2101 also may include one or more buttons, links, or other user interface widgets for taking messaging actions with respect to the displayed message. For example, Toolbar 2101 may provide Reply, Reply To All, and Forward options. Selecting the Reply option instructs the e-mail processing application to generate a new message in reply to the currently displayed message, directed only to the sender of the message. Selecting the Reply To All option instructs the e-mail processing application to generate a new message in reply to the currently displayed message, directed to the sender of the message and all recipients of the message. Selecting the Forward option instructs the e-mail processing application to generate a new message that is directed to a new recipient and that includes a copy of the currently displayed message. In other embodiments described herein, new messages are not generated, and reply content or forwarded content is consolidated in the original message., 526576=The \u201cmore pages\u201d navigation region 2250 may comprise an indicator that additional message pages and navigation regions are available for display and selection. For example, the region can display an arrow, dot, or other icon adjacent to the right-most message navigation region., 429921=Referring again to block 1724, if the event message is asynchronous, then control passes to block 1726 in which the event message is dispatched using a transport mechanism. The event message is sent over a durable or non-durable topic, as appropriate, as shown by block 1728, 1730, 1732. Thereafter, the event message is processed at the message broker, as shown by block 1734, in the manner described above. Concurrently, a notification message is received at block 1750, and in response a notification is sent to the end user, at block 1752., 360624=In another embodiment, table columns may be formatted according to one of a plurality of abstract data types, e.g., date, numbers, currency, time, etc. The data types may also be enumerated data types, such as a priority type (high, medium, low); an answer type (yes or no), a status type (open, closed, pending, resolved); an approval type (approved, do not approve, undecided); or a custom enumerated type that is user-defined. To apply a data type, the author selects the Properties button from among buttons 1368 and then selects a data type from among a list of available data types. The selected data type is stored in the database as an attribute value for the associated column of the table. If the author adds rows to the table, then columns in the row inherit the data type attribute values. When a recipient adds data to a cell, type checking is carried out to ensure that the value that was entered matches the type of the cell; if a type match occurs, an error is reported., 141169=Web storage system 2020 provides Exchange server 2008 with a unified storage name space for all messages, calendar information, documents, discussions, or other data. Its objects are accessible using HTTP, XML, COM, WebDAV, and file system calls. In one embodiment, transportable applications are stored in Web storage system 2020.
