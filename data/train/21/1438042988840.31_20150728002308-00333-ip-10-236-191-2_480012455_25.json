As used in this description, \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d or similar phrases means that the feature(s) being described are included in at least one embodiment of the invention. References to \u201cone embodiment\u201d in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment; however, neither are such embodiments mutually exclusive. Nor does \u201cone embodiment\u201d imply that there is but a single embodiment of the invention. For example, a feature, structure, act, etc. described in \u201cone embodiment\u201d may also be included in other embodiments. Thus, the invention may include a variety of combinations and/or integrations of the embodiments described herein. Temporal aspects of the present invention have not been largely discussion, however one of skill in the art will appreciate that computationally profiles are more time consuming than generation of transition probabilities. Thus, off-line or pre-generated profiles which are then compared against substantially real-time generated transition probabilities may be efficient use of compute power providing the user with a more rapid response than real-time generation of both profiles and transition probabilities. The description of the invention in the discussion has illustrated how to locate a high degree of similarity between a profile and a target, one of skill in the art will recognize that the present invention could also be",
