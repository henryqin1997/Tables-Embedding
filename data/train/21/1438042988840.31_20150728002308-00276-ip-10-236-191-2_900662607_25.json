            "Juniata has HUNDREDS of clubs to choose from and many different activities you can be involved in--it's you who choose to have fun or be bored.",
            "Great for people who like smaller class sizes, one-on-one time with professors, don't mind living in a small town, and in general love learning.",
            "There are a lot of multicultural events that you might not have been exposed to, but they are all very interesting and worth going to.",
            "Juniata is very expensive, but the financial aid office WILL work with you to figure out payment plans if you are struggling. I'm an independent student, and I talked with Diane in the office and she helped figure out everything to me. There's always something that can be done!",
            "Numerous events on campus, movies, bowling, go to Altoona/State College (45 min car ride away)",
            "The food is basic school food--sometimes good, sometimes bad. You can get really sick of the food after a while, but I've had worse.",
            "Some dorms are better than others, but I've had all good experiences with where I've lived. You just have to know how to play your cards.",
            "Classes get a bit overwhelming, especially at the end of the semester, but it's do-able.",
            "Ask questions! The tour guides are not afraid to answer anything for you! They know all the facts about Juniata.",
            "It's worth it!"

I cannot wait for August 18th., 184949=Mountain Day is when you are woken up at 4am by airhorns in September or October on an unknown day, to tell you there is no class. The entire school then goes up to Raystown Lake where there are a variety of activities that happen. Lobsterfest, Storming the Arch, Mr. Juniata, and Madrigal are also a traditions that make Juniata unique., 149331=The food at Juniata is a little disappointed but it is better than cooking canned food every night. They tend to put all the good food in one meal during one day of the week but there are different dining options available so you probably will not get tired of a certain food. And after all, they are renovation the cafeteria and changing the way the food is going to be served for the 2013 school year!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor Because Juniata is a Liberal Arts school, students are exposed to many different subject areas than just their intended major. Classes are usually small and professors are always willing to help. You do have to apply yourself though, slacking won't get you very far.
