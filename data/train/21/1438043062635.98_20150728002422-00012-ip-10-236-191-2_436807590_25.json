            "Multi-Phase Power Block For a Switching Regulator for use with a Single-Phase PWM Controller - A multi-phase power block for a switching regulator includes a phase control circuit, N power cells and a current sharing control circuit. The phase control circuit is configured to receive a single phase PWM clock signal and generate N clock signals in N phases. Each of the N power cells includes a pair of power switches, gate drivers, a control circuit receiving one of the N clock signals and generating gate drive signals for the gate drivers, and an inductor. The current sharing control circuit is configured to assess the inductor current at the inductor of the N power cells and to generate duty cycle control signals for the N power cells. The duty cycle control signals are applied to the control circuits to adjust the duty cycle of one or more clock signals supplied to the power cells to balance a current loading among the N power cells.",
            "CONFIGURABLE MULTI-MODE PWM CONTROLLER - A multi-mode pulse width modulation (PWM) controller for a buck switching regulator includes a multi-mode PWM control circuit where the PWM control circuit is configured to operate in one of multiple control schemes selectable by a mode select signal. In one embodiment, the multi-mode PWM control circuit incorporates a peak current mode control scheme, a voltage mode control scheme, and a valley current mode control scheme. In another embodiment, the multi-mode PWM control circuit further incorporates a constant ON-time control scheme."

The lead frame used in packaging the integrated circuit includes a first area for receiving the integrated circuit, and a second area having a plurality of connections from one side to the other side of the lead frame, thereby forming coil segments. After mounting the integrated circuit and wire bonding its connections, the lead frame is placed on a ferrite plate, the assembly is encapsulated in resin, and the leads trimmed and bent. Mounting of the packaged integrated circuit on a properly prepared printed circuit interconnects the coil segments in the package to coil segments on the printed circuit, thereby forming a single, multi-turn coil around the ferrite plate. Various embodiments are disclosed. 20100102416 Published Description Patent application number Nitin Kalje, Cupertino, CA US 09-19-2013 System, method, and computer program product for directing predetermined network traffic to a honeypot - A system, method, and computer program product are provided for directing predetermined network traffic to a honeypot. In use, predetermined network traffic originating from a node in a local area network and/or a virtual private network is identified. Further, the predetermined network traffic is directed to a honeypot. 20130242743 Published Description Patent application number Nitin Jyoti, Bangalore, IN US",

The Repeater is a lightweight entity that receives redo from the primary database with the purpose of redistributing that redo throughout the primary/standby system configuration. The Repeater able to extend no data loss protection and switchover functionality to terminal standby databases even though the primary database does not need to have a direct connection with those destinations. 10-24-2013 Nitin Kaskhedikar, Wolfsburg DE Patent application number Description Published 20110151340 NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE CONTAINING AS A SOLVENT A BORATE ESTER AND/OR AN ALUMINATE ESTER - A non-aqueous electrolyte includes: at least one ionically conducting salt, a non-aqueous, anhydrous solvent for the ionically conductive salt, said solvent being selected to achieve a lithium transference number between 0.45 and 1.0, at least one oxide in a particulate form, said oxide being selected such that it is not soluble in said solvent and such that it is water-free. 06-23-2011 Nitin Kulshrestha, Menlo Park, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20100280944 PAPERLESS CHECKING TRANSACTIONS - According to one",
