Prototypes See also: Firmware Versions You cannot get keys for A5 and newer devices unless the ramdisk is not encrypted (until a bootrom exploit). Sadly, even with unencrypted ramdisks, you can only get the Root FS key. However, iH8sn0w found two iBoot exploits which allows the keys to be retrieved, but he has refused to make the exploits public to avoid patching by Apple. He has, however, been providing the keys to iCJ's website, but only for public firmwares (non-beta). All dates are relative to UTC. The firmware version number for the Apple TV builds are the ones that the Apple TV reports (also known as the \"marketing version\"). You can use img3decrypt or xpwntool to decrypt these files as described in Decrypting Firmwares. Once done, mount or extract using the tool of your choice. The table on the right lists the application processors and their corresponding devices. This list is also accessible from the main page. WTF SEP-Firmware",
