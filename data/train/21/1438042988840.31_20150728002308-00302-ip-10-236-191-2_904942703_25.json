            "Campus PD offers an emergency text service that will alert students of any safety alerts that occur on campus. The residential security monitors make sure everyone coming into the building either lives there or is checked in and is the responsibility of a resident of the building. Help boxes are located all across campus and offer a help button, phone, and light for anytime students are crossing campus in the middle of the night from the library (which is bound to happen at least once).",
            "Clubs on campus offer a way to make new friends while sharing similar interests. If there isn't already an existing club for what you love to do, then you can easily start one on your own!",
            "Amherst has been voted the best college town in America multiple years in a row and they were not wrong. Amherst Center offers a wonderful middle ground between the public university of UMass and the private, beautiful, Amherst College. The shops and restaurants (and bars) give you a variety of places to visit and explore.",
            "When they tell you that UMass Dining is award winning, they are NOT lying! Every dining hall has options for everyone, whether it be the salad bar, vegetarian selection, sushi, pizza, or pasta. There are enough choices to allow you to eat something different all week. The campus center and various concession areas around campus give you variety like burritos, burgers, chicken fingers, noodle bowls, sandwiches, or meatball subs.",
            "Residential areas at UMass are known for being pretty segregated, but are always welcoming. It is difficult to enter dorm life as a freshman, but everyone is friendly and everyone is in the same boat as you, which makes it a great time to make new friends! R.A.s are a great resource for ANYTHING since they have been in your shoes already.",
            "No matter what your major is, you will have to take General Education (GenEd) courses to round out your schooling. Some may think these classes are pointless, but they may end up being some of the most fun or thoughtful classes you take. The advisers and professors at UMass are stern, but friendly, and always willing to help. Just ALWAYS go to class!!",
            "Students looking to attend UMass should first visit the campus DURING the school year and follow a tour and explore on their own. The campus itself has so much to offer, and without a tour it may be overwhelming, but a structured tour may not allow you to see everything you want. Aside from the campus itself, clubs, dining halls, and dorms, the academic buildings are worth checking out according to where your major classes will be held. Don't worry if you are confused or lost, SO IS EVERYONE ELSE and everyone is more than willing to offer advice, direction, or just an anecdote for help.",
            "There is something special for EVERYONE at UMass Amherst. The classes are challenging and educational, the clubs are diverse and welcoming, and the campus is beautiful all-year round. Everyone will have a great experience at this top-notch university."

As long as other parts of your application are strong, you should be fine. I had strong recommendation letters and work experience/volunteer work so that helped., 28612=The campus security is very thorough, making sure all students that are non residents of a dorm on campus are signed in from 8:00 PM - 12:00 PM on weekdays and 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM on weekends. There are student cadets, as well as police officers at every corner on the weekend to control crime and prevent fighting, but it is not as heavily guarded during the week., 235631=We like breaking food world records. In 2010 we broke the world record for worlds longest California Sushi Roll and in 2011 we broke the record for worlds largest Stir Fry., 186689=Do a lot of research about the different kinds of activities and resources on campus. It'll definitely come in handy; I ended up being able to get an awesome on campus job in September of my freshman year because I found out about the place the previous August. Also, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, take advantage of everything going on. Try new things, talk to all different kinds of people!, 263849=Tons of clubs on campus and even through the town. Go running or to the park and play frisbee. Go dancing at Lit. Ride the B43 to Northampton and go eat or shop. Take the bus to Boston or NYC for the weekend (MegaBus is sometimes $1 for inconvenient times). The farmer's market sets up sometime in March and runs through October, weather permitting., 252005=Don't take 8 o'clock classes, just don't. If a class is full and you're waitlisted, talk to the teacher, they might be able to let you in., 869330=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 647506=A lot of parents want to make sure their child is getting the best possible education that they can afford. Our business school was rated number 46 out of 100 for 2013 in Business Weekly. We beat out many other business schools that are twice the tuition of Umass., 672108=When I went to UMASS in 2006 I lived in Southwest and it was a blast! You create lifelong friendships and you can even take classes in your dorms., 149699=This is dependent on where you live, but I still recommend staying on campus, at least for a year. That way you get to see how Umass operates up close. After that, if you live in Amherst or Northampton, take the bus, you'll save time and money. Otherwise, stay on campus, since many required classes for graduation start at 8:00 AM., 852650=Here are two University of Massachusetts traditions from the umassalumni website http://umassalumni.com/s/1640/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1640&gid=2&pgid=627 Did you know that the very first colors associated with Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1863 were red and blue? The school colors of maroon and white made their first appearance sometime in the 1870s when the college premiered its first football uniforms. We\u00e2??ve maintained this time-honored tradition ever since. Sam the Minuteman is the #1 UMass fan! He holds the record for most athletic events attended in one year, showing up for all home football, hockey, men\u00e2??s basketball and women\u00e2??s basketball games and occasionally checking out our soccer, field hockey, lacrosse, baseball and softball as well. See Sam in his ESPN commercial and become one of his Facebook fans., 760563=There are many residential zones on campus, and the one that stands out for its unique characteristic in the schools is the Southwest residential area. This is one of the two residential zones that doesn't look like a large town of condominiums and grass fields. Basically the party zone of UMass Amherst, it tends to get quite rowdy on weekend nights, especially when the weather is nice out, but, generally, the noise remains indoors otherwise and isn't really as bad as a zoo. Rather, just think of your local shopping mall on the first week of December. For other dorms, expect a little more silence, just as well as your usual college party or dorm get together,, 334934=The freshman dorms are pretty great, and you are guaranteed housing your first year, most of the dorms available being freshman only. The dorm in which I lived, Van Meter (In central) had just been renovated when I went, and was really sweet. The entire basement was renovated the summer of 2011, so we had a new kitchen, swanky couches, and flat-screen televisions. Housing in other parts of the campus was usually atleast acceptable, but varied. There were social events hosted by the RA's during finals week that were pretty cool, and some free tickets offered for local plays and movies. Overall, the people in my dorm were great and I came to befriend a bunch of them.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Through dance groups, drumline, photojournalism, and just hanging out with people in the dorms, I have met a lot of really great friends in my three semesters at UMass. Definitely find a group that interests you and get involved. Also, don't worry too much about partying... contrary to what some people think, not EVERYBODY at ZooMass parties every night, and if somebody can't respect your choices not to, then they're not worth your time. Another thing: the surrounding area is really interesting. Lots of great stores and restaurants, and it's overall an interesting community. Am learning a lot If you take the right Gen Ed classes, they can be very interesting. Definitely try to take classes that interest you or you will very likely be bored out of your mind. However, I so far get the impression that most professors and instructors are generally interested in their fields of expertise, and are enthusiastic about sharing that interest with students.
