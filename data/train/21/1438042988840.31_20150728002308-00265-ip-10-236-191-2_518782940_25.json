A penalty notice contains an IRS representative\u2019s name and/or telephone number for contact purposes; or the payer may be instructed to respond in writing to the address provided. IRS/IRB does not issue penalty notices and does not have the authority to abate penalties. For penalty information, refer to the Penalties section of the 2010 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns (Forms 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G)., 15651=.01 In this publication, all pertinent changes for Tax Year 2010 are emphasized by the use of italics. Portions of text that require special attention are in boldface text. Filers are always encouraged to read the publication in its entirety., 655666=.05 As soon as it is apparent that a 30-day extension of time to file is needed, an extension request should be submitted. It may take up to 30 days for IRS/IRB to respond to an extension request. IRS/IRB does not begin processing extension requests until January. Extensions completed online via the FIRE System receive instant results., 10695=Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, 10453=Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, 47217=A financial entity must retain a copy of Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, or have the ability to reconstruct the data required to be included on the return, for at least 4 years from the date such return is required to be filed., 9357=.01 The purpose of this Revenue Procedure is to provide the specifications for filing Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, 8935, and W-2G with IRS electronically through the IRS FIRE System. This Revenue Procedure must be used for the preparation of Tax Year 2010 information returns and information returns for tax years prior to 2010 filed beginning January 1, 2011. Specifications for filing the following forms are contained in this Revenue Procedure., 53429=.02 Corrections should be filed as soon as possible. Corrections filed after August 1 may be subject to the maximum penalty of $50 per return. Corrections filed by August 1 may be subject to a lesser penalty. (For information on penalties, refer to the Penalties section of the 2010 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns (Forms 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G.) However, if payers discover errors after August 1, they should file corrections, as a prompt correction is a factor considered in determining whether the intentional disregard penalty should be assessed or whether a waiver of the penalty for reasonable cause may be granted. All fields must be completed with the correct information, not just the data fields needing correction. Submit corrections only for the returns filed in error, not the entire file. Furnish corrected statements to recipients as soon as possible., 37765=.01 IRS/IRB prepares a publication of vendors who support electronic filing. Publication 1582, Information Returns Vendor List, contains the names of service bureaus that will produce or submit files for electronic filing. It also contains the names of vendors who provide software packages for payers who wish to produce electronic files on their own computer systems. This list is compiled as a courtesy and in no way implies IRS/IRB approval or endorsement., 30352=.09 Electronic Products and Services Support, Information Returns Branch, Customer Service Section (IRB/CSS), answers electronic, paper filing, and tax law questions from the payer community relating to the correct preparation and filing of business information returns (Forms 1096, 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, 8027, 8935 and W-2G). IRB/CSS also answers questions about the electronic filing of Forms 1042-S and the tax law and paper filing instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3. Inquiries pertaining to Notices CP2100 and 972CG, backup withholding and reasonable cause requirements due to missing and incorrect taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) are also addressed by IRB/CSS. Assistance is available year-round to payers, transmitters, and employers nationwide, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, by calling toll-free 1-866-455-7438. IRB/CSS also offers an e-mail address for transmitters and electronic filers of information returns. The address is mccirp@irs.gov. When sending e-mails concerning specific file information, you must include the company name and the electronic filename or Transmitter Control Code. Please do not submit TINs or attachments, because electronic mail is not secure and the information may be compromised. The Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) toll number is 1-304-579-4827. Call as soon as questions arise to avoid the busy filing seasons at the end of January and February. Recipients of information returns (payees) should continue to contact 1-800-829-1040 with any questions on how to report the information returns data on their tax returns., 10851=Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions, 120660=.01 The FIRE System is designed exclusively for the filing of Forms 1042-S, 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, 8027, 8935 and W-2G., 27642=Note: Because paper forms are scanned during processing, you cannot use forms printed from the IRS website to file Form 1096, and Copy A of Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922 or 5498 with the IRS., 655117=.04 To be considered, an extension request must be postmarked, transmitted or completed online by the due date of the returns; otherwise, the request will be denied. (See Part A, Sec. 7, for due dates.) If requesting an extension of time to file several types of forms, use one Form 8809; however, Form 8809 or file must be submitted no later than the earliest due date. For example, if requesting an extension of time to file both Forms 1099-INT and 5498, submit Form 8809 on or before February 28., 20905=Form 1099-INT, Payee \u201cB\u201d Record new field added.

IRS/IRB does not process waiver requests until January. Waiver requests received prior to January are processed on a first come, first serve basis., 681019=.01 If a payer is required to file electronically but fails to do so and does not have an approved waiver on record, the payer will be subject to a penalty of $50 per return in excess of 250. (For penalty information, refer to the Penalty Section of the 2010 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns (Forms 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G.), 193575=.03 The number of \u201cA\u201d Records depends on the number of payers and the different types of returns being reported. Do not submit separate \u201cA\u201d Records for each payment amount being reported. For example, if a payer is filing Form 1099-DIV to report Amount Codes 1, 2, and 3, all three amount codes should be reported under one \u201cA\u201d Record, not three separate \u201cA\u201d Records., 114747=.02 The FIRE System will be down from 2 p.m. EST December 21, 2010, through January 3, 2011. This allows IRS/IRB to update its system to reflect current year changes. In addition, the FIRE System may be down every Wednesday from 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. EST for maintenance., 11802=Form 1099-SA, Distributions from an HSA, Archer MSA, or Medicare Advantage MSA, 11083=Form 1099-INT, Interest Income, 40265=.01 Transmitters are required to submit Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE), to request authorization to file information returns with IRS/IRB. A single Form 4419 should be filed no matter how many types of returns the transmitter will be submitting electronically. For example, if a transmitter plans to file Forms 1099 INT, one Form 4419 should be submitted. If, at a later date, another type of form (Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, 8935 and W-2G) will be filed, the transmitter should not submit a new Form 4419. The Form 4419 is subject to review before the approval to transmit electronically is granted and may require additional documentation at the request of the IRS. If a determination is made concerning the validity of the documents transmitted electronically, IRS has the authority to revoke the Transmitter Control Code (TCC) and terminate the release of files., 10600=Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions, 21036=Form 1099-R, Payee \u201cB\u201d Record field positions 545-546, added new distribution code W for \u2018Charges or payments for purchasing qualified long-term care insurance contracts under combined arrangements\u2019, changed code 6 description to \u2018Section 1035 exchange (a tax-free exchange of life insurance, annuity, qualified long-term care insurance, or endowment contracts)\u2019, and changed code E description to \u2018Distributions under Employee Plans Compliance Resolution Systems (EPCRS)\u2019. Distribution code W can be used with code 6., 94957=.05 Failure To Furnish Correct Payee Statements (Section 6722). For information regarding penalties which may apply to failure to furnish correct payee statements, see 2010 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns (Forms 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G)., 659181=.10 Requests for extensions of time to file postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or before the due date of the returns, and delivered by United States mail to IRS/IRB after the due date, are treated as timely under the \u201ctimely mailing as timely filing\u201d rule. A similar rule applies to designated private delivery services (PDSs). Notice 97-26, 1997-1 C.B. 413, provides rules for determining the date that is treated as the postmark date. For items delivered by a non-designated Private Delivery Service (PDS), the actual date of receipt by IRS/IRB will be used as the filing date. For items delivered by a designated PDS, but through a type of service not designated in Notice 2004-83, 2004-2 C.B. 1030 the actual date of receipt by IRS/IRB will be used as the filing date. The timely mailing rule also applies to furnishing statements to recipients and participants., 77699=.03 Statements to recipients should be clear and legible. If the official IRS form is not used, the filer must adhere to the specifications and guidelines in Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, 8935, W-2G and 1042-S., 11231=Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, 11296=Form 1099-OID, Original Issue Discount, 29959=.08 A taxpayer or authorized representative may request a copy of a tax return, including Form W-2 filed with a return, by submitting Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return, to IRS.
