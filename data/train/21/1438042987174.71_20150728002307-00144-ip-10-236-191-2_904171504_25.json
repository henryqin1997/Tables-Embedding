Lighting and security has increased since the 2007 off-campus killing of student Donnie Farrel. From what I've seen, the Rowan police are generally pretty fair. Glassboro cops love to break student's balls. Have never heard one solitary reedeming thing about them. The town of Glassboro loves to drain student's pockets as much as they can through fines. Their is also Rowan Security, who are basically rent-a-cops., 2237=At first I attended University of Delaware where I did not feel comfortable at all. After I came to Rowan in the Spring 2009, I immediately felt welcome and accpeted on the medium size campus. I loved my housing assignment and location of it. During my time here I am making many friends and having a lot of fun., 317949=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 259488=There's always something to do on the weekends. There's plenty of house parties and frat parties. There's also shuttles to Philly if you're looking to leave campus. And as of Winter 2013, there will be an ice rink for recreational use on Rowan Boulevard., 230328=After my visit there, it was made clear that prospective engineering students need to do all that they possibly can to get good grades and test scroes to get accepted, as it is a very selective major. Other students should just look at a 3.0 or better gpa and a 1500 or better SAT to have a good chance of getting accepted to Rowan.}",
