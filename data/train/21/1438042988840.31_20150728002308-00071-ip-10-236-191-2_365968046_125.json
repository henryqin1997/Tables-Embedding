Usage Guidelines The mitigation command is entered in policy-map class configuration mode to attach a TMS type parameter map to a TMS type class map under a policy map. The same parameter map can be attached to one or more class maps. If there are multiple class maps attached to a policy map, each can be associated with the same parameter map or a different parameter map. Examples The following example configures the mitigation command to attach the TMS type parameter map to the policy map:  Router(config)# class-map type control tms TMS_CLASS_1  Router(config-cmap)# match tidp-group 10-20  Router(config-cmap)# exit  Router(config)# parameter-map type tms TMS_PAR_1",
