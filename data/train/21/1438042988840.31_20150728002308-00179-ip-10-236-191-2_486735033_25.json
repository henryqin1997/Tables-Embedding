    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39453=The performance required of a recorded article obtained by the ink jet recording method for the ozone fastness is increased year by year, and so the coloring material heretofore used in the cyan ink does not come to provide an image having ozone resistance on the level satisfying the above requirement. For example, in the inventions described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2002-249677, 2002-275386, 2002-294097, 2002-302623, 2002-327132, 2003-003099, 2003-213168 and 2003-034758, it is attempted to improve the ozone fastness of the image by introducing various substituents into the coloring material. However, there is a limit to improve the ozone fastness of the image by only the properties of such a coloring material., 272001=In the cleaning portion, the recording head H1001 before and after the recording is cleaned. A pump M5000 is operated with the ejection orifices of the recording head H1001 being capped with a cap M5010, whereby an unnecessary ink is sucked from the ejection orifices of the recording head H1001. When the ink remaining in the cap M5010 is sucked with the cap being opened, sticking of the remaining ink or other troubles are prevented., 278195=The flow path forming member H1600 is fixed to the cartridge holder H1500 for holding the ink cartridges H1900 by, for example, ultrasonic welding to form ink flow paths H1501 linking from the ink cartridges H1900 to the first plate H1200. The filters H1700 are provided at ends on the ink cartridge side of the ink flow paths H1501 linking to the ink cartridges H1900 so as to prevent invasion of dust from the outside. Sealing rubbers H1800 are fitted to portions engaged with the ink cartridges H1900 so as to prevent evaporation of the inks from the engaged portions., 37420=The color fading of the image is mainly caused by the cyan ink particularly low in the ozone fastness among the respective inks of cyan, yellow and magenta. Therefore, a large number of proposals has been made for improving the ozone fastness of the cyan ink (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2002-249677, 2002-275386, 2002-294097, 2002-302623, 2002-327132, 2003-003099 and 2003-213168). In addition, a proposal has been made on the improvement in the ozone fastness of an image by introducing a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocyclic ring into the skeleton of a phthalocyanine coloring material commonly used as a coloring material of the cyan ink (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-34758). It is described that this phthalocyanine coloring material may have (SO3D)m or (SO2NHR)n (m=1 to 4, n=0 to 3) as a substituent, and SO2NHR is SO2NH2 or a sulfonamide residue capable of forming a complex with a copper ion. Incidentally, D is a monovalent alkali metal, ammonium or organic ammonium., 573104=This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2007-210095, filed Aug. 10, 2007, and No. 2008-175247, filed Jul. 4, 2008, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety., 270124=Upon feeding of paper, only a predetermined number of recording media is sent to a nip portion constructed by a paper feed roller M2080 and a separating roller M2041 in the paper feeding portion including a paper feeding tray M2060. The recording media are separated in the nip portion, and only a recording medium located uppermost is conveyed. The recording medium sent to the conveying portion is guided to a pinch roller holder M3000 and a paper guide flapper M3030 and sent to a pair of rollers of a conveying roller M3060 and a pinch roller M3070. The pair of rollers having the conveying roller M3060 and the pinch roller M3070 are rotated by driving of an LF motor E0002, and the recording medium is conveyed on a platen M3040 by this rotation., 359377=The sodium salt of Exemplified Compound I-25 synthesized referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-45535 was used as Compound 2., 274567=The first recording element substrate H1100 and the second recording element substrate H1101 are Si substrates, and a plurality of recording elements (nozzles) for ejecting an ink is formed in one surfaces thereof by a photolithographic technique. An electric wiring such as Al for supplying electric power to each recording element is formed by a film forming technique. A plurality of ink flow paths corresponding to the individual recording elements is formed by the photolithographic technique. Ink supply openings for supplying inks to a plurality of the ink flow paths are formed so as to open to a back surface., 353536=(1) Synthesis of a mixture of copper tribenzo(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine and copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)-porphyrazine [a mixture in which the ratio of the pyridine ring to the benzene ring among A, B, C and D in the general formula (A) is 1.5:2.5 on the average], 36054=A gray ink is generally prepared by conducting toning with coloring materials of cyan, magenta and yellow. It has been proposed to improve image quality by using the gray ink prepared by using such coloring material in combination. For example, it has been proposed to provide a light gray ink, a medium gray ink and a dark gray ink as toned gray inks to conduct gradation recording by combination of these inks (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-526062). This publication also discloses that a black coloring material is mixed with a proper coloring material to provide an gray ink., 381219=The lithium salt of Exemplified Compound V-2 synthesized referring to the description of Compound d-5 in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-143989 was used as Compound 6., 278876=A cartridge holder portion is bonded to a recording head portion H1001 by, for example, adhesion as described above, thereby forming the head cartridge H1000. The cartridge holder portion is constructed by the cartridge holder H1500, the flow path forming member H1600, the filters H1700 and the sealing rubber H1800. The recording head portion H1001 is constructed by the first recording element substrate H1100, the second recording element substrate H1101, the first plate H1200, the electric wiring substrate H1300 and the second plate H1400., 381491=The following magenta dye synthesized referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-080765 was used as Comparative Compound 3 that is a comparative compound of the third coloring material., 384316=The sodium salt of Exemplified Compound VI-1 synthesized referring to the description of Example 1 in International Publication No. 2006/001274 Pamphlet was used as Compound 7., 138938=The second coloring material used in the present invention and represented by the general formula (II) requires that X1 and X2 in the general formula (II) are, independently of each other, an electron attractive group having a Hammett's \u03c3p value of 0.20 or more. Here, Hammett's rule and Hammett's substituent constant, \u03c3p value (hereinafter referred to as \u201cHammett's \u03c3p value\u201d) will now be described. The Hammett's rule is an empirical rule advocated by L. P. Hammett in 1935 for quantitatively discussing the influence of a substituent on the reaction and equilibrium of a benzene derivative and its propriety is widely recognized at present. The substituent constants determined by the Hammett's role include a \u03c3p value and a \u03c3m value. These values are set forth in many general books. For example, the detailed description thereof is given in Langer's Handbook of Chemistry, 12th edition; edited by J. A. Dean, 1979, McGraw-Hill, and Region of Chemistry, extra edition; No. 122, pp. 96 to 103, 1979, Nanko-do., 359634=The following cyan dye synthesized referring to Japanese Patent No. 3851569 was used as Comparative Compound 1 that is a comparative compound of the first coloring material., 38553=Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-034758 describes that SO2NH2 is favorable as SO2NHR. However, three Examples among five Examples in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-034758 are examples where the phthalocyanine coloring material has no SO2NHR, i.e., n is 0. The results of a color fading test with ozone gas when phthalocyanine coloring materials having SO2NH2 as SO2NHR and substituted by a sulfonamide residue were respectively used are described. However, it is disclosed that the results of the color fading test when these phthalocyanine coloring materials were used are poorer than the case of n=0 though Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-034758 describes that SO2NH2 is favorable as SO2NHR as described above., 356630=(3) Synthesis of a mixture of Compound (4) and Compound (16) [a mixture containing Exemplified Compounds I-2, I-3 and I-4: a mixture in which the ratio of the pyridine ring to the benzene ring among A, B, C and D in the general formula (I) is 1.5:2.5 on the average, E is ethylene, X is a 2,5-disulfoanilino group, Y is an amino group, l is 0, m is 1.7, and n is 0.8]:, 355309=(2) Synthesis of a mixture of copper tribenzo(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine tri(sulfonyl chloride) and copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine di(sulfonyl chloride) [a mixture containing Compound (3) and Compound (5): a mixture in which the ratio of the pyridine ring to the benzene ring among A, B, C and D in the general formula (B) is 1.5:2.5 on the average, and x is 2.5]:, 263656=When an image is formed with the ink according to the present invention, a recording medium with an ink-receiving layer formed mainly of fine particles having an average particle size of 1 \u03bcm or less is favorably used. Specific examples of the fine particles include fine silica particles and fine aluminum oxide particles. As the fine silica particles, fine silica particles typified by colloidal silica are favorable. A commercially available product may also be used as the colloidal silica. However, colloidal silica described in, for example, Japanese Patent Nos. 2803134 and 2881847 is favorably used. As favorable examples of the fine aluminum oxide particles, may be mentioned fine alumina hydrate particles (alumina pigments)., 277460=The electric wiring substrate H1300 applies an electric signal for ejecting the ink from each nozzle formed in the first recording element substrate H1100 and second recording element substrate H1101. The electric wiring substrate H1300 has electric wirings corresponding to the first recording element substrate H1100 and second recording element substrate H1101, and an external signal input terminal H1301 located at edges of the electric wirings for receiving electric signals from the ink jet recording apparatus. The external signal input terminal H1301 is positioned and fixed on the back surface side of the cartridge holder H1500., 384570=The lithium salt of Exemplified Compound VII-5 synthesized referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-139427 was used as Compound 8., 380965=The sodium salt of Exemplified Compound IV-1 synthesized referring to the description of Example 4 in International Publication No. 2004/104108 Pamphlet was used as Compound 5.}",
