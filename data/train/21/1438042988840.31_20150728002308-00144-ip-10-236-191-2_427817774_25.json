Further, the method does so without damaging the slip assemblies. The method provides for the retrieval of the entire downhole tool including all of its component parts, requiring but a single trip within the wellbore. When the tool is to be retrieved, the sealing element is disengaged from the casing by relaxing the compression forces on the sealing element. Then the slip assemblies are disengaged from the casing such that the slip assemblies are no longer in gripping engagement with the casing. The tool is then retrieved from the wellbore. The step of disengaging the sealing assembly can be performed by radially contracting the sealing element with or without longitudinally expanding the sealing element. 20110147013 Published Description Patent application number Marion Dewey Kilgore, Terlingua, TX US 11-12-2009 High Circulation Rate Packer and Setting Method for Same - A high circulation rate packer ( 20090277651 Published Description Patent application number Marion D.
