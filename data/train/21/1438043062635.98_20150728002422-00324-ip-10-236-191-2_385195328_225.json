Usage Guidelines You can use theshow mpls oam echo statistics command to display the following: Currently configured TLV version for MPLS OAM operations. Return code distribution among the received MPLS echo reply packets. Statistics of sent and received MPLS echo packets, and counts of incomplete packet dispatches and timed out MPLS echo requests. If you enter the summary keyword, the Echo Reply count shows all the echo reply packets, regardless of whether they are valid responses to a sent request packet. Therefore, the number of return codes will not match the number of echo reply packets received. Examples The following example displays sample detailed output when the summary keyword is not specified:  Router# show mpls oam echo statistics  Cisco TLV version: RFC 4379 Compliant Return code distribution: !--Success (3) - 5 B--Unlabeled output interface (9) - 0 D--DS map",
