That included a 27-23 loss at Carolina on October 26 when the Cardinals blew a 17-3 lead in the third quarter., 36646=On Carolina's next offensive play, Delhomme was intercepted by linebacker Gerald Hayes. Warner then hit Fitzgerald with a 29-yard TD pass with 3:32 left in the half, as the speedy receiver raced to the right side of the field before stretching his left hand to the pylon for the score and a 27-7 margin., 35386=After each team punted, Arizona tied the game with Warner throwing three yards to Tim Hightower for a score -- but the big play during the march was a 41- yard grab by Fitzgerald, as he leaped to catch the ball between two defenders., 32813=In 1998 the Cardinals won at Dallas in the wild card round before falling at Minnesota. Ten years later head coach Ken Whisenhunt has his team knocking on the door of the first Super Bowl appearance in franchise annals., 34126=It was an unpleasant 34th birthday for Delhomme, as he was picked off a career-high five times and also fumbled the ball away. He ended 17-of-34 for 205 yards with one TD and DeAngelo Williams was limited to 63 yards on the ground for the Panthers (12-5), who suffered their first home loss since December 22, 2007 against Dallas., 37714=Rackers connected from 20 yards out with 3:10 remaining before Delhomme hit Smith for an eight-yard score with 50 seconds left., 32461=Kurt Warner connected on 21-of-32 passes for 220 yards with two scores and was picked off once for the Cardinals (11-7), who won a pair of playoff games in the same season for the first time in franchise history. The last time the team made it this far was when the 1948 Chicago Cardinals lost the league championship game at Philadelphia., 34685=Before Saturday, Arizona was the last NFC team not to make the championship game since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970., 31931=In the playoffs for the first time since 1998, the NFC West champions were coming off a 30-24 home win over Atlanta last Saturday. Boldin suffered a strained left hamstring in that game and was held out of this contest, but Fitzgerald, the third overall draft pick in 2004, had six catches for 151 yards and his touchdown in the first half, jolting the Cardinals to a surprising 27-7 lead. In fact, Arizona scored 33 straight points after Jonathan Stewart capped the game-opening drive with a nine-yard touchdown run., 33756=The 37-year-old Warner is one win away from playing in his third Super Bowl, having won it with the Rams over Tennessee following the 1999 season.}",
