    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck I am pretty ecstatic about how convenient the cost to go to Adams State is. It really is hard to find a quality college such as this one that has a low cost. ASC is really a hit when it comes to the financial matter. Am enjoying being here Coming from a the city of Denver, I have never been close to living in such a natural, small town like Alamosa. It is a big change coming from the city but I enjoy being here because there are a lot of outdoor activities to fill the day with. Am learning a lot I chose to rate my learning experience at Adams State College a four because all the professors that I have had classes with are more than eligible to teach in their fields. I am finding that I learn more everyday than I did back at my high school. I'm thrilled to return to ASC my sophomore year. Login to rate or flag the reviews Jennifer from Bedford, NH 03/26/2012",
