EVERYTHING is within walking distance so no need for a bike, but a car is pretty much necessary due to the fact that it's pretty far out. Campus is extremely safe and is rather nice!"

I have gone on several field trips with my clubs including a local organic farm, a nature conservancy, and New York City for the People's Climate March.

They always seem to be on time and they always do their jobs well. Greek Life There is no greek life on campus. Good and bad. Less hazing, but harder socialization. Clubs and Activities There is a wide variety of clubs and organizations on campus. You're almost sure to find something that peekes your interest. Great for these types of students People that prefer smaller schools. Also, if you're looking for teachers that actually know your name, this is the place for you. Bang for the buck Some would say what you get is not worth what you put",
