The latter are known, for example, from Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Weinheim, Vol. A 21 (1992) p. 169 or from J. Brandrup, E. H. Immergut, Polymer Handbook 3rd ed, J. Wiley, New York 1989. Accordingly, the glass transition temperature can be modified in a known manner through the choice of monomers., 209530=A mixture of 5 g (15.5 mmol) of perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride (prepared in accordance with Liebigs Ann. 1995, 1229-1244), 2.44 g (17 mmol) of n-nonylamine and 75 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was heated at 175\ufffd C. under nitrogen for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried under reduced pressure at 80\ufffd C. This gave 5.5 g (79%) of the desired product in the form of dark red crystals having a melting point of 201\ufffd C., 212247=1 g (2.3 mmol) of 3-hexyl-9(10)-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl)perylene (prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of 3-(6-acetoxy-1-hexynyl)-9(10)-hexylperylene in accordance with Liebigs Ann./Recueil 1997, 395-407) was dissolved in 60 ml of dry dioxane, heated to 45\ufffd C. under nitrogen, admixed with 0.75 ml of triethylamine and 0.52 ml of methacryloyl chloride, stirred at 45\ufffd C. for 4 h, then admixed with 0.52 ml of methacryloyl chloride, stirred at 45\ufffd C. for a further 12 h, cooled to room temperature, admixed with 250 ml of water and extracted with a total of 350 ml of methylene chloride. The solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure and the residue was chromatographed on silica gel using methylene chloride as eluent. Following removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, 790 mg (68%) of the desired product were isolated as a yellow, finely crystalline solid., 487363=The quality of the coated papers was analyzed on the basis of the CIE whiteness in accordance with DIN 6174. Measurement was made using an Elrepho type Datacolor 2000 spectrophotometer. The results are indicated in Table 15., 231840=1. A mixture of 5 g (8.6 mmol) of 1,7-diphenoxyperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (from PCT/EP96/05519), 2.1 g (mmol) of 5-amino-1-pentanol and 75 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone was heated at 175\ufffd C. under nitrogen for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the deep violet precipitate was filtered off, washed with copious amounts of methanol and dried under reduced pressure at 100\ufffd C. This gave 5.9 g (92%) of N,N\u2032-bis(5-hydroxypentyl)-1,7-diphenoxyperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide in the form of a blackish violet powder having a melting point of >300\ufffd C., 114438=In principle the reactive group Rf can also be in latent form and can be converted into the reactive form Rf only by subsequent chemical modification. Typical reactive groups Rf include hydroxyl groups, primary and secondary amino groups, which can be reacted with ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives, such as carbonyl chlorides, carboxylic anhydrides, or with isocyanates or allyl halides to give the desired end products. The groups \u2014X\u2014S\u2014Rf and \u2014X\u2014S\u2014P can also be introduced into the perylene compound by means of transition metal-catalyzed aryl/aryl coupling, aryl/alkynyl coupling or Heck reaction. The abovementioned reaction types are fundamentally known to the skilled worker and can be employed analogously to prepare the perylene compounds of the invention (in this respect cf. J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1992; Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, 1989)., 148127=The process of the invention permits the preparation of dye-comprising aqueous polymer dispersions in which the polymer particles contain at least one oil-soluble dye in molecularly disperse form and, furthermore, have particle sizes of below 1000 nm. Unlike aqueous suspension polymers, such polymer dispersions are stable to sedimentation. Furthermore, the polymer dispersions are notable for the low migration tendency of the dye molecules they contain., 171074=Preferred styrene-acrylic acid copolymers and styrene-methacrylic acid copolymers have a styrene content of from about 20 to 60% by weight, in particular from 35 to 50% by weight, and an acid number of from 130 to 250. Their average molecular weight Mw is preferably from 1000 to 15,000. The glass transition temperature of the copolymers is preferably from 60 to 90\ufffd C. Some of the carboxyl groups of these copolymers may be in esterified form, e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated. Preference is given to the ammonium and, in particular, the sodium salts of such polymers. Such polymers are known (e.g., EP-A-68 024, 96 901 and 467 103) and are obtainable commercially, for example, under the name Joncryl\ufffd, Carboset\ufffd, Morez\ufffd or Glascol\ufffd., 210052=Analytical data for dye 10: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 83.2/83.3; H: 6.5/6.5; N: 3.1/3.1; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=447 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (CH2Cl2): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=482 (28791), 500 (32531) nm; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=8.02 (d, 2H), 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.70 (d, 2H), 7.59 (d, 2H), 7.51 (d, 2H), 4.05 (m, 2H), 1.78 (m, 2H), 1.45 (m, 2H), 1.34 (m, 10H), 0.90 (t, 3H) ppm; IR (KBr): \u03bd=1680 (s, C\u2550O), 1650 (s, C\u2550O) cm\u22121., 124189=The preparation of the aqueous emulsion E1 to be used for the process according to the invention takes place judiciously starting from conventional oil-in-water emulsions of the monomers in which the dye is already in solution or is dispersed molecularly in the monomer droplets. Such conventional emulsions (also referred to below as macroemulsions) can be obtained, for example, by dissolving the dye in the monomer and converting this solution into an aqueous emulsion in accordance with known techniques; for example, by stirring the dye/monomer solution into an aqueous medium which comprises emulsifier. Conventional emulsions here generally have an average droplet size of more than 1000 nm. The macroemulsion is subsequently converted by known techniques into the emulsion E1 (also referred to below as miniemulsion) (cf. P. L. Tang, E. D. Sudol, C. A. Silebi und M. S. El-Aasser in Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 43 [1991] 1059-1066)., 145606=In general, the polymerization process of the invention produces aqueous polymer dispersions having an overall dye-comprising polymer content of up to 50% by weight based on the overall weight of the dispersion. A higher overall dye-comprising polymer content is generally associated with an undesirable increase in the viscosity of the dispersion. If such a higher solids content is required, it is advisable to configure the process of the invention in accordance with the details in DE-A 196 28143. That means producing an aqueous emulsion E1 from at least part of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers and the total amount of dye, and from the remainder, if appropriate, of the monomers, producing a conventional emulsion E2 in which the monomer droplets have a diameter of more than 1000 nm., 171841=Preferred copolymers of maleic acid (or of maleic anhydride following hydrolysis) with olefins, preferably C4-C12 olefins, especially isobutene and diisobutene, and processes for preparing them are known, for example, from EP-A 9169, EP-A 9170 and EP-A 367049. In these polymers the molar ratio of copolymerized maleic acid to copolymerized olefin is preferably within the range from 5:1 to 1:5. Preferably, at least some of the carboxyl groups in these polymers are neutralized. Preference is given to the ammonium and, in particular, the sodium salts of such polymers. Some of the carboxyl groups of these copolymers can also be in esterified form, e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated. The K value of the polymers in the acidic, i.e. nonneutralized, form is generally in the range from 5 to 100, preferably from 10 to 60 (determined by the method of Fikentscher as a 1% strength solution, Cellulose-Chemie 13, 1932, 58-64 and 71-74). Polymers of this kind are obtainable commercially, for example, under the name Sokalan\ufffd CP9 from BASF AG., 172921=Preferred formaldehyde condensates of arylsulfonic acids are, in particular, condensates of benzenesulfonic acid or of naphthalenesulfonic acids, e.g., of the \u03b1 or \u03b2 isomer, or mixtures thereof. They generally have an average molecular weight in the range from 500 to 10,000 daltons, in particular in the range from 700 to 2500 daltons. Preference is given to the alkali metal salts, especially the sodium salts. Formaldehyde condensates of aromatic sulfonic acids are known to the skilled worker as spraying assistants from, for example, DE-A 24 45 813, EP-A 78 449, EP-A 407 889, WO 98/03576 and WO 98/03577. The disclosure content of these documents in terms of the spraying assistants is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Suitable formaldehyde condensates are also available commercially, for example, as TAMOL\ufffd NN 4501 and as TAMOL\ufffd NN 9104 from BASF AG., 310733=Luviquat\ufffd FC 370 is an approximately 40% strength by weight aqueous solution of a copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone and 1-vinyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride in a weight ratio of 7:3, having a K value (in accordance with Fikentscher; determined in a procedure based on DIN 53726 as a 1% strength by weight solution in 3% strength by weight aqueous NaCl solution) in the range from 41 to 49 (manufacturer: BASF AG, Ludwigshafen), 125435=In the first variant, the aqueous macroemulsion is compressed to more than 1000 bar using a piston pump, and is then released through a narrow gap. In this case, the action is based on an interplay of high shear and pressure gradients and cavitation in the gap. An example of a high-pressure homogenizer operating in accordance with this principle is the Niro-Soavi high-pressure homogenizer type NS1001L Panda., 213140=Analytical data for dye 12a: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 86.4/86.3; H: 7.2/7.3; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=500.4 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (dioxane): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=455 (29712) nm; 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=8.25-8.00 (m, 4H), 7.89-7.85 (m, 2H), 7.49-7.41 (m, 2H), 7.33-7.26 (m, 2H), 6.12 (s, 1H), 5.57 (s, 1H), 4.23 (t, 2H), 3.04-2.95 (t, 2H), 2.82-2.67 (m, 4H), 1.98 (s, 3H), 1.94-1.83 (m, 4H), 1.78-1.40 (m, 6H), 0.97 (t, 3H) ppm., 165757=Suitable cationic polymers PW are in general composed of from 5 to 95% by weight, in particular from 10 to 50% by weight, of at least one cationic monomer, and from 5 to 95% by weight, in particular from 50 to 100% by weight, of at least one neutral monomer, based in each case on the total amount of the monomers making up the cationic polymer. Their molecular weight is generally >1000 daltons and is preferably within the range from 2000 to 50,000 daltons., 177925=Suitable water-soluble agents having a water-retaining action include not only polyhydric alcohols, especially those containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as glycerol, erythritol, pentaerythritol, pentitols such as arabitol, adonitol and xylitol, and hexitols such as sorbitol, mannitol and dulcitol, but also polyalkylene glycols and polyalkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, a term which is also intended to include the lower (di-, tri- and tetra-) alkylene glycols and alkylene glycol ethers. These compounds preferably have average molecular weights of from 100 to 1500, particular preference being given to polyethylene glycols and polyethylene glycol ethers having an average molecular weight of \u2266800.

The precipitate formed was isolated by filtration, washed with methanol and dried at 60\ufffd C. under reduced pressure. Chromatographic separation on silica gel using 40:1 chloroform/methanol as eluent, followed by twofold recrystallization from chloroform, gave 4.83 g (86%) of the desired end product in the form of brownish red crystals which underwent decomposition at temperatures above 260\ufffd C., 218829=Analytical data for N-(5-hydroxypentyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 79.6/79.4; H: 5.2/5.2; N: 3.4/3.4; Mass (FD, 8 kv): m/z=407.2 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (CH2Cl2): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=482 (30101), 507 (33006) nm; 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C2D2Cl4): \u03b4=8.52 (d, 2H), 8.34 (d, 2H), 8.32 (d, 2H), 7.86 (d, 2H), 7.52 (t, 2H), 4.15 (t, 2H), 3.61 (t, 2H), 1.78 (m, 2H), 1.62 (m, 2H), 1.48 (m, 2H) ppm; IR (KBr): \u03bd=1680 (s, C\u2550O), 1650 (s, C\u2550O) cm\u22121., 223687=Analytical data for dye 16: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 86.4/86.3; H: 5.7/5.7; N: 2.4/2.4; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=584 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (dioxane): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=502 (41901), 519 (41062) nm; 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=8.63 (d, 2H), 8.47-8.41 (m, 4H), 8.01 (d, 1H), 7.59-7.45 (m, 7H), 7.33 (d, 2H), 6.85-6.80 (m, 1H), 5.87 (d, 1H), 5.35 (d, 1H), 2.79-2.74 (m, 2H), 1.18 (d, 12H) ppm; 13C-NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=165.3, 147.2, 144.4, 140.8, 138.9, 138.7, 138.6, 137.5, 133.8, 133.2, 132.3, 131.7, 131.6, 131.4, 130.6, 130.5, 129.7, 129.6, 129.4, 128.2, 128.1, 127.6, 125.2, 125.1, 124.7, 122.2, 122.1, 121.5, 121.2, 115.9, 93.1, 30.3, 25.2 ppm.

Such monomers B also, however, include esters of vinyl alcohol or allyl alcohol with at least C9 (generally up to C30) alkanecarboxylic acids, examples being vinyl nonanoate, vinyl decanoate, vinyl laurate and vinyl stearate, and also commercial monomers VEOVA\ufffd 9-11 (VEOVA X is a trade name of Shell and stands for vinyl esters of carboxylic acids which are also designated as Versatic\ufffd X acids). Further such monomers B include macromonomers such as oligopropene acrylate (very generally, macromonomers are polymeric or oligomeric compounds which have at least one, usually terminal, ethylenically unsaturated double bond; to be useful as a monomer B of minimal solubility in water their relative number-average molecular weight should preferably be not more than 100,000; in general this relative number-average molecular weight will be from 1000 to 50,000 or from 2000 to 50,000; macromonomers are known to the skilled worker; their preparation is described, for example, in Makromol. Chem. 223 (1994) 29-46). In very general terms, suitable monomers B of minimal solubility in water are all those whose molar solubility at 25\ufffd C. and 1 atm in water is lower than the corresponding solubility of lauryl acrylate. Further examples of such monomers B are the methacryloyl-polybutyl acrylate AB-6 and the methacryloyl-polystyrene A5-6 from Toa Gosei Kagaku KK (JP), both of which have a number-average relative molecular weight of 6000. Other compounds B which can be employed as macromonomers having low water solubility are Polyol 130 and Polyol 110 from H\ufffdls AG (low-viscosity stereospecific polybutadiene (75% 1,4-cis, 24% 1,4-trans, 1% vinyl) whose dynamic viscosity at 20\ufffd C. is 3000 mPa\ufffds)., 308060=The ultrasound source used was the apparatus described in FIG. 4 of DE 197 56 874, equipped with a flow cell having a vessel diameter of 42 mm and a height of mm.

This gave aqueous, dye-comprising miniemulsions.

This, when reacted with methacryloyl chloride in accordance with Example 10, 3., gave the desired product in 81% yield as a red, amorphous solid., 169532=Particularly preferred anionic copolymers PW are in general composed of from 5 to 95% by weight, in particular from 30 to 90% by weight, of at least one anionic monomer, and of from 5 to 90% by weight, in particular from 10 to 70% by weight, of at least one neutral monomer, based in each case on the total amount of the monomers making up the anionic polymer. Their molecular weight is generally at least 1000 daltons and is preferably within the range from 2000 to 50,000 daltons., 125866=In the second variant, the compressed aqueous macroemulsion is released into a mixing chamber through two nozzles which are directed against one another. The action of fine dispersion is in this case dependent above all on the hydrodynamic conditions within the mixing chamber. An example of this type of homogenizer is the Microfluidizer type M 120 E from Microfluidics Corp. In this high-pressure homogenizer, the aqueous macroemulsion is compressed by means of a pneumatically operated piston pump to pressures of up to 1200 atm, and is released through an \u201cinteraction chamber\u201d. In this chamber, the jet of emulsion is divided, in a microchannel system, into two jets which are caused to intersect at an angle of 180\ufffd. Another example of a homogenizer operating in accordance with this mode of homogenization is the Nanojet model Expo from Nanojet Engineering GmbH. With the Nanojet, however, instead of a solid channel system, two homogenizing valves are installed which can be adjusted mechanically., 136999=These emulsifiers can of course also be employed in a mixture with protective colloids. Protective colloids are water-soluble organic polymers. These are barely able to reduce the surface tension of water and, unlike emulsifiers, have relative molecular weights which are generally more than 1000 and, preferably, more than 2000., 210801=A mixture of 32.3 g (45 mmol) of N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,6,9-tribromoperylene-3,4-dicarboximide (prepared in accordance with Example 1a of WO 96/22 332), 27.0 g (180 mmol) of p-tert-butylphenol, 16.6 g (120 mmol) of anhydrous, finely pulverized potassium carbonate and 1200 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was heated at 120\ufffd C. with stirring for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was introduced with stirring into 4500 g of 6% strength by weight aqueous hydrochloric acid, the mixture was subsequently stirred for 2 h, and the precipitated solid was filtered off, washed to neutrality with water and dried under reduced pressure at 100\ufffd C. Filtration through a short silica gel column using methylene chloride as eluent, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, gave 38.9 g (93%) of the desired product in the form of reddish violet crystals having a softening point of 156\ufffd C., 72161=Further possible compounds B\u2032 are resins such as rosins (cf. Ullmanns Encycl. Techn. Chem., 4th edition (1976), Vol. 12, pp. 525-538) and hydrocarbon resins (cf. Encycl. Polym. Sci. Eng. (1987) Vol. 7, pp. 758-782), such as Kristalex F 85 from Hercules for example. Mention may be made, by way of example, of Foral\ufffd 85 E, a glyceryl ester of highly hydrogenated rosin (softening point: 86\ufffd C.) from Hercules.

For use in paper coating slips, the average particle size is with particular preference in the range from 50 to 200 nm and, with very particular preference, from 100 to 160 nm. Bimodal and multimodal particle size distributions may also be of advantage., 154333=In one preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the dye-comprising polymer particles of the dispersion have a monomodal distribution of their particle sizes. This means that the distribution of the polymer particles sizes in the dispersion, as determined, for example, by light scattering experiments or using an ultracentrifuge, exhibits a pronounced maximum in the case of one particle size. In general, this maximum will be at <1000 nm. In a particularly preferred embodiment the polymer particles have z-average particle diameters dz (determined by quasielastic dynamic light scattering, see above) in the range from 100 to 400 nm, in particular from 100 to 300 nm and, with very particular preference, from 100 to 200 nm., 116481=in which X1, X3 and X4 and Y1 to Y4 possess one of the definitions given above other than halogen and \u2014X\u2014S\u2014P, and Hal is halogen, especially bromo. Preferably, X1 and X4 are selected independently from hydrogen, C1-C12-alkyl and aryl. X1 and X4 can also together be \u2014C(O)\u2014N(R\u2032\u2033)\u2014C(O)\u2014. X3 is hydrogen in particular. Such compounds are described, for example, by Schlichting et al. (see above), and in WO 96/22 332. The compounds of the formula VI can then be reacted, in analogy to the procedure described in Schlichting et al. (see above), with suitable \u03c9-functionalized alkynes (see also Tetrahedron Lett. 50, 1975, 4467). Reactive groups, such as OH groups or NH2 groups, can then be liberated from the coupling products, directly or following hydrogenation of the ethynyl groups, by conventional methods (see e.g. Schlichting et al. and literature referred to therein) and these groups can subsequently be reacted with a reactive ethylenically unsaturated compound W, an example being the acid chloride of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as acryloyl chloride, or an ethylenically unsaturated isocyanate, such as allyl isocyanate, to give the desired compounds IIIa or IIIb respectively. The last-mentioned reaction will typically be conducted in an inert, aprotic solvent; for example, in an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic ether, an aromatic hydrocarbon or a nitrogen-containing solvent such as pyridine, quinoline or N-methylpyrrolidone., 221751=Analytical data for dye 15b: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 78.3/78.3; H: 5.3/5.3; N: 2.9/2.9; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=475.3 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (CH2Cl2): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=486 (29133), 507 (31342) nm; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=8.00 (d, 2H), 7.88 (d, 2H), 7.71 (d, 2H), 7.62 (d, 2H), 7.32 (t, 2H), 6.12 (m, 1H), 5.55 (m, 1H), 4.21 (t, 2H), 4.10 (t, 2H), 1.98 (s, 3H), 1.81 (m, 4H), 1.58 (m, 2H) ppm; IR (KBr): \u03bd=1734 (s, C\u2550O, acrylic ester), 1681 (s, C\u2550O, imide), 1650 (s, C\u2550O, imide) cm\u22121., 220198=Analytical data for dye 15a: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./found): C: 78.1/78.2; H: 5.0/5.0; N: 3.0/3.0; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=461.3 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (CH2Cl2): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=484 (29711), 505 (31976) nm; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4=8.00 (d, 2H), 7.88 (d, 2H), 7.71 (d, 2H), 7.62 (d, 2H), 7.32 (t, 2H), 6.21 (m, 1H), 5.82 (m, 1H), 5.58 (m, 1H), 4.19 (t, 2H), 4.10 (t, 2H), 1.81 (m, 4H), 1.58 (m, 2H) ppm; IR (KBr): \u03bd=1731 (s, C\u2550O, acrylic ester), 1680 (s, C\u2550O, imide), 1651 (s, C\u2550O, imide) cm\u22121., 232440=Analytical data for N,N\u2032-bis(5-hydroxypentyl)-1,7-diphenoxyperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide: Elemental analysis (% by weight calc./gef.): C: 74.0/73.8; H: 5.1/5.1; N: 3.75/3.7; Mass (FD, 8 kV): m/z=746.4 (m+, 100%); UV/VIS (CH2Cl2): \u03bbmax (\u03b5)=404 (8312), 515 (38122), 550 (57103) nm; IR (KBr): \u03bd=1695 (s, C\u2550O), 1653 (s, C\u2550O) cm\u22121., 232853=2. 2.8 g (3.8 mmol) of N,N\u2032-bis(5-hydroxypentyl)-1,7-diphenoxyperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide from 1. were dissolved in 75 ml of pyridine, and the solution was heated to 80\ufffd C. under nitrogen and admixed dropwise at this temperature with a solution of 1.5 ml (15.2 mmol) of methacryloyl chloride in ml of anhydrous dioxane. This mixture was stirred at 80\ufffd C. for a further 1.5 h, the solvent was removed by distillation, the residue was taken up in a little chloroform (about 20 ml), a filtration was conducted, the filtrate was admixed with about 100 ml of hexane and the precipitated product was isolated by filtration.

In conventional emulsion polymerization techniques, in contradistinction to the process of the invention, the monomer droplets in the polymerization vessel generally have diameters above 1000 nm. The failure of conventional emulsion polymerization in the preparation of dye-comprising polymers can probably be attributed to the fact that in conventional emulsion polymerization the monomer droplets serve solely as a reservoir for the polymers to be polymerized while the actual polymerization reaction takes place in the aqueous dispersion medium or on the polymer particles that are formed in the course of the polymerization. In that case, the monomers, which generally have a certain solubility in water, diffuse from the monomer droplets to the centers of polymerization (an extensive discussion of the mechanism of free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization is given, for example, in A. Echte, Handbuch der technischen Polymerchemie, pp. 322 to 345). The dye, on the other hand, which does not generally possess sufficient solubility in water, remains in the monomer droplets; homogeneous incorporation of the dyes into the polymer particles is therefore not guaranteed. In contradistinction to the course of polymerization sketched out above, it is presumed that in the process of the invention the polymerization takes place in the monomer droplets. There is therefore homogeneous incorporation of the dyes into the polymeric matrix., 84802=Examples of suitable nonpolar perylene dyes are those as described in U.S. Pat.

The documents cited are hereby incorporated fully by reference., 224715=1. 2.0 g (3.56 mmol) of 9-bromo-N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide (prepared in analogy to Example 6a of WO 96/22 332 using N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide from Example 28 of WO 97/22 607 as starting material) was dissolved in 500 ml of a mixture of one part by volume of absolute tetrahydrofuran (THF) and one part by volume of dry piperidine under inert gas, admixed in succession with 4 mol % of Pd(PPh3)4 (164 mg, 0.14 mmol), 5 mol % of CuI (32 mg, 0.18 mmol) and 1.14 g (7.12 mmol) of 6-acetoxy-1-hexyne; this mixture was slowly heated to 70\ufffd C. and held at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was added to three times the volume of a mixture of ice and concentrated hydrochloric acid in a volume ratio of 3:1, the organic phase was separated off, the aqueous phase was extracted with 3 times 200 ml of methylene chloride, the combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as eluent gave 1.98 g (90%) of N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-9-(6-acetoxy-1-hexynyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide as a red powder having a melting point >300\ufffd C., 218282=1. A mixture of 10 g (31 mmol) of perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride (prepared in accordance with Liebigs Ann. 1995, 1229-1244), 3.6 g (35 mmol) of 5-amino-1-pentanol and 250 ml of NMP was heated at 175\ufffd C. under nitrogen for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reddish brown precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried under reduced pressure at 100\ufffd C. This gave 9.0 g (71%) of N-(5-hydroxypentyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide in the form of a brownish red powder having a melting point of 274-276\ufffd C.}",
