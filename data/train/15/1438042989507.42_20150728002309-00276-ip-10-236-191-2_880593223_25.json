However, one of the down sides of The University of the Arts is it has inconvenient labs hours and doesn't offer 24 hour access to the University until the end of the semester. If your looking for an accredited art school in the Philadelphia area that offers majors such as film,game design, performing arts and graphic design come check out University of the Arts."
