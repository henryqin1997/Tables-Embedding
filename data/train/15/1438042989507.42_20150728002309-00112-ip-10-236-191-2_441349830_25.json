Following homeowners as they buy and sell houses, we first show that internal transaction volume is incredibly volatile and indeed much more pro-cyclical than external volume.2 In particular, internal transaction volume at the peak of the boom in 2003-2005 is three times greater than in the preceding trough in 1993 and four times greater than in the subsequent trough in 2008, while external transaction volume varies in a much more narrow band. As a result, the fraction of homes sold by internal movers is highly pro-cyclical, ranging from a low of 20 percent in the trough years to over 40 percent in the peak years. We demonstrate that similar patterns hold for internal transaction volume in various volatile housing markets across the country3 and that the substantial volatility of internal movement over the cycle holds for households with both low and high loan-to-value ratios.4, 25200=The data for this section of the paper are drawn from detailed records on the universe of housing transactions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area from January 1988-June 2009. Dataquick is the provider of these data. The records include precise information on the property and structure, the transaction price, the date of the transaction, and, most importantly, the names of the buyer(s) and seller(s). When spouses purchase houses jointly, both names are observed on the property record., 23540=Before examining the data on transactions and movement, it is helpful to characterize the market cycles in the Los Angeles metropolitan area over this time period. To this end, Figure 1 presents a real housing price index for the LA metropolitan area from 1988-2008, calculated using a repeat sales analysis similar to Shiller [1991]. The underlying data for this and the other figures presented in this section are shown in Table 1. The Los Angeles market experienced booms in the late 1980s and in the early 2000s. In between these booms, the market experienced a substantial bust with real housing prices falling by 45 percent from 1990-1996. Much like the US housing market as a whole, the Los Angeles metropolitan area experienced a major bust following the early 2000s boom. Figure 1 also shows transaction volume and the median TOM over the cycle.8 Like prices, transaction volume and TOM are quite volatile over time, and they are positively and negatively correlated with prices, respectively., 21124=To ensure that our results on internal movement are not unique to Los Angeles or dependent on any assumptions in our name matching algorithm, we also examine internal movement using the FRBNY/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel data. Using these data, we can track when homeowners throughout the country move using a household id (i.e. we do not need to match names) and we can see whether they move within or outside their MSA. Owner occupancy is not observed directly but is inferred from the mortgage information of the individual. We find that the level of the internal mover share is comparable in the Equifax data during the years in which the two datasets overlap. In Equifax, the average internal mover share for MSAs in California between 2001-2008 is 38 percent, versus 35 percent for Los Angeles using the Dataquick data. We not only find that the internal mover share is positively correlated with the house price cycle for MSAs in California; we also find that across MSAs in the U.S., differences in the volatility of the internal mover share over time are strongly related to across MSA differences in house price dynamics, as illustrated in Appendix Figure 1. The details of the Equifax data and the analyses are discussed in Appendix A. Appendix A also discusses a third robustness check we conduct using the American Housing Survey for Los Angeles. This dataset is more limited, but it confirms our finding that most housing transactions are indeed external.}",

The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116(4):1233-1260, 2001., 97563=Appendix Figure 1 plots the internal mover share by year for MSAs in California, averaged across MSAs. We smooth through the year 2003 because there is an uptick in internal movement (not just in California but in all states) due to a change in Equifax's methodology of determining someone's address. The level of the internal mover share is similar to the level of the internal mover share calculated from the Dataquick data specifically for Los Angeles. The internal mover share is also pro-cyclical for MSAs in California. Interestingly, the internal mover share peaks just before the house price index, which we also find to be the case in Dataquick (see Figure 1). Since the Equifax data is nationally representative, we can also investigate across MSA differences in the dynamics of the internal mover share. The states in the left panel of Appendix Figure 1 had large price run-ups in the early 2000's, followed by large house price declines starting in the middle of the decade. The states in the right panel had more subdued house price dynamics according to CoreLogic. The evidence strongly suggests that the dynamics of internal movement are correlated with the house price cycle., 99454=We use the American Housing Survey data for Los Angeles to calculate the share of owner-occupied housing units with recent movers where the previous unit of the recent mover was also owner-occupied (Source: Table 3-10). This should overstate the internal mover share as we define it because a move between two owner occupied units from one MSA to another would be included in the numerator. The survey is only conducted every 5 years or so, but the average share in the six most recent surveys is 40 percent, consistent with our finding that most housing transactions are external. The share is the highest in 1989 (during a house price boom) and the lowest in 1995 (during a house price bust)., 89153=Karl E Case, John M Quigley, and Robert J Shiller.
