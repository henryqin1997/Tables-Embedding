The general health of the patients has been good except for influenza during January and February, 1926. There were about 150 cases of influenza on this service during that time. Most of the cases had a high elevation of temperature and quite a number had complications. The most frequent complications were pneumonia and otitis media. Very few cases were fatal. We have had no cases of contagious disease. There has been no sudden deaths and no suicides. No serious accident has happened., 231126=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MADAM:--I respectfully submit to you the record of work done in the Carpenter Department from June 30th, 1924, to June 30th, 1926:, 25600=RALEIGH, N.

These boilers were fired up and put in use December 25th, 1925. Everything was working fine until I got oil in the new boilers and burned out twelve tubes in No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 boilers; this was caused by too much oil being fed to the cylinders of the engine. These tubes were replaced and I have kept them clean ever since., 224557=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MADAM:--I hereby submit a report of the work done in the Engineering Department for two years, ending June 30th, 1926:, 3475=Text transcribed by Apex Data Services, Inc.

Mild epidemic of influenza occurred during the early months of 1926. No deaths, however, from this cause. All patients have been immunized against smallpox and typhoid fever. The prevailing cause of death has been exhaustion from epilepsy. Two patients died from exhaustion from pellagra. Two patients committed suicide. With a population increased by 117% during the biennium there has been but one escape against four during the previous biennium, and the caretakers have only been increased by one. Examinations of all new patients have been made and their histories written, with notations of changes from time to time filed. Notwithstanding the population doubled during the biennium and the fact that there were two suicides as against one in the previous biennium, there was exactly the same number of deaths, as of the previous period., 55467=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We awarded contracts July 15th for the rebuilding of that portion of the building that was destroyed by fire on the 10th day of April. The building is now in course of construction, and at the suggestion of Governor McLean, who deemed it wise to take advantage of the overhead expense in connection with building operations, we enlarged the building and instead of rebuilding for two hundred seventy-five, which was the number of inmates in the burnt portions, we have provided for one hundred additional, or three hundred seventy-five. Our contract provides that this entire project must be completed not later than the 15th day of May, 1927, and that part designated as the rear dormitory, which is a part of this project, will be completed by the 15th of October, this year. This project is to be one of the best in the State. The building will be fireproof, and the plans were given most careful consideration, and I conferred with several of the Nation's competent authorities in reference to the building before preparing the working plans., 22449=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 10th, 1926, about 1:40 P. M., fire broke out in the roof of the Sixth Ward and destroyed the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Wards and the northern end of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Wards. The Eleventh Ward was also so badly damaged that it cannot be used until extensive repairs can be made. The patients are being cared for on the porches of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Wards and on the parts of these wards not destroyed by the fire. Some patients were transferred to Oaks Colony and some were taken home by relatives., 11987=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have the honor to submit herewith the report of Dr. Albert Anderson, Superintendent of the State Hospital for the Insane, at Raleigh, North Carolina, covering the operations of the Hospital from July 1, 1924 to June 30, 1926, together with a copy of the audit made by Hon. Baxter Durham, Auditor., 229213=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 10th, 1926, we had a fire which destroyed six wards of the Main Building and four wards that were built during Dr. Kirby's administration, and stopped at a wall of the Underwood Building built during Dr. Jas. McKee's administration. On the back side of the old building, the dormitory and old dining hall and toilets for six wards were destroyed. This was built by Underwood and was built during Dr. McKee's administration., 299839=Return to Menu Page for Biennial Report ... from July 1, 1924, to June 30, 1926 by State Hospital (Raleigh, N.C.), 236652=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MADAM:--I hereby respectfully submit to you a report of the work done in the Matron's Department from June 30th, 1924, to June 30th, 1926:, 37684=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There have been no contagions. Mild epidemics of influenza occurred during early months of 1926. No deaths, however, from this cause. All patients have been immunized against smallpox and typhoid fever. The prevailing cause of death has been exhaustion from epilepsy. One death was from pneumonia. Examinations, mental and physical, of all new patients have been made and their histories written. Notations of condition have been made and recorded from time to time. With more than double the population of the previous biennium we have experienced only three more deaths this period than the former report., 231332=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laid maple floors in First and Fourth Ward.

A wing was added to the original building and some changes made in the original building, thus giving us the space for the fifty additional beds and also providing a new dining room and serving room to care for the one hundred inmates, the former smaller dining room having been used for bedrooms by building partitions in same. The required number of shower baths and other toilet facilities were also added and two additional rooms for attendants in charge of this wing of the building., 27550=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There has been a decided decrease in drug addiction patients. For the periods of 1924-1925, we admitted thirty patients; 1925-1926 seventeen patients who were drug addicts. On July 1st, 1924, there were in this service four patients diagnosed drug addiction; July 1st, 1926, only one patient of this class., 243833=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MADAM:--I hereby respectfully submit to you a report of the work done in this department from June 30th, 1924, to June 30th, 1926:, 242851=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the aid of patients in the spring of 1925 we painted the entire Kitchen, including the five Dining Rooms in Kitchen, Vegetable Room and Diet Kitchen. In the spring of 1925 we painted the Meat Room, Broom Room, Vegetable Room, Supply Room, Diet Kitchen and varnished all the furniture, office fixtures and chairs in Center Building, also painted and enameled all beds in Center Building., 201136=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MADAM:--I hereby submit a summary of the past two years, ending June 30th, 1926:, 32353=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Movement and condition of the population of Oaks Colony during the biennial period ending June 30th, 1926:, 4735=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The electronic edition is a part of the UNC-CH digitization project, Documenting the American South. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text has been entered using double-keying and verified against the original. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text has been encoded using the recommendations for Level 4 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Original grammar, punctuation, and spelling have been preserved.
