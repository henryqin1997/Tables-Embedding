In this example, the maximum value of 60000 ms is used:, 990=This feature was introduced on the Cisco 2600 series, Cisco 3600 series, and Cisco MC3810 series., 41095=The IUA transport protocol using SCTP is supported on the Cisco PGW 2200; the Cisco PGW 2200 now uses IUA to communicate with Cisco access servers., 121781=Router(config-iua)# as as1 sctp-t1init 1000, 250220=In the configuration above, an application server named as-named as5400-3 is configured to use two local IP addresses and a port number of 2577. IP address values that are set apply to all IP addresses of the ASP., 58353=This feature supports IUA with SCTP for the Cisco AS5x00, Cisco 2420, Cisco 2600 series, Cisco 3600 series, and Cisco 3700 series. It is to be used as an alternative to the existing IP-based User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-to-Reliable Link Manager (RLM) transport between the Cisco PGW 2200 and Cisco gateways., 122800=Router(config-iua)# asp asp1 as as1 10.4.8.68 10.4.9.68, 210178=In the following example, a segmented datagram is received in two chunks, for stream 0 and sequence number 0. The length of the first chunk is 1452, and the second is 1 byte. The first chunk indicates that it is for a new datagram, but the second chunk indicates that it is part of an existing datagram that is already being reassembled. When the first chunk is processed, it is noted to be in sequence, but is not complete and so cannot be delivered yet. When the second chunk is received, the datagram is both in sequence and complete. The application receives the datagram, and a SACK is shown to acknowledge that both chunks were received with no missing chunks indicated (that is, with no fragments)., 17329=Application server as1 is configured to use two local IP addresses and port 2577. IP address values that are set apply to all IP addresses of the application-server process., 41265=IUA with SCTP on the Cisco PGW 2200 provides the following services:, 74329=Router(config-iua)# asp asp1 as as5400-3 10.4.8.68 10.4.9.68 2577, 269844=The following example sets the SCTP T1 initiation timer in milliseconds.

It provides the layer between an SCTP user application and an unreliable end-to-end datagram service such as IP. The basic service offered by SCTP is the reliable transfer of user datagrams between peer SCTP users, within the context of an association between two SCTP hosts. SCTP is connection-oriented, but SCTP association is a broader concept than, for example, TCP connection., 152052=interface Serial3/0:1:23, 152999=isdn T200 2000, 129474=Router(config-iua)# asp asp1 sctp-t3-timeout 10.10.10.10 60000, 254537=The following example sets the failover time (in milliseconds) between 1 and 10 seconds.
