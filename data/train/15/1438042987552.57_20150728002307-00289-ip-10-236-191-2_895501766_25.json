            "I have always felt safe on campus. Pacific takes extra precautions to make sure students, faculty and staff are safe. There is an actual on-campus police force. There are emergency call posts all over campus. If you press the button and make the call, the police will be to your aid in minutes. There is also group called Stripe. If you feel uneasy walking around campus at night you call the widely available number and in a few minutes a member of the Stripe team will pick you up in a car or golf cart and take you to your destination. Pacific is a very safe campus.",
            "I HIGHLY recommend Greek Life at Pacific. Before I went to college I never thought I would join a sorority. Greek life at Pacific is different than the typical stereotypes sororities and fraternities portray. There are 4 social sororities and 4 social fraternities, each with a house on campus. There is a sense of unity between all the houses and you can tell that everybody is proud to be Greek, regardless of what house they belong to. When in a sorority or fraternity, you form such a strong bond with your sisters or brothers. The Greek community works hard to better our world by supporting different philanthropies by holding many different fundraising events throughout the year. Going Greek was one of the best choices I have ever made.",
            "There are many different types of clubs and organizations on campus. From cultural clubs to religious groups to intramural sports teams, there is something for everybody. Get involved!!!!",
            "The food at Pacific is pretty good. Bon Appetit is the company that does the food services for the entire university. The food they provide is healthy and local. On campus there is a main dining hall in University Center (known as the UC) which serves a variety of things such as Mexican food, Chinese food, pasta and sandwiches. There is a grill on the second floor of the UC called The Lair. The Lair is the only place on campus where alcohol is sold (to the 21 and older crowd of course). They serve a wide variety of food such as burgers, hot dogs, wraps, and salads. It is up in The Lair that karaoke nights and other live entertainment are held. The is an on-campus grocery store called The Grove where fresh fruit, frozen items, and other groceries can be purchased. Students can also buy breakfast and lunch from the EAT truck. The EAT truck serves delicious snack items and lighter fare. If you are a coffee drinker, don't worry because the two on campus cafes serve both Starbucks and Jesus Mountain coffee and other drinks. Pacific's food is good and healthy but many students travel off campus to eat in order to get a little variety.",
            "I personally did not have the opportunity to live in the dorms myself. I did however spend plenty of time in the dorms visiting and staying with friends. Pacific has several different types of living communities available to freshman: two larger residence halls and several smaller halls known as quads. Within these communities there are honors dorms and other groups. In all residence halls, the rooms are quite similar. Most are typically double and single occupancy, though I believe halls have triple occupancy rooms. The rooms are relatively spacious. The beds and desks can be arranged as you wish. Some rooms even have sinks. The Resident Advisers I had the chance to meet were very nice and cared a great deal about the students in their residence halls.",
            "Pacific offers some truly academic rigorous courses. Due to small class size professors take on a more hands-on teaching role. They aim to challenge you and broaden your perspectives. They are personally invested in your success in their class. If you are struggling in a course, many professors are willing to go over material with you. If this isn't your style, there is free on campus peer tutoring available. Though some courses are more challenging than others, if you make yourself accountable and study often, you will do very well in your classes.",
            "I believe that Pacific is one of the most supportive college communities out there. The entire campus community truly cares about students' well-being and success in not only academics but also in life. At Pacific, every student matters and there is no chance of being lost in the shuffle."

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students UOP is great for students who are not afraid of Stockton environment, students who are willing do experience new things and enjoy the college life. Tips for prospective students For future students, I encourage you to choose this school for many reasons. This school has been voted to have a beautiful campus. The personnel at UOP are very friendly and very helpful if any questions arise. UOP also provides a large variety of majors for any incoming student and it would be great to have enthusiastic students on campus. Bang for the buck Of course, the cost at UOP would be a little pricey because of being a private school but you do get your money's worth here on this campus. Again, with the class sizes you have a better chance of retaining the information for the prices that you are paying. UOP also provides many ways of payment that can help the students who need it Am enjoying being here Even though it is my first year and I don't really have anything to do yet I see a large potential for me to go out and find clubs and find a place to be within the",
