Rumours persisted that he was considering a move elsewhere, but in 2010 he was picked for the four-day side as a batsman when injuries gave rise to an opportunity and it was in that role that he completed his maiden first-class hundred against Hampshire. When Sutton left at the end of the 2010 season, Cross committed his future to Lancashire., 76493=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 34209=Born June 20, 1984, Bury, Lancashire, 55395=Jul 11, 2014, 56200=Jul 8, 2013, 52002=In 2011, he missed only one match and his 557 Championship runs included a career-best 125 against Sussex at Hove. He was disappointed with his return as a batsman but his glovework earned him the Professional Cricketers' Association's Wicketkeeper of the Year title. He moved to Derbyshire but was released at the end of 2014. ESPNcricinfo, 50883=Gareth Cross made the transition from second-team wicketkeeper to the first-team role at Lancashire when Warren Hegg was injured towards the end of the 2005 season. He immediately showed promise with tidy glovework and it wasn't long before his sparky batting was also on show. But Lancashire did not feel he was ready for full-time promotion and instead brought in Luke Sutton to fill the number one spot.}",
