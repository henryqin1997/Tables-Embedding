My translator and drawing procedures also support this so called 'implicit' functions, however the processing time is longer. So, writing y = 2x - 5 yiels the same graphic as y - 2x = 5 but the latter is slower. All functions (normal, inverse, parametric, implicit) use the same translator and result in the same tables. The drawing procedures however are different. To summarize the supported functions / equations: .....x.....y.... = ....x....y...... In rare cases as graphs of trifoliums and the like, functions do not exist. These graphs are the result of equations like y = 5sin(v) ; x = 5cos(v) ........for a circle with it's center at (0,0) and radius 5 Donations Designing software is time consuming.

Also calculations between (.......) have priority as in 3*(10 -6) where 10 - 6 has to be calculated first. The following table shows the priorities of the operations supported name symbol priority example function ... 7 log(x) exponentiation ^ 6 x^3 unairy - - 5 -sin(x) multiplication * 4 3*x division / 4 x/5 addition + 3 x+5 subtraction - 3 x/5 transfer = 2 y = 17 separator ; 1 y = 1; x = 2 Note: the ; operator is a dummy with the lowest priority. It keeps the x and y variables separated in parametric functions. An intrinsic (type 4) function like........x^2 + y^2 = 15x + 22y is changed into .....v = x^2 + y^2 - 15x + 22y before the translation process. The - operator is assigned a priority of 2, the = operator a priority of 1. So, if a set of (x,y) satisfies the equation then v = 0. Determining the type",
