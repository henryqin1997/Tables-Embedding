            "UNDERWATER REPAIR WELDING METHOD - A protection plate is welded to a metal structure in water so that the protection plate covers the surface of the structure including a portion to be repaired. The welding is carried out such that the periphery of the protection plate is welded in water by laser welding while inactive gas is supplied to portion to be welded to seal the portion to be repaired by the protection plate. Welding is carried out while the inactive gas is supplied to the portion to be welded coaxially with a laser beam during the laser welding. The plate is provided therein with an opening in advance so as to release vapor produced from water remaining during welding between the protection plate and the structure and the opening is sealed after the periphery of the protection plate is welded to the structure.",
            "IN-PIPE WORK DEVICE - According to an embodiment, an in-pipe work device is inserted into a pipe and remotely controlled by a control device to perform an operation for an inner surface of the pipe. The in-pipe work device has: a main unit; a main-unit support unit; a rotation arm; a process head; a first distance sensor; and a process head position adjustment mechanism that changes a distance from a rotation center of the rotation arm to the process head. The control device makes the process head position adjustment mechanism expand and contract based upon a result of measurement by the first distance sensor and operation condition information that is input in advance."

Conventional surface roughening technology by etching can only be used for leadframes made of limited materials. Improved adhesion cannot therefore be achieved between a metal member such as leadframe and a sealing resin.</td> <td>20130228907</td> <tr> </tr> <td>08-15-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130208174\">IMAGING LENS AND IMAGING DEVICE</a> - The present invention ensures excellent optical characteristics corresponding with a high pixel imaging element while an imaging lens is miniaturized and has a larger aperture.</td> <td>20130208174</td> <tr> </tr> <td>07-25-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130188088\">ZOOM LENS AND IMAGE PICKUP APPARATUS</a> - A zoom lens includes a first lens group having a positive refracting power and normally fixed in position, a second lens group having a negative refracting power and movable along an optical axis, and a third lens group having a positive refracting power and normally fixed in position, disposed in order from the object side to the image side.

The first storage is configured to store therein first information obtained from a target uttered voice. The second storage is configured to store therein second information obtained from an arbitrary uttered voice. The first generator is configured to generate third information by converting the second information so as to be close to a target voice quality or prosody. The second generator is configured to generate an information set including the first information and the third information. The third generator is configured to generate fourth information used to generate a synthesized speech, based on the information set. The fourth generator configured to generate the synthesized speech corresponding to input text using the fourth information. 08-22-2013 Masayuki Tamura, Kanagawa JP Patent application number Description Published 20110193991 RECORDING APPARATUS, IMAGING AND RECORDING APPARATUS, RECORDING METHOD, AND PROGRAM - Disclosed herein is a recording apparatus including: an input section configured to input data to be recorded; and a recording control section configured to reserve a recording region beforehand on recording media by updating file management information about the recording media to which the data is",
