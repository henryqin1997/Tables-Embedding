He moved to Derbyshire in 2010 but enjoyed only moderate success until late in the 2011 season, when an injury to Mark Turner provided an opening, and he finished the season with 15 wickets in four first-class matches. He kept his place for the first three matches in 2012 but thereafter his appearances were sporadic. But the following season his career really got going. ESPNcricinfo staff, 73006=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 59893=NBC Denis Compton Award 2006, 35120=Born November 25, 1985, Nottingham, 69369=New Zealand women's coach Haidee Tiffen on her mentoring philosphy, winning the 2000 World Cup final, and retiring young, 52747=He progressed through the Nottinghamshire academy with the ability to bowl seriously quickly, if erratically. Sourav Ganguly was his first wicket in first-class cricket as he took 4 for 45 against Glamorgan on debut in 2005. The preceding winter, he was selected for England Under-19s but injury forced him to pull out of the squad. But next winter he was back in the England Academy and was chosen to play for the MCC against his own county in the traditional curtain-raiser to the season in 2006. He took his maiden five-wicket haul, 5 for 45, against the West Indies in August that year., 51526=Blessed with genuine pace, Mark Footitt has taken a while to hone his talent but is gradually becoming recognised as one of the leading bowlers in county cricket. 2014 was a breakthrough season for him with 84 first-class wickets at 19.19. His 82 wickets in the Championship - the highest in Division Two - represented the best return by a Derbyshire bowler since the England offspinner Geoff Miller in 1984. Just as strikingly, his 106 dismissals in all competitions were the most by a Derbyshire bowler since 1965. With left-arm quicks a rare commodity, a call-up to the England Performance Programme soon followed., 52249=Footitt, a left-armer, had also been one of the few Derbyshire players to lift their game after they regained a place in Division One in 2013. They were immediately relegated, but he turned in his best season with 42 first-class wickets, including a career-best 6 for 53 against Durham. A taste of Division One cricket proved to be a fillip for his career, and he also hailed to influence of Derbyshire's incoming elite performance director, Graeme Welch., 58681=Sep 15, 2014, 59832=NBC Denis Compton Award 2005, 57996=May 19, 2015}",
