Until recently, these products were simple single output units, often with narrow range AC inputs. An \"option\" would be to have a front panel selector switch to allow the product to accept 230VAC input. Switching power supply design rules expensive and more efficient than equivalent linear supplies. Not long ago, efficiency hinged on the converter's switching devices that wasted most of the power budget during relatively low-frequency transitions -- typically 20 to 30 kHz -- between on and off states. Improving efficiency by increasing Class G Amplifiers Class G amplifier operation involves changing the power supply voltage from a lower level to a higher level when larger output swings are required. There are several ways to do this; the simplest involves a single class AB output stage that is connected to two power-supply rails by a diode Brushless DC Motor Control Using PIC18FXX31 MCUs A PICDEM TM MC demo board was used to develop, test and debug the motor control code.
