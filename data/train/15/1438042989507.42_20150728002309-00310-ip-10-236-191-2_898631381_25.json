The range from the choice of classes to quality of professors, Mesa has much more to offer than any of the other San Diego District Community Colleges (which include Miramar, Mesa, and City). I would know, I've attended all three. Mesa even supersedes the other districts such as Grossmont and Southwestern. Even through the budget cuts and all the financial decreases in the past year, Mesa seems to be upholding their standards of actually giving a decent education, as best as it gets for community that is., 4974=Its community college, if you do not want to spend the high cost of what a 4 year college and private colleges make you pay stick with a community college. Mesa is a part of the San Diego Community Colleges (City and Miramar are the other two). At the time of this post $26 per credit for local CA residents is a great deal to get your GE done and go for an AA and then transfer to a 4 year.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I love Mesa college!!! I have taken both on-campus and on-line courses; both are wonderful. I can honestly say I have learned a great deal in the short time I have attended Mesa college. Am learning a lot The professors here at Mesa are amazing!!! The professors and students alike are very helpful here. Academics are a major aspect of this college. If you want to go to a college where the students are friendly, the professors strict but helpful, many clubs and groups to choose from Mesa is it. Plus the weather is magnificent all year long!.
