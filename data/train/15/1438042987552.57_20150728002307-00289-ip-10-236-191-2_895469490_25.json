I go to school 2 hours early to get a spot in the very front. The sign on the library says it opens at 8:00 but it actually opens at 7:30, so if you get there early you can go to the library and complete any homework you haven't already finished. Talk to other students about teachers they have had because some teachers are a lot better than others. No matter what classes you take, how busy your schedule is, or how prepared you think you are; the one thing I would suggest more than anything is to have and use a daily planner., 132783=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "They post activities on bulletin boards and even the girls bathroom stalls for your convenience Great for these types of students Lots of diversity at this campus Bang for the buck You can make payments up to 5 months for classes without having your credit checked. I do hate the fact that they tack on a $100 late fee to struggling students, but there's no huge loan fees to pay back so I guess it's worth it. What to do for fun I go to the Lowell Campus. There's lots of places to sit outside of restaurants, a Quilt museum. I've been to an an Art gallery close by. Things are within walking distance like a gym and the Lowell Memorial Auditorium where I just saw a concert for Blood, Sweat and Tears the other night. Food and Dining Dining hall is usually open with vending machines for the evening students, but no real food. you can walk to nearby places like dunkin donuts during breaks. Academic Rigor Classes can be tough, but if you do the reading and homework you'll be fine. My Stats teacher said YOU",
