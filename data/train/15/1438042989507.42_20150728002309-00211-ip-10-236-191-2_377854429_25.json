Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines This command allows you to know about IS-IS neighbors going up or down. The log-adjacency-changes command is on by default but only changes generated by IIH events are included, unless the all keyword is also used. Examples The following example configures the router to send a syslog message when an IS-IS neighbor state changes: Device# enable Device# configure terminal Device(config)# router isis ABCD Device(config-router)# log-adjacency-changes all Related Commands Command Description",
