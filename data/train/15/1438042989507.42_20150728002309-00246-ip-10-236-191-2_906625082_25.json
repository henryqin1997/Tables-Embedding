Tips for prospective students Make sure that any transcript requests are send a very long time beforehand. I have had problems recieving paperwork on time, and have heard similar stories from other students. Bang for the buck Tuition prices vary depending on the amount of classes a student takes, but is still very inexpensive. The campus classes are very reasonably priced, but the bookstore is not. I found the class materials to be very overpriced, especially since rental textbooks are generally so cheap. Did enjoy being here While ACCC was a good school, I truly wanted to attend a four year university. Despite my plans to transfer, I enjoyed my classes and time on campus. Did learn a lot Despite the negative image alot of students have regarding community college, I learned a lot of new things from my time attending Atlantic Cape. Login to",
