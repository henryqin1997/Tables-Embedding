            "I've never felt threatened, been threatened, or worried about my safety or the safety of my peers. I know there are security guards but in the two years that I've been at Normandale I haven't seen two students so much as yell at one another. I do believe that if anyone did feel threatened, and they told ANY employee, that person would be given immediate assistance.",
            "As a two year institution there are only two Fraternities that I know of on Normandale. Both are for students with high academic achievement.",
            "There's a plethora of clubs and organizations. If you have a hobby or an interest, there are people at Normandale who will have that interest too.",
            "I think Normandale attempts to reach all generals studies students. More recently I believe they've begun the groundwork for a lot of selective and cooperative degree focuses in line with four year institutions.",
            "During the summer there are a lot of outdoor areas to find. Inside, all around the campus, there are benches, seats, tables, and alcoves where large or small groups can meet and associate. Watch out for the L300 classrooms. They're on the top floor of the library and you won't see them unless you actually go into the library and ascend the stairs. Don't be shy, get in there!",
            "I feel like every class I've been in has given me more, never less, than what I've put into it, and that includes monetary values.",
            "There's a plethora of clubs and organizations. If you have a hobby or an interest, there are people at Normandale who will have that interest too.",
            "Great cafeteria. Lots of food choices. Lots of seating. Lots of nooks to disappear into. You may be in the middle of a lunch room but it feels like you're in a small diner.",
            "There are no dorms.",
            "I have always felt challenged. The classes I've had have expected its students to read, write, and do an assortment of projects and assignments. This is a works based style of academia.",
            "Be organized. Take your professors as serious as you expect them to take you. If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask, everyone on staff is happy to help you out.",
            "Normandale is a warm school with great professors. It's very diverse and has great resources. The computer lab, student center, library, cafeteria and gym make it a comfortable place to spend your whole day."
