Another onsides kick did not work., 75831=Bush's 203 rushing yards was the most by a Dolphin since Ricky Williams had 216 against the Bears on December 9, 2002., 77365=Dan Carpenter made a pair of field goals to give Miami a six-point lead. A 12- play, 83-yard drive ended in a 20-yard Carpenter field goal with 8:34 left. Vontae Davis then picked off Fitzpatrick and returned the ball to the Buffalo 24. But the Dolphins settled for a 26-yard Carpenter field goal and a 13-7 margin., 78617=Buffalo made things a bit interesting, though, as Fitzpatrick led an eight- play, 67-yard scoring drive. David Nelson caught a 21-yard pass to move the ball to the Miami 33. Spiller added a 19-yard catch two plays later. Derek Hagan ended the march with a two-yard TD catch to make it 30-20 with 2:27 to play.}",
