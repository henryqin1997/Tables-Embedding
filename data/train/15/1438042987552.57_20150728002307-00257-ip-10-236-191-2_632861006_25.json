DB-9 (EIA-574) Versions Also Available If you need to convert a DB-9 Serial port toRS-422, you need the Patton Model 222N9 Highlights The Patton Model 222N Series of converters now comes in two \"flavors\": The Model 222N allows an RS-232 device with DB-25 port to connect to an RS-422 device up to 4000 feet away over two twisted pair. The Model 222N9 does the same thing for an RS-232 device with a DB-9 port (now called EIA-574). Both converters support data rates up to 19.2 kbps, and require no AC power or batteries for operation. All handshaking lines are looped back. The Model 222NRC is a dual rack card version of the Model 222N, with two converters in one card! Overview Made in the USA \u2014 This Patton equipment is designed by Patton engineers and built in our Gaithersburg, Maryland facility. Patton's American-made manufacturing process delivers high-quality networking solutions with reliability you can trust. 600W of Optional Surge Protection Reliable Surface Mount Construction Handshake Lines are Looped Back No AC Power Required Bi-Directional Data Conversion Conforms to the EIA RS-422 Interface Standard",
