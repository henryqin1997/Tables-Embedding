In general, stock options granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan that are vested may be exercised within three months after termination of employment without cause. However, if the executive\u2019s employment terminates due to death or disability, earned shares and vested shares may be exercised within one year after the date of termination, but not later than the expiration date of the option., 408787=Based upon a Schedule 13G amendment, dated February 10, 2014, filed by Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, a Delaware Limited Partnership, which indicates that as of December 31, 2013, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP had the sole power to dispose of 629,283 shares as an investment advisor or manager to investment companies, trusts and separate accounts that own the 629,283 shares. The address of Dimensional Fund Advisors LP is Palisades West, Building One, 6300 Bee Cave Road, Austin, Texas 78746. We make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the information reported., 234040=2012, 434086=\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narrative discussion in the Company\u2019s proxy statement for the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\u201d, 602360=(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Termination of Continuous Service. Unless the Option Agreement otherwise provides, in the event an Optionholder\u2019s Continuous Service terminates, the Optionholder\u2019s Options that have not vested or were not exercisable as of the date of termination shall automatically and without notice terminate and become null and void at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of termination. With regard to those Options that have vested, the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination) but (i) for Incentive Stock Options, only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (A) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Optionholder\u2019s Continuous Service, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement, and (ii) for Nonstatutory Stock Options, only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (A) the date specified in the Option Agreement, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within such time period, the Option shall terminate. Nothing in this Section 6(h) shall restrict the Committee from amending an Incentive Stock Option in order to cause it to be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option., 503272=We made payments to subsidiaries of Oakland Financial Corporation during 2013 in the amount of $245,917 for insurance premiums paid pursuant to agreements to provide insurance coverage to certain of our independent contractors. The underlying agreements are made directly with the independent contractors. The full amount of these payments to the subsidiaries of Oakland Financial Corporation is recouped by us from the independent contractors., 374130=Our 2006 Stock Option Plan provides for an annual grant of a stock option to each of our non-employee directors through 2016. In 2013, each non-employee director received an option to purchase 5,000\u00a0shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Each option is exercisable from its date of grant through the fifth anniversary of that date, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the plan. The exercise price for the options granted to our non-employee directors in 2013 was $10.44 per share., 206621=Section\u00a0162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, imposes a $1\u00a0million limit on the amount that a public company may deduct for compensation paid to the company\u2019s chief executive officer or certain of the company\u2019s other most highly compensated executive officers. This limitation does not apply to compensation that meets the requirements under Section\u00a0162(m) for \u201cqualifying performance-based\u201d compensation (compensation paid only if the individual\u2019s or the company\u2019s performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria approved by the stockholders). We periodically review the potential consequences of Section\u00a0162(m) and may structure some or all of the compensation for our executive officers so that it will not be subject to the deduction limitations of Section\u00a0162(m). None of the compensation paid to our executive officers for 2013 was structured to be \u201cqualifying performance-based\u201d compensation. For 2013, we were not precluded by Section\u00a0162(m) from deducting any compensation that we paid to any of our executive officers., 475854=Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, were audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. In 2013, the Audit Committee selected Grant Thornton LLP as our principal independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2014., 371622=Amounts paid to Mr. Manuel Moroun for 2013 represented payments under his Consulting Agreement with PTSI. The Consulting Agreement was entered into on December 6, 2007, with an initial term of one year and automatic renewals for four additional one-year periods. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Manuel Moroun provided us with consultation and advice as to the management and operation of PTSI, and such other consulting activities as we requested. For the services that Mr. Manuel Moroun rendered pursuant to the agreement, we paid him a consulting fee of $100,000 per year, in quarterly installments. During 2013, the Company renewed this agreement under the same terms and conditions for an additional five-year period., 435557=Although this is an advisory vote which will not be binding on the Compensation and Stock Option Committee or the Board, we will carefully review the results of the vote. The Compensation Committee will consider stockholders\u2019 concerns and take them into account when designing future executive compensation programs. The Board therefore recommends that you indicate your support of the Company\u2019s executive compensation in fiscal year 2013, as outlined in the above resolution., 101833=Norman E. Harned, age 73, retired as Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary of CenTra, Inc. in 2007, after 35 years of service to CenTra and its predecessor companies.

Mr. Harned is a certified public accountant. He has served on the board of directors of Durarock Reinsurance, Ltd., a reinsurance company, since 1985. Mr. Harned became a director of PTSI in March 2014. He currently serves on the Audit Committee. His extensive experience as an executive in the transportation industry and his experience and certification as a professional accountant qualify him to serve on the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee of PTSI., 251075=We have not established a proportion that salary and bonus should be of our executive officers\u2019 total compensation. As indicated in the Summary Compensation Table, the proportion for 2013 that salary and bonus were of total compensation ranged from 87% to 89% for our executive officers., 143452=Our Board of Directors has a policy of encouraging our directors to attend the annual meetings of the stockholders. In 2013, all but one of our then current directors attended the Annual Meeting., 249439=Lance K. Stewart. The Company did not have a written employment agreement with Mr. Stewart during his service as CFO. At the time Mr. Stewart\u2019s resignation became effective, he earned an annual salary of $280,000. Prior to June 3, 2013, Mr. Stewart earned an annual salary of $200,000., 413184=Includes 1,625,877\u00a0shares owned directly, 14,000 options available for exercise, and 3,092,000\u00a0shares held in a trust of which Mr. Matthew Moroun is a co-trustee and a beneficiary (the \u201cMoroun Trust\u201d). Mr. Hal M. Briand is co-trustee with Mr. Matthew Moroun of the Moroun Trust and may therefore also be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by the Moroun Trust. The business address of each of Messrs.\u00a0Moroun and Briand is 12225 Stephens Road, Warren, Michigan 48091., 196354=During April 2012, the Compensation Committee awarded a discretionary cash bonus to Mr. Cushman in the amount of $150,000 and to Mr. Stewart in the amount $50,000. The terms of these bonuses provided that one-half of the bonus amount awarded was paid during April 2012, while the remaining one-half is to be paid at the rate of 12.5% of the bonus amount awarded during each of the next four succeeding years, subject to the executive\u2019s continued employment with the Company., 169810=Daniel H. Cushman. Mr. Cushman, age 59, has served as President and CEO since July 2009. Prior to his employment with the Company, Mr. Cushman served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing for CRST International, Inc. in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (\u201cCRST\u201d) from July 2008 to July 2009, and as Vice President and General Manager of Dedicated Services for CRST from March 2008 to July 2008. From January 2007 to March 2008, Mr. Cushman was Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer for Werner Enterprises in Omaha, Nebraska. From January 2002 to December 2006, he served as Executive Vice President Chief Marketing and Operations Officer for Werner Enterprises., 244209=Mr. West was appointed as Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on June 3, 2013, upon the resignation of Mr. Stewart. Accordingly, the table reflects only Mr. West\u2019s 2013 compensation. Mr. Stewart\u2019s resignation from the Company became effective on September 3, 2013., 155224=The Audit Committee discussed with PTSI\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP (\u201cGrant Thornton\u201d), who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality and the acceptability of our financial reporting and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), including the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee and Grant Thornton also reviewed management\u2019s assessment, which was included in management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting and Grant Thornton\u2019s opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013., 378286=The following table sets forth certain information as of March 31, 2014, regarding beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by: (i)\u00a0each person who is known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our Common Stock; (ii)\u00a0each of our directors; (iii)\u00a0each of the named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table of this annual report; and (iv)\u00a0the total for our current directors and named executive officers as a group., 522178=(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0History. This Plan is an amendment and restatement of P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. 2006 Stock Option Plan, which was adopted by the Board in March 2006 and approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders in May 2006. Should any material provision of this Plan be determined to impair the rights of a Participant under an award granted prior to the Effective Date of this Plan, the award agreement covering the Stock Award shall instead be treated as including the provision as stated in the 2006 Stock Option Plan as an explicit term., 147076=Each current member of the Audit Committee is independent, as independence for audit committee members is defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and the rules of the SEC. From May 2013 to March 2014, as permitted by Rule 5605(c)(2) of the NASDAQ listing standards, the Committee temporarily included one director, Frederick P. Calderone, who is not an independent director as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards. Because Mr. Calderone is employed by CenTra, Inc., a company owned by Matthew T. Moroun, our Chairman of the Board and controlling stockholder, and his father, Manuel J. Moroun, who is also a director of the Company, our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Calderone is not an independent director as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards. Mr. Calderone otherwise meets the criteria for audit committee members under the NASDAQ listing standards and the rules of the SEC. Based on his extensive financial and accounting experience and in order to maintain at least three members on the Audit Committee as required by the NASDAQ listing standards, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company for Mr. Calderone to serve on the Audit Committee following the retirement of two previous members of the Audit Committee effective at our Annual Meeting in 2013 until an additional independent director was elected to our Board of Directors. Mr. Calderone served on the Audit Committee until the appointment of Norman E. Harned to the Committee on March 13, 2014., 402762=Total Outstanding Shares as of March 31, 2014, 194201=During January 2014, as authorized by the Board, the Compensation Committee awarded a discretionary cash bonus to Daniel H. Cushman, our CEO, in the amount of $224,500 and to Allen W. West, our Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer (\u201cCFO\u201d), in the amount of $75,000. The terms of Mr. Cushman\u2019s bonus provided that 30% of the bonus was paid immediately, while the remaining 70% will be paid in equal installments of 17.5% of the bonus amount awarded during each of the next four succeeding years, subject to his continued employment with the Company. The terms of Mr. West\u2019s bonus provided that 46.8% of the bonus was paid immediately, while the remaining 53.2% of the bonus will be paid in equal installments of 13.3% of the bonus amount awarded during each of the next four succeeding years, subject to his continued employment with the Company., 211199=At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we held our first advisory vote on executive compensation, commonly referred to as \u201csay on pay.\u201d Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the \u201csay on pay\u201d resolution presented with more than 99% of the votes cast (excludes abstentions and broker non-votes) voting to approve our executive compensation. The Compensation Committee reviewed these voting results and given the strong level of support, did not make any changes to our executive compensation program or principles in response to the vote. In addition, at our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, over 70% of the shares voted (excludes abstentions and broker non-votes) were in favor of our recommendation to hold the \u201csay on pay\u201d vote every three years. As such, we have included a \u201csay on pay\u201d in this Proxy Statement for consideration and approval at the 2014 Annual Meeting. While the vote is an advisory and non-binding vote, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the voting results to determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results., 225514=2011, 96577=Director Since 2009, 368013=Our CEO and President, Mr.\u00a0Cushman, who is also a director, has been omitted from this table because he receives no additional compensation for serving on our Board of Directors. Mr.\u00a0Cushman\u2019s compensation is included in the Summary Compensation Table. Our current director Mr. Norman E. Harned has also been omitted from this table as he was elected to the Board of Directors in March 2014. Messrs. Conner and Wilkins each retired from the Board of Directors effective May 23, 2013., 407373=The percentages shown are based on the 7,991,613\u00a0shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2014, plus the number of shares that the named person or group has the right to acquire within 60\u00a0days of March\u00a031, 2014. For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of common stock held by each person or group, any shares the person or group has the right to acquire within 60\u00a0days of March\u00a031, 2014 are deemed to be outstanding with respect to such person or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of any other person or group., 517326=2014 AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN, 197158=Upon his resignation in 2013, Mr. Stewart forfeited the remaining $54,750 in unpaid amounts from his 2013 and 2012 bonus awards., 195416=During April 2013, the Compensation Committee awarded a discretionary cash bonus to Mr. Cushman in the amount of $180,000, and to Lance K. Stewart, our then CFO, in the amount of $60,000. The terms of the bonuses provided that 40% of the bonus amount awarded was paid immediately, while the remaining 60% is to be paid at the rate of 15% of the bonus amount awarded during each of the next four succeeding years, subject to the executive\u2019s continued employment with the Company. The Compensation Committee also paid Mr. West, in his prior role with the Company, a one-time discretionary cash bonus of $5,000., 510276=In order for a proposal by a stockholder to be included in the proxy statement at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the proposal must be received at our principal executive office not later than December 18, 2014, the date that is 120 days before the first anniversary of the date of this Proxy Statement. The proposal should be directed to the attention of the Secretary, for consideration for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting. Any such proposals must comply in all respects with the rules and regulations of the SEC., 324287=In November 2013, Messrs. Cushman and West each received restricted shares of our common stock, which vest in equal installments of 20% per year beginning on the first anniversary grant date. In general, the unvested shares are forfeited at the time of termination., 94950=Frederick P. Calderone, age\u00a063, has served as a Vice President of CenTra, Inc. for the past 23\u00a0years.

These experiences qualify him for service on the Board of PTSI., 202097=On November 15, 2013, the Board approved the issuance of restricted shares of our common stock to our executive officers in the amount of 5,000 shares to Mr. Cushman and 1,250 shares to Mr. West.

References in the Plan to any section of the Code shall be deemed to include any amendments or successor provisions to such section and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder., 125484=Compensation Committee. Following the retirement of two of our independent directors effective as of our Annual Meeting in 2013, our Board of Directors elected to appoint our Chairman of the Board and our CEO as the two members of our Compensation Committee based on our status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Compensation Committee met one time in 2013.
