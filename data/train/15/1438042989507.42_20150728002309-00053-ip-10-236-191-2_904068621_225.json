            "Outside of campus and at night it's dangerous. Ypsilanti itself is a dangerous city. But if you take classes during the day and don't wander around by yourself, you'll be safe. There are escort services, and the campus police are helpful.",

Financial cost is something that most usually comes up in conversation, and having friends in class that commute to campus, live on campus, and are either international students attests to, after talking to them, one of the main* reasons they have chosen EMU. Though students should and can heavily place their considerations on choosing an accredited college based on cost, other reasons such as: prestige, location, and accommodations come to mind; by which EMU excels in., 981274=Looking for Scholarships to remain in school at Eastern Michigan University is very difficult, for a single white women there are not any scholarships available. I feel frustrated and concerned that I may not be able to finish my last semester of schooling and I will not be able to graduate in 2014 because of financial poverty., 1075151=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 894093=When I was living in the dorms back in 2008 the quality was not as good as it is now. I'm glad Eastern has raised the quality life greatly concerning re-decorating, food, quality of furniture etc., 296488=Study, work hard and have fun. Set your alarm and don't take classes during times you know you have a hard time getting up for 8:30 for example. Participate in events and browse the clubs. Get involved., 917301=I would say if you can live on campus you should. Your much closer to the social aspect of college life and also avoid the living hell it is to find a parking spot on campus. All the dorms actually on campus after 10 o'clock p.m. (might be sooner now, been awhile since I've lived on campus), have somethings called night watch. People sit outside the entrances to the dorms and request to see your student I.D. If you live in that particular door, you'll have a sticker indicating so, if your not a student at Eastern or your not from that dorm you must be signed in. What I mean by on campus dorms are the student housing options that are actually steps away or in the middle of campus (i.e. the freshman dorms, Wise, Buell, etc..) Off campus housing would be the housing options on the outskirts of campus (i.e. Cornell Courts, The Village, etc...) These housing options to not have night watch. The on campus housing and even The Village try to host small events for the students that live in that particular dorm. Nothing major, but small things to past the time. It's crucial to make friends with those in your dorm and the events help you to mingle with your fellow dorm mates and make new friends., 893575=When I was living in the dorms in 2008 the quality of food was not that good, certain places were better to eat at then others to the palate of food choice was low. Now having experienced the food at Eastern the quality has raised., 324696=you pay a lot for horrible rooms that have needed to be fixed up since 1970 or so.}",

The professors offer a college level challenge, yet are very accessible and more than willing to help if you are having trouble.
