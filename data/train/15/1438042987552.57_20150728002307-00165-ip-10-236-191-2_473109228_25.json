    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6671=However, the utility of recombinantly-produced antibody-based fusion proteins may be limited by their rapid in vivo clearance from the circulation. Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, for example, have been shown to have a significantly lower in vivo circulating half-life than the free antibody. When testing a variety of antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, Gillies et al. reported that all of the fusion proteins tested had an \u03b1 phase (distribution phase) half-life of less than 1.5 hours. Indeed, most of the antibody-based fusion proteins were cleared to 10% of the serum concentration of the free antibody by two hours. See, Gillies et al., BIOCONJ. CHEM. 4: 230-235 (1993). More recently, it was shown that antibody-based fusion proteins with reduced binding affinity for an Fc receptor have enhanced circulating half-lives. It was also shown that a reduced binding affinity for the Fc receptor interfered with some of the antibody effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), but did not interfere with other functions such as complement fixation or antigen binding. See Gillies at al., Cancer Res. 59(9):2159-66 (1999).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34050=This application is a divisional application of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 11/268,191, filed Nov. 7, 2005, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,507,406 on Mar. 24, 2009, which is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/780,668, filed Feb. 9, 2001, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,091,321 on Aug. 15, 2006, which claims priority to, and the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 60/181,768, filed Feb. 11, 2000, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein., 38331=The serum half-life of an antibody is influenced by the ability of that antibody to bind to an Fc receptor (FcR) and to the Fc protection receptor (FcRp). The serum half-life of immunoglobulin fusion proteins is also influenced, for example, by the ability to bind to such receptors (Gillies et al., Cancer Res. 59:2159-66 (1999))., 65075=Methods and compositions of the invention are useful when coadministered with angiogenesis inhibitors such as those disclosed in PCT/US99/08335 (WO 99/52562) or prostaglandin inhibitors such as those disclosed in PCT/US99/08376 (WO 99/53958). Methods and compositions of the invention can also be used in multiple cytokine protein complexes such as those disclosed in PCT/US00/21715. Methods and compositions of the invention are also useful in combination with other mutations disclosed in PCT/US99/03966 (WO 99/43713) that increase the circulating half-life of a fusion protein., 113137=In order to show that the effect of the Lys residue on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody-IL-2 fusion protein was applicable to other cytokines, we chose a different cytokine, TNF\u03b1. The complete cDNA sequence of TNF\u03b1 was published by Nedwin at al. in Nucleic Acids Res. (1985) 13:6361-6373, and the expression of an antibody-TNF\u03b1 also has been described by Gillies at al. in Bioconjugate Chem. (1993) 4:230-235. The fusion junction of the antibody-TNF\u03b1 has the sequence SerProGlyLys-ValArgSerSerSer (SEQ ID NO: 34), where Val is the N-terminal residue of the mature TNF\u03b1. In order to compare with huKS-TNF\u03b1, DNA encoding huKS-(deleted Lys)-TNF\u03b1 was constructed by an overlapping PCR method [Daugherty at al., (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19:2471-2476] with mutagenic primers encoding the deletion of the Lys residue. The resultant expression vector for huKS-(deleted Lys)-TNF\u03b1 therefore encodes the peptide sequence SerProGly-ValArgSerSerSer (SEQ ID NO: 35) at the fusion junction. Additional modifications of this fusion protein according to the new invention might include the removal of the Arg residue in the amino terminal sequence of TNF to further reduce the overall charge of the junction region., 35949=Proteins can be joined together through either chemical or genetic manipulation using methods known in the art. See, for example, Gillies et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1428-1432 (1992); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,150., 69238=The expression vector for immunocytokines was described in Gillies at al., (1998) J. Immunol. 160:6195-6203. In the human gamma-1 gene encoding the heavy chain, the XmaI restriction site located 280 bp upstream of the translation stop codon was destroyed by introducing a silent mutation (TCC to TCA). Another silent mutation (TCT to TCC) was introduced to the Ser codon three residues upstream of the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain to create the sequence TCC CCG GGT AAA (SEQ ID No. 3), which contains a new XmaI site [Lo at al, (1998) Protein Engineering 11:495-500]. The IL-2 cDNA was constructed by chemical synthesis and it contains a new and unique PvuII restriction site [Gillies at al., (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 89:1428-1432]. Both the XmaI and PvuII sites are unique in the expression vector, and they facilitated mutagenesis of the lysine codon which lies at the junction of the CH3 and the IL-2 DNA.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Each of the patent documents and scientific publications disclosed herein is incorporated by reference into this application in its entirety. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The foregoing embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects illustrative rather than limiting on the invention described herein. Scope of the invention is thus indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. EQUIVALENTS For example, an expression construct encoding a fusion protein containing part or all of an antibody is mutagenized. Clones are generated, the corresponding proteins are expressed, and the proteins are tested, either individually or in small pools, for relative sensitivity to proteases. Variant antibody fusion proteins with enhanced resistance to proteases are then tested for their pharmacokinetic properties, and a significant number of the protease-resistant antibody fusion protein variants have improved pharmacokinetic properties. The nucleic acids encoding the improved variant fusion proteins are sequenced, and some improved variants are found to contain mutations at sites other than the fusion protein junction that cause the phenotype of enhanced resistance to proteolysis and improved pharmacokinetics. It is also useful to use extracellular proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, other",
