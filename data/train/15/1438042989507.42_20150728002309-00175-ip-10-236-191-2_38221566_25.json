For the past two weeks IBBW has tempted fate by running away with the CK Award, only to be curiously rewarded with a string of impressive and/or dramatic 'Nova wins and now a cushy 3-seed for the 'Cats at home in Philadelphia. So we'll see if (or when) IBBW gets the usual brand of CK Award-based comeuppance, but you should know this: the last time 'Nova received a 3 seed in the East Region was 1995, when the Kerry Kittles-led 'Cats went down to 14th-seeded Old Dominion in three overtimes. Just sayin'., 190346=Tennessee blog Rocky Top Talk thinks this is only fair: LSU is for real, kids. The Tigers won a double overtime war against Mississippi State in a week where they moved to 9-1 in conference and continued to put a stranglehold on the rest of the SEC. Don't forget that some of these kids were on the team that played in the 2006 Final Four., 73122=Ain't it, though? Naturally, we here at the BlogPoll are celebrating the onset of Championship Week and March Madness by issuing our final poll of the regular season, which goes like so:, 48132=So, how much stock do you put in conference tournament performance? If you put a whole lot of stock in it, you've probably got the marathon men from Syracuse pretty high up the ballot after last week's theatrics. If not, maybe you still see the same bunch of Orangemen that lost 7 of 10 from mid-January to mid-February. And so Syracuse stands atop this week's standard deviation chart., 209041=On the other side of the Spectrum, St. John's blog East Coast Bias left his top eight--including all three of Duke, Wake, and Clemson--unchanged. To his credit, he explains that he doesn't yet feel comfortable with any of the teams who would take the Blue Devils' or Deomon Deacons' places ... but when we're talking about one team that hasn't won in regulation in two weeks and another that hasn't won on the road since Jan. 17 despite shots at two of the ACC's worst three teams, it's time for a shake-up., 51782=After a few weeks away from the poll, Arizona St. blog House of Sparky returns to vote LSU No. 11, Duke No. 14, Clemson No. 15, and Dayton No. 18 to earn this week's Mr. Bold award. While we're (sort of) on the topic of LSU and where they should be ranked, here's a Fun Fact: Northwestern finished with as many RPI top-50 wins as the the SEC's three NCAA entrants combined. Ladies and gentlemen, your 2009 Southeastern Conference!, 151581=Whoopsie: March to Madness accidentally voted Michigan rather than Michigan St. No. 8 in their Week 3 ballot, and when you drop your No. 8 team out of your ballot entirely the following week you tend to rack up the swing points. We do strive for accuracy here at the BlogPoll, but I think we can also forgive March to Madness this one particular mistake, seeing as it came on the heels of his SDSU Aztecs' 26-point horse-whipping at the hands of New Mexico. I think any of us would be a little unsteady after that., 224059=#BlogTeam Avg Error 1 Tomahawk Nation Florida St. 5.18 2 Notes From A Basketball Junkie Buffalo 4.27 3 From Old Virginia Virginia 3.58 4 March Madness All Season Connecticut 3.49 5 Rock Chalk Talk Kansas 3.20, 70033=Remember what I said about some voters not putting much stock in conference tournaments? Safe to say that's how Max at Inside Creighton Hoops feels after leaving his top nine teams unchanged from last week. I might say something here about how maybe we shouldn't put that little stock in Championship Week results, but this is a guy for whom seeing Arizona pop up on the Selection Show \"was like getting punched in the stomach by 1985 Dolph Lundgren.\" I think we can cut him some slack., 126929=Elsewhere, though, there were some compelling arguments against the Huskies. Rocky Top Talk says: I'm highly opposed to dropping Pitt back behind UConn despite their loss to Providence this week, being that they just beat the Huskies on the road by eight points two weeks ago. Well, yeah, there is that one little thing, I guess. East Coast Bias keeps the Huskies out of the top spot for more aesthetic reasons: I watch U Conn and I really think they lack that ability to crush hearts. Perhaps I am trying to envision them as the Khalid El-Amin/ Rip Hamilton/ Jake Voskuhl Huskies or the Caron Butler/ Emeka Okafor (was Ben Gordon on that squad?) Huskies and I see the Josh Boone/ Marcus Williams/ Rudy Gay Huskies. To quote Eminem, \u201cyour style is like dying in my sleep/ I don\u2019t feel it.\u201d The problem with keeping UConn our of the top spot is ... who do you replace them with? While a handful of voters resisted Memphis due to their C-USA ties and early-season struggles--I Bleed Blue and White among them--those who did vote for the Tigers brought plenty of ammunition to back their opinions up. Tomahawk Nation : (T)hey have the longest winning streak in the country. They have the best defense in the country. Their only 3 losses in the season were in late November and early December to Xavier, Georgetown and Syracuse.\u00a0 Since then, they have beaten Cincinnati, UAB, Gonzaga, Tennessee, Tulsa...as well as everyone else they have played. Next up, Maize N' Brew : Yes, I have Memphis ranked #1 because, uh, who else should it be?\u00a0 They've won 20 in a row, rock a #1 KenPom rank, and everyone else from a power-conference seems hell-bent on losing a head scratcher. Of course, this is where the \"Conference USA\" thing comes in: full credit to Memphis for obliterating C-USA and leaving nothing but skidmarks and confetti in their wake, but head-scratchers are a lot easier to avoid when your \"easy\" road trips are to dead zones like Southern Miss and SMU instead of Providence or Maryland. Is there an easy answer to this kind of voting conundrum? No, no there is not., 43465=One is Memphis, who ground C-USA under their heel for the third straight year but still has its doubters because it's, well, the C-USA. For North Carolina, it's true that the January losses to Wake Forest and Boston College are becoming increasingly distant memories ... but the sight of Ty Lawson on the bench during the ACC tournament while the Tar Heels flailed against Va. Tech and Florida St. is not. Whither the Heels? BC Interruption votes UNC No. 1 and provides the positive spin: We think North Carolina is the best team in the country, despite their semifinals loss to Florida State. With Lawson back for the NCAAs, they should represent the ACC in the tournament well., 108535=This is the second straight win for March to Madness in the Mr. Manic-Depressive category, but this week our resident Aztec fan isn't so much manic-depressive as merely willing to react to on-court events in a week where many voters held their ground. The biggest drop on their ballot belongs to LSU, who went from No. 12 to out--harsh, but fair in my opinion, given that we're talking about two blowout losses to teams outside current NCAA projections. Arizona St. up 11 is a little extreme in a week in which ASU lost to Stanford at home, but this is still the lowest total to win Mr. Manic-Depressive in our four weeks of \"competition.\", 191528=Sadly, most of the Interwebs' SEC guys probably missed this taunt while they were busy looking up their team's 2010 football recruits' status on Facebook. Frankly, at this point the conference--and its collective one team in the Pomeory ratings' top-30 , wobbly Kentucky--should be approached much as we would approach a mid-major league; LSU's dominance deserves some kind of recognition, but exactly how much is going to have to be left in the eye of the beholder until the league can right itself., 163351=It's a shame, really. BracketBusters weekend is supposed to be a celebration of all things mid-major, an opportunity for mid-majordom's leading lights to impress the college basketball populace with big, impressive victories on their all-too-brief national stage. As you can see, it didn't work out that way in 2009, as coming off of their road disemboweling of Davidson the Butler Bulldogs saw their poll position ... drop two spots, thanks to their ill-advised two-game losing streak entering BracketBusters. Elsewhere, Dayton's toast after losing at Saint Louis, Utah St.'s an afterthought in the wake of a road defeat at Patty Mills-less St. Mary's, and don't even bother asking about Davidson, thanks. From Old Virginia explains: I really really really wanted to include teams like Dayton, Butler, and Siena. Mid-majors definitely got the shaft this week. But it's impossible to ignore the absurdly low formula rankings of teams like Dayton and Siena, and more importantly it's also tough to ignore that Butler and Dayton suffered some bad losses this week. Elsewhere, Friarblog says what I think just about everyone was thinking: Hey other BlogPoll voters\u2026.raise your hand if you considered dropping out Illinois completely out of your poll for the sole fact that they only scored 33 points in their loss to Penn State. There's your call, and I Bleed Blue and White has your response: Illinois , you are gone. Probably forever. 33 points in the entire game ? Good Lord. As you can see, the Illini did enough in the win yesterday at Ohio St. to keep too many people from applying what we might call the Rule of 33, but I don't think they'd want to take their chances again.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Mr. Bold First up are \"Mr. Bold\" and \"Mr. Numb Existence.\" The former goes to the voter with the ballot most divergent from the poll at large. The number you see is the average difference between a person's opinion of a team and the poll's opinion. Ballot Math So, how much stock do you put in conference tournament performance? If you put a whole lot of stock in it, you've probably got the marathon men from Syracuse pretty high up the ballot after last week's theatrics. If not, maybe you still see the same bunch of Orangemen that lost 7 of 10 from mid-January to mid-February.
