            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOVING THREADS IN A SHARED PROCESSOR PARTITIONING ENVIRONMENT - The present invention provides a computer implemented method and apparatus to assign software threads to a common virtual processor of a data processing system having multiple virtual processors. A data processing system detects cooperation between a first thread and a second thread with respect to a lock associated with a resource of the data processing system. Responsive to detecting cooperation, the data processing system assigns the first thread to the common virtual processor. The data processing system moves the second thread to the common virtual processor, whereby a sleep time associated with the lock experienced by the first thread and the second thread is reduced below a sleep time experienced prior to the detecting cooperation step.",

The complementary doping methods generally involve inducing a first and second chemical reaction in at least a first and second portion, respectively, of a dopant source, which has been disposed on a thin film of a semiconductor or semimetal material. The chemical reactions result in the introduction of an n-type dopant, a p-type dopant, or both from the dopant source to each of the first and second portions of the thin film of the semiconductor or semimetal. Ultimately, the methods produce at least one n-type and at least one p-type region in the thin film of the semiconductor or semimetal. 20110127638 Published Description Patent application number Kevin Andrew Brenner, Alpharetta, GA US 01-12-2012 KindCat Tidy Box - A box for cat elimination use that simplifies clean-up, features only eco-friendly components, and is not expensive. The design includes 3 parts: box, trays and pad. The 12\u00d718 wax coated cardboard box is sturdy and long lasting, and with proper use may not need replacing indefinitely. The waxed lift-out tray is a single design with handles on each short end, and is used on 2 levels inside the box: the lower lift-out tray (#1) is used to hold a reusable, washable, absorbent, compostable wool pad; the upper tray (#2) provides the animal's usage surface. The trays",

Brenner, Austin, TX US Larry Bert Brenner, Austin, TX US Patent application number Description Published 20080235686 Method and apparatus for improving thread posting efficiency in a multiprocessor data processing system - A computer implemented method, a data processing system, and computer usable program code for improving thread posting efficiency in a multiprocessor data processing system are provided. Aspects of the present invention first receive a set of threads from an application. The aspects of the present invention then group the set of threads with a plurality of processors based on a last execution of the set of threads on the plurality of processors to form a plurality of groups. The threads in each group in the plurality of groups are all last executed on a same processor. The aspects of the present invention then wake up the threads in the plurality of groups in any order. 09-25-2008 20080271029 Thread Scheduling with Weak Preemption Policy - Thread scheduling with a weak preemption policy is provided. The scheduler receives requests from newly ready work. The scheduler adds a \u201cpreempt value\u201d to the current work's priority so that it is somewhat increased for preemption",
