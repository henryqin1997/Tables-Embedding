            "Freshman dorms are typical. Upperclassman dorms are apartment style. Sometimes the security can get annoying and tedious, but it's effective.",

            "There's no city like Boston to go to school. The coop program can't be beat, and there's nothing like it. The classes, professors, student life, etc are the best around.",
            "This a a great school with more opportunities for students than any other. The professors and classes at this school are top-notch. Student life is awesome and there's always something going on."

To this end, there is also a great deal of resources that are available to assist with skill strengthening. Also, be prepared to take at least 3 courses in English, regardless of your major or ultimate study plan--it's a core requirement as of Fall 2013., 239339=The best benefit to a Northeastern education is the co-op program, by far. Take advantage of all of Boston's numerous employment opportunities, mingle with the Ivy kids around the corner, and feel secure in knowing that you've got the experience that counts in the job field. The biggest complaint? Particularly for people who value the small-campus experience, the undergrad class size is a little large for all of your teachers to know you by name. Still, the 14:1 student-teacher ratio is better than what you'd find elsewhere, by far., 690362=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 623930=In October we do an Underwear Run where anyone who wants to can strip down to just their underwear and run down the middle of Massachusetts Avenue and the Prudential Center. The school sanctions it, and it is a BLAST!!, 598842=We hold a naked marathon every year in October. The terrace at the Curry Student Center in the spring time is absolutely gorgeous., 103553=I love Northeastern, I have made so many friends since September and I did not know one person when I arrived. I love the city of Boston, and the campus it so pretty to be located in the middle of a city. There is always something going on on campus. The only set back is that Boston does not have the greatest under 21 night-life., 167454=Unusual tradition I have witnessed so far is the underwear run in the middle of October when it's freezing out. The amazing thing is that almost everyone participates in it that the cops have to show up just in case there are riots., 500022=The underwear run happens once a year during Parents' weekend, usually end of October, just before Halloween. On a Friday night, a huge portion of the student population gathers outside of the freshman quad in ridiculous outfits. Some students go all out with costumes and themed groups, while others decide to run in sports bras and spandex shorts. It is a great and fun tradition that shows our goofiness and lets everyone have a good time running around the streets of Boston, all around campus, and through the halls of the Prudential center to show our school pride., 228961=The underwear run! It happens in November during parents weekend. Also, the secret of Northeastern! (if you stand in the middle of the science quad and whisper, you can hear yourself as if you were speaking into your own ear!)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The school is expensive because it is a private school. However, it is comforting to see that they are using our tuition money wisely. Recently they built, a brand new dormitory and dining hall. Not to mention the numerous campus building they just rebuilt and updated. The expenses are also made worth it by the fact that the degree and resume you will graduate with from here is unlike any other college. Due to Northeastern's Coop program, you can make money to pay for tuition while receiving college credit and boosting your resume with job experience. The COOP program alone makes the hefty tuition worth the bang for the buck. Am enjoying being here I love being here. I can not help but brag to visiting high school students how underestimated Northeastern truly is in comparison to other colleges. Everyone who goes here is so proud to be a Northeastern husky. Students, including myself, always brag about our beautiful campus located in the city of Boston, the same campus, our great hockey team, the awesome people, the fun parties, and the overall excitement on campus. Its hard to not love it here. My only reason for holding back one star is that the winters in Boston, MA are very harsh and cold. If you are not prepared for brutal winds",
