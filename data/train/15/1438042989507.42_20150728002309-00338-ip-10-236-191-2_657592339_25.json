From a technical point of view (browserscope), both browsers have network similar capabilities \u2013 both browsers can load from 6 hosts at once and have a maximum of 35 connections open at one time. Summary results Chrome vs Ie8 Homepage testing \u2013 20mbit network connection 10 fastest homepages 10 worst optimised homepages 10 top optimised homepages I\u2019ve created a mini-test of 40 New Zealand homepages. I\u2019ve split the test into 4 tests of download performance, that represent a cross-section of the best and the worst that NZ homepages have to offer. Recently, Gomez released information that Google Chrome was the fastest browser from real world testing. That got me thinking, how does Chrome compare to IE8 for New Zealand webpages. For most websites, IE8 is the most popular browser, so it will be an interesting piece of research. Introduction August 30th, 2011 NZ Homepage Drag Race \u2013 Chrome vs IE8 \u2013 which is faster ?

There was some \u201cglitches\u201d where IE8 was faster by a couple of seconds eg. On Geekzone.co.nz, IE8 loaded the page 2 secs faster than Chrome. IE8 and Chrome were more evenly matched for the top optimised pages. For DSL speed, it was a tie 5-5 between Chrome and IE8, 20mbit it was 7-3 in favour of Chrome.
