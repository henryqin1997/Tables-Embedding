DHCP protocol information is carried inside of BOOTP packets. To enable BOOTP broadcast forwarding for a set of clients, configure an IPv4 helper address on the networking device interface physically closest to the client. The IPv4 helper address should specify the address of the DHCP server. If you have multiple servers, you can configure one IPv4 helper address for each server. Because BOOTP packets are forwarded by default, DHCP information can now be forwarded by the networking device. The DHCP server now receives broadcasts from the DHCP clients., 199476=All prefixes configured on interfaces that originate IPv6 router advertisements are advertised with a valid lifetime of 2592000 seconds (30 days) and a preferred lifetime of 604800 seconds (7 days), and with both the \u201conlink\u201d and \u201cautoconfig\u201d flags set., 218326=seconds : 1800 seconds, 159620=The interval between the sending of duplicate address detection neighbor solicitation messages (the duplicate address detection timeout interval) is specified by the neighbor discovery-related variable RetransTimer (as specified in RFC\u00a02461, Neighbor Discovery for IP Version\u00a06 [IPv6]), which is used to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when the address is being resolved or when the reachability of a neighbor is being probed. This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Use the ipv6 nd ns-interval command to configure the interval between neighbor solicitation messages that are sent during duplicate address detection., 146821=MTU in bytes. Range is 1280 to 65535 for IPv6 packets. The maximum MTU size that can be set on an interface depends on the interface medium., 178163=Interval (in milliseconds) between IPv6 neighbor solicit transmissions.
