The files named with .rec suffixes contain these signals in EDF format. Three-channel Holter ECGs (V5, CC5, V5R) were recorded using a Reynolds Lifecard CF system (Reynolds Medical, UK); the files named with _lifecard.edf suffixes contain these ECG signals in EDF format. The recording dates and times are not available. In record ucddb002, only two distinct ECG signals were recorded; the second ECG signal was also used as the third signal.
