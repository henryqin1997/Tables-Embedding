Gross profit for the six months ended February 28, 2006 was $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million for the comparable period in the prior year. \u00a0, 245691=On December 30, 2005, 1,435,897 Series II Preference Share warrants were exercised at a subscription price of US$0.50 per share for total proceeds of US$ 717,948., 160486=Vancouver Office - 1710 Columbia Street, 2nd Floor, Vancouver, BC V5Y 3C6 Tel: (604) 681-9308 Fax: (604) 688-3977, 520345=Pursuant to the conversion instrument, 336,000\u00a0Common Shares, which represent the number of shares that could be issued for the obligation of US$1,075,000, had previously been reserved for issuance. At February 28, 2006 and August 31, 2005 the obligation to Comerica is valued at $142,000., 254445=During the six months ended February 28, 2006, the Company paid $95,000 (2005 - $90,000) to a company controlled by a shareholder, director and officer of the Company \u00a0\u00a0for executive services rendered. These expenditures are reflected in the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses., 437969=\u00a02005, 513006=Pursuant to the reorganization, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary PAPDC became the owner of substantially all of the assets and business (collectively, the pre-existing assets) that the Company owned immediately prior to January\u00a020, 2003, the date of the reorganization. The pre-existing assets consisted principally of accounts and loans receivable, film and television programming rights, and all shares and other securities (including intercompany loans) held by the Company in its subsidiaries existing at January\u00a020, 2003., 150289=This form shall be used by foreign private issuers which are required to furnish reports pursuant to Rule 13a-16 or 15d-16 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 368047=February 28, 158547=I hereby confirm that the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Management Discussion and Analysis for the results for six months ended February 28, 2006 were sent by first class mail to the registered shareholders and the shareholders of the supplemental mailing list of Peace Arch Entertainment Group Inc. on the above date., 231846=2005, 212896=Motion Picture revenue for the period ended February 28, 2006 was $1.2 million representing a decrease of $2.2 million, or a 64% decrease compared to revenue of $3.4 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2005. The decrease in revenues primarily reflects the lower number of projects produced by Peace Arch and is associated with the Company's strategy to prioritize the packaging, financing, and distribution of projects. \u00a0This strategy results in lower presale revenues at the time a project is completed and delivered. During the six months ended February 28, 2006, the Company did not take delivery of any motion pictures. The revenues for the six month period arose from sales of distribution rights on programs completed and delivered in prior years., 521965=Subsequent to the reorganization of PAPDC described in note\u00a011(a), on August 1, 2003, the Company sold all of its shares in PAPDC for nominal consideration. During the year ended August 31, 2003, the operating results of PAPDC were included in the consolidated financial statements until the date of the disposal., 246207=As at February 28, 2006, the Company had available cash or cash equivalents of $0.7 million. \u00a0The Company borrows funds from banks and other financial institutions to finance the costs of production which are generally incurred in advance of contracted receipts and revenues from these programs. The Company typically finances the capitalized costs of its proprietary film and television programming through presales from customers, borrowings from bank facilities for individual production financing, government tax incentives, contributions from co-producers and working capital deployed as interim financing to contracted receipts. In the past, the Company has also funded capital requirements through the issuance of shares, warrants and debt. \u00a0The Company has a term loan and a letter of credit provided by a financial institution due on July 30, 2006. \u00a0Upon mutual agreement between the Company and the lender, the financing may be extended for a period of six months. \u00a0The Company is currently identifying various financing alternatives to enable the timely discharge of the Company's obligations. \u00a0Management will work toward funding capital requirements through the issuance of shares, warrants and debt, but there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its financing efforts or the extension granted., 611915=2009, 423986=operating results of Peace Arch Project Development Corp. (\"PAPDC\"). As described in note\u00a011(a), \u00a0\u00a0PAPDC is the owner of the Company's assets and business in existence prior to the reorganization and \u00a0\u00a0rationalization of its assets, operations and subsidiaries. Following the sale of PAPDC to a third party as \u00a0\u00a0described in note\u00a012 the Company continued to have a variable interest in PAPDC, and it had been \u00a0\u00a0determined that the Company was required to absorb the majority of the expected losses of PAPDC. Under \u00a0\u00a0the rules governing AcG-15, the Company was considered the primary beneficiary of PAPDC and \u00a0\u00a0consequently the Company consolidated PAPDC on a retroactive basis effective December 1, 2004, \u00a0\u00a0without restatement of prior periods., 619541=February 28, 474612=Of the loans outstanding there is $15,197,000 (August 31, 2005 - $8,498,000) denominated in United States dollars. Loans from various banks bear interest at rates ranging from the respective bank's United States dollar base lending rate or the LIBOR rate plus 1% to plus 3.75%. The Company has several loans outstanding from other parties which bear interest at the rate of 0% to 1.5% per month of the principal balance outstanding plus a premium payable at date of repayment. Loans denominated in Canadian dollars bear interest at rates ranging from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's prime lending rate plus 1% to plus 2% or the Royal Bank's prime lending rate plus 2%., 255679=As at February 28, 2006, the Company was owed $nil (2005 - $167,000) from a company controlled by a shareholder, director and officer of the Company. This amount \u00a0\u00a0is included in accounts and other receivables., 551396=The Company has recorded stock compensation expense for the stock options granted to employees in the amount of $243,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended February 28, \u00a0\u00a02006 (2005 - $220,000). The Company incurred stock based compensation of $17,000 which was included \u00a0\u00a0as part of the purchase price of kaBOOM as described in note 9. The fair value of each stock option was \u00a0\u00a0estimated on the date of vesting using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following \u00a0\u00a0assumptions:, 556972=On December 30, 2005, 1,435,897 Series II Preference Share warrants were exercised at a subscription price of US $0.50 per share for total proceeds of US $717,948., 519234=The Company issued a conversion instrument to Fremantle which permitted Fremantle to convert the amount of its outstanding debt including unpaid accrued interest at December 31, 2004, if any, into Common Shares of the Company for a period of 90\u00a0days commencing on December\u00a031, 2004. On March 31, 2005 Fremantle agreed to convert its $8,793,000 note plus interest for 2,931,125 shares of the Company's common stock., 445467=August 31, 2005, 419833=Restatement of the Three Months Ended February 28, 2005, 609183=2006, 659900=During the six months ended February 28, 2006, the Company paid $95,000 (2005 - $90,000) to a company controlled by a shareholder, director and officer of the Company for executive services rendered. These expenditures are reflected in the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses., 259490=As at February 28, 2006, the Company's financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, restricted term deposits, accounts and other receivables, corporate loan, production loans, revenue guarantee obligation, business acquisition obligation and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying values of the restricted term deposits and the revenue guarantee obligations approximate fair value as the interest rates are reflective of current market rates as at February 28, 2006. The carrying value of the business acquisition obligation to issue shares reflects fair value as it is reported at the fair value of the shares at February 28, 2006. The carrying value of the remaining financial instruments approximated their fair value due to their ability for prompt liquidation or short term to maturity., 228166=Other Amortization. \u00a0\u00a0For the six months ended February 28, 2006, other amortization consisting of amortization of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets amounted to $90,000 compared to $27,000 for the comparable period of the prior year, representing a $63,000 increase. This increase is due primarily to amortization of $45,000 for intangible assets. In the comparable period of fiscal 2005, the Company did not have amortization related to intangible assets., 444764=February 28, 2006, 160716=Los Angeles Office - 228 Main Street, Suite 14, Venice, CA 90291 Tel: (310) 450-1711 Fax: (310) 581-8040, 601139=On October\u00a02, 2001, the Company initiated an action against Viacom, Inc., MTV Networks, VH1 Music First et al in British Columbia Supreme Court for damages in the amount of US$2,750,000 and consequential damages arising from the Defendants' failure to honour a contract for the co-financing of the television series Big Sound. During the year ended August\u00a031, 2003, the subsidiary which initiated the action was sold as described in note\u00a011. During the year ended August\u00a031, 2005 the subsidiary was reacquired as part of the acquisition of PAPDC (see note\u00a012)., 177923=On March 31, 2005, Fremantle agreed to convert its $8,793,000 note plus interest for 2,931,125 shares of the Company's common stock. \u00a0As a result of Fremantle's conversion the Company has recognized a gain on settlement of the obligation to issue shares of $1,105,000 representing the difference between the carrying amount of the obligation and the price of the Company's stock on the date of settlement., 618383=Selected information for the Company's operating segments for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005, net of intercompany amounts, is as follows:, 282391=2005, 231288=February, 232363=May 31,, 523868=PAPDC was considered a VIE under AcG-15 and was therefore consolidated from December\u00a01, 2004 as described in note\u00a02. On consolidation, the distribution obligation and associated distribution rights to all the film and television programming rights, as described above, were eliminated, as the liability to Fremantle and Comerica was also recorded within PAPDC and the investment in film balance existed in PAPDC. The Company then applied the purchase method to include PAPDC's assets, liabilities and retained earnings in its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidated an investment in film and television balance of $1,681,000, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $474,000 and the liability to Fremantle of $1,467,000., 515135=Effective January 30, 2003, the Company and Fremantle agreed to restructure the remaining $7,580,000 of term loan due to Fremantle. Fremantle agreed that the revised source of debt repayments and security would be restricted to the business, assets, and undertakings of the Company as they existed immediately prior to January\u00a030, 2003 (the pre-existing assets), that date being the closing of the acquisition and financing transactions described elsewhere in this note. The new debt had no fixed repayment dates. Interest, which continued to accrue at 10% per annum, and principal were payable from the income, 191768=Television revenue for the period ended February 28, 2006 was $0.7 million representing a decrease of $0.6 million from $1.3 million for the comparable period of the prior year or a 46% decrease compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is mainly attributable to the recognition on 13 episodes of a television series during the quarter compared to revenue recognized on 26 episodes of two television series in the comparable period of the prior year., 485478=At August 31, 2002, the Company continued to occupy the second property through an operating lease arrangement. As the present value of the minimum lease payments was greater than the gain on the sale of $523,000, the gain was deferred and amortized over the four-year minimum lease term. During the year ended August 31, 2003, the Company amortized $127,000 of the deferred gain prior to disposal of the subsidiary in which the gain was recorded (PAPDC)., 437436=2006, 245208=On January 23, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of kaBOOM, the Company issued 1,764,118 common shares of the Company for proceeds of $0.8 million, net of issuance costs. The value of the common shares issued was $0.44 or $0.48, which was based on and determined by the average of the Company's common stock trading price for the 10 day period prior to the date of acquisition., 179654=2006, 250861=Production loan repayments are solely due from cash flows derived from each film and is independently secured by a charge over all the assets of the production subsidiary and the exploitation rights, tax credits and subsidies associated with each film. \u00a0Management expects that a significant portion of the loans due at February 28, 2006 will be payable over the next year. \u00a0The Company has total loan and credit facilities of $11.4 million which are due for annual renewal in the current fiscal year. \u00a0The Company obtained extensions in the past since the timing of collection of receipts and revenue streams may extend beyond the original estimated date. \u00a0Management seeks renewals and extensions of the individual production loan facilities and is confident that such an agreement will be achievable. \u00a0However, there is no assurance the Company will be successful. \u00a0, 661159=As at February 28, 2006, the Company was owed $nil (2005 - $167,000) from a company controlled by a shareholder, director and officer of the Company. This amount is included in accounts and other receivables., 184797=During fiscal 2005, the Company adopted AcG-15, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as more fully described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. This change in accounting policy was applied on a retroactive basis effective December 1, 2004 without restatement of prior periods. This resulted in a cumulative increase of the Company's deficit in the amount of $53,000., 187417=Three Months Ended February 28,, 203922=Interest Income. \u00a0\u00a0Interest income was $0.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2006, compared to $0.3 million for the same period of the prior year. \u00a0Interest revenue represents interest earned on the Restricted Term Deposit. This interest revenue is offset by interest expense of the same amount recorded in respect of the Film Financing Obligation., 186442=Revenue. The Company reported revenue of $3.7 million for the three month period ended February 28, 2006 compared to $1.7 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2005 representing an increase of $2.0 million or 118% increase compared to the same period of the prior year. The following table presents revenues earned for each of our business segments;, 187936=2006, 368714=2006, 241950=During the year ended August 31, 2005, the Company identified a required revision to its second quarter February 28, 2005 financial statements related to its accounting treatment of a complex arrangement with Showtime for the project \"Our Fathers.\" \u00a0We have determined the arrangement was in the nature of a co-financing relationship where both parties contributed financially to the production. \u00a0Under GAAP, the co-financier's contribution to the project is considered a reduction of the film's negative costs. \u00a0Previously, the co-financier's contribution to the production was recognized as revenue by the Company from sale of rights. \u00a0The cost of the Company's investment in its film assets is similarly reduced., 270018=Additional financial information is provided in the Company's consolidated financial statements for its 2005 fiscal year and the Six Months ended February 28, 2006., 185739=For the three months ended February 28, 2006, the Company has reported a loss of $0.7 million or $0.04 diluted loss per share compared to a loss of $0.5 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2005 or $0.03 diluted loss per share., 326211=February 28, 221351=Selling, General and Administrative Expense. \u00a0Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1.1 million, or 65.2%, to $2.7 million for the six months ended February 28, 2006 from $1.6 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This increase was mainly due to additional costs associated with the new home entertainment business that has been incurred from the date of the kaBOOM acquisition compared to the comparable period of the prior year. During the six months ended February 28, 2006 there was no recovery of selling, general and administrative expenses as the time period over which the Company was entitled to recover such expenses associated with managing certain assets to realize cashflows to retire the Fremantle debt had ended in fiscal 2005. The following table presents the comparative net selling, general and administrative costs for the last two comparable periods; \u00a0, 177247=I Preference Share and one Series II Preference Share warrant for proceeds of $2,349,000 or US$0.46 per Unit. Each warrant, upon exercise, entitles the holder to acquire one Series II Preference Share at a price of US$ 0.50 at any time up to July 29, 2009. Each Series I and Series II Preference Share is convertible into one Common Share of the Company. Each outstanding Series I and II Preference Share pays a 10% cumulative dividend on a quarterly basis. At August 31, 2005 all the Series II Preference Share warrants remained outstanding., 231673=November, 489130=On January 23, 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of kaBOOM! Entertainment Inc. (kaBOOM), a home entertainment studio in Canada that distributes videocassettes, digital video discs and ancillary merchandise to retailers and mass merchandisers in Canada. \u00a0\u00a0The cost of the purchase was $7,127,000 consisting of 1,033, 058 common shares of the Company valued at $500,000, 50,000 options of the Company valued at $17,000, cash consideration of $3,000,000, future cash consideration of $3,202,000 and direct costs of the acquisition of $408,000. \u00a0The fair value of the common shares issued of $0.48 per share was determined based on the date the transaction was announced as having been completed. \u00a0The options, which are fully vested, entitle the holder to acquire shares of the Company at an exercise price of $0.41. \u00a0 The agreement provides for payment of a maximum additional consideration of $1,000,000 based on kaBOOM's achieving certain results of operations for the twelve months ending April 30, 2006. \u00a0The additional consideration, if any, will be recognized when the results of operations for the twelve months ending April 30, 2006 have been determined and the additional consideration becomes payable. \u00a0Any additional consideration paid will be included as a cost of the purchase, resulting in additional goodwill. \u00a0The future cash consideration of $3,202,000 will be due when the final determination of any contingent consideration due has been made. The obligations to settle the future cash consideration and any contingent consideration are supported by letters of credit amounting to $4,202,000 which have been provided by a financial institution and certain of the preferred shareholders. Any portion of the letters of credit drawn would result in a loan payable by the Company to those parties providing the letters of credit. \u00a0The loan resulting from the drawdown of the financial institution letter of credit would bear interest at 12% per annum and be due on July 30, 2006. \u00a0Any loan resulting from the drawdown of the letters of credit provided by the preferred shareholders would bear interest at the prime rate plus 12% per annum and be due on demand. \u00a0The letter of credit from the financial institution and a portion of the letters of credit available from the preferred shareholders totalling $2,401,000 are available to be drawn at any time to July 30, 2006. \u00a0The remaining $1,801,000 letters of credit are available to be drawn on or after June 15, 2006. \u00a0In addition, the financial institution provided financing of $3,500,000 as described further in note 5. \u00a0 In conjunction with the provision of financing described in the preceding paragraph, the Company incurred aggregate costs of $716,000 consisting of 731,060 common shares with a fair value of $325,000 issued to the financial institution, $108,000 which is payable in cash or common shares issuable to the preferred shareholders at the option of the Company and other fees and costs payable in cash of $283,000. \u00a0These costs will be amortized over the term of the loan and lines of credit. The Company also paid certain share issuance costs amounting to $25,000 which have been charged to capital stock. The acquisition of kaBOOM has been accounted for by the purchase method and the results of operations of kaBOOM have been included since January 23, 2006. \u00a0The preliminary allocation of the cost of the purchase, 413253=On July 29, 2005 the Company completed a private placement of 4,347,827 Preference Share Units of the Company for US$2 million. On December 30, 2005 1,435,897 of the Series II Preference Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of US$717,948, which were used by the Company to fund working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes., 469742=February 28, 2006, 271886=1. I have reviewed the interim filings (as this term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings) of Peace Arch Entertainment Group Inc., (the issuer) for the interim period ending February 28, 2006;, 244150=Quarterly net earnings (loss) have varied due to one time events that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 arising from the recognition of a one time $2.1 million gain on the settlement of obligations as described in note 11 of the August 31, 2005 consolidated financial statements., 524786=Pursuant to the original arrangements with PAPDC set out in note\u00a011(a), the Company was obligated to carry out management services for PAPDC. This obligation continued until June 25, 2004. During the six months ended February 28, 2006, the Company recovered costs against the payable to Fremantle of $nil (2005 - $149,000)., 274507=Date: April 13, 2006, 640771=February 28, 2006, 204428=Interest Expense. \u00a0\u00a0Interest expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended February 28, 2006, representing an increase of $0.3 million from $0.4 million for the same period of the prior year. \u00a0The increase is due to interest on outstanding production loans for projects produced and delivered in prior years which is no longer capitalized to the cost of the productions. \u00a0Interest expense also includes interest of $0.1 million on the deferred financing costs related to the kaBOOM acquisition. \u00a0Interest expense includes interest incurred on the Film Financing Obligation. This interest expense was offset by interest revenue of the same amount recorded in respect of the Restricted Term Deposit., 198436=Amortization. \u00a0Amortization for the three months ended February 28, 2006 was higher than the same comparable period. \u00a0Amortization was $2.4 million for the three months ended February 28, 2006 compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended February 28, 2005. The increase in amortization is reflective of the increase in revenues for the three months compared to the same period in the prior year., 242810=The adjustment to the February 2005 quarter is a reversal of $6.1 million in revenues and $5.7 million in amortization resulting in an increase of net loss of $0.4 million., 434113=Certain amounts presented for the six month period ending February 28, 2006 have been reclassified to, 612830=2010, 410825=February 28, 2006 and 2005, 233151=November 30,, 281708=February 28, 220691=Amortization. \u00a0Amortization for the six months ended February 28, 2006 was lower than that of the comparable period for the prior year. Amortization was $3.2 million for the six months ended February 28, 2006 compared to $4.0 million for the six months ended February 28, 2005. The decrease in amortization is reflective of the sales of product during the period with a higher gross margin, or lower amortization attached, compared to the sales of product in the comparable period of the prior year., 192701=Gross Profit. \u00a0Gross profit is comprised of revenue less amortization of film and television programming and other production costs. Gross profit for the three months ended February 28, 2006 was $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the same period in the prior year. \u00a0, 326512=2006, 143416=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management's Discussion and Analysis, dated April 13, 2006, 465553=In connection with the acquisition of kaBOOM!
