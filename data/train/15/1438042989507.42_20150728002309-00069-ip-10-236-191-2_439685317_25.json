            "WIND TURBINE GENERATOR - The present invention provides a wind turbine generator, in which a rotor head that rotates by receiving external wind with turbine blades generates power by driving a generator installed inside a nacelle and in which the nacelle is installed at a top end of a tower, wherein an introducing vent that takes the external wind into an internal space in the wind turbine generator is provided at a portion of an outer circumference surface of the tower or the nacelle that receives positive pressure due to the external wind; and an exhaust vent that externally exhausts cooling air in the internal space is provided at a portion of the outer circumference surface of the tower or the nacelle that receives the negative pressure due to the external wind.",
            "WIND TURBINE GENERATING APPARATUS - In a wind turbine generating apparatus, a heat generating device is provided inside the rotor head and has a hermetically-sealed structure from outside. A rotor head cooling air passage is formed through the periphery of the heat generating device to the inside of a wind turbine blade. A cooling air introduction portion through which cooling air flows and an air outlet from which the cooling air is discharged are provided in the rotor head cooling air passage to thereby form the air outlet in the wind turbine blade.",
            "WIND TURBINE GENERATOR - With a simple and low-cost structure, it is possible to introduce a sufficient amount of external wind while suppressing power consumption, and thereby, inside a nacelle and a tower are satisfactorily cooled. A wind turbine generator, in which a rotor head generates power by driving a generator installed inside a nacelle and in which the nacelle is installed at a top end of a tower, wherein an introducing vent that takes the external wind into an internal space in the wind turbine generator is provided at a portion of an outer circumference surface of the tower or the nacelle that receives positive pressure due to the external wind; and an exhaust vent that externally exhausts cooling air in the internal space is provided at a portion of an outer circumference surface of the tower or the nacelle that receives the negative pressure due to the external wind.",
            "DEICING DEVICE FOR WING LEADING EDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT MAIN WING - A deicing device for a wing leading edge of an aircraft and an aircraft main wing are constituted by providing a hot air passage (",
            "COOLNG STRUCTURE FOR RECOVERY-TYPE AIR-COOLED GAS TURBINE COMBUSTOR - In a cooling structure for a recovery-type air-cooled gas turbine combustor having a recovery-type air-cooling structure that bleeds, upstream of the combustor, and pressurizes compressed air supplied from a compressor, that uses the bled and pressurized air to cool a wall, and that recovers and reuses the bled and pressurized air as combustion air for burning fuel in the combustor together with a main flow of the compressed air, wall cooling in which cooling air is supplied to cooling air passages formed in the wall of the combustor to perform cooling involves a downstream wall region, closer to a turbine, that is cooled using the bled and pressurized air as the cooling air and an upstream wall region, closer to a burner, that is cooled using, as the cooling air, bled compressed air bled from a main flow of the compressed air through a housing inner space.",
            "AIRCRAFT ICE PROTECTION SYSTEM AND AIRCRAFT PROVIDED WITH THE SAME - An aircraft ice protection system is provided for preventing ice accretion on a wing of an aircraft or removing the accreted ice. Bleed air extracted from a main engine of the aircraft and air introduced from an air intake installed on an airframe and heated by a heat source of the airframe of the aircraft are selectively supplied to a hot air chamber formed inside the wing, thereby carrying out ice protection."
