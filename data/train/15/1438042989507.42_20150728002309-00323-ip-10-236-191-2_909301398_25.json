            "There are loads of concerts and museums to go to. The music scene here in Baltimore is very big and you can get to free shows plenty of times. There is the Copy Cat where students go to have fun and party. The school also host events like cats/puppy day, and the halloween party, which are great fun to go to. We are also every close to D.C. so commuting to there is no hassle at all.",
            "Being in Baltimore, here are a lot good restaurants to go eat at. There are all sorts of cuisines like Korean, Japanese, America, Indian, etc. THere really is a great variety here. There are also great small specialty place that sells super delicious soups, and if you're looking for some fine dinning for date nights, you can go down to the inner harbor for a romantic dinner and a stroll next to the harbor. There are a lot of good places to eat around the campus. Each has it's own color and taste. Being a freshman, however, you have to get the two most amount for meals. That means that you would want to use most of it up before the semester ends because there's no roll over of the meal points. That means that most of the time, you will be eating school's food. At first, it is very delicious, but after eating at the same place every single day, the meal does get bland an unappetizing. It's is a great convenience to have the meals because sometimes you just dont feel like cooking, but it does get bad after a while. The great side to the dinning hall is Breakfast/Brunch on Saturday and Sunday. They have such good breakfast foods like omelets, and bacon, and yogurts. Also, there is a wide variety in vegan and vegetarian food. There is a salad bar, and a soup stand, and a sandwich bar. There is a great variety, but it's jsut too much sometimes.",
            "The dorms are really nice. Since the freshman dorms were originally apartment complex, there is a bathroom and kitchen in each house. You can make it as cozy and homy are you want. Since most freshman's dorms are in the same radius, it's really easy to just walk over to your friend's dorm when you want to just hangout, or take a break, or do homework together. The close proximity allows you to make friends very quickly. In between the dorm buildings, there is a giant field that you can use to play music, soccer, basketball, or just sunbathe, read and have tea when the weather gets nice. The field there is really nice when you just want to get out of he dorm and enjoy the quietness of the outdoor. There would also be dance parties there, especially durring orientation, when there were dance parties every night. While the dorms are nice, it is still fairly old, so, the appliances and bathrooms do break quite often. The fixes are usually simple, but to send a request and wait for someone to come and fix it do takes some times. Sometimes they don't even come and you have to keep on complaining until they come, which is quite a hassle. There is a laundry room, but the machines would sometimes die and you can't use it. It also eats up coins sometimes, and sometimes, people would forget about their laundries and you can't use the machine. Overall, however, my dorm life has been quite fun compared to what my friends has told me about theirs. THere is a huge field, you're close to all your friends, there's a kitchen and private bathroom used only by 3-4 people. The beds are soft and it's a very nice environment to live in.",
            "The projects given are always really interesting. The amount of work you have really depends on how many hours you put into a piece. Of course, the longer you work on it, the better it would be. For academic classes, there will be a lot of readings, usually 20+ pages, and essays to write. The papers are not that hard to do if you put some times into it. Depending on the teacher that you have, you can write one paper a week, or one paper and a couple of short responses on the reading. Classes are once a week, since studio classes are 6 hours long, but once you're used to it, the classes aren't really that long. Plus, you get a one hour lunch break and 10-20 minutes break also.",
            "MICA is a wonderful college with a faculty full of experts. The campus is modern, is constantly upgrading to the current technologies, and is always current in what is out in the field of art making. The teachers here are people who are still working in their perspective fields and can give you honest opinions on what it's like to truly be working in today's time."

For a dedicated art school MICA is also surprisingly well-rounded, which played a big part in my decision to attend. Tips for prospective students 1. Be prepared to work often and hard. MICA is a fun place, but it is even more fun for those who manage their time and workload properly. 2. Get some sleep sometimes. 3. Remember that Baltimore is a big city and should be treated accordingly. There are many opportunities here, but you should exercise appropriate caution. 4. Get to know your professors. They can and will help you. Bang for the buck Like all schools, MICA gives back to you",
