We have a great athletics department, namely our men's baseball team which won the NCAA Tournament in 2008. We also have a fantastic and top-notch music department., 68405=You get out of your education what you put in. I have learned a great deal since I started attending CSU Fresno as a first time freshman in 2009. There is free tutoring in the learning center located on the bottom floor of the library and professors also offer plenty of assistance to struggling students. The textbooks are informative and can usually be rented at an affordable price in the library. Overall, CSU Fresno offers a great learning environment. I'm definitely learning a lot., 200927=The dining hall was awesome at first! I was excited about the all you can eat aspect. The breakfast omelets were to die for, and Thursday pizza was exceptional. However, they started making meals that NO ONE wanted. They would repeat a lot of things and it got old fast. I stopped wanting to go around February. Some days were better than others., 551047=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 88318=As CSU tuition rises, State Universities such as Fresno State become more expensive. as of 2011,the prices for next fall including tuition,housing, books and other costs are estimated at 22,000 total. However, as prices for schooling goes, its a great bargain and a great investment. If you like Fresno and places like it, then this will be a good investment for you., 134469=Tuition has gone up SO much since I started there in 2009, there are hardly any classes to choose from., 405518=There the rock music play at the food court and some kind of festival in April.}",
