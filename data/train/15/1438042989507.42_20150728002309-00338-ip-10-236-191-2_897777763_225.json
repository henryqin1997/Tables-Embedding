    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{455985=The University has a great athletic success. For example, We had 77 Olympians and 71 NCAA National Championships,AP 18th Ranked Football Program, In 2013, we were in the Top 25 Ranked Men's Basketball Recruiting Class, In 2012 the Preseason Top 25 Ladies Softball Program, and last but not least we became the recent addition to the Big East Conference., 454303=The Campus Recreation & Wellness Center is great for students, there is a Multi-Million dollar facilities including 5 gyms (Basketball, Volleyball, & Badminton); an outdoor soccer field; indoor Olympic size swimming pool; outdoor recreation pool; weight room; and 3 group class studios.Students can rent out a locker in the locker room per semester or per year for a nominal fee. Membership to UH students is FREE. A important fact, when the Olympic board looked into Houston as a host city for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, our indoor facility was considered to host all Olympic swimming events! It is our are home of the University Intramural Office Flag Football, Basketball, Wii Sports, Badminton, Dodgeball and State difference between UH Club Sports and Intramural Sports!, 1063085=They will always send a text if its harmful to the entire student body, which happened once in 2013 even though it was a false alarm. Police are always there. I would say make sure your not flashing all the expensive things you have because people are watching. Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced. I only lived there out of convenience (close to classes, don't need to worry about paying utilities, etc.)., 863027=May be tough at times, but everyone needs a challenge to learn., 959174=By the start of the 2013-2014 school year there will be over 8,000 beds on the UH campus. That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in. This could be a great experience for you, or it could be a horrible one. Things to take into consideration: Responsiveness, organization, availability, are the advisers worth their salt, what perks do they give you ex: help with internships, and ect., 370137=-Definitely apply for financial aid on time, try to get it in before April 1 -If your not comfortable with sharing public bathrooms with about 30 other girls than you might not want to live in Moody Towers. -DO NOT BUY YOUR BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE, I made the mistake of doing that my first semester and I wasted over $350., 142332=UH has earned every single one of those gold stars; experiences here have been so awesome that there is no need to sugar coat it. If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards. People collect more than what they need so that they can trade with other people, whether they know them or not. I love it. its like a huge game with the WHOLE campus!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Quality education for a better price. Although tuition is going up, the SGA is trying to freeze tuition to help students. The University is also offering $70 million dollars worth of scholarships for incoming freshmen! Lots of scholarship opportunities available from the university itself, the different colleges, and the organizations on campus! Am enjoying being here There are hundreds of clubs and organizations, not to mention activities on campus. Even though I don't sleep in a dorm, I enjoy UH. A world-class Wellness and Recreation center, an underground center called the Satellite, housing restaurants, study areas, TV rooms, pool tables, the University Center with shopping selections, and the Welcome Center, which includes more stores and places to grab a bite. The campus is not too big, so you can walk places if you don't mind the exercise. The people are great, the grounds are green, and there's quite a lot to do. Am learning a lot No matter what major you'll get into, you'll definitely learn a lot. There a many professors who care if you're actually learning or not and they will try to engage you as best as they can with the amount of students they have. I'm in the Honors College and it's crazy.",
