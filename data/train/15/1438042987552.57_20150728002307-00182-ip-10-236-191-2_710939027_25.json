    "textAfterTable": "Directions: Location of the sledding hill is at the Conneaut Township Park Bluffs. Comments: It is a rolling hill and there are areas with smooth slopes as well. Ample parking available if the gates are open to the park. When gates are closed, there is a church parking lot close by that people use. You can get a lot of air off some of the rolling hill areas so be careful.
