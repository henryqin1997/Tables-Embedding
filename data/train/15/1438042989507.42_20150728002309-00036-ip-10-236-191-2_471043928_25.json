The server may be formed of one or mutliple digital processors. Data processing may be in parallel processes or use distributed or other processing techniques. Data storage may be redundant or otherwise. FIG. 1 For example the DBMS 10 illustrated in While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims. Aggregate functions, like the SQL \u201cmin\u201d, \u201cmax\u201d and \u201csum\u201d functions operate on an input stream and accumulate a resulting value. The arithmetic operators used to accumulate this resulting value depend on the datatype of the field in the input stream. Simply put, floating point addition and comparisons are different than integer addition and comparisons. In a DBMS whose runtime execution engine is interpretive, there must be runtime checks to determine which kind of data type and which kinds of arithmetic operator to use. In contrast, the",
