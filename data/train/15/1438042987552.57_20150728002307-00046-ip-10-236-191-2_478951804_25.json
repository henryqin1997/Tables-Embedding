No. 6,006,266., 51693=Herein, a socket is a unique host identifier created by the concatenation of a port identifier with a transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) address. A socket address is a data structure that uniquely identifies a specific communications end point; it consists of a port number and network address; and it also specifies the protocol family. See, G. McDaniel, Ed., IBM Dictionary of Computing, McGraw-Hill, Inc., page 632, (1994). Sockets, and socket programming, are well known in the art. See, for example, W. Richard Stevens, UNIX Network Programming, Prentice-Hall (1990), Chapter 6, at pages 260, 261; and, IBM, IBM AS/400 System API Reference, Vol. 3, Version 3, IBM Publication SC41-3801-00, Chapter 65, pages 65-1 through 65-74 (September 1994)., 110034=For example, the string \u201cWed Jul. 5 09:58:23 1995\u201d and string 624 \u201c067486/QTMTWSG/QTWSG00712\u201d both get hashed together into a session identifier signature 626 (2 different keys concatenated together) as demonstrated in the prototype code debug messages of Table 3:, 128077=(The socket programming calls and instructions referred to in the following description are further described in IBM AS/400 System API Reference, Vol. 3, Version 3, September 1994, IBM Publication SC41-3801-00, pages 65-1 through 65-74. The server parent job instantiation is similar to that for the server child job set forth in FIG. 3, except that the parent job instantiation does not require the structure of block 500. Consequently, where appropriate in the following description, reference may be made to the structural elements of FIG. 3 as though they formed a server parent 200.)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the Invention. In particular, it is within the scope of the invention to provide a memory device, such as a transmission medium, magnetic or optical tape or disc, or the like, for storing signals for controlling the operation of a computer according to the method of the invention and/or to structure its components in accordance with the system of the invention. Alternative Embodiments Re-register for new work: If a client session has been inactive too long (step 235 evaluates true) or the client logs off (step 238 evaluates true), in step 231 child job 202 makes the session available again for new clients. This is done be re-queuing a job identifier 336-340 for the child 202 back onto job available queue 206. A session timer (step 235) is maintained to track inactivity for each client 120-124. In step 228, child job 202 will also check that a sufficient number of available sessions exist, and in step 230 will prestart another child job if the number available is below threshold (threshold algorithm TBD). Furthermore, if the number of available sessions is greater than the threshold value, in step 239 child job 202 checks to see if it can safely exit and still leave",
