The hardware devices are just another kind of file on the Debian system. If you have problems accessing devices such as CD-ROM and USB memory stick from a user account, you should make that user a member of the relevant group. Alternatively, you may dynamically add users to groups during the authentication process by adding \"auth optional pam_group.so\" line to \"/etc/pam.d/common-auth\" and setting \"/etc/security/group.conf\". (See Chapter\u00a04, Authentication.) Note In order to make group permissions to be applied to a particular user, that user needs to be made a member of the group using \"sudo vigr\" for /etc/group and \"sudo vigr -s\" for /etc/gshadow.
