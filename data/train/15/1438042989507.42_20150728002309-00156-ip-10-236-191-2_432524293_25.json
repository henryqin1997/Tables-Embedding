After some opportunities at junior levels, Ireland decided to improve his game in club cricket in England, and after a player rebellion of 2004 was given more opportunities to perform in Logan Cup cricket, and was included in the national team squad the following year. He struggled on his first tour, to West Indies, breaking his left hand in practice at the start of the programme. When he recovered, he struggled with his length and tended to bowl too short, which proved fatal against batsmen as adept with the pull as most West Indians. He secured a more regular place at the end of 2006 and was included in Zimbabwe's World Cup squad, although he made only one appearance., 58646=To the chagrin of many in Zimbabwe cricket circles, he retired from international cricket on the team's return home, complaining about the country's cricketing administration, and soon after signed a two-year deal with Gloucestershire under the Kolpak agreement. While he enjoyed moderate success with the county, it surprised many when he returned to play in Zimbabwe's revamped domestic Twenty20 competition in February 2010. It remains to be seen whether a comeback to the national side is a possibility, but his county career took him to Middlesex, back to Gloucestershire and on to Leicestershire, with the latter releasing him at the end of the 2014 season., 33653=Born August 30, 1984, Masvingo, 64173=Jun 29, 2013, 79665=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five}",
