It gets you used to college and lets you take your general education classes a lot cheaper. Bang for the buck The reason I decided to start at GCC is because of the tution price. Now that I am enrolled, I realize that not only is tuition reasonable but I am also getting free printing, free tutoring, free writing assistance and so many other features that a private school could never offer me. Am enjoying being here I like that GCC is a small school. It guarantees that the professors have enough time to get to know you and your needs. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
