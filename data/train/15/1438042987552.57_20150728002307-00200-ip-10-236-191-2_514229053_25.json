For example, constituent correspondence from 1976 and 1977, as well as much from 1982 is missing from the collection. The series of photographs offers a brief visual glance at Mr. Benjamin's activities but falls short of provding a comprehensive photographic record of Mr. Benjamin's terms in office and the various projects in Northwest Indiana. Finally, the collection lacks any personal correspondence or memoirs of Mr. Benjamin, along with information on his campaigns for the Congress., 11104=Reports, bills, hearing testimony, several Benjamin speeches, memoranda, and some correspondence constitute these series (1975- 1982) dealing with the local and national steel industry. The views of Congressmen, steel manufacturers, and interest groups (such as the American Iron and Steel Institute) reflect consideration of trigger pricing, \"Buy American\" legislation, reindustrialization, defense, and environmental issues. Reports provide useful background information on the state of the industry during the period. In particular, a comprehensive manual on the Congressional Steel Caucus contains membership lists, executive committee minutes, Caucus annual reports and activity reports, and testimony., 20582=Adam Benjamin continued to gain a reputation hard work, dedication, effectiveness, and loyalty among both his colleagues and his constituents. He retained his seat in the 1978 and 1980 elections, and probably would have secured a fourth Congressional term in the 1982 election. Unfortunately Adam Benjamin suffered from a heart ailment and died suddenly in September, 1982., 17486=Born on August 6, 1935, in Gary, Indiana, the son of Adam Benjamin and Margaret Marjanian, Adam Benjamin, Jr. became one of the Calumet Region's most dynamic and respected legislators. After graduating from Kemper Military School in Missouri in 1952, Mr. Benjamin served as a Marine in Korea until 1954. Upon his honorable discharge, he secured an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, earning a B.S. degree in engineering in 1958. Following three years of airborne and ranger training in the U.S. Army, Mr. Benjamin returned to Gary in 1961 and began teaching math and physics at Edison High School. Two years later, Adam Benjamin entered public service as the Gary zoning administrator; he gained further experience in local government acting as Gary Mayor A. Martin Katz's executive secretary from 1965 through 1966., 12733=Legislative files (1966-1982) yield information on many issues, mostly at the national level. The series includes reports and printed material, hearing testimony, and some correspondence from various interest groups relating particularly to education, health, and senior citizens. A major portion of the series encompasses House resolutions (arranged numerically) accompanied by notes and correspondence. Labor files contain articles and reports on many aspects of labor from federal economic planning to unemployment analyses. Persons interested in politics should note that the series retains Democratic Study Group reports and Whip Advisories., 13452=Documenting the assignment of federal funds, the Appropriations files (1969-1982) consist of hearing testimony from national interest groups and manufacturers detailing requests for funding. Most of the files retain reports, bills, correspondence, and memoranda offering insight into primarily transportation industry requests and federal transportation agency funding needs. In particular, the series presents much information on the mass transit industry. Also, hearings involving the Department of Transportation and National Highway Transportation Safety Board trace issues ranging from operating efficiency to seat belts. Many files within he series are labeled \"Reference\" and \"Press\" and contain newsclippings, reports, interest group statement, tables, and correspondence., 18333=Shortly after receiving a doctor of jurisprudence degree from Valparaiso University in 1966, Adam Benjamin began his sixteen year legislative career by winning election as a state representative. Four years later, he moved to the state senate, where he was named Outstanding State Senator by newsmen assigned to report on the Indiana General Assembly. As a state legislator, Mr. Benjamin developed a new code of ethics for legislators, worked on a new state medical malpractice act, and facilitated court reform for the Lake County Superior Court system. He became known as one of the most dedicated and hard working public officials in Indiana., 10169=Constituent correspondence (1978-1982) contains incoming letters and outgoing replies to constituents and colleagues. The files are arranged alphabetically by main subject heading; within each file, the correspondence is organized alphabetically by correspondent or topic. Most years cover subjects such as Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Government, Health, H.U.D., Interior, Justice, Labor, Post Office/Civil Service, Senior Citizens, Steel, and Transportation. The 1979 files provide particular insight into health and energy issues, such as the Bailly nuclear plant and oil shortages. In the 1980 correspondence, school prayer and inflation appear to be strong concerns. Reaction to the Reagan Administration budget cuts embraces 1981 correspondence, while the 1982 files concentrate heavily on transportation projects., 14884=A small series of schedule files (1977-1982) detail the appointment and meetings of Mr. Benjamin. The schedules provide a view of the Congressman's demanding work load and portray his commitments to legislative expertise and keeping in close contact with his district. In addition, many of the files contain correspondence and memoranda from local organizations, churches, unions, and associations inviting Mr. Benjamin to events and offering their thoughts on issues such as politics, transportation, industry, and health care. Researchers should consult this series as a supplement to the legislative and steel files series., 7128=These records document the activities and accomplishments of Adam Benjamin, Jr. as Indiana's 1st Congressional District Representative in the U.S. House of Representative from 1976 to 1982. Twelve distinct series constitute the collection: constituent correspondence; steel files; steel caucus files; project files; legislative files; appropriation files; budget committee files; bill files; schedule files; printed reports; photographs; and oversize materials., 11887=The project files (1972-1982) deal with local public works projects in the Calumet Region and attempts to create a strong climate for the economic and social growth of Northwest Indiana. Files comprising correspondence from local officials, construction firms, and consultants as well as reports, memoranda, newsclippings, and statistics offer data on local sewer projects, river basin development, Amtrak rail relocation, hazardous waste dumps, mass transit, and highways. The series exhibits strength in documentation of the continuance of the South Shore Railroad service, the Bailly Nuclear plant, and the expansion of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Weekly reports submitted by Benjamin project workers reveal weekly progress and problems of many of these projects., 7032=74.00 Linear Feet June 1984 Revised January 2000, 18988=By 1972, Mr. Benjamin had gained considerable legislative skill and developed a reputation as an effective lawmaker. His bid for the 1st District seat in the U.S. Congress failed, however, and Mr. Benjamin continued his work in Indianapolis, awaiting his next opportunity to attain national office. In the 1976 congressional campaign, Adam Benjamin achieved his goal, defeating incumbent Ray J. Madden by a 56% to 34% margin., 14348=These series (1981-1982) comprise House bills aimed at apportioning the federal budget among various agencies and projects. In addition, several files contain analyses of the Reagan Administration's budget cuts and effect upon the economy. An interesting set of \"Dear Colleague\" files offer some insight into Adam Benjamin's legislative and political activities and interests. Also, the bill files series includes a Democratic Steering and Policy Work Manual.}",
