With the turbine shut down, the valve-poppet return spring forces damping oil into the first bellows. On start-up, gas pressure on a diaphragm compresses the first bellows and displaces oil into the second. As the turbine runs, oil constantly MICRO: Ultrapure Gas Delivery - Morgan (September 2000) by the process recipe. These subsystems generally consist of several automatic shutoff valves, a pressure regulator, and a mass-flow controller (MFC). A gas stick receives its supply from a \" gas room, \" which contains the various high- pressure process gases used throughout the facility. These gases MICRO: Characterizing an electrochemical oxygen sensor for process gas monitoring applications to commissioning. However, during routine fab operations, an inadvertent error by a process tool operator or the failure of a delivery system component such as a valve or pressure regulator can cause gas contamination, which, if not detected in a timely manner, can result in a significant amount of scrapped Evaluating the use of MEMS-based gas and fluid delivery systems and electromechanical counterparts.
