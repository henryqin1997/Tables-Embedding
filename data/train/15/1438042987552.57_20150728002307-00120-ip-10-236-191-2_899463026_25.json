    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Those who are from a small town and love that atmosphere or those who do not want too many distractions. Tips for prospective students Apply for scholarships! Buy or rent books online, not in the bookstore! Bang for the buck The tuition is up there but for a University of Pittsburgh degree its worth it. Plus, if you apply for scholarships for on-campus students then you'll get a break on the expensive tuition cost. Am enjoying being here The town of Bradford is pretty boring. It is a good idea to bring your own forms of entertainment. Am learning a lot The education is good and the teachers are very friendly and helpful!
