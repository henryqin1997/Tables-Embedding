It will offer regular bill auctions to be held on Tuesdays, with a new closing time of 12.30 pm, initially focussing on 3-month and 6-month bills. The ESM bill programme will replace the existing EFSF bill programme. EFSF will therefore no longer hold bill auctions and maturing EFSF bills will be financed via long-term funding or through the proceeds of ESM bills., 67607=The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is an inter-governmental institution which was inaugurated on 8 October 2012. Its mandate is to preserve financial stability of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union by providing financial assistance to euro area Member States in difficulty. In order to fulfil its mission, the ESM is authorised to issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market to raise funds needed to provide loans to countries in financial difficulties, intervene in the debt primary and secondary markets, act on the basis of a precautionary programme and finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to governments including in non-programme countries. All financial assistance to Member States is linked to appropriate conditionality., 65358=The first financial assistance was provided by ESM on 13 December when it launched 2 bills and 3 floating rate notes for a total amount of close to \u008039.5 billion for the recapitalisation of the Spanish banking sector. For 2013, ESM will finance the rollover of the 2 bills mentioned above for an amount of \u00808.968 billion. The ESM will also be responsible for the financing of future macroeconomic assistance programmes. The ESM bill programme is expected to cover funding needs for the first half of the year with an inaugural bond issuance expected from ESM in the second half., 68747=The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was incorporated in Luxembourg on 7 June 2010. Its objective is to preserve financial stability of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union by providing financial assistance to euro area Member States in difficulty. In order to fulfil its mission, the EFSF is authorised to issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market to raise funds needed to provide loans to countries in financial difficulties, intervene in the debt primary and secondary markets, act on the basis of a precautionary programme and finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to governments including in non-programme countries. All financial assistance to Member States is linked to appropriate conditionality. EFSF issues are backed by guarantees given by euro area Member States of up to \u0080780 billion. EFSF has a lending capacity of \u0080440 billion., 61306=In terms of long-term funding, EFSF will continue to finance the macroeconomic adjustment programmes for Ireland, Portugal and Greece. In 2013, EFSF is expected to raise between \u008055 and \u008060 billion in long-term issuance in order to finance disbursement to these three beneficiary Member States and to finance the rollover of existing maturities., 60647=Luxembourg - European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) today announced their funding programmes for 2013.}",
