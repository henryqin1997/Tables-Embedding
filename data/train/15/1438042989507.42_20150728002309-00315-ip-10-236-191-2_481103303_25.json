As a result, they could not be filtered. Initial oligonucleotide concentrations of 2,250 OD/mL could be partially filtered and 3.5-3.9% of the product remained in the liquid phase., 124354=3 mL of Oligonucleotide No. 2 <SEQ. ID NO:2> (ISIS 2302) having an initial concentration of 1263 OD/mL, was precipitated into 3 volumes of either cold (\u221220\ufffd C.) or ambient temperature (18-20\ufffd C.) ethanol, 1-propanol, isopropanol, or denatured ethanol (Solvent). The resulting mixture was briefly agitated and then followed by either gravitational settling for 1.5 hours or centrifugation at a speed of 2,000 RPM for 2 minutes. An aliquot (1 mL) of the liquid phase was then analyzed for concentration of oligonucleotide in the liquid phase using an ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer. The percentage of oligonucleotide remaining in the liquid phase (% Oligo in Liquid Phase) was determined. The results of treatment with cold and ambient temperature solvent followed by gravitational settling and low speed centrifugation are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively., 59256=In other embodiments of the present inventions, the oligonucleotide is a deprotected oligonucleotide present in a solution. The oligonucleotide is preferably present in solution at a concentration of at least about 2250 OD/ml, between about 2500 OD/ml and about 7500 OD/ml, or between about 4500 OD/ml and about 6500 OD/ml., 72651=As used herein, \u201cunmodified\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d nucleobases include the purine bases adenine and guanine, and the pyrimidine bases thymine, cytosine and uracil. \u201cModified\u201d or \u201cnon-naturally occurring\u201d nucleobases include other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine. Further nucleobases include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in the Concise Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science And Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J. I., ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1990, those disclosed by Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613, and those disclosed by Sanghvi, Y. S., Chapter 15, Antisense Research and Applications, pages 289-302, Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B., ed., CRC Press, 1993; each is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 261751=Oligonucleotide Nos. 2 and 3 <SEQ. ID NOS 2, 3> (ISIS 2302, ISIS 14803) were processed in the Robatel Slab 320 sedimenting centrifuge, at 2,500 rpm. The results are presented in Table 13. The oligonucleotides were prepared following the previously described protocol., 88178=The oligonucleotide is optionally present in solution. Suitable solvents would be readily understood by those skilled in the art to include any solvent that is substantially nonreactive with the reagents, intermediates, or products at the reaction temperature used. Although any of a variety of solvents can be used, the solvent preferably also functions as the aggregating agent, as discussed below. The concentration of oligonucleotide in solution can vary over a considerable range. For example, oligonucleotide concentrations of between about 550 OD/mL and about 4750 OD/mL can be used. It will be appreciated, however, that the concentration of oligonucleotide in solution could depend on a variety of factors, including the solvent used, and the nature of the oligonucleotide. In particular, when purifying a protected oligonucleotide in solution, the concentration of oligonucleotide present in solution is preferably at least 550 OD/mL, more preferably at least about 600 OD/mL, even more preferably at least about 700 OD/mL, and still more preferably at least about 850 OD/mL. When the oligonucleotide is a deprotected oligonucleotide present in a solution, the oligonucleotide is preferably present in said solution at a concentration of at least about 2250 OD/mL, more preferably at least about 2500 OD/mL, preferably at least about 3000 OD/mL, more preferably at least about 4500 OD/mL, even more preferably at least about 6500 OD/mL, and still more preferably at least about 7500 OD/mL., 115152=FIG. 4 describes sulfurization of phosphite triester by delivering a 0.2 M solution of phenylacetyl disulfide (PADS) in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile:3-picoline to the reaction column. This results in the formation of the corresponding phosphorothioate triester. The excess reagent and by-products are removed by washing the support-bound material with acetonitrile., 244040=Solutions containing oligonucleotide concentrations ranging from 1000 OD/mL to 4750 D/mL, were prepared using Oligonucleotide Nos. 1 or 5 <SEQ. ID NO: 1 or SEQ. ID NO:5> (ISIS 5132 or ISIS 3521) formed as lyophilized powders. To these stock solutions, 3.0 M NaOAc was added and the resulting mixture vortexed. The mixture was then precipitated in 3 volumes of ethanol and the resulting slurry was filtered through a Buchner funnel, fitted with a 5.5 cm Whatman No. 4 filter under vacuum. The slurry was given a rating (A-D) based on ease of filtration. The percentage of oligonucleotide remaining in the filtrate (% Oligo in Filtrate) was determined after filtration. The results of the filtration are presented in Table 12., 78679=Some representative modified oligomeric compounds contain, at least one nucleoside having one of the following substituent groups: C1 to C10 lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl or O-aralkyl, SH, SCH3, OCN, Cl, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, SOCH3, SO2CH3, ONO2, NO2, N3, NH2, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group, a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligomeric compound, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligomeric compound, and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred modification includes 2\u2032-methoxyethoxy [2\u2032-O\u2014CH2CH2OCH3, also known as 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxyethyl) or 2\u2032-MOE] (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486), i.e., an alkoxyalkoxy group. A further preferred modification is 2\u2032-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a O(CH2)2ON(CH3)2 group, also known as 2\u2032-DMAOE. Representative aminooxy substituent groups are described in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/344,260, filed Jun. 25, 1999, entitled \u201cAminooxy-Functionalized Oligomers\u201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/370,541, filed Aug. 9, 1999, entitled \u201cAminooxy-Functionalized Oligomers and Methods for Making Same;\u201d hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 71028=Other modifications can be made to the sugar, to the base, or to the phosphate group of the nucleotide. Representative modifications are disclosed in International Publication Numbers WO 91/10671, published Jul. 25, 1991, WO 92/02258, published Feb. 20, 1992, WO 92/03568, published Mar. 5, 1992, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,138,045, 5,218,105, 5,223,618 5,359,044, 5,378,825, 5,386,023, 5,457,191, 5,459,255, 5,489,677, 5,506,351, 5,541,307, 5,543,507, 5,571,902, 5,578,718, 5,587,361, 5,587,469, all assigned to the assignee of this application. The disclosures of each of the above referenced publications are herein incorporated by reference., 94054=Once the oligonucleotide aggregate has been formed, the oligonucleotide aggregate is isolated to provide the isolated oligonucleotide. Due to the size and mass of the oligonucleotide aggregates, physical means for isolating the oligonucleotide aggregates can be beneficially employed. For example, the oligonucleotide can be isolated from solution by high-speed centrifugation, low-speed (e.g., preferably less than about 3000, and more preferably less than about 2500 rotations per minute) centrifugation, gravitational settling, and/or filtration., 52158=The chemical literature discloses numerous processes for coupling nucleosides through phosphorous-containing covalent linkages to produce oligonucleotides of defined sequence. One of the most popular processes is the phosphoramidite technique (see, e.g., Advances in the Synthesis of Oligonucleotides by the Phosphoramidite Approach, Beaucage, S. L.; Iyer, R. P., Tetrahedron, 1992, 48, 2223-2311 and references cited therein each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), wherein a nucleoside or oligonucleotide having a free hydroxyl group is reacted with a protected cyanoethyl phosphoramidite monomer in the presence of a weak acid to form a phosphite-linked structure. Oxidation of the phosphite linkage followed by hydrolysis of the cyanoethyl group yields the desired phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkage., 225811=Following Procedure A, 145 \u03bcL of 3.0M NaOAc was added to 25 mL of DMT-off Oligonucleotide Nos. 1 or 2 <SEQ. ID NO: 1; SEQ. ID NO:2> (ISIS 5132; ISIS 2302), having a concentration of 2750 OD/mL. The resulting salt/oligonucleotide mixture was then added to three volumes of ethanol, 1-propanol, IPA or denatured ethanol and mixed for 30 seconds. The resulting slurry was allowed to settle for 1.5 hours and a 1 mL sample of the solution phase was collected to determine the concentration of oligonucleotide in the liquid phase (% Oligo in Liquid Phase). It was observed that large aggregates formed and immediately began to settle upon addition of the salt/oligonucleotide mixture to any of the alcohols used. The data in Table 11 show that less than about 0.35% of the oligonucleotide remained in the liquid phase after settling., 46417=One method for inhibiting specific gene expression is with the use of oligonucleotides, especially oligonucleotides that are complementary to a specific target messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. Several oligonucleotides are currently undergoing clinical trials for such use. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are presently being used as antisense agents in human clinical trials for various disease states, including use as antiviral agents. Other mechanisms of action have also been proposed. For example, transcription factors interact with double-stranded DNA during regulation of transcription. Oligonucleotides can serve as competitive inhibitors of transcription factors to modulate their action. Several recent reports describe such interactions (see Bielinska, A., et. al., Science, 1990, 250, 997-1000; and Wu, H., et. al., Gene, 1990, 89, 203-209), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 261356=Six lots of Oligonucleotide Nos. 3-7 <SEQ. ID NOS: 3-7> (ISIS 14803, ISIS 2503, ISIS 3521, ISIS 104838, and ISIS 107248) have been successfully processed using room temperature ethanol and the Carr centrifuge., 85639=Typically, the first step in such a process is attachment of a first monomer or higher order subunit to a solid support using standard methods and procedures known in the art. Solid supports are substrates which are capable of serving as the solid phase in solid phase synthetic methodologies, such as those described in Caruthers U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069. A linker is optionally positioned between the terminal nucleotide and the solid support. Linkers are known in the art as short molecules that serve to connect a solid support to functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) of initial synthon molecules in solid phase synthetic techniques. Suitable linkers are disclosed in, for example, Oligonucleotides And Analogues A Practical Approach, Ekstein, F. Ed., IRL Press, N.Y, 1991, Chapter 1, pages 1-23, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 75720=A representative list of substituent groups includes hydrogen, hydroxyl, C1-C20 alkyl, C2-C20 alkenyl, C2-C20 alkynyl, C5-C20 aryl, O-alkyl, O-alkenyl, O-alkynyl, O-alky O-alkylalkoxy, O-alkylaminoalkyl, O-alkylimidazole, S-alkyl, S-alkenyl, S-alkynyl, NH-alkyl, NH-alkenyl, NH-alkynyl, N-dialkyl, O-aryl, S-aryl, NH-aryl, O-aralkyl, S-aralkyl, NH-aralkyl, N-phthalimido, halogen (particularly fluoro), amino, thiol, keto, carboxyl, nitro, nitroso, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, imidazole, azido, hydrazino, hydroxylamino, isocyanato, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfide, disulfide, silyl, aryl, heterocycle, carbocycle, intercalators, reporter groups, conjugates, polyamine, polyamide, polyalkylene glycol, and polyethers of the formula (O-alkyl)m, where m is 1 to about 10. Preferred among these polyethers are linear and cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs), and (PEG)-containing groups, such as crown ethers and those which are disclosed by Ouchi et al. (Drug Design and Discovery 1992, 9, 93), Ravasio et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 4329) and Delgardo et. al. (Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 1992, 9, 249), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Further sugar modifications are disclosed in Cook, P. D., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 1991, 6, 585-607, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fluoro, O-alkyl, O-alkylamino, O-alkyl imidazole, O-alkylaminoalkyl, and alkyl amino substitution is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,197, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 63946=FIG. 5 shows the sulfurization of a phosphite triester by delivering to the reaction column, 0.2 M solution phenylacetyl disulfide (PADS) in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile: 3-picoline, which results in the formation of the corresponding phosphorothioate triester., 138975=3 mL aliquots of DMT protected Oligonucleotide No. 4 <SEQ. ID NO:4> (ISIS 2503) having an initial concentration of 1785 OD/mL were precipitated in 1-4.5 volumes of ambient temperature ethanol. The resulting mixture was briefly agitated for 1 minute and then allowed to settle for 1.5 hours. After settling, approximately 1 mL of the solution phase was collected and the concentration and percentage of oligonucleotide remaining in the liquid phase (% Oligo in Liquid Phase) was determined. The results are presented in Table 4., 93306=The ratio of oligonucleotide concentration to aggregating agent concentration can also be varied. For example, when the oligonucleotide is in solution, the ratio of oligonucleotide solution to aggregating agent is preferably 1 part solution to at least about 1.5 parts, more preferably at least about 2 part, and even more preferably at least about 2.5 parts aggregating agent by volume. Although ratios of solution to aggregating agent in excess of about 1:2.5 can be utilized, the ratio is preferably maintained at 1 part solution to below about 4.5 parts aggregating agent, and more preferably to below about 4 parts aggregating agent, because the cost of using more aggregating agent does not outweigh the benefits obtained., 83863=Methods for assembling oligomers in accordance with the present invention include both solution phase and solid phase chemistries. Representative solution phase techniques are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,210,264, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Representative solid phase techniques are those typically employed for DNA and RNA synthesis utilizing standard phosphoramidite chemistry, (see, e.g., Protocols For Oligonucleotides And Analogs, Agrawal, S., ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1993, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)., 53012=The ability of the acylaminoethyl group to serve as a protecting group for certain phosphate diesters was first observed by Ziodrou and Schmir. Zioudrou et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 3258, 1963; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A version of this method was extended to the solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotide dimers, and oligomers with oxaphospholidine nucleoside building blocks as substitutes for conventional phosphoramidites. Iyer et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 39, 2491-2494, 1998; PCT International Publication WO/9639413, published Dec. 12, 1996; each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Similar methods using N-trifluoroacetyl-aminoalkanols as phosphate protecting groups has also been reported by Wilk et al., J. Org. Chem., 62, 6712-6713, 1997; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This deprotection is governed by a mechanism that involves removal of an N-trifluoroacetyl group followed by cyclization of aminoalkyl phosphotriesters to azacyclanes, which is accompanied by the release of the phosphodiester group., 260587=The data in Table 12 show that as the initial concentration of oligonucleotide increases from 2500 to 2750 OD/mL, the filtration rate improved considerably and the percentage of product remaining in the liquid phase was reduced to 0.6-1.3%. Optimal filtration was achieved by precipitating solutions with a concentration of oligonucleotide ranging from 3000 to 4500 OD/mL. Filtration of solutions containing these concentrations resulted in a reduction in the amount of product remaining in liquid phase to less than about 0.3%., 80258=Other preferred modifications include 2\u2032-methoxy (2\u2032-O\u2014CH3), 2\u2032-aminopropoxy (2\u2032-OCH2CH2CH2NH2) and 2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F). Similar modifications may also be made at other positions on nucleosides and oligomers, particularly the 3\u2032 position of the sugar on the 3\u2032 terminal nucleoside or at a 3\u2032-position of a nucleoside that has a linkage from the 2\u2032-position such as a 2\u2032-5\u2032 linked oligomer and at the 5\u2032 position of a 5\u2032 terminal nucleoside. Oligomers may also have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyl moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such modified sugars structures include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,957; 5,118,800; 5,319,080; 5,359,044; 5,393,878; 5,446,137; 5,466,786; 5,514,785; 5,519,134; 5,567,811; 5,576,427; 5,591,722; 5,597,909; 5,610,300; 5,627,0531 5,639,873; 5,646,265; 5,658,873; 5,670,633; and 5,700,920, certain of which are commonly owned, and each of which is herein incorporated by reference, and commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser.
