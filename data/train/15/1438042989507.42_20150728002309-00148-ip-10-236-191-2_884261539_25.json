            "I don't believe we have it on the St. Pete campus, but maybe at the Tampa campus.",
            "There is a huge amount of clubs on campus. They will be featured in the courtyard every semester, so you can choose which one you like!",
            "Environmental majors, art/graphic design majors, bio majors.",
            "The school isn't really old enough for that, but lets make some!",
            "Affordable, and nice.",
            "There are tons of ways to get involved on campus! If that doesn't excited you, there is also downtown, museums, and the beach near by!",
            "If you are a first year student you will be required to pay for a meal plan. The staff is awesome, and the food isn't too bad, but I would prefer to cook for myself.",
            "Large dorms available. My dorm is four bedroom, two bath, living room, and kitchen! Right by the water, and a five minute walk to down town!",
            "Like in any other learning facility, the output of what you get depends on your input.",
            "Take advantage of the small classrooms. If you are interested in an enviromental degree or an art degree this campus is perfect. It s located right on the water (great research opportunities!), the campus it right by the Dali museum and the Fine Arts museum, and for those premed students.. there is even an All Children's Hospital down the street!",
            "The campus at USFSP is breathtaking. You'll love study breaks by the water, and waterfront activities that are perks of being s student. The campus is small, so you are sure to get to know your teachers much more personally."

What to do for fun hang out with my roommates, attend campus activities, enjoy the downtown st. pete since everything is in walking distance. Tips for prospective students if you enjoy one on one help from your teachers over being just a number in a bigger university then this is the place for you.
