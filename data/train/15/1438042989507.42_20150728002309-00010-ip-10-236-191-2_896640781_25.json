    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{43823=Elmira College has three places in which students can enjoy a variety of foods. There is Mackenzie's, which is a pub-style restaurant that has sandwiches, salad, pizza, chicken tenders, pasta and more. The 1855 Room is a wonderful place to enjoy burgers, hot sandwiches, calzones, and the coffee bar has Starbuck's coffee. The main dining hall has more options than I could ever list, and everyone can find something that will make their mouth water. It is definitely possible to eat healthy on campus, but there are also opportunities to treat yourself to something not-so-healthy but delicious!, 62975=Elmira is obsessed with school spirit. You will see purple and gold everywhere on campus...even with the purple rock salt that covers the walkways during the winter. The bells that keep time play the Alma Mater at 6:55pm everyday because we were founded in 1855 and in military time, 6:55 is 18:55. Some people think this is tacky, but it shows how spirited and united the college is., 142080=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 56136=Elmira is on a trimester schedule, 12 weeks for the first two and only 8 weeks in the third, so the third trimester is the most fun and relaxing. It also offers and travel abroad program every third trimester with so many places to go and for a great price. There are also traditions this school does such as May Day and Mountain Day where students get the day off and there are fun activities to go to such as racing cardboard boats in The Puddle, which is like a cute pond on campus. Also, there is a beautiful fountain on campus which people just hang out in and around on beautiful days., 132071=Elmira has a lot of traditions, including the Candle Light Ceremony, Finals Breakfast for Dinner, May Days, and Moutain Day., 11826=Elmira College has a high price tag. One of the best ways to trim down that cost is to have a high GPA. A student with 3.2 GPA and 1150 or higher on their SAT's can get a $20,000 a year scholarship. Usually the scholarship provided by the school in combination with Federal and state financial aid usually makes EC's price tag comparable to a community college.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Elmira College is my dream college. I fell in love with it just by looking at it online. In my opinion that's how you can tell if a college is the perfect fit for you or not. The administrators, the students, the professors and in general everyone is kind, social and real. You really won't ever find another college that feels more at home than here. Am learning a lot There is never a moment in which you are not learning something at Elmira College. Whether you are learning something academic or something about yourself, you're mind is literally always working. The professors not only want you to learn about the subject but how to apply it to everyday life and how it benefits.
