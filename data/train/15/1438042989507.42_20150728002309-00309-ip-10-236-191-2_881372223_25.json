Unfortunately, also Jython 2.2.1 has certain Unicode problems (for more information, see http://bugs.jython.org/issue1802339 and http://bugs.jython.org/issue1032), which makes it incompatible with Robot Framework.

Robot Framework test data is defined in tabular format, using either the HTML (hypertext markup language) or TSV (tab-separated values) format. Robot Framework selects a parser for the test data based on the file extension. The extension is case-insensitive, and the recognized extensions are .html, .htm and .xhtml for HTML, and .tsv for TSV. 2.1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supported file formats Variable files to provide more flexible ways to create variables than resource files Resource files with variables and higher-level user keywords Test libraries containing the lowest-level keywords In addition to this, there are: Test suite directories can have a special initialization file.
