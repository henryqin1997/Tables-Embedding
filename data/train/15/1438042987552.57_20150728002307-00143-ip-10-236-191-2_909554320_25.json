So plan on working hard in the majority of your classes. Bang for the buck Campbellsville, has recently become quite expensive. So if you haven't applied for any scholarships, do so.

Am learning a lot When a person is taking courses in their intended major, they will definitely learn lots. However, in the gen ed courses, it will all depend on the professor if the student will gain the knowledge intended.
