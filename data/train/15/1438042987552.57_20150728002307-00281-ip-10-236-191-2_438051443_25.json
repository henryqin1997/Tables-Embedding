            "ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOX - An electrical junction box for distributing electric power in a vehicle includes: a metal core substrate",
            "METAL CORE SUBSTRATE AND ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOX USING THE SAME - The electrical junction box is provided with a metal core substrate including: a rectangular-shaped core metal layer in which two core metal plates are arranged with a slit-shaped gap therebetween; and insulating layers filling the gap and integrating the two core metal plates by covering surfaces of the core metal plates. Electric power from a battery is inputted into the core metal plate, and electric power from an alternator is inputted into the core metal plate. The gap includes: a first straight portion vertically extended straight from one side of the core metal layer; a second straight portion vertically extended straight from another side of the core metal layer, parallel to a virtual extended line of the first straight portion, and not arranged in the same line as the first straight portion; and a square-U-shaped portion."

A first ball bearing is inserted from the first axial side toward the second axial side into the interior of the bearing holder of the rotor through the opening of the bearing holder after the installing of the second ball bearing, so that an outer race of the first ball bearing is press fitted to the inner peripheral portion of the interior of the bearing holder and is axially spaced from the outer race of the second ball bearing. 06-18-2009 20100295394 Electric motor - Winding Start Sections and Winding End Sections of Winding Wires are Pulled out from slots of an armature core and are guided by wire guides of an insulator. Thereafter, each corresponding one of the winding start sections and the winding end sections is guided by a corresponding winding holding portion and is directly connected to a corresponding one of power supply terminal elements of a circuit apparatus without using an intermediate terminal. 11-25-2010 20100299912 BRUSHLESS MOTOR",
