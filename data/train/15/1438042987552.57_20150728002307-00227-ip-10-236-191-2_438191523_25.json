            "Method of Manufacturing Flexible Shell Inlay Strips - A method of fabricating shell purfling strips having sufficient flexibility to be placed within a curved configuration. The shell purfling strips may be placed, as a single unit, in curved channels which require the strip to bend. The flexibility results from a laminated structure comprising a layer of binding material overlain by an organic shell layer, with a bonding agent attaching the layers together. The organic shell layer comprises a plurality of precisely placed breaks along its length. The binding material retains the individual fragments of the shell layer in the strip, but because the binding material comprises a flexible material, such as rubber, the layer of binding material is sufficiently flexible to allow the purfling strip to flex longitudinally and transversely. The shell purfling strips may be attached in parallel relationship to other perfling components allowing installation as a unit.",
            "Flexible Inlay Strips and Method of Manufacturing the Same - A method of fabricating an ornamental purfling strip which has sufficient flexibility to be placed within a curved configuration. The ornamental purfling strips are sufficiently flexible to be placed, as a single unit, in curved channels which require the strip to bend. The flexibility results from a laminated structure comprising a layer of binding material overlain by an ornamental layer, with an adhesive or bonding agent attaching the layers together. The ornamental layer comprises a plurality of precisely placed breaks along its length. The binding material retains the individual fragments of the ornamental layer in the strip, but because the binding material comprises a flexible material, the layer of binding material is sufficiently flexible to allow the purfling strip to flex longitudinally and transversely. The ornamental layer may comprise organic shell material or synthetic materials such as synthetic opal."

Once inside the chamber, eaters are used to bring the boat and trailer temperatures up to 112\u00b0 F. to 165\u00b0 F. for a minimum soak-in time, with five minutes being sufficient in most cases. Humidity measurements of the off-gassing water vapors are used to sense when all the available water that could harbor marine life has been removed. Such combination of high temperatures and no available water assures that pests cannot survive to contaminate a new body of water. 20110097677 Published Description Patent application number Karl V. Ryan, Los Gatos, CA US 09-09-2010 Switching Operating Modes of Liquid Crystal Displays - In an embodiment, a computer comprises a liquid crystal display (LCD) operable in a transmissive mode, a reflective mode, and a transflective mode; a display driver coupled to the LCD; one or more processors coupled to the display driver; mode switching logic coupled to the one or more processors and/or",

Ryan, San Diego, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20090140878 SOUND CUSTOMIZATION FOR OPERATING ACTIONS OF AUTOMOBILES - Customizing sounds for operating actions of an automobile, comprising: receiving signal emitted by a remote; determining a requested operating action corresponding to the signal; and assigning a customized sound to the requested operating action when a sound assignment is requested. 06-04-2009 Lucas C. Ryan, San Francisco, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20100161984 SECURE MESSAGE SYSTEM WITH REMOTE DECRYPTION SERVICE - Systems and methods for secure messaging are provided. A sender may encrypt content and send the encrypted content to a recipient over a communications network. The encrypted content may be decrypted for the recipient using a remote decryption service. Encrypted message content may be placed into a markup language form. Encrypted content may be incorporated into the form as a hidden form element. Form elements for collecting recipient credential information such as username and password information may also be incorporated into the form. At the recipient, the recipient may use the form to provide recipient credential information to the remote decryption service. The recipient may also use the form to upload the encrypted content from the form to the decryption service. The decryption service may provide the recipient with access to a decrypted version of the uploaded content over the communications network. 06-24-2010",
