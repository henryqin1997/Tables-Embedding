            "You definitely get more bang for the buck at this community college. Their technical and culinary programs work in cohesion with the industry leaders of their perspective fields.

As a result students who successfully complete the program often are hired by the corporation.",

If you require more activity in your leisure time, then the J building should satisfy all of your physical fitness needs. You can try the Olympic track or the Olympic swimming pool, or shoot some hoops in the gymnasium. The staff at Macomb definitely considered the stress levels of studies and have proovided adequate reliefs.",

I'm sure I havent seen everything, but I prefered the older set up they had in 2006., 224594=One thing I love about Macomb is the Student life activities that the school offers. Some of the great activities that i have done through this program include DYI cupcakes. That activity allowed us to bake and decorate our own cupcakes. During the month of December in spirit of Christmas they allow us to construct our own Gingerbread houses. The gingerbread houses were a blast not to mention messy., 331616=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 68581=I use to love the student center but as far as I have seen with the new changes there doesn't seem to be great opportunitys. I just see students sitting around talking, when back in 2006 there were pool tables, foozball, food court, ping pong, etc. If they do still have those things then I have no idea where it was moved to.}",

Login to rate or flag the reviews Kayleigh from Clinton Township, MI 07/12/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 3 of 79 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Macomb isn't specifically for a single type of person. It's a cheaper alternative to a larger university, the only thing it lacks is the personal dorm rooms. Macomb welcomes great diversity! Tips for prospective students I suggest you get referrals for teachers, either from friends or counselors. Also leave early, (not just the first day) depending on what lot your in, it can be very time consuming to find a spot-especially in winter. Register as early as possible, join a waitlist if need be, your chances are good. Bang for the buck",
