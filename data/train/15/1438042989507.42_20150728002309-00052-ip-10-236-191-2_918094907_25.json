Section 115 establishes a compulsory license for the making and distribution of phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. Section 115, in turn, requires the Register of Copyrights to prescribe by regulation the procedures for the monthly payment of royalties and preparation and service of monthly and annual statements of account by licensees. This final rule updates the existing payment and statement-of-account regulations in response to legal and marketplace developments, including the Copyright Royalty Board's adoption of newer percentage-of-revenue royalty rate structures for certain digital music services, and changes in accounting and industry practice in the years since the rules were last substantially amended., 66300=On May 9, 2013 the U.S. Copyright Office issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comments concerning a new regulation that will allow copyright owners to audit the statements of account and royalty fees that cable operators and satellite carriers deposit with the Office for secondary transmissions of broadcast programming made pursuant to statutory licenses. The Office has revised the proposed regulation to address certain logistical concerns and based on further input that it has received from copyright owners, cable operators, satellite carriers, and accounting professionals. The Office seeks comments on the revised proposal before it is adopted as a final rule., 28102=The United States Copyright Office will be holding public hearings as part of the sixth triennial rulemaking proceeding under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) concerning possible exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition against circumvention of technological measures that control access to copyrighted works.

This document also provides information concerning the recommended format and content for submissions, including documentary and multimedia evidence., 23588=Title 37 published on 2014-07-01}",

Effective December 18, 2014. 37 CFR Part 201 Summary The U.S. Copyright Office recently adopted amended regulations to allow remitters to submit title lists in electronic format when recording documents that reference 100 or more titles. Those regulations also provide a process for correcting inaccuracies in the Office's online Public Catalog resulting from errors in electronic title lists. To avoid delay in implementing the electronic title list option, the Office decided to issue that final rule without imposition of a fee for corrections until such time as a fee could be set in accordance with this separate rulemaking. Today, the Office is amending its regulations to set that fee at a rate of seven dollars per corrected title. 79 FR 68623 - Verification of Statements of Account Submitted by Cable Operators and Satellite Carriers GPO FDSys XML | Text Additional Documents type regulations.gov",
