            "I do not know anything about Greek Life.",
            "I hear about many clubs but I do not participate.",
            "I feel that San Antonio College is a great starting point for people out of high school who need to continue school and are still trying to figure out their direction or for those who need to get basic courses at a reasonable price.",
            "The school is extremely cheap!",
            "I am not sure about any sort of activities that the school funds because I do not get involved.",
            "The food is actually pretty decent and the eating area is really nice.",
            "The school does not have any dorms.",
            "Some of the courses are somewhat difficult but overall, if you are a decent student, you will get by fine.",
            "Double and triple check that you are on the right academic path for your chosen major. Be persistent and always check that all of your transcripts are processed correctly.",
            "I feel like many of the teachers make a solid effort in assisting students and helping them realize the bigger picture. However, the way the school is run is very confusing and is poorly managed as a whole."

Our Ranger newspaper has actually just decided to come up with dorms for the Fall of 2013 and applications are being taken., 472563=They have a mall area, a fiesta room, and upstairs from that is a game room. Every week they have stands or people come out and it is a lot of fun. In December they have a snow day. They do karaoke, boxing matches and all sorts of kind of things., 387315=I do not live in dorms, but dorms are being built near the college as I speak. The colleges should be completed by 2014-Spring., 478728=12 credits cost me 800ish while 15 this semester is 1044 you better be a indistrict student, 364369=There are no dorms at San Antonio College. But in Fall 2013 there will be Tobin Lofts provided to students who would like to rent them. The lofts are conveniently positioned across the street from campus. From the looks of construction, the lofts will look amazing when complete., 561568=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 380237=Brand new dorms that are opening right next to campus in fall 2013., 27517=sac is offering so much more than what they first did when i attened in 2003. i love the fact that everything is spread out and doesnt seem so cluttered, and no one has to walk shoulder to shoulder like some colleges. also very clean!!!!, 429017=I started attending SAC in Spring 2013. I registered last minute and was running around like a chicken with its head cut off. It was a little stressful because I had no clue of what I was doing or where I should have been. If it hadn't been for my sister who had started a semester before me, I don't think I would have enrolled. But all in all, once the craziness settled down and I started my classes things were good. I would rate this school with 4 out of 5 stars., 442915=As San Antonio College is a community college, most of the students are commuting to and from. Beginning Fall 2013, SAC will open their own version of dorms called the Tobin Lofts. They're basically apartments, having different floor plans that can accommodate up to 4 persons comfortably, complete with WiFi, furnishing options, cafeteria, utilities, pool area, fitness center, etc. They also have a designated parking garage separate from the SAC garage. You don't actually have to be a SAC student to room there, as you can live there as long as you are enrolled at a college institution in San Antonio.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus at San Antonio college is visually appealing, and small enough so that buildings are easily spotted and identifiable. There is nothing more important to a college campus than easy navigability! There are so many different community opportunities, and you meet the most interesting people! Am learning a lot The professors at San Antonio college are extremely well rounded, diverse, and impressive! I have yet to feel like I am not learning anything from them. Without great teachers, you have a lesser chance of getting a personally useful education, so why not get a good education? You're paying for it, so take a chance and learn something! There is a wide variety of classes offered at San Antonio college, so take advantage of it and learn as much as you can with some very interesting professors by your side.
