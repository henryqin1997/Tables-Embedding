            "Located only .5 miles from the trailhead, Kelly Lake is the most popular destination in the Siskiyou wilderness. Most visitors Fishing here",
            "Far away from any trailhead, this remote lake is set in a cirque beneath the towering Lieutenant Peaks. Regardless of which trailhead one begins from, reaching this lake will require crossing two mountain passes, meaning solitude is pretty much a guarantee here. The lake is unofficially named on the topo, and is known to some as Private Lake.",
            "Located a stones throw outside the wilderness boundary, Sanger Lake offers a lot of the same qualities one would find at the lakes within the wilderness, but without the hike. The lake is popular with fishermen.",
            "Set beneath the dramatic Preston Peak, this deep mountain lake is one of the most scenic in the wilderness. The lake is packed with trout and offers some of the best fishing in the wilderness.",
            "The crown jewel of the Siskiyou Wilderness, Devil's Punchbowl is set in a deep u-shaped glacier carved valley. Steep granite walls shoot thousands of feet directly up from the lake. The lake has little vegetation to use as firewood, so be sure to bring a stove. Despite the strenuous hike required to get here, this is one of the most popular destinations in the wilderness. Solitude is not a guarantee on summer weekends.",
            "A quick stroll from the doe flat trailhead",
            "A steep hike",
            "bla",
            "Situated near the geographic center of the wilderness the scenic Harington Lake is set beneath the granite cliffs of Harington mountain. Getting there requires a long hike form any direction, and the section of the Kelsey Trail from Bear lake to Eightmile creek has not been maintained in many years. But those willing to make the hike will be rewarded with some of the best scenery the Siskiyous have to offer.",
            "Flat Iron Lake is the most notable of several tarn along the boundary trail. The lake is quite smalla ns shallow, but carries a unique charm other lakes in the wilderness can not match. The boundary trail is not maintained, and offers incredible potential for solitude to those with decent wilderness navigation skills."
