            "A new cafeteria was recently added with great selections of dining. The dining area can be updated, however, and it is more like a recreational/party area than a dining area.",
            "This college has great program opportunities in Health Science careers. I do not like how difficult it is to get ahold of anyone in certain departments, and I dislike how the system is set up for current students for Drop/Add registration of classes. Other than that, this is a good college with a beautiful location right on the water, it just needs some updating for it is an old college."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The teachers here are really helpful, and if help is ever needed, their doors are always open. Mr. L. Harris is the best math teacher ever. There's no way you cannot earn an A in math if he's your instructor. Gulf Coast is known to have one of the best science programs in the country -- that means it is super challenging. With subjects such as Chemistry and Physics, I highly encourage study groups. It is very relieving to discuss with classmates the tons of information thrown at you in a lecture. Everyone has that one concept that they can grasp and master. Working together and brainstorming can ensure that everyone gets help. Maybe your classmate can explain in a way that the instructor cannot.
