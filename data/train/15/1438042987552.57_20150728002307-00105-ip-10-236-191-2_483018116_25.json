    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58898=The cationic cross-linking agents of the present invention are added in an amount effective to obtain a desirable increased gel strength due to linking with the homopolysaccharide. In one preferred embodiment, the cationic cross-linking agent comprises calcium sulfate, and is present in the sustained release excipient in an amount of about 10 percent, by weight of the excipient. The ratio of the homopolysaccharide to the cationic cross-linking agent is preferably from about 1.5:1 to about 3:1., 39802=Uniformity and predictability of therapeutic levels of sulfonylureas and resulting blood sugar levels are considered to be desirable in the management of diabetes patents, and in particular, for the management of type II diabetic patients. For example, in tests with art-known extended release glipizide (formulations based on orally ingestible osmotic devices, as discussed hereinbelow) it has been shown that fasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in patients treated with controlled release glipizide than with immediate-release glipizide (Berelowitz et at., 1994, Diabetes Care 17(12):1460-4)., 45234=Still yet further, the present invention is directed to a controlled release dosage form for oral administration comprising a therapeutically effective amount of Glipizide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and, a controlled release matrix comprising a gelling agent, an ionizable gel strength enhancing agent and an inert diluent; wherein the ratio of gelling agent to inert diluent is from about 1:8 to about 8:1; the gelling agent comprises xanthan gum and locust bean gum in a ratio of from about 3:1 to about 1:3; the ionizable gel strength enhancing agent increases the gel strength of the controlled release matrix; and, the Glipizide is suspended or dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agent prior to incorporation with the remaing ingredients of the controlled release matrix., 62043=If the mixture is to be manufactured without a wet granulation step, and the final mixture is to be tableted, it is preferred that all or part of the inert diluent comprise a pre-manufactured direct compression diluent. Such directed compression diluents are widely used in the pharmaceutical arts, and may be obtained from a variety of commercial sources. Examples of such premanufactured direct compression excipients include Emcocel\ufffd (microcrystalline cellulose, N.F.), Emdex\ufffd (dextrates, N.F.), and Tab-Fine\ufffd (a number of direct-compression sugars including sucrose, fructose and dextrose), all of which are commercial available from Edward Mendell Co., Inc., Patterson, N.Y.). Other direct compression diluents include anhydrous lactose (Lactose N.F., anhydrous direct tableting) from Sheffield Chemical, Union, N.J. 07083; Elcems\ufffd G-250 (Powdered cellulose, N.F.) from Degussa, D-600 Frankfurt (Main) Germany; Maltrin (Agglomerated maltodextrin) from Grain Processing, Muscatine, Iowa 52761; Neosorb 60\ufffd (Sorbitol, N.F., direct-compression) from Roquette Corp., 645 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; NuTab\ufffd (Compressible sugar, N.F.) from Ingredient Technology Inc., Pennsauken, N.J. 08110; Polytplasdone XL\ufffd (Crosspovidone, N.F., cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone) from GAF Corp., New York, N.Y. 10020; Primojel\ufffd (Sodium starch glycolate, N.F., carboxymethyl starch) from Generichem Corp., Little Falls, N.J. 07424; Solka Floc\ufffd (Cellulose floc) from Edward Mendell Co., Carmel, N.Y. 10512; Fast Flo Lactose (Lactose N.F., spray dried) from Foremost Whey Products, Baraboo, Wis. 53913 and DMV Corp., Vehgel, Holland; and Sta-Rx\ufffd 1500 (Starch 1500) (Pregelatinized starch, N.F., compressible) from Colorcon, Inc., West Point, Pa. 19486. However, it is preferred that a soluble pharmaceutical filler such as lactose, dextrose, sucrose, or mixtures thereof be used. In a preferred embodiment, the inert diluent is dextrose., 107343=The drug to matrix ratio in Examples 1, 2 and 3 was varied from 1:5 through 1:15. From the data it appears that as the amount of gum in the formulation was increased, a decrease in % drug dissolution resulted. However, no significant difference was seen for the 1:10 and 1:15 drug to gum ratio formulations (Examples 2 and 3)., 67525=Suitable basic excipients include any inorganic or organic bases which are pharmaceutically acceptable, in the dosage ranges used, including a monovalent metal alkali and/or a divalent metal alkali, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonia, tertiary sodium phosphate, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, or L-lysine and/or mixtures thereof. The molar ratio of active substance to basic excipient or mixtures of excipients is preferably from about 1:1.1 to 1:10, but a greater excess of base may also be advantageous in some cases., 31477=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/950,732 filed Oct. 15, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,977., 55202=In general, the release controlling properties of a polysaccharide-based matrix of the present invention may be optimized when the ratio of a heteropolysaccharide gum to homopolysaccharide gum is from about 1:1 to about 1:10, although heteropolysaccharide gum in an amount ranging from about 8 to about 50 percent or more by weight, relative to the total weight of the polysaccharide blend may be employed. Preferably, a heteropolysaccharide gum in an amount ranging from about 8 to about 40 percent by weight of the homopolysaccharide gum, provides an acceptable slow release product. More preferably, the polysaccharide blend includes from about 8 to about 30 percent by weight of a heteropolysaccharide gum, and even more preferably, the polysaccharide blend includes about 12 percent by weight of a heteropolysaccharide gum., 89534=The data presented by the Examples, hereinbelow, compares the dissolution properties for glipizide tablets prepared with various drug:gum ratios and with varying amounts of an alkalizing excipient and/or polar solvent. Generally, the higher the drug to gum ratio, the slower the release rate during a period of from 1-12 hours. Thus, a drug to gum ratio of 1:15 provided the most prolonged duration of glipizide release in the absence of a polar solvent such as a solid PEG., 64933=Suitable basic excipients for rendering the aqueous medium at an alkaline pH, include a number of inorganic or organic bases which are pharmaceutically acceptable, in the dosage ranges used, including a monovalent metal alkali and/or a divalent metal alkali, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonia, tertiary sodium phosphate, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, or L-lysine and/or mixtures thereof. The molar ratio of active substance to basic excipient or mixtures of excipients is preferably from about 1:1.1 to 1:10, but a greater excess of base may also be advantageous in some cases. The alkalizing excipient includes, simply by way of example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonia, tertiary sodium phosphate, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, 6 N-methyl-glucamine or L-lysine and/or mixtures thereof. The molar ratio of active substance to basic excipient or mixtures of excipients is preferably from about 1:1.1 to 1:10, but a greater excess of base may also be advantageous in some cases. The aqueous medium which is alkalized and granulated with the excipient according to the invention preferably has a pH ranging from about 7.0 to about 9.0 or more. The pH of the aqueous medium can also range from about pH 7.0 to about 8.0 or can be about pH 7.5. It is important that sufficient basic excipient is added to the formulation to ensure complete bioavailability in vivo.}",
