            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDOVER IN MOBILE NETWORK, AND MOBILE TERMINAL THEREOF - A method and an apparatus for performing handover in a mobile communication network and a mobile communication terminal using the same are provided. The method of performing handover in a mobile communication network includes: receiving information about signal intensity of mobile networks to which a user terminal can be connected; selecting at least one of connectable mobile networks as a network for handover using user information including information about user requirement and information about the received signal intensity; requesting approval of handover of the user terminal to the selected network for handover and receiving result information about the approval request from the network for handover; and transmitting information about a network in which handover is approved among the networks for handover to the user terminal. Therefore, in consideration of user information such as service characteristics, a user service environment, and user requirement, by selecting a network for handover, a mobile communication network service having a performance and a cost suitable for user request can be provided.",
            "Handover method and apparatus in mobile network - A method and an apparatus for performing handover in a mobile communication network are provided. The method of performing handover in a mobile communication network includes: obtaining a service providing time period and a utility function on a candidate network basis; obtaining a selection function of each of the candidate networks using the utility function and the service providing time period; and selecting a network for handover among the plurality of mobile networks using the selection function. Therefore, in consideration of user satisfaction and a network service quality, utility functions are defined and by selecting a network for handover using the utility functions, a network suitable for a user environment can be effectively selected and thus it is possible to perform handover that has a performance and a cost suitable for user request and that can maximize a quality of a mobile service."
