    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck There's no doubt what so ever that this school deserves every dollar per credit hour! The cheapest four year university in the area is VCU, which at approx. $7,000 a year for only tuition, is triple what you'd pay at J. Sargeant Reynolds. People may assume J. Sargeant Reynolds has to have such low rates solely because it is a community college and its not like they're actually teaching the students, anyway. To which, I would reply to that completely incorrect statement, not only are we being taught for wonderful rates, but we are being taught for wonderful rates by professors who also teach at other four year universities and graduate schools in the area (such as VCU and the University of Richmond). Am enjoying being here Because J Sargeant Reynolds is a community college, the people that make up the student body are just that: the community. Richmond, VA is a colorful city and J Sarg is the proof! Personally, it made for a very easy transition since I came from a very diverse high school campus. However, many people come directly from the local high schools with their friends. Though that aspect may be intimidating for people not originally from the area and/or the older students, the familiarity and security provided by the already formed groups could be considered",
