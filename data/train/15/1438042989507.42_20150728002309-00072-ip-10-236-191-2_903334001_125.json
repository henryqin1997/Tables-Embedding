            "Clemson tries it's very best to make sure that it's campus is safe. They have safety walks, CUPD text/email alert subscriptions, and a transportation option called TigerTransit. TigerTransit will pick up and drop off a student at any location on campus at night.",
            "I am not personally in a sorority/fraternity. I do know people that are in such organizations who dearly enjoy the opportunities and parties that are a part of this experience.",
            "There are plenty of Clubs and Activities available to all Clemson students. Clemson even has a website for any who are willing to browse them all - http://www.orgsync.com/",
            "Clemson is great for people who want to get involved in Greek Life, future Engineers/Architects/Science and Math related majors, and those willing to be a part of a tradition.",
            "There is a bucket list of Clemson that is fun for all students to complete and can be found here -http://www.clemsonwiki.com/wiki/Clemson_bucket_list",
            "Clemson has a pretty accurate cost for what the institution provides. When you go to Clemson, you become part of a glorious family-friendly atmosphere that stays with you. Not many Universities can say that. Also, scholarships aren't too hard to come by.",
            "The rumors that there is nothing to do at Clemson are inaccurate. Emails are sent out every week for FREE, FUN things to do. You can even get FREE things such as t shirts and different Clemson related products.",
            "I am a Vegetarian and honestly there aren't many options in Clemson Dining for Vegetarians/Vegans. They do however, provide numerous healthy options for all of those omnivores out there. I must say that Clemson House's cookies are absolutely marvelous.",
            "Clemson Housing does a pretty accurate job of placing potential roomates together. In addition, hanging out with hall-mates is one of the funnest activities to do. My one hint of advice is to answer the potluck survey accurately. If you don't, you'll be very disappointed.",
            "The classes at Clemson are thorough and can be hard if you don't want to learn the material. My best advice would be to take classes you're interested in. If you study and want to learn the material, the grades will come.",
            "Coming into any University, students should make a study schedule. It helps with time management and keeps grades up. If you aren't a partier, don't feel pulled into that kind of life. It really isn't for everyone and there are plenty of students that have fun without it.",
            "If you go to a high school in South Carolina and want in-state tuition, Clemson University is a definite must. The classes are fair, the professors want you to learn the material, and the people are friendly. This is definitely a University to consider applying to."

Applied learning has helped to advance Clemson to the top 20 public schools in the country as of 2014. Overall the University wants you to succeed in academics as well as future career opportunities, producing successful students., 578417=I'd say there's probably around a 1000 people affiliated in greek life? It's everywhere but you definitely DON'T have to join to make friends or feel complete, 23290=Clemson has many things to do. There are always sports going on. You can join intramural, club, or varsity sports. There are many clubs and leisure skill classes you can take. Clemson also has random activities that they send you emails about. Last December, Clemson even went to the extent to set up an ice skating rink right on campus., 814391=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 667409=Clemson is a great campus to be on during the school year and even when school is not in session. It is ranked in the top 25 for colleges and has great staff that are very welcoming. I cannot wait to start in August., 662857=I had no intention of going to Clemson until I toured in April of senior year. The campus was beautiful and there was something about it that made it feel like a close-knit community. There's not much to do in the surrounding area if you don't have a car but there are so many organizations on campus that if you just give your email at the organizations fair, you'll always be a part of something and have something to do. I'm not a huge fan of the housing and dining but that's pretty much all that's ever bothered me., 434569=Keep your GPA up and your SAT score high. Clemson is selective, but it never hurts to apply even if you think you will not get in! Also, never think that just because you have a 1600 on the SAT or a 4.0 you will get in. Clemson seems to look a lot at extracurricular activities too., 199601=clemson is definitely a sports-minded school. football season welcomes the tigers in august. in december the torch is handed to basketball season. and in march we are graced by baseball season. throughout the year there are also other sporting events to go to and for those who are not interested in sports, clemson offers great bands for concerts in the coliseum on campus. clemson also organizes social events for all tigers, not just greek life. if clemson can't entertain you, there is sure to be something happening in charlotte, nc or atlanta, ga which are both a short two hour drive from clemson.}",

In Clemson, a five minutes drive from campus will take you into corn fields and cow pastures! A great country living scene Tips for prospective students Apply Early! The earlier you apply, the better chance you will have of getting accepted, especially if you do not have an exceptionally high GPA and SAT score. Also, housing priority is determined by your application date to the university, not your application to housing date. So the earlier you apply, the better chance you will have of getting into the dorm you want. In my opinion, Clemson House is the best, as far as room size and living conditions. And they have a dining hall on",
