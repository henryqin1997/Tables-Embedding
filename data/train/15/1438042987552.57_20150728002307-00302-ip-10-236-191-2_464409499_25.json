    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{271882=Two subject phosphorus-containing compounds incorporating MPEG 550 were synthesized using the synthetic strategy described in the preceding examples: 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP and 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 PO. The general structure of the polymeric chain precursors used to prepare these compounds is shown below:, 134264=In certain embodiments, ns and x of Formula II represents an integer in the range of about 1 to about 1000 or more, e.g., about 1, about 5, about 10, about 20, about 50, about 100, about 250, about 500, about 750, about 1000, etc., 253808=The subject compounds 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 EOP and 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 EOP, were prepared from a polymeric chain precursor and EOPCl2 (0.50 equivalents relative to MPEG 355 used in the polymeric chain precursor) using triethylamine (TEA, 2.5 equivalents relative to MPEG 355) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.5 equivalents relative to MPEG) in chloroform solution at \u22125\ufffd C. The EOPCl2 was added to the polymeric chain precursor solution over a period of 30 minutes and the reaction was allowed to proceed for one hour thereafter. Following the reaction the residual amine contaminants were removed by treatment with IER (112.5 g of Dowex\ufffd DR-2030 and 90 g of Dowex M-43\ufffd). The IERs were removed by vacuum filtration and the solvent was removed under vacuum to yield the neat liquid subject phosphorus-containing compound., 76425=For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 67th Ed., 1986-87, inside cover., 254704=The subject compounds 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 PO and 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 PO were prepared by an identical process, except that POCl3 (0.33 equivalents relative to MPEG 355) was substituted for the EOPCl2 in the process and 56 g of Dowex\ufffd DR-2030 and 45 g of Dowex M-43\ufffd were used in the IER treatment rather than the amounts listed above., 313395=Choi et al., Macromolecules 31:8766-8774 (1998); Ha et al., Journal of Controlled Release 62:381-392 (1999); Jeong et al., Nature 388:860-862 (August 1997); Jeong et al., Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces 16:185-193 (1999); Jeong et al., Journal of Controlled Release 63:155-163 (2000); Jeong et al., Journal of Controlled Release 62:109-114 (1999); Jeong et al., Macromolecules 32:7064-7069 (1999); Kim et al., Journal of Controlled Release 72:191-202 (2001); Von Recum et al., Journal of Controlled Release 55:121-130 (1998)., 276069=Table XI below shows the composition data obtained for 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP and 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 PO compounds. The actual materials prepared are close to the targeted materials in terms of both composition and MW., 147920=In certain embodiments, the subject phosphorus-containing compounds have weight-averaged molecular weights ranging from about 1000 or up to about 350,000 daltons, or alternatively from about 2,500, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000,60,000, 70,000, 80,000, 90,000, 100,000, 125,000, 150,000, 175,000, 200,000, 225,000, 250,000, 275,000, 300,000 to 325,000 daltons. Number-average molecular weight (Mn) may also vary widely, but generally fall in the range described above. Within a given sample of a subject polymer, a wide range of molecular weights may be present. For example, molecules within the sample may have molecular weights which differ by a factor of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or more, or which differ from the average molecular weight by a factor of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or more. One method to determine molecular weight is by gel permeation chromatography (\u201cGPC\u201d), e.g., mixed bed columns, CH2Cl2 solvent, light scattering detector, and off-line dn/dc. Other methods are known to those of skill in the art., 275521=Table X shows the MW data obtained for 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP and 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 PO compounds and their theoretical values of Mn. The Mns determined by 1H NMR agree well with the theoretical values whereas the Mns determined by GPC are somewhat higher. This is not surprising since the polymers are low MW and the values are determined using a calibration curve generated from polystyrene standards. The Mws determined by GPC are reasonable and the MWDs are low, about 1.4 to 1.5., 274479=75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP was prepared from a polymeric chain precursor and EOPCl2 (0.50 equivalents relative to MPEG 550 used in the polymeric chain precursor) using triethylamine (TEA, 2.5 equivalents relative to MPEG 550) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.5 equivalents relative to MPEG) in chloroform solution at \u22125\ufffd C. The EOPCl2 was added to the polymeric chain precursor solution over a period of 30 minutes and the reaction was allowed to proceed for one hour thereafter. Following the reaction the residual amine contaminants were removed by treatment with ion exchange resins (IERs) (84 g of Dowex\ufffd DR-2030 and 68 g of Dowex M-43\ufffd). The IERs were removed by vacuum filtration and the solvent was removed under vacuum to yield the neat liquid PPE. 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 PO was prepared by an identical process, except that phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3, 0.33 equivalents relative to MPEG 550) was substituted for the EOPCl2 in the process., 197751=For example, a compound prepared from a polymeric chain precursor made from equimolar amounts of DL-lactide (\u201cDL\u201d) and caprolactone (\u201cCl\u201d), initiated with propylene glycol (\u201cPG\u201d) with a theoretical Mn of 2000 Da, and condensed onto ethyl dichlorophosphate, EOPCl2, (\u201cEOP\u201d) will be designated \u201c50/50 DL-PLCl (PG) 2000 EOP\u201d. A subject phosphorus-containing compound prepared from a polymeric chain precursor made from DL-lactide, initiated with methoxy-capped poly(ethylene glycol) MW=200 (\u201cMPEG 200\u201d), with a theoretical Mn of 1500 Da, and condensed onto EOPCl2 will be designated \u201c100 DL-PL (MPEG 200) 1500 EOP\u201d., 276574=Table XIII below shows the gel-point temperatures measured for 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP and 75/25 DL-PLG (KEG 550) 1000 PO using a concentration of 35% (w/w) in deionized water. Below the gel-point temperature the samples were viscous but fluid. At the gel-point the samples were very viscous, resistant to flow, and had become slightly opaque. Above the gel-point temperature the samples became completely opaque, then precipitated. These observations were made by visual inspection upon heating the samples., 251755=The 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 polymeric chain precursors were prepared from 19.52 g (0.135 mole) of DL-lactide, 10.48 g of glycolide (0.090 mole), and 21.30 g (0.060 mole) of MPEG 355 as the initiator. The components above were transferred in a 250 mL 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with a gas joint connected to a dry argon gas source, a stirrer bearing/shaft/paddle assembly, and a glass stopper and mixed at 150\ufffd C. in an oil bath. When the reaction mixture became homogeneous, 115 L of a solution of tin octoate (SnOct) in toluene (1.3041 g of SnOct in 10 mL of anhydrous toluene), equivalent to 0.05% w/w SnOct, were added to the melt. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for 5 hours at 150\ufffd C. at which time the oil bath temperature was reduced to 105\ufffd C. The residual monomer was removed under vacuum at 105\ufffd C. for 1 hour and then the flask was removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool to room temperature under argon gas, and allowed to stand over night under argon gas., 276339=Table XII below shows the composition of the 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 EOP and 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 PO expressed in terms of the weight percent (% w/w) of polyester, MPEG, and phosphorus (P)., 89625=The term \u201celectron-withdrawing group\u201d is art-recognized, and refers to the tendency of a substituent to attract valence electrons from neighboring atoms, i.e., the substituent is electronegative with respect to neighboring atoms. A quantification of the level of electron-withdrawing capability is given by the Hammett sigma (\u03c3) constant. This well known constant is described in many references, for instance, March, Advanced Organic Chemistry 251-59, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, (1977). The Hammett constant values are generally negative for electron donating groups (\u03c3(P)=\u22120.66 for NH2) and positive for electron withdrawing groups (\u03c3(P)=0.78 for a nitro group), \u03c3(P) indicating para substitution. Exemplary electron-withdrawing groups include nitro, acyl, formyl, sulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, cyano, chloride, and the like. Exemplary electron-donating groups include amino, methoxy, and the like., 273454=The 75/25 DL-PLG (MPEG 550) 1000 polymeric chain precursors were prepared from 35.48 g (0.246 mole) of DL-lactide, 9.52 g of glycolide (0.082 mole), and 24.75 g (0.045 mole) of MPEG 550 as the initiator. The components above were transferred to a 500 mL 3 neck round bottom flask equipped with a gas joint connected to a dry argon gas source, a stirrer bearing/shaft/paddle assembly, and a glass stopper and mixed at 150\ufffd C. in an oil bath. When the reaction mixture became homogeneous, 172 L of a solution of tin octoate (SnOct) in toluene (1.3071 g of SnOct in 10 mL of anhydrous toluene), equivalent to 0.05% w/w SnOct, were added to the melt. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for 5 hours at 150\ufffd C. at which time the oil bath temperature was reduced to 105\ufffd C. The residual monomer was removed under vacuum at 105\ufffd C. for 1 hour and then the flask was removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool to room temperature under argon gas, and allowed to stand overnight under argon gas., 252781=The 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 polymeric chain precursors were prepared from 19.52 g (0.135 mole) of DL-lactide, 10.48 g of glycolide (0.090 mole), and 10.65 g (0.030 mole) of MPEG 355 as the initiator. The components above were transferred in a 250 mL 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with a gas joint connected to a dry argon gas source, a stirrer bearing/shaft/paddle assembly, and a glass stopper and mixed at 150\ufffd C. in an oil bath. When the reaction mixture became homogeneous, 115 L of a solution of tin octoate (SnOct) in toluene (1.3071 g of SnOct in 10 mL of anhydrous toluene), equivalent to 0.05% w/w SnOct, were added to the melt. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for 5 hours at 150\ufffd C. at which time the oil bath temperature was reduced to 105\ufffd C. The residual monomer was removed under vacuum at 105\ufffd C. for 1 hour and then the flask was removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool to room temperature under argon gas, and allowed to stand over night under argon gas., 42859=This application is a 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/US03/05795 filed Feb. 25, 2003, which claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 60/359,314 filed Feb. 25, 2002, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety., 237297=The polymeric chain precursor in each case was prepared from trimethylene carbonate (TMC) initiated with 1-dodecanol such that the theoretical ratio of TMC was 5/1 and the theoretical Mn was about 700 daltons. The polymerization was conducted for 3 hours at 155\ufffd C. using 300 ppm (based on grams of total monomer) of SnOct as the catalyst. The residual monomer was removed from the polymeric chain precursor by vacuum stripping for one hour at 105\ufffd C. The polymeric chain precursor was then dissolved in chloroform for reaction with the appropriate phoshohalogenate., 146465=As exemplified above, the type and ratio of different constitutional units in any polymeric chain R1 may vary. For example, in certain embodiments, the polymeric R1 chains may be composed almost entirely, if not entirely, of a single constitutional unit, such as depicted in Formula IIe. Alternatively, in other instances, the polymeric chains are composed of two different types of constitutional units, in which the percentage of each subunit may vary from less than 1:99 to more than 99:1, or alternatively 10:90, 15:85, 25:75, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 75:25, 85:15, 90:10 or the like. In other embodiments, in which three or more different types of constitutional units are present in a polymeric R1 chain, the present invention contemplates a range of mixtures like those taught for the two-unit systems. The amounts of the different units in polymeric chains with multiple units may be expressed as an average for all the polymeric chains in the subject phosphorus-containing compound., 251436=Four subject phosphorus-containing compounds incorporating MPEG 355 were synthesized using the synthetic strategy described in the preceding examples: 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 EOP, 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 EOP, 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 PO, and 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 PO., 222482=The polymeric chain precursor in each case was prepared from a 60/40 molar ratio of DL-lactide and glycolide, targeting an approximately 60/40 ratio in the final polymeric chain precursor, and initiated with 1 -dodecanol such that the theoretical ratio of DL-lactide to glycolide to 1-dodecanol was 2.4/1.6/1.0 and the theoretical Mn was about 700 daltons. The polymerization was conducted for 3 hours at 155\ufffd C. using 200 ppm (based on grams of total monomer) of SnOct as the catalyst. The residual monomer was removed from the polymeric chain precursor by vacuum stripping for one hour at 105\ufffd C. The polymeric chain precursor was then dissolved in chloroform for reaction with the appropriate phosphohalogenate., 183524=In certain instances, the release rates of different compositions of the present invention may be compared by subjecting them to such a protocol. In certain instances, it may be necessary to process compositions in the same fashion to allow direct and relatively accurate comparisons of different systems to be made. Such comparisons may indicate that any one composition releases incorporated material at a rate from about 2 or less to about 1000 or more times faster than another drug delivery system. Alternatively, a comparison may reveal a rate difference of about 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 750. Even higher rate differences are contemplated by the present invention and release rate protocols., 262411=Table VIII below shows the composition data obtained for the 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 EOP and 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 500 PO compounds and Table IX below shows the composition data obtained for the 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 EOP and 60/40 DL-PLG (MPEG 355) 1000 PO compounds. The actual materials prepared are close to the targeted materials in terms of both composition and MW. However, the amount of DL-lactide present in these compounds is slightly lower than the theoretical amount., 73333=\u201cSmall molecule\u201d is an art-recognized term, and refers to a molecule which has a molecular weight of less than about 2000 amu, or less than about 1000 amu, and even less than about 500 amu.}",
