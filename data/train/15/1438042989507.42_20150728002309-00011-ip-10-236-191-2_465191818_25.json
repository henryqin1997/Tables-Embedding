    "textAfterTable": "Sorting Records With SQL In the SQL, to sort a field in ascending order, you can include the ORDER BY clause in your statement. The syntax used would be: SELECT What FROM WhatObject ORDER BY WhatField; The field used as the basis must be recognized as part of the selected columns. Imagine you have created a list of staff members made of their first and last names in a table named Employees. If you want to order the list in alphabetical order based on the LastName column, you would use a statement such as: SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName; If you use the * operator to include all fields, you can order the list based on any of the table's fields, as we learned during data analysis. Imagine that you have created a query that includes all fields. The following statement would list the records of the Employees table based on the alphabetical order of the LastName column: SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName; By default, records are ordered in ascending order. Nevertheless, the ascending order is controlled using the ASC keyword specified after the based field. For example, to sort the last names in ascending order of a query that includes the first and last names, the above statement can also be written",
