No. 60/217,101, filed Jul. 10, 2000., 248350=The actual accumulation of data for measurement of such emissivity values is conventional and may be done by using, for example, a Beckman Model 4260 spectrophotometer with \u201cVW\u201d attachment (Beckman Scientific Inst. Corp.). This spectrophotometer measures reflectance versus wavelength, and from this, emissivity is calculated using the aforesaid ASTM Standard 1585-93., 244073=Color characteristics are measured and reported herein using the CIE LAB 1976 a*, b* coordinates and scale (i.e. the CIE 1976 a*b* diagram, Ill. CIE-C 2 degree observer), wherein:, 250775=The terms \u201cheat treatment\u201d and \u201cheat treating\u201d as used herein mean heating the article to a temperature sufficient to enabling thermal tempering, bending, or heat strengthening of the glass inclusive article. This definition includes, for example, heating a coated article to a temperature of at least about 1100 degrees F. (e.g., to a temperature of from about 550 degrees C. to 900 degrees C.) for a sufficient period to enable tempering., 250150=\u201cMechanical durabilility\u201d as used herein is defined by the following tests. The test uses a Pacific Scientific Abrasion Tester (or equivalent) wherein a 2\u2033\ufffd4\u2033\ufffd1\u2033 nylon brush (e.g., as made by Wright Bernet of Franklin Park, Ill., Model 1280 Hand & Nail Brush) is cyclically passed over the layer system in 500 cycles employing 150 gm of weight, applied to a 6\u2033\ufffd17\u2033 sample. In this test, if no substantial, noticeable scratches appear when viewed with the naked eye under visible light, the test is deemed passed, and the article is said to be \u201cmechanically durable\u201d or to have \u201cmechanical durability\u201d., 246234=The term Rsolar refers to total solar energy reflectance (glass side herein), and is a weighted average of IR reflectance, visible reflectance, and UV reflectance. This term may be calculated in accordance with the known DIN 410 and ISO 13837 (December 1998) Table 1, p. 22 for automotive applications, and the known ASHRAE 142 standard for architectural applications, both of which are incorporated herein by reference., 246685=\u201cHaze\u201d is defined as follows. Light diffused in many directions causes a loss in contrast. The term \u201chaze\u201d is defined herein in accordance with ASTM D 1003 which defines haze as that percentage of light which in passing through deviates from the incident beam greater than 2.5 degrees on the average. \u201cHaze\u201d may be measured herein by a Byk Gardner haze meter (all haze values herein are measured by such a haze meter and are unitless)., 247522=For architectural purposes, emissivity values become quite important in the so-called \u201cmid-range\u201d, sometimes also called the \u201cfar range\u201d of the infrared spectrum, i.e. about 2,500-40,000 nm., for example, as specified by the WINDOW 4.1 program, LBL-35298 (1994) by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, as referenced below. The term \u201cemissivity\u201d as used herein, is thus used to refer to emissivity values measured in this infrared range as specified by ASTM Standard E 1585-93 entitled \u201cStandard Test Method for Measuring and Calculating Emittance of Architectural Flat Glass Products Using Radiometric Measurements\u201d. This Standard, and its provisions, are incorporated herein by reference. In this Standard, emissivity is reported as hemispherical emissivity (Eh) and normal emissivity (En)., 244430=Other similar coordinates may be equivalently used such as by the subscript \u201ch\u201d to signify the conventional use of the Hunter method (or units) Ill. C, 100 observer, or the CIE LUV u*v* coordinates. These scales are defined herein according to ASTM D-2244-93 \u201cStandard Test Method for Calculation of Color Differences From Instrumentally Measured Color Coordinates\u201d Sep. 15, 1993 as augmented by ASTM E-308-95, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol. 06.01 \u201cStandard Method for Computing the Colors of Objects by 10 Using the CIE System\u201d and/or as reported in IES LIGHTING HANDBOOK 1981 Reference Volume.}",

For example, and without limitation, the aforesaid oxidation graded contact layer(s) and Si-rich silicon nitride layer(s) can be used with single silver layer stacks, as well as the illustrated dual silver layer stacks. Such other features, modifications and improvements are therefore considered to be a part of this invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims: The terms \u201cheat treatment\u201d and \u201cheat treating\u201d as used herein mean heating the article to a temperature sufficient to enabling thermal tempering, bending, or heat strengthening of the glass inclusive article. This definition includes, for example, heating a coated article to a temperature of at least about 1100 degrees F. (e.g., to a temperature of from about 550 degrees C. to 900 degrees C.) for a sufficient period to enable tempering. \u201cMechanical durabilility\u201d as used herein is defined by the following tests.
