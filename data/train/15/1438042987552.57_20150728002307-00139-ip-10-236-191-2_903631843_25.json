            "No dorm for this college",
            "The academic programs are great.",
            "1 .Attendance is a must at Broward College, plus many teachers give you a grade on attendance 2. Ratemyprofessor.com is a great website to help you have an idea on what other students opinions are on their professors",
            "If I had a chance to give Broward College a rating I would honestly give it a 8/10. The reason why I not 10/10 is because on the North Campus I feel it badly needs to be updated as far as looks compared to Central and south campus. a lot of the teachers are helpful. You will learn a lot."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{168520=I was an active member of 4 clubs before I dropped down to one. Each campus has their own clubs. For example, I was a member of the North Campus Art Club but Central Campus & Downtown have different art club chapters. North campus clubs are very involved in student life. The student life awards take place in April every year and all members have a chance to win something!, 1163274=last time i was at north campus they had a chocolate fest in February and they had parties every once in a while , for valentines day etc. they also had a chili cook off a few weeks ago., 726547=For the amount of money paid and the results that I have received through my studies at Broward College I am extremely impressed. This year Broward College was a top ten contender for the best college in America, we will find out in March 2013 if we win the Aspen Award for $1,000,000.00., 652311=Not much of a traditional college. Celebrates 9/11, Constitution Day, Multicultural month every year, along with some other things. North Campus is re-opening the OMNI Auditorium January 2013 which will allow the campus to host basketball and volleyball games., 611065=I really only attend pines and miramar campus and they don't have any., 603018=the south campus usually has a few cops that stay guarding the campus and miramar town center has plenty of cops patrolling, 169723=Last year, I paid a little over $1800 for 18 credit hours. Classes were $98/credit for in-state students when I last checked., 357369=There are 3 broward college campuses located in the following areas in Florida: Pembroke Pines, Davie, and Ft.-lauderdale. there are 3 centers, located in the following areas: Weston, Miramar, and Sheridan., 552276=Although this school is not focus a lot in it's food and dining service some changes are coming in the 2012 fall term, they are adding more vary to the food selection., 802311=Yes!! The tuition fees are low. Broward College, by the way, is one of the top 10 colleges in the Nation. It has an amazing nursing program and since 2006, has had 12 Jack Kent Cook scholarship recipients!, 85444=The school has events at the end of every month. Each event is different. Usually they are based on what is being celebrated that month. For example in November we had a fall event that had rides and games all over the campus like a miniature carnival., 171724=There's a reason why Broward was one of the top ten community colleges in the nation in 2013. These courses are no easier than any 4-year university course and it truly challenges students. The myth that community college is easy is no longer accurate. I transferred from a 4-year university to Broward College and my classes are more rigorous here., 530507=Take professor Benham for ENC1101. He is a great teacher!, 363431=if you need anything from the office go very early as it gets full after 9:30. You will be waiting for hours., 163670=For most of my classes, I basically breezed through. I was never one for school, but I wanted to afford myself better opportunities in life. As I took class after class at BC, I came to realize that the school was just a joke. I can't remember how many of these classes that I attended without ever opening a textbook. The instructors require that you buy the textbooks before class begins, but most of them don't even work from the textbook; they just wing it. I wasted a lot of money on books that I never even used, but at least was able to sell them online. Do this: Read review after review and look at all of the mistakes in grammar. These are college students writing these reviews. Do the same at ratemyprofessor.com. Check out the reviews for the Broward College english teachers and you'll see so many reviews where the students state that they passed with a reasonable grade, but pay attention to the grammar errors. These people passed a college level english class with those errors. If I were a professor, I would have failed those students without hesitation. Good old Broward College., 749904=Broward College offers many clubs and activities to get the students involved. For example, there is club week, where many of the clubs here at Broward showcase some of their benefits of joining. As far as activities, my favorite activity would be the Yoga classes offered Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:00 a.m. I feel so much more relaxed throughout the week taking these classes., 683957=Safety here is a concern I've fortunately never had to deal with I once had a night class that ended at 9:30 there is always campus security around and parking lots are available near any class you'll have., 35429=Attending Broward college would save you more money than you'll expect to spend. Broward College charges about 77 dollars per credit course. I'm a full time student taking 5 classes, i spend and overall of 2300 dollars and that includes the price for new books!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Although Broward College is a great campus for the locals residing in South Florida, I've come to notice that many professors do not posses the required discipline, and lecture skills, to be qualified as a professor. Broward College offers many different classes at different hours of the day, which is convenient for many working students. From my own personal experience, however, I conclude that a minority of professors do not appear in class with their resources prepared, and fail to carry out the ideal lectures aimed to keep the student's interest afloat. I hold mentors with highest respect possible, they are the guiding hand of every young aspiring student destined to achieve prosperity. Having the option to choose from a variety of courses is detrimental, however, it does not invalidate the fact that many professors unknowingly degrade the quality of education by not emphasizing and reviewing their course evaluations to renovate their teaching methods. The professors who truly enjoy their job find pleasure in being the mentor to future scholars. They are the ones who are very knowledgeable, providing good insight into the real world experience by finding relevance between the subject being taught and the student's personal life.
