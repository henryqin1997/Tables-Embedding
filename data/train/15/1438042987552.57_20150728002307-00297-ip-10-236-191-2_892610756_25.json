            "I have found Saint Michael's College to be academically challenging, highly engaging, and very accommodating. As a transfer student, Saint Michael's was very helpful in transferring credits and working with me to make sure I had a solid academic plan. I have found the professors and fellow students to be very interesting and inspiring."

This year we had a lobster dinner in April, and often there is an extremely large cake waiting in the cafeteria. My only complaint is the limited weekend hours, but they make up for this with a free grill in the freshman quad on Friday and Saturday nights.

They're also in the process of building a brand new dorm and student center.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you are a student who wants a small classroom, being a name and a face rather than a number in a huge lecture hall _ Saint Mikes is for you! If you are an athlete who wants to be on the good side of the professors, St. Mikes is for you!!! So many of the professors follow along with the sports teams, and love to have them in class (even if they do tease you!) If you are an 'outdoors person then Saint Michael's is DEFINITELY the place for you... We are close to Lake Champlain, Smugglers Notch Ski Resort, Stowe Resort and manyyyy other mountains and hiking trails! For those girls who love to shop:: Public Transit takes you right down to Church Street where the best little boutiques and mall is! Saint Michael's is an all-around school that has something for everyone to fall in love with! Tips for prospective students DON'T BE AFRAID! If you think you wouldn't fit in at a small school do not be alarmed! Saint Mike's is such an accepting school to all sorts of students! Don't let the cost bug you down! Even though college is getting pricier these days, this school is worth it! Just think of the opportunities you will receive from St. Mikes and the amazing opportunities you will attain from",
