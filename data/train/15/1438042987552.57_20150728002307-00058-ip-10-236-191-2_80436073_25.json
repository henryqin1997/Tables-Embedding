The box will be replenished randomly with energy cells, microfusion cells and electron charge packs whenever you enter L1, giving a continuous supply of energy weapons ammunition. When killed, Mister Gutsies and protectrons will have small amounts on them. Extremely large numbers can be found in one of the boxes that appears during Caesar's Favor and Caesar's Hire (sometimes over 1800 can be found). The box that the cells appear in only appears once you reach Idolized reputation with Caesar's Legion.
