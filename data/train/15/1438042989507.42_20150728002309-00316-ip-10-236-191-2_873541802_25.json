            "Participants received apixaban and warfarin-placebo following randomization during a titration phase using a dosing algorithm for warfarin- placebo; apixaban was dosed at 5 mg twice daily (BID) [or 2.5 mg BID in select subjects]. Subsequent warfarin placebo doses were recommended based upon an algorithm using an encrypted, shammed International Normalized Ratio (INR) procedure to preserve the double blind; however, the final dosing decision rested with the investigator.",
