            "SELF-ADAPTIVE IMAGE-BASED OBSTACLE DETECTION METHOD - A self-adaptive image-based obstacle detection method comprises steps: capturing an original image; transforming the original image to an HSV color space, and retrieving a hue component (H) and a saturation component (S) of the HSV color space to form an HS-based image; dividing the HS-based image into image blocks; selecting one image block as a background block; using an obstacle recognition equation to determine whether each of the image blocks is similar to the background block; if no, deleting the image block; if yes, preserving the image block to form a binary obstacle image; and overlaying the binary obstacle image on the original image to filter out the background and obtain an initial ambit of an obstacle image. Then, three orderly movement flow equations are used to determine whether it is an obstacle.",
            "AUTOMATIC AIRVIEW CORRECTION METHOD - An automatic airview correction method comprises steps: moving a vehicle to an airview alignment pattern; capturing a plurality of airview alignment images of the surroundings of the vehicle; correcting distortion of the airview alignment images to obtain a plurality of corrected images; performing alignment compensation on the corrected images; searching for corner points of the corrected images and converting view point s to obtain a plurality of view angle-converted images; and searching for corner points of the view angle-converted images, and seaming the view angle-converted images to form a panoramic airview and obtain parameters corresponding to the panoramic airview. The present invention can automatically align images and can also automatically detect corner points to seam the images of the surroundings of a vehicle, whereby to form a panoramic airview."
