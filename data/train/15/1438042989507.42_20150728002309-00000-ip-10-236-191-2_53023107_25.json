As the rookie was being dragged down for a sack, he flung a pass that hit Titans defensive lineman Will Witherspoon in the gut just five yards away. Witherspoon managed to hold on to the ball, then rumbled to the end zone for a 40-yard return and a 17-7 lead with 4:40 left in the first half., 75907=Tennessee responded with a 16-play drive that chewed up more than 10 minutes, but had to settle for Rob Bironas' third field goal of the day -- a 25-yard kick that made it 23-21 with 10:28 remaining in the fourth quarter.}",
