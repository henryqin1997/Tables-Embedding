            "everyone is very involved whether working on campus or student events all around campus. so there is always something fun to do. especially since we are about 15 minutes away from downtown dallas!",
            "you will be challenged in every area of your faith and the weaknesses will come out, but with god all things are possible.",
            "it is a great school if you are a christian, and even if you aren't. they offer excellence in servant leadership that allows you to explore your calling but also be successful in the class room as well."

The GOOD NEWS is that DBU offers other dining options. The patriot cafe serves chipotle-style burritos, tacos, nachos and quesadillas. The bistro in the learning center serves healthy flatbreads, wraps and snacks. There is also a Starbucks on the second floor of the library. They are opening a Chic-Fil-A and Pizza Hut on campus in Fall 2013.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 13 out of 14 people found this review useful. 2 of 71 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anyone interested in pursuing higher education with fellow Christians in a very Christian learning environment. Tips for prospective students Just pray up, and seek God as to if He would have you go here. These guys at DBU prayed over my application, read over it, and sought out God's decision. It's a great school with wonderful people. Bang for the buck Expensive for me, but I know that I serve a God that controls finances. Will enjoy being here Great atmosphere, and the people care. Will learn a lot Looks like a great place to be, and is perfect for pursuing my call",
