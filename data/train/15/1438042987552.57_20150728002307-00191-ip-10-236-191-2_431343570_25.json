            "LITHIUM ION BATTERY - A lithium ion battery capable of maintaining for a long time fire resistance of a nonaqueous electrolytic solution at a time of battery abnormality to secure safety is provided. In the lithium ion battery, two kinds of organic solvent, EC and DEC, are used for mixed organic solvent which forms the nonaqueous electrolytic solution, and liquid flame retardant formed by phosphazene A having a boiling point closely to that of EC and phosphazene B having a boiling point closely to that of DEC is added to the electrolytic solution. At battery abnormality, when the battery temperature goes up due to internal short circuit of positive and negative electrodes caused by melting of separators to decompose each of EC and DEC, the phosphazene A and B, each having the boiling point closely to that of EC and DEC, decompose timely to function, thereby fire resistance of the electrolytic solution can be maintained for a long time to secure safety of the battery at the time of battery abnormality."

The mannooligosaccharide composition is provided by hydrolysis of mannan material. The mannooligosaccharide includes from about 1 to about 10 monosaccharides with at least about 60 weight percent of the monosaccharides being mannose. 09-04-2008 20090063326 Trading System - An object of the invention is to provide a trading system used by agents or the like when placing orders in a trading market system. The trading system has order receiving means; order ID assigning means; event monitoring means for monitoring at least one event and determining whether order conditions have been met; order issuing means for issuing, in the trading market system, order attributes defined on the basis of order attributes; and order attribute definition means for performing processing on the basis of objects when undefined order attributes are included, and returning the results. The order issuing means transfers an object ID included in the undefined order attributes; the order attribute definition means processes the object and returns the results to the order issuing means; and the order issuing means receives the processed results, converts the portion of the undefined order attributes to the processed results, and converts the order attributes to defined order attributes, whereupon",
