Given the improvement in between 1850 and 2000, formula (12) implies that quality-controlled labor hours declined by approximately 20.4 percent. These results support the Job Quality hypothesis that the average hours would have been working approximately 20.4 percent lower in 2000 had the nature of work remained constant since 1850., 5419=Using a unique dataset on labor hours, wages, and nonpecuniary job characteristics from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)4, this study provides empirical evidence suggesting that some job characteristics induce more labor hours than others do. In the aggregate economy, the share of jobs with these characteristics has increased over time, resulting in an improvement in the economy wide Job Quality index. Between 1850 and 2000, the increase in Job Quality contributed to at least 20.4 percent of growth in labor hours in the U.S., 4348=The theory of job quality draws inspiration from observed changes in the nature of work over time and from the heterogeneity in hours by occupation. Table I displays the share of total employment by industry in the United States in 1850, 1920, and in 2000. In 1850, Agriculture made up approximately 58.0 percent of total employment. The percentage decreased to 26.2 percent in 1920, and to 2.9 percent in 2000. The shares of employment in the Manufacturing sector were 12.3 percent, 24.6 percent, and 14.9 percent in the corresponding years. For the retail sector, the corresponding percentages were 8.1 percent, 9.9 percent, and 17.9 percent. Table II, presents the share of employment by occupation in 1850, 1920, and in 2000. In 1850 3.3 percent of total employees were Professionals, the percentage increased to 5.5 percent in 1920 and to 21.1 percent in 2000. Farmers and Farm laborers made up 57.5 percent, 25.8 percent, and 1.7 percent of employment in 1850, 1920, and 2000, respectively.5, 10197=Many economic models featuring labor supply decisions, especially in macroeconomic analysis, assume away heterogeneity in the nature of work, or assume that the nature of work is irrelevant to the labor/leisure choice. This paper studies the macroeconomic implications of relaxing this assumption. Estimation from micro data using labor hours, wages, consumption, and nonpecuniary job characteristics suggests that labor supply responds to differences and to changes in the nature of work. Ceteris paribus, some job characteristics induce more labor hours than others do. Labeling the jobs that embed the labor-inducing characteristics as better quality jobs, the study estimates a Job Quality index for the aggregate U.S. economy from 1850 to 2000. The results suggest that over the same period, improvements in Job Quality accounted for at least 20.4 percent of growth in labor hours., 9001=A well documented regularity of time series variables of the aggregate United States economy is the lack of trend in per capita labor hours. For example, between 1950 and 2000 economic variables such as consumption per capita and GDP per capita nearly tripled. Per capita labor hours, on the other hand, remained relatively stable with no sign of a strong trend. (See Figure I) While this observation is widely accepted among economists nowadays, it was not always expected. In his 1930 essay on the `` Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren'', Keynes predicted an increase in leisure as income rises.1 In other words, with the rise in income, we should have observed a strong downward trend in work hours. This decrease was quite conceivable, but didn't happen., 3079=In the cross-section, there is heterogeneity in average work hours by occupation. Rones, Gardner, and IIg [1997] analyzed trends in hours of work in the United States between 1976 and 1993. The most noteworthy observation is the increase in the share of persons who are working very long hours, exceeding the average workweek by a full eight-hour day. They further find that the long workweek itself is associated with certain types of occupations.6}",

The data in both waves are identical except the second wave's data were collected two years after those of the first. The second wave contains questions on job characteristics for respondents who switched jobs between the two waves. The factor scores for these respondents are constructed as described above. No job characteristics data were collected for respondents who remained in the same job. For these respondents, the factor scores estimated in the first wave are used. In this estimation as in the cross-section, consumption is omitted. In the end, we have data on labor hours, factor scores, time-varying demographics, and pecuniary job characteristics for two waves of data collected approximately two years apart for the same respondents. These data allows us to test how changes in hours between 1992 and 1994 responded to changes in the factor scores, by estimating the following econometric model., 167489=14.\u00a0\u00a0The possible exception is the spouses of the respondents.

The index increased by approximately 0.204. The results imply that the improvement in Job Quality was responsible for at least 20.4 percent growth in average annual labor hours between 1850 and 2000, which corresponds to approximately 0.14 percent of labor hours growth (less than three hours) per year., 62348=Source: Author's calculations from 1 percent Sample of the Census Bureau collected in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series by the Minnesota Population Center.

From 1850 to 1880, the index did not change. Between 1880 and 1950, it improved almost exponentially, and after 1950, it continued to improve at a slower rate. The increase between 1880 and 1900 reflects the shift from Agriculture toward Manufacturing, Transportation, and Retail trade industries. For occupations, the significant shift occurred from Farmers to Machine operatives. Post 1950, the share in employment in Agriculture and Manufacturing declined drastically, and the share of Professional services industry rose. From 1950 on, employment in the Clerical and Professional occupations surged, while employment shares of Farmers and Operative laborers declined. These three phases seem to mark the movement from Agriculture to Manufacturing between 1880 and 1900, and from Manufacturing to Services after 1950., 60353=Source: Author's calculations from 1 percent Sample of the Census Bureau collected in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series by the Minnesota Population Center. (http://www.ipums.org). Industry in all years is redefined by IPUMS to be consistent with the 1950 classification., 42212=First, the aggregate Job Quality measure assumes a constant ranking of industry and occupation cells across time. Sector-biased technological changes could cause quality in an occupation to exceed the Job Quality in occupations previously ranked higher. The assumption appears, however, reasonable. A correlation of the rankings of industry and occupation cells by education (a good proxy for Job Quality) is 0.90. Second, the derived relationship between Job Quality and work hours assumes that a worker in 1850 is identical to a worker in 2000. If the characteristics of workers change over time, this could influence our measured quality effect. Further, and perhaps more importantly, the current Job Quality index fails to account for within-jobs quality improvements. The derived index is entirely based on the reallocation of employment across industries and occupations over time., 30717=The next sensitivity analysis is motivated by potential biases introduced by the choice of the HRS data. This issue is of concern because in the HRS most respondents were born between 1931 and 1941.14 For these reasons, the average age in the sample (55 year of age) exceeds the national average worker's age. To the extent that the Job Quality effect is different for older and younger workers, the coefficient in our sample will not reflect the coefficient obtained using the entire population data. The regression analysis for various age brackets reveals a higher coefficient for younger respondents. For respondents below 55 years of age, the average coefficient is 0.043 and 0.027 for respondents over 55. One possible explanation for these results is that older workers are more experienced and accustomed to their jobs, and hence, tolerate more than younger works. The differences in coefficients for age groups are mostly insignificant. To the extent that differences in coefficients across age groups matter, they indicate a higher coefficient for younger workers, which indicates that our estimate of the quality effect would be higher if the age distribution of workers in the HRS sample were identical to the age distribution at the national level., 60663=Table II. Share of Employment by Occupation in 1850, 1920, and 2000 (percent), 28508=Next, the sample in the Difference model is restricted to the set of respondents who switched jobs between 1992 and 1994. Excluding respondents who didn't change jobs allows more variation in the Job Quality variable and provides a firmer test of whether changes in Job Quality and changes in labor hours co-vary. The estimated coefficient for the Job Quality variable is 0.047. In the next set of sensitivity tests, the sample is split between males and females for both models. The split of the sample allows a test of whether the relationship between Job Quality and labor hours differs by gender. The estimates are identical for men and women., 112907=Table IX. O.L.S.

I use IPMUS decennial data on employment by occupation and industry from 1850 to 2000.15 IPUMS reclassifies occupations and industries based on the census 1950 classification scheme. The reclassification makes the data comparable across years. I match these industry and occupation groups with those of the HRS. In the end, we obtain thirteen industries and eight occupations groups that are comparable between the IPMUS data and the HRS data (see Appendix A for the industry and occupation classification in both datasets)., 141782=Table XIII. Growth in Labor Hours by Occupation due to Improvements in Job Quality between 1850 and 2000 (Percent), 44141=This study presents evidence of the heterogeneity in jobs, and analyzes the implications of this heterogeneity for labor supply. The results indicate that, ceteris paribus, some jobs tend to induce more labor hours. These jobs are prevalent in the services sector and in public administration, and in occupations such as management, professional specialty, sales, administrative, and technical support. Workers in these occupations tend to enjoy higher wages and more generous employer provided benefits packages. The share of employment in these industries and occupations has increased over time, inducing an overall increase in aggregate Job Quality. The increase in labor resulting from the improvement in Job Quality explains, in part, the lack of a strong downward trend in the average work hours in the United States. More precisely, the improvement in Job Quality between 1850 and 2000 accounts for at least 20.4 percent of growth in per capita labor hours. Once we control for changes in quality, we observe a decline in labor hours consistent with a domination of the income effect over the substitution effect., 57703=Table I.
