To return the CRC setting on a POS interface to the 32-bit default setting, use the no form of this command. crc (POS) transmit-delay show interfaces pos pos keepalive (POS) interface pos encapsulation (POS) crc (POS) The real-time POS functionality is performed in hardware, according to the hardware configuration setup. Configured hardware events are detected by the framer application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and the control is passed to the software. The generic POS driver is responsible for providing a mechanism to configure the hardware on a per-interface basis, to handle interface state transitions, and to collect POS-related statistics. In addition to high-bandwidth efficiency, POS offers secure and reliable transmission for data. Reliable data transfer depends on timing integrity. POS provides a method for efficiently carrying data packets in SONET or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) frames. High-bandwidth capacity and efficient link utilization are characteristics that make POS largely preferred for building",
    "textAfterTable": "Release 2.0 This command was introduced. Release 3.2 This command was introduced. Release 4.0.0 This command was introduced. Usage Guidelines CRC is an error-checking technique that uses a calculated numeric value to detect errors in transmitted data. The designators 16 and 32 indicate the length (in bits) of the frame check sequence (FCS). A CRC of 32 bits provides more powerful error detection, but adds overhead. Both the sender and receiver must use the same setting. CRC-16, the most widely used error checking method throughout the United States and Europe, is used extensively with WANs. CRC-32 is specified by IEEE standard 802 and as an option by some point-to-point transmission standards. It is often used on Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) networks and LANs.
