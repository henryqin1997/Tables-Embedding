You pay for every item instead of just swiping per time you go into cafeteria like most colleges. As a freshman you must get a meal plan, your options are 1600 or 1800 dollars per semester. If you don't finish your money you can use some of those points at the convenience store on campus or at one of their Starbucks cafes. The food is about standard for a college campus.}",

It's also good for those who may be more advanced because there are teachers that are very challenging. Most of the professors are still working and have many connections and if you're good enough, they are more than happy to help you out finding opportunities for work life during and after college. Tips for prospective students Visit the campus. It's really a nice place to be. Also, look up all the teachers for the department you're thinking about majoring in and their work. This will be very helpful in determining if there are teachers that can help you grow in the areas that you need. Also look up the instructors in other departments",
