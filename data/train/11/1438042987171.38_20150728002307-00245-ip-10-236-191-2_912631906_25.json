Trust me. Am enjoying being here I like the school and all. but everybody is doing something. I don't really have friends. I am pretty much by myself, but then again I am not a bubbly person that just go up to people. Other than that PSC is a enjoyable place. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot it PSC.
