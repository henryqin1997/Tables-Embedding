The call flow is for a vertical handoff of an MSS 1310 from an 802.16 BS 1350 to an 802.11 AP 1370. The following description is made under the assumption that the 802.11 AP 1370 has been registered as an MSS to the 802.16 BS 1350.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{138083=If the vertical handoff is decided, the MSS generates a 802.16 HO_REQ message and transmits it to the 802.16 BS in step 1515 and monitors reception of an HO_RSP message in step 1517., 21094=This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119 to an application entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Implementing Handoff between Heterogeneous Networks in a Wireless Communication System\u201d filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jun. 23, 2005 and assigned Serial No. 2005-54416, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 137020=Upon receipt of the VHO response message, the MSS determines whether the VHO response message acknowledges the VHO request in step 1419. If the VHO request is not acknowledged, the MSS returns to step 1411. If the VHO request is acknowledged, the MSS releases an existing connection form the 802.11 AP and associates with the 802.16 BS in step 1421., 134778=The AP 1370 responds to the BS 1350 with an HO-notification-response message in step 1323 and the BS 1350 transmits an HO-notification-confirm message to the AP 1370 in step 1325., 37366=Horizontal Handoff Between IEEE 802.16 BSs In the IEEE 802.16 network, initialization between a base station (BS) and a subscriber station (SS) (or MSS) is based on IEEE 802.16-2004 and horizontal handoff is implemented in compliance with the IEEE 802.16e draft., 132326=The BS 1270 responds to the HO-notification message with an HO-notification-response message to the AP 1250 in step 1229 and the AP 1250 transmits an HO-notification-confirm message to the BS 1270 in step 1231. In step 1232, the AP 1250 transmits a VHO response message for the VHO request message to the MSS 1210., 136207=In the case of a vertical handoff from an 802.11 AP to an 802.16 BS, an MSS associated with the 802.11 AP acquires a signal from a neighbor 802.16 BS by scanning in step 1411 and decides on a vertical handoff by a vertical handoff determination algorithm in step 1413. In generation, the MSS decides on the vertical handoff by comparing the received signal strength of a serving BS with those of neighboring BSs. If the vertical handoff is not available, the MSS returns to step 1411., 136745=If the vertical handoff is determined, the MSS generates a VHO request message (refer to Table 16) and transmits it to the 802.11 AP in step 1415 and monitors reception of a VHO response message (refer to Table 17) in step 1417., 134295=The MSS 1310 transmits an 802.11 MSSHO_REQ message to the BS 1350 in step 1317. The AP 1370 is set as a target BS. Upon reception of the MSSHO_REQ message, the BS 1350 determines the handoff target and if the target is an 802.11 AP, converts the MSSHO_REQ message to an HO-notification message in step 1319. In step 1321, the BS 1350 transmits the HO-notification message to the AP 1370., 132736=The AP 1250 then dissociates from the MSS 1210 in step 1233. Hence, the MSS 1210 associates with the BS 1270 by initial ranging in step 1235 and performs initialization through authorization, registration and IP connection in step 1237. The authorization or IP connection may not be performed because the 802.16 BS 1270 already has knowledge of the MSS 1210., 135032=Meanwhile, the AP 1370 transmits a BSHO_RSP message for the MSSHO_REQ message to the MSS 1310 in step 1327. The MSS 1310 transmits an HO_IND message to the BS 1350 in step 1329. In step 1331, the BS 1350 releases an existing connection form the MSS 1310. Later, the MSS 1310 associates with the AP 1370 by exchanging association request and response messages in step 1333. Since, the BS 1350 provides information about authorization, registration, and IP connection to the AR 1370, there is no need for re-setting the information., 137689=In the case of a vertical handoff from an 802.16 BS to an 802.11 AP, an MSS associated with the 802.16 BS acquires a signal from a neighbor 802.11 AP by scanning in step 1511 and decides on a vertical handoff by a vertical handoff determination algorithm in step 1513. If the vertical handoff is not available, the MSS returns to step 1511., 138312=Upon reception of the HO_RSP message, the MSS determines whether the HO_RSP message acknowledges the vertical handoff request in step 1419. If the vertical handoff request is not acknowledged, the MSS returns to step 1511. If the vertical handoff request is acknowledged, the MSS releases an existing connection form the 802.16 BS and associates with the 802.11 AP in step 1521., 131828=In step 1221, the MSS 1210 acquires a signal from the BS 1270 by scanning and decides on a vertical handoff to the BS 1270. The MSS 1210 then transmits a VHO request message (refer to Table 16) to the AP 1250 in step 1223. The AP 1250 converts the VHO request message to an 802.16 HO-notification message in step 1225 and transmits the HO-notification message to the BS 1270 in step 1227.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, they are merely exemplary applications. For example while the embodiments of the present invention have been described focusing on handoff between an 802.11 WLAN and an 802.16 broadband wireless network, the present invention is easily applicable to handoff between the broadband wireless network and any other network interworkable with the broadband wireless network. Therefore, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. As described above, the present invention provides a vertical handoff technique between an 802.11 WLAN and an 802.16 broadband wireless network. Since, the present invention supports the 802.11-802.16 vertical handoff, handoff between heterogeneous networks efficiently applies to a network with 802.11 and 802.16 networks being coexistent. Upon reception of the HO_RSP message, the MSS determines whether the HO_RSP message acknowledges the vertical handoff request in step 1419. If the vertical handoff request is not acknowledged, the MSS returns to step 1511. If the vertical handoff request is acknowledged, the MSS releases an existing connection form the 802.16 BS and associates with the 802.11 AP in step 1521. If the vertical handoff is decided, the MSS generates a 802.16 HO_REQ message and transmits it to the",
