Because a shared secret is not configured specifically for client 10.1.1.1, it will inherit the shared secret specification, which is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccisco\u00e2\u0080\u009d, from the global RADIUS proxy configuration. Client 10.2.2.2 will use \u00e2\u0080\u009csystems\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the shared secret and will use the default ports for listening for accounting and authentication packets., 205872=(Optional) Specifies the relative priority of the traffic class.

Command Default Specifies the default AAA method list to which the authentication request will be sent. default Specifies the AAA method list to which the authentication request will be sent. list-name (Optional) Specifies that authentication will be performed using an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) method list. aaa list Specifies that user authentication will be performed on the contents of the varname value, if present. varname (Optional) Authenticates using the contents of the varnamevalue instead of the unauthenticated username. If you do not specify an aaa list, the default AAA authentication list is used. variable",
    "textAfterTable": "Usage Guidelines The authenticate command configures an action in a control policy map. Control policies define the actions the system will take in response to specified events and conditions. A control policy map is used to configure an ISG control policy. A control policy is made of one or more control policy rules. A control policy rule is an association of a control class and one or more actions. The control class defines the conditions that must be met before the actions will be executed. The actions are numbered and executed sequentially within the policy rule. Note that if you specify the default method list, the default list will not appear in the output of the show running-config command. For example, if you configure the following command:  Router(config-control-policymap-class-control)# 1 authenticate aaa list default  the following will display in the output for the show running-config command:  1 authenticate Named method lists will display in the show running-config command output. Examples The following example shows an ISG configured to initiate an authentication request upon account logon. The authentication request will be sent to the AAA method list called AUTH-LIST.  policy-map type control LOGIN class type control",
