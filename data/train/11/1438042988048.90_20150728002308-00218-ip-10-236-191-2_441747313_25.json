            "MAGNETIC SENSOR AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREOF - The present invention relates to a magnetic sensor with which magnetic characteristics are made extremely stable by consideration of an area of contact of a base layer of a magnetic substance and a semiconductor substrate. On a semiconductor substrate a plurality of Hall elements are embedded so as to be coplanar to a top surface of the semiconductor substrate while being mutually spaced apart by a predetermined distance, and above the Hall elements and the semiconductor substrate, a base layer, having a coefficient of thermal expansion differing from that of the Hall elements and partially covers a region of each Hall element, is formed via a protective layer, and a magnetic flux concentrator, having an area larger than the base layer and with magnetic amplification, is formed on the base layer.",
            "MAGNETIC SENSOR AND SENSITIVITY MEASURING METHOD THEREOF - The present invention relates to a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity measuring function and a method thereof. Magnetic sensitivity surfaces detect flux density, and a switching unit extracts magnetic field intensity information of each axis, and inputs it to a sensitivity calculating unit. The sensitivity calculating unit calculates the sensitivity from the magnetic field intensity information about the individual axes from the magnetic sensitivity surfaces. The sensitivity calculating unit includes an axial component analyzing unit for analyzing the flux density from the magnetic sensitivity surfaces into magnetic components of the individual axes; a sensitivity decision unit for deciding the sensitivity by comparing the individual axial components of the magnetic field intensity from the axial component analyzing unit with a reference value; and a sensitivity correction unit for carrying out sensitivity correction in accordance with the sensitivity information from the sensitivity decision unit."

The bonding layer is provided on the outer surface side of one insulating substrate. The strain suppressing plate has rigidity higher than that of the insulating substrate to suppress the strain caused by curving the insulating substrate. The strain suppressing plate is fixed to the insulating substrate by the bonding layer. 11-26-2009 20100053759 ANTIREFLECTION COATING AND DISPLAY DEVICE - An antireflection coating is formed on a transparent substrate and includes an Al film having a transmittance of lower than 10% at a wavelength of 550 nm with a thickness of 25 nm and predominantly composed of aluminum (Al), and an Al\u2014N film formed in at least one of an upper layer and a lower layer of the Al film, having a transmittance of equal to or higher than 10% at a wavelength of 550 nm with a thickness of 25 nm, predominantly composed of Al and at least containing a nitrogen (N) element as an additive. A specific resistance of the antireflection coating is equal to or lower than 1.0\u00d710 03-04-2010 20120020056 DISPLAY DEVICE AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING",
