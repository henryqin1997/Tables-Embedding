    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30690=Quarterback - Carson Palmer comes off another fine season and seemed to have a down 2006 mainly because so many other quarterbacks had career best seasons. His touchdown totals are slightly declining and that could happen again this year since the Bengals want to establish the run better than they did last year. T.J. Houshmandzadeh and Chad Johnson both return and even Johnson says he will not be a distraction and will play out his contract (for at least one more year). Even Chris Henry is rumored to return but the Bengals would be fine without him since they used the NFL draft to load up on wideouts. Training camp is important for Palmer to get some chemistry going with Jerome Simpson and Andre Caldwell if only for future seasons., 69892=Use of this website constitutes acceptance of it's Privacy Notice and Terms of Use. \u00a9 2015 THEHUDDLE.COM. Part of USA TODAY Sports Digital Properties., 21405=Running Backs - The Ravens added Willis McGahee last year and said their goodbye to Jamal Lewis but the results were almost identical. In fact McGahee had two less touchdowns than Lewis did in 2006. What was even worse was that the coaching staff felt that McGahee wasn't capable of being an every down back and there were questions about his conditioning. That all led the Ravens to draft Ray Rice with their second round pick. McGahee has already skipped some voluntary camps this year and now Rice has been impressive enough to merit more than mere relief work. McGahee remains the primary back to be sure, but Rice has the chance in the preseason to gain more playing time and even up to being a true tandem backfield. Rice is a definite one to watch in August. He is small at 5'8\" but he's both quick and powerful., 34249=Running Backs - This will be an interesting year for the running backs though it may not show up so much in training camp. Rudi Johnson returns from his first injury-marred season and even Chris Perry has regained his health. The intention is that the duo reprise 2005 when they combined for a formidable backfield with Johnson rushing and Perry mainly receiving. But given the injury history of the two - particularly Perry - it is likely that the two will not get much work in preseason games and scrimmages if only to keep them healthy. That'll likely make Kenny Watson look like he is going to be a bigger factor than he will (unless Perry and/or Johnson are injured again)., 54926=Quarterback - There is not a lot to work on for Ben Roethlisberger who returns to the same set of receivers and may have an even better rushing game this year. There are plans in training camp to get Roethlisberger to release the ball faster since he was sacked 47 times last year but that won't show up much in camp. Big Ben comes off a very solid season and only needs to refresh before the season starts. Roethlisberger was 3rd in the NFL last year with 34 passing scores but the rushing game was horrible at scoring in 2007. The Steelers drafted line-buster Rashard Mendenhall so Big Ben will likely score less this year., 63839=Training Camp Fantasy Angle - The Steelers have an interesting camp to follow even if it will be mostly to see what 2009 might bring. Rashard Mendenhall has a chance to get more playing time if he can show up big in camp and preseason games though Parker will hold the primary role no matter what. Limas Sweed will be interesting to watch and while there may not be a lot of room for him this year, Sweed can work his way onto the field and become a factor in the endzone if the Steelers elect to take advantage of his height. If he runs a few fade routes in preseason games, consider it a positive sign., 60837=Wide Receivers - Hines Ward returns from a season of nagging injuries but he remains the starter and possession receiver. Santonio Holmes has his breakout last year with eight scores and 942 yards so the only opening left is the slot which likely will be manned by Nate Washington again this season. But the Steelers made a play for the future by drafting Limas Sweed and his 6'4\" height could become a factor in the endzone and middle of the field if only in future seasons. Sweed is a replacement for Plaxico Burress that has taken years to happen. Sweed is worth watching in dynasty leagues but 2008 is not likely to hold much fantasy value. What will be ideal is if Sweed can show an ability to go over the middle and take the ball away from defenders and hold onto it when hit. Sweed should get a lot of work in the preseason., 58365=Running Backs - This could be one of the most interesting units to watch in the NFL this summer. The Steelers installed a new offense last year and Parker rushed for 1316 yards on 321 carries. That was #4 in rushing yards and #3 in rushing attempts. But Parker only scored twice last year. That led the Steelers to draft Rashard Mendenhall for at least the short yardage and goal line carries. Parker remains the starter - he has rushed for more than 1200 yards in each of the last three seasons - but Mendenhall will also be involved. Training camp and preseason games should help give a clue as to whether Mendenhall remains purely relief and goal line duty or if he may have a bigger role. Parker is returning from a broken leg but has nothing to prove - he should stick to staying healthy and let Mendenhall get more work., 23876=Wide Receivers - The Ravens are in a rebuilding year and elected to start out with quarterback and running back. They made no moves in the free agency market for any of the ball-handling position and left the wide receivers as is from last year. That means Derrick Mason remains the lone certain starter but he is on the down-side of the career and can only make the possession catches. There will be a competition for the #2 between Mark Clayton and Demetrius Williams with the taller Williams most likely to win the starting spot since OC Cam Cameron prefers larger wideouts (Williams is 6'2\" while Clayton is only 5'10\"). This unit hasn't been much for fantasy value other than Mason starting out 2007 with an obscene amount of catches but even he cooled down. The new offense won't be hitting on all cylinders to start with so training camp is important, especially if the starting quarterback ends up to be Joe Flacco.}",
