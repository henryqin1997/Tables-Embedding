            "I went to NCCU and WSSU and they both were EXPENSIVE as I don't know what! I don't have to use but one loan to get me through the semester. With me having no job I an grateful for the loans, I just wish it could be forgivable. Other than that you get what you pay for and I mean it!",

            "There is no dorm life because it is a community college!",
            "I wish that some of the classes were more challenging and then I wish that the challenging classes were more easy! I am in 3 classes right now which all are online but one is hybrid so I have to go to class as well!",
            "Be prepared for whatever your teacher throws at you! STUDY, STUDY, STUDY! Always, and I mean ALWAYS go to class!",
            "Forsyth Tech is a good school to go to is all you want are the basics of post-secondary education. I would not recommend taking online classes unless you have taken them before and have done exceptionally well because you can get distracted very easily. Overall, the classes are a little easier than university/college courses!"

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who will flourish at Forsyth Tech: Independent students who are looking for variety. The student body at Forsyth Tech is incredibly diverse. In one class, you can have international students, a mother of four, a man who is 65, a more traditional college student and a high school student. Inevitably, you will encounter people from all walks of life. Students who want to be as debt-free as possible. Students who are looking for flexibility or have to fit school around work or family. Forsyth Tech offers a variety of online and evening courses, as well as courses at satellite locations (King, Kernersville, etc.). If you enjoy diversity, independence, and new opportunities, Forsyth Tech is the school for you. Tips for prospective students The most important tip is to go into Forsyth Tech with an open mind. It sounds cheesy, but most people view (including me, at first) view community college as second rate and go into it not expecting to learn a thing. This community college is an excellent place to attend school. Also, be sure to plan your courses ahead of time. While Forsyth Tech offers a good place to explore different career paths, don't do a class blitz and register for everything that sounds appealing. Go into registration with some sort of plan. Also, register early. It will make sure you",
