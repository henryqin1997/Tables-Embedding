            "Very high presence around campus. Always willing to help",
            "There are sororities and fraternities on campus, but I do not know too much about them.",
            "Plenty of activities to do all semester long. You'll never find a dull day at CSI",
            "CSI is great for those interested in student life and building networks. Also, great for the academics-first mind.",
            "The most economically-friendly school in the nation. Half the tuition (at least) of surrounding private institutions. In the most prime location.",
            "Participating in the many student life events and clubs, working out or playing some ball at the Sports and Recreation Center. Even taking the Staten Island Ferry shuttle and hopping over to Manhattan (the city)",
            "It is no 5 star dining experience, but it definitely satisfies the hunger in between classes",
            "We have dorms opening up this fall semester. Personally, as most of the student body, I live at home and commute with no plans to dorm. We expect the dorms to become a large attraction on campus.",
            "We are not any Ivy League school...yet. We are up and coming in technology with pivotal research as well.",
            "Remember no matter what school you attend, you get out of your education what you put into it. If you are strongly considering an institution, go see it before you commit.",
            "One of the smartest decisions you can make as a student."

The school was originally the Willowbrook State School, which was a state institute for individuals with mental disabilties.

    "textAfterTable": "Currently not in any. Great for these types of students Working students, older students, those that are budget minded, students who want to stay close to home yet complete a 4 year degree, driving students, though a lot of buses stop at the main entrance Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Sitting on the grass is actually encouraged but most people don't do it, it's a shame, the main lawns are great. There is a small wooded pathway between building 1P & it's parking lot that is nice to walk through during the summer & fall. Bang for the buck Great value considering the tuition costs of my previous school beinge $36,000+ I definately feel more comfortable with tuition being in the $2500-$3000 range. What to do for fun Ummm... I usually drive off campus, the mall is nearby, so are a lot of stores, banks, restaurants since the campus is located near some of the biggest intersections on the island. Food and Dining Never ate on campus, but I hear the food in the Cafe and Dining Hall is pretty decent. Dorm Life",
