The running of Jason Snelling and Turner continued to move the chains, and Turner powered his way in for a two-yard TD at the 5:26 mark of the third., 51480=Ryan caught Dallas' secondary asleep and hit Weems for a 30-yard score with 5:07 to play. Folk's 34-yard kick made it a three-possession game less than three minutes later to account for the final margin., 50418=Romo ended the half by buying enough time with his feet and hitting Crayton for a five-yard touchdown to finish off a 10-play, 63-yard march that gave the hosts a 17-7 lead at the break., 51104=Austin had another big grab early in the fourth quarter, as his 27-yard reception set up Folk's 46-yard field goal with 10:10 remaining in the game.}",
