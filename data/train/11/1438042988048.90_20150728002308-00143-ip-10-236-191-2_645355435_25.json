All other measurements, such as chest and hip, remain the same. Please refer to our new, updated Women's Size Chart for details.

Hemp is an alternative natural fiber that\u2019s cultivated with low impact on the environment. It requires no irrigation, uses no pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, and is harvested and processed by hand. It\u2019s one of the most durable natural fibers on the planet, and results in a fabric with a wonderful drape, comparable to linen. Unfortunately, industrial hemp is illegal to grow in most parts of the world because government agencies continue to associate it with marijuana. We currently import our high-quality hemp from China, and continue to hope that it might someday",
