When the router is reloaded, the specified Cisco IOS image is loaded onto the GRP card and automatically downloaded to all the line cards., 340127=Loads a Cisco IOS software image on a line card from Flash memory or the GRP card on a Cisco 12000 series GSR., 300023=To load a Cisco IOS software image on a line card from Flash memory or the GRP card on a Cisco 12000 series Gigabit Switch Router (GSR), use the microcode command in global configuration mode. To load the microcode bundled with the GRP system image, use the no form of this command., 331766=To reload the Cisco IOS image from a line card on Cisco 12000 series routers, use the microcode reload command in global configuration mode., 333129=(Optional) Slot number of the line card that you want to reload the Cisco IOS software image on. Slot numbers range from 0 to 11 for the Cisco 12012 and from 0 to 7 for the Cisco 12008 router. If you do not specify a slot number, the Cisco IOS software image is reloaded on all line cards., 307240=In addition to the Cisco IOS image that resides on the GRP card, each line card on a Cisco 12000 series has a Cisco IOS image. When the router is reloaded, the specified image is loaded onto the GRP card and then automatically downloaded to all the line cards., 360045=This command was introduced in diagnostic mode. The command can be entered in both privileged EXEC and diagnostic mode on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers., 337839=Issuing a microcode reload command on any of the line cards in a Cisco 12000 GSR immediately returns the console command prompt. This allows you to issue a subsequent command immediately to the reloading line card. However, any commands entered at this time will not execute, and often no indication will be given that such a command failed to run. Verify that the microcode has reloaded before issuing new commands., 337080=For additional information on GSR configuration, refer to the \u201cObserving System Startup and Performing a Basic Configuration\u201d chapter in the Cisco 12000 series installation and configuration guides., 385999=RPR+ mode is not supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers., 311751=Reloads microcode on Cisco 12000 series GSRs., 359606=This command was modified and implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Routers. The following enhancements were made:, 386087=Cisco IOS Release 12.2XNE and 1000 Series Routers, 385646=The Cisco ASR 1006 Router supports a second Route Processor. The second Cisco IOS process can run only on the standby Route Processor. This means that hardware redundancy is available and RPR and SSO do not need to be configured by the user because a second Cisco IOS process is available by default on the Cisco ASR 1006 router., 380686=This command was modified. This command was implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers., 148835=This command was implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers., 306523=This command was introduced for Cisco 12000 series GSRs., 33332=The maximum number of entries retained in the configuration log. Valid values range from 1 to 1000. The default value is 100 entries., 304156=(Optional) Slot number of the line card that you want to copy the software image to. Slot numbers range from 0 to 11 for the Cisco 12012 router and 0 to 7 for the Cisco 12008 router. If you do not specify a slot number, the Cisco IOS software image is downloaded on all line cards., 385029=For Cisco ASR 1002 and 1004 routers, RRP and stateful switchover can be used to switch between Cisco IOS processes. RPR and SSO need to be configured by the user, however, because a second Cisco IOS process is not available by default on Cisco ASR 1002 and 1004 routers. Enter the redundancy command in global configuration mode to enter redundancy configuration mode. You can enter the mode command within redundancy configuration mode.}",

Usage Guidelines The Cisco IOS software uses the value of this command to determine when to pause during multiple-screen output. Not all commands recognize the configured screen length. For example, the show terminal command assumes a screen length of 24 lines or more. Examples In the following example, the terminal type is specified and the screen pause function is disabled for the terminal connection on line 6:  Router(config)# line 6 Router(config-line)# terminal-type VT220 Router(config-line)# length 0 Related Commands Command Description",
