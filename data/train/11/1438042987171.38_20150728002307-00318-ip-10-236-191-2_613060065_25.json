    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{64228=The Devil 6700 follows current gaming requirements for the display and features an LED-backlit 1920x1080 16:9 aspect display. The GeForce GTX 680M is one of the few graphics cards we have tested that does not have problems with Full HD in games. Other high-end models such as the GeForce GTX 660M frequently stutter due to the extreme processing power required to smoothly render the over two million pixels per cycle required for Full HD rendering. Pictures and movies also benefit from the razor-sharp reproduction of the Full HD display and multi-window operation is also comfortable., 75223=On the other hand, the Wi-Fi module is the Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230 module which supports 802.11b/g/n as well as the latest Bluetooth 4.0. According to Intel, this card supports Wi-Fi Direct, Smart Connect, and Wireless Display (WiDi) technologies. The optionally available Killer Wireless N module does not include Bluetooth support., 6380=While the GTX 680M\u2019s memory bandwidth of 115.2 GB/s is considerably lower than the contending HD7970M\u2019s 153.6 GB/s bandwidth based on 2048 MB GDDR5 VRAM on a 256-bit bus, this is hardly noticeable during practical use. As well, the GTX 680M features 3.5 times the shader units as its lower-priced Kepler brother, the GTX 660M, with 1344 CUDA cores as opposed to 384., 534=The GeForce GTX 680M performed perfectly in the Unigine Heaven benchmark at 1280x1024. However, the Radeon HD 7970M performed 12 percent better with 80.1 fps compared to the GTX 680M\u2019s 71.6 fps. For further comparison, the GTX 675M came in 35 percent behind the 680M with 47.2 fps and the GTX 670M was 45 percent slower with 39 fps. For this test, we used the ForceWare 302.75 GPU driver., 81196=Naturally, a notebook with premium equipment also carries a premium price tag. It is not surprising that the Devil 6700 starts at 1029 Euro ($1250). However, our lavishly equipped test device (the complete specifications are provided on the right) costs just under 1800 Euro ($2190)., 82645=For the graphics card, DevilTech allows the buyer to choose between the Fermi-based GeForce GTX 670M\u00a0and GTX 675M or the latest Kepler-based GeForce GTX 680M. The latter is currently the most powerful Nvidia card and is capable of competing with the AMD Radeon HD 7970M. An additional highlight is the inclusion of two hard disk slots. To fill these slots, the user can choose between physical hard drives ranging in size from 500 to 1000 GB, hybrid drives (SSH) that use both physical drives and flash memory ranging in size from 500 to 750 GB, and Intel-, Corsair-, and Samsung-built solid state drives (SSDs) ranging in size from 120 to 512 GB., 59383=This high image quality is due to the Devil 6700\u2019s high-end LG Philips screen. We already tested the LP156WF1-TLF3 display module, most recently in the MSI GE60\u00a0and\u00a0DevilTech Fire DTX. For the Devil 6700, we observed a good average brightness of just under 250 cd/m2 and a 522:1 contrast ratio which are above average for notebooks., 5188=It should be noted that the GTX 680 desktop card is significantly faster due to its higher 1 GHz core clock and 3 GHz memory clock as well as having more shader potential with 1536 CUDA cores., 83848=While the Devil 6700 only allows for a 15.6-inch matte display, other components can be customized. Currently, the range of options includes seven different processors. Amongst dual-core options, the buyer can choose various Core i3, i5, and i7 processors including the i5-3210M,\u00a0i5-3320M, and\u00a0i7-3520M. However, gamers are more likely to choose one of the available quad-core processors such as the attractively priced Core i7-3610QM\u00a0or the top-of-the-line Core i7-3920XM. The notebook has four memory slots, allowing a total system memory size of 4 to 32 GB of DDR3-1600 RAM., 75616=The Devil 6700 uses a Qualcomm Atheros Killer e2200 network adapter that is specifically built for gamers. According to the manufacturer, intelligent data packet management provides the user with optimal online performance while gaming. The included Network Manager is well-structured and provides various information and settings options., 6784=The GeForce GTX 680M GPU has DirectX 11.1 support, uses a PCIe 3.0 interface, and a specified 100 Watt TDP. The high-end GK104 chip codenamed \u201cN13E-GTX\u201d is built on the cutting-edge 28 nanometer process. The specifications leave no room for complaint with 3.54 billion transistors and a gigantic 4096 MB GDDR5 video memory clocked at 1800 MHz.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{116697=Out of the 18 games we tested, only Metro 2033, where we observed a jerky 24 fps at 1920x1080 in high settings, pushed the graphics card to its limits. Other popular games such as Skyrim,\u00a0Max Payne 3, and\u00a0Battlefield 3\u00a0were\u00a0playable without restriction.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "While this performance level is impressive, Nvidia charges a significant premium for this top model. The 400 Euro ($490) premium is steep even for hardcore games. AMD\u2019s price policy is considerably fairer. However, it should be noted that AMD\u2019s Enduro technology, designed to compete with Nvidia Optimus, is still extremely unsophisticated and struggles with a bad detection ratio and all variety of bugs. The HD 7970M also generally needs a lot more care. In direct competition with the Radeon HD 7970M, there is no clear winner. A chart at the end of the review shows the relative frame rates of both the GTX 680M and the HD 7970M. Although certain differences are seen depending on the game, both GPUs are essentially equally powerful. By comparison, the aging Fermi models fall considerably short. The GTX 680M surpassed the GTX 675M\u00a0by 50 percent and broke away from the\u00a0GTX 670M\u00a0by 80 percent. Out of the 18 games we tested, only Metro 2033, where we observed a jerky 24 fps at 1920x1080 in high settings, pushed the graphics card to its limits. Other popular games such as Skyrim,\u00a0Max Payne 3, and\u00a0Battlefield 3\u00a0were\u00a0playable without restriction. The Devil 6700 demonstrates that the mobile sector is closing in on the desktop market due to the 28 nanometer process of mobile graphics cards. The Nvidia\u00a0GeForce GTX 680M\u00a0supplies enough power to render",
    "textAfterTable": "Emissions Case fan System Noise While the Devil 6700 features impressive performance, this performance comes at the cost of noise. At a distance of 15 cm (5.9 in), we measured a clearly audible 35 dB noise level despite the use of the integrated Intel GPU and being idle. The fan remained active even after longer periods of idle and easily drowned out the storage device. By comparison, the Alienware M17x R4\u00a0settled to a quiet 31 dB despite equal performance. Under load, the Devil 6700 became increasingly louder as the Nvidia GPU sprang into action. In 3DMark06, we measured a noise level of 48 dB, likely too loud for some users. Clevo\u2019s competing P170EM barebones system was a bit quieter in this test\u00a0at approximately 45 dB. As if this were not loud enough, the notebook registered an annoyingly loud level of 50 dB during full load. By comparison, the DVD writer\u2019s noise level was rather unspectacular.
