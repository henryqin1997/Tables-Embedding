A consumer 1201 has a trust relationship 1209 with Bank 1 1206. The consumer is a credit card holder and the bank issues the card. In addition, the consumer 1201 has another trust relationship 1219 with an ISP 1202 in this case the consumer holds a trust token (here, smart card 1220) issued by the ISP 1202. With this smart card, the consumer is able to check the integrity of the ISP platform 1202 and the ISP is able to check the identity of the consumer 1201 essentially as described above with reference to FIG. 5 (in particular). The ISP 1201 has a trust relationship 1210 with Bank 1 1206 as it is a client of the bank. The ISP 1202 also has a trust relationship 1221 with a vendor 1203. When the consumer 1201 wants to buy goods from the vendor 1203, he contacts the ISP 1202, 1211, checks the integrity of the ISP platform and gets a temporary identity and session key from the ISP. The consumer then contacts the vendor 1203 by using this temporary identity and session key. Because of the trust relationship with the ISP the vendor is able to verify whether the ISP issued the temporary identity and session key or not. If asked to authorise a transaction, the ISP 1202 contacts Bank 1206 via a gateway 1205, 1214, 1215 to authorise the payment from the consumer's account. If the verification is successful, the vendor will deliver the goods to the consumer 1218.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44991=The other main components of the host computer 100 attached to the PCI bus 225 include: a SCSI (small computer system interface) adaptor connected via a SCSI bus 235 to a hard disk drive 2600 and a CD-ROM drive 2605; a LAN (local area network) adaptor 250 for connecting the host computer 100 to a LAN 125, via which the host computer 100 can communicate with other host computers (not shown), such as file servers, print servers or email servers, and the Internet 130; an 10 input/output) device 225, for attaching the keyboard 110, mouse 115 and smartcard reader 120; and a trusted device 260 (which incorporates the trusted display processor function). The trusted display processor handles all standard display functions plus a number of further tasks, which will be described in detail below. \u2018Standard display functions\u2019 are those functions that one would normally expect to find in any standard host computer 100, for example a PC operating under the Windows NT\u2122 operating system, for displaying an image associated with the operating system or application software., 27260=The subject matter of the present application may also be related to the following U.S. patent applications: \u201cTrusted Identities on a Trusted Computing Platform,\u201d Ser. No. 10/208,716, filed Jul. 29, 2002; and \u201cMethod and Apparatus for User Profiling,\u201d Ser. No. 10/241,893, filed Sep. 12, 2002., 35681=An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example. A part of the system of this preferred embodiment is a client platform will be described which contains a trusted component, the trusted component allowing secure and reliable interaction with the client platform by users or other parties communicating with the client platform. Such a trusted component is described below, but is more fully described in the applicant's copending International Patent Application No. PCT/GB 00/00528 entitled \u201cTrusted Computing Platform\u201d filed on 15 Feb. 2000 and incorporated by reference herein. The trusted component in the client platform also controls the client platform display, so the user can be confident that what is seen on the display has not been subverted by an unauthorised process operating on the client platform. This aspect of the trusted component is also described below, but is more fully described in the applicant's copending International Patent Application No. PCT/GB 00/01996 entitled \u201cSystem for Digitally Signing a Document\u201d filed on 25 May 2000 and incorporated by reference herein. The system also employs in preferred embodiments a trusted token personal to a user\u2014in the embodiment described in detail here, the trusted token is a user smart card. In addition, in the embodiment described, not only the client platform but also the server contains a trusted component (though this does need to have trusted display functionality)., 80309=Additionally, or alternatively, in some embodiments it may be required that the user profile is encrypted and signed to protect privacy and integrity. If so, a secure data transfer protocol may be needed between the trusted device 260 and the smart card 122. There exist many available mechanisms for transferring secure credentials between two entities. A possible implementation, which may be used in the present embodiment, is secure key transport mechanisms from ISO/IEC DIS 11770-3, \u201cInformation technology\u2014Security techniques\u2014Key management\u2014Part 3: Mechanisms using asymmetric techniques\u201d, International Organization for Standardization, March 1997.}",

The skilled man will appreciate that the use of hardware to ensure confidence in trusted relationships allows for a particularly effective method for brokering transactions as shown above, by allowing trusted relationships to be leveraged without proliferation of exchanges of personal information.
