As a result, there is no simple way to estimate how many users can be supported by a given number of servers. Therefore, make sure that you conduct testing in your own environment before you deploy SharePoint Server 2010 in a production environment., 65610=The following table shows the maximum throughput test results of adding front-end Web servers for InfoPath list operations in SharePoint Server 2010., 75876=1202, 61840=The following graph shows the maximum throughput for different InfoPath submit operations on different front-end topologies. SharePoint Server 2010 submit and save scale to two front-end Web servers. However, a farm running five document library submit forms in parallel can achieve more throughput with four front-end Web servers than a single document library with four front-end Web servers. A farm will generally have more than one InfoPath solution that is deployed. This result means that one of those individual solutions will reach maximum throughput at four front-end Web servers. However, the collective throughput of all the solutions can scale beyond four front-end Web servers.
