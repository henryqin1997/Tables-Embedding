            "BATTERY POWERED, HANDHELD LUBRICATION GUN WITH DISPLAY - A battery-powered, handheld grease gun for dispensing lubricant. A pump mechanism driven by a motor is in communication with the lubricant and has a supply port for dispensing the lubricant at a lubrication point. A sensor monitors the pump mechanism of the motor. A display displays information indicative of the monitored condition of the device, such as volume of lubricant dispensed. A processor responsive to operator input selectively energizes the motor to drive the pump mechanism to dispense lubricant.",
