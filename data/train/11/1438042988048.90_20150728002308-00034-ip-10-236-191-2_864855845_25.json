The Bronx has the Yankees (American League) and Queens has the Mets (National League) of Major League Baseball. The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn, while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island. Yet three of the four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan. The New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883\u2014except for 1889, when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island, and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911\u2014until they headed west with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season.[252] The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Highlanders, named for Hilltop Park, where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912. The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season, where they were officially christened the New York Yankees, remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River in 1923 to Yankee Stadium.[253] The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963, their first two seasons, before Shea Stadium was completed in 1964.[254] After the Mets departed, the Polo Grounds was demolished in April 1964, replaced by public housing.[255][256], 300342=Starting in the mid-19th century, the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the Five Points neighborhood, an area between Broadway and the Bowery, northeast of New York City Hall. By the 1820s, the area was home to many gambling dens and brothels, and was known as a dangerous place to go. In 1842, Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen.[281] The area was so notorious that it even caught the attention of Abraham Lincoln, who visited the area before his Cooper Union speech in 1860.[282] The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang was one of the country's first major organized crime entities., 174566=Manhattan is one of the highest-income places in the United States with a population greater than one million. As of 2012[update], Manhattan's cost of living was the highest in the United States,[163] but the borough also contained the country's most profound level of income inequality.[164] Manhattan is also the United States county with the highest per capita income, being the sole county whose per capita income exceeded $100,000 in 2010.[165] In 2012, The New York Times reported that \"the income gap in Manhattan, already wider than almost anywhere else in the country, rivaled disparities in sub-Saharan Africa. ... The wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites made more than 40 times what the lowest fifth reported, a widening gap (it was 38 times, the year before) surpassed by only a few developing countries\".[166], 168494=At the 2010 Census, there were 1,585,873 people living in Manhattan, an increase of 3.2% since 2000. Since 2010, Manhattan's population was estimated by the Census Bureau to have increased 3.2% to 1,636,268 as of 2014, representing 19.3% of New York City's population and 8.3% of New York State's population.[1][158] As of the 2000 Census, the population density of New York County was 66,940 per square mile (25,846/km\u00b2), the highest population density of any county in the United States.[159] If 2012 census estimates were accurate, the population density then approximated 70,518 people per square mile (27,227/km\u00b2). In 1910, at the height of European immigration to New York, Manhattan's population density reached a peak of 101,548 people per square\u00a0mile (39,208/km\u00b2)., 306815=During Manhattan's early history, wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires. In 1776, shortly after the Continental Army evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British, a massive fire broke out destroying one-third of the city and some 500 houses.[288], 34972=The name Manhattan derives from the word Manna-hata, as written in the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on Henry Hudson's yacht Halve Maen (Half Moon).[51] A 1610 map depicts the name as Manna-hata, twice, on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River (later named the Hudson River). The word \"Manhattan\" has been translated as \"island of many hills\" from the Lenape language.[52], 209346=Manhattan's most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The borough's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine for Manhattan, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.[197] Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion,[198] while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.[199], 58343=New York City played a complex role in the American Civil War. The city's strong commercial ties to the American South,[83] its growing immigrant population (prior to then largely from Germany and Ireland; beginning in the late 1850s waves of Italian; and Central, and Eastern European Jews began flowing in en-masse), anger about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to pay $300 to avoid service, led to resentment against Lincoln's war policies, plus the racial element, fomented paranoia about free Blacks taking the poor immigrant's jobs,[84] culminated in the three-day-long New York Draft Riots of July 1863. These intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history, with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred.[85], 318635=MTA New York City Transit offers a wide variety of local buses within Manhattan under the brand New York City Bus. An extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters and other travelers heading into Manhattan. The bus system served 784 million passengers citywide in 2011, placing the bus system's ridership as the highest in the nation, and more than double the ridership of the second-place Los Angeles system.[303], 211947=Lower Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall share trading value and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013.[12] The NYSE MKT (formerly the American Stock Exchange, AMEX), New York Board of Trade, and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) are also located downtown. In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[200], 72106=By the 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeting to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence under greater control.[100] The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market.[101] Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy., 69604=The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[96][97], 178518=As of 2010, 59.98% (902,267) of Manhattan residents, ages five and older, spoke only English at home, while 23.07% (347,033) spoke Spanish, 5.33% (80,240) Chinese, 2.03% (30,567) French, 0.78% (11,776) Japanese, 0.77% (11,517) Russian, 0.72% (10,788) Korean, 0.70% (10,496) German, 0.66% (9,868) Italian, 0.64% (9,555) Hebrew, and 0.48% (7,158) African languages as a main language. In total, 40.02% (602,058) of Manhattan's population, ages 5 and older, spoke a language other than English at home.[170], 279282=Since 1990, the largely powerless Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Manhattan's current Borough President is Gale Brewer, elected as a Democrat in November 2013 with 82.9% of the vote.[269] Brewer replaced Scott Stringer, who went on to become New York City Comptroller., 339027=Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[319] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel.[320] The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[321] President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.[322] The Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn., 44161=It was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson, an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, that the area was mapped.[56] Hudson came across Manhattan Island and the native people living there in 1609, and continued up the river that would later bear his name, the Hudson River, until he arrived at the site of present day Albany.[57], 270485=The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.[257] The New York Knicks started play in 1946 as one of the National Basketball Association's original teams, playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory, before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home.[258] The New York Liberty of the WNBA have shared the Garden with the Knicks since their creation in 1997 as one of the league's original eight teams.[259] Rucker Park in Harlem is a playground court, famed for its streetball style of play, where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league.[260], 93035=Early in the 19th century, landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street.[117] When building the World Trade Center in 1968, 1.2\u00a0million cubic yards (917,000\u00a0m\u00b3) of material was excavated from the site.[118] Rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street, creating Battery Park City.[119] The result was a 700-foot (210-m) extension into the river, running six blocks or 1,484 feet (452\u00a0m), covering 92\u00a0acres (37\u00a0ha), providing a 1.2-mile (1.9\u00a0km) riverfront esplanade and over 30\u00a0acres (12\u00a0ha) of parks.[120], 101885=According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a \"slightly lower hazard for tall buildings\" in Manhattan than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near New York City, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[131], 53062=From January 11, 1785, to the fall of 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall.[74] Federal Hall was also the site of where the United States Supreme Court met for the first time,[75] the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified,[76] and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, establishing measures for adding new states to the Union.[77], 333888=Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan, and the grid's skew of approximately 28.9\u00a0degrees, is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as Manhattanhenge (by analogy with Stonehenge).[314] On separate occasions in late May and early July, the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines, with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level.[314][315] A similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in January and December., 277953=The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court's 1964 \"one man, one vote\" decision.[268], 272220=Though both of New York City's football teams play today across the Hudson River in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, both teams started out playing in the Polo Grounds. The New York Giants played side-by-side with their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football League in 1925, until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956.[261] The New York Jets, originally known as the Titans, started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds, staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in Queens in 1964.[262], 280072=Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, has been the District Attorney of New York County since 2010.[270] Manhattan has ten City Council members, the third largest contingent among the five boroughs. It also has twelve administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents. As the host of the UN, the borough is home to the world's largest international consular corps, comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates.[271] It is also the home of New York City Hall, the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor of New York City and the New York City Council. The mayor's staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, completed in 1916, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.[272], 265876=Manhattan is home to the NBA's New York Knicks, the NHL's New York Rangers, and the WNBA's New York Liberty, who all play their home games at Madison Square Garden, the only major professional sports arena in the borough. The New York Jets proposed a West Side Stadium for their home field, but the proposal was eventually defeated in June 2005, leaving them at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey., 208159=In 2010, Manhattan's daytime population was swelling to 3.94 million, with commuters adding a net 1.48\u00a0million people to the population, along with visitors, tourists, and commuting students. The commuter influx of 1.61\u00a0million workers coming into Manhattan was the largest of any county or city in the country,[195] and was more than triple the 480,000 commuters who headed into second-ranked Washington, D.C.[196], 68835=Returning World War II veterans created a postwar economic boom, which led to the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans, including Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town, which opened in 1947.[94] In 1951, the UN relocated from its first headquarters near Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan.[95], 227429=Manhattan had approximately 520 million square feet (48.1 million m\u00b2) of office space in 2013,[219] making it the largest office market in the United States.[220] Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the nation based on office space,[221] while Lower Manhattan is the third-largest (after Chicago's Loop).[222][223], 85226=On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction in the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor,[106] severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents[107] and leading to gasoline shortages[108] and disruption of mass transit systems.[109][110][111][112] The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.[113], 219084=On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, with the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology capital.[209][210], 56409=New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and, later, with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada.[78][79] By 1810 New York City, then confined to Manhattan, surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.[80], 225400=Real estate is a major force in Manhattan's economy, and indeed the city's, as the total value of all New York City property was assessed at US$914.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year.[214] Manhattan has perennially been home to some of the nation's, as well as the world's, most valuable real estate, including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value in the city in 2006 at US$1.1\u00a0billion,[215] to be subsequently surpassed in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, for US$1.95 billion.[216] When 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for US$510\u00a0million, about US$1,589 per square foot (US$17,104/m\u00b2), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887/m\u00b2) based on the sale of 660 Madison Avenue.[217] In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price.[218], 233342=The oldest public-access television cable TV channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971, offers eclectic local programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming.[227] NY1, Time Warner Cable's local news channel, is known for its beat coverage of City Hall and state politics., 10360=Manhattan is often said to be the economic and cultural center of the United States[2][3][4] and serves as home to the United Nations Headquarters.[5] Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world,[6][7][8][9][10] and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[11][12] Many multinational media conglomerates are based in the borough. Historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for the equivalent of US$1050,[13] Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world, with the value of Manhattan Island, including real estate, estimated to exceed US$3 trillion in 2013.[14][15], 215598=Silicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high tech enterprises,[202] utilizing the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, game design, financial technology (\"fintech\"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by the New York City metropolitan area's venture capital investments, amounting to over US$3.7 billion across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises in the first half of 2015,[203] and its entrepreneurship ecosystem. High technology startup companies and employment, which are growing mostly in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens,[204] and elsewhere in the region, are bolstered by New York City's position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines,[205] New York's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.[206] Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.[207] As of October 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector,[208] with a significant proportion in Manhattan., 332228=\"Crosstown traffic\" refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan's East Side and Manhattan's West Side. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, absence of express roads other than the Trans-Manhattan Expressway at the far north end of Manhattan Island, and only 4 crosstown roads for travel through Central Park, which is between 59th Street and 110th Street. Proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city's densest neighborhoods, namely the Mid-Manhattan Expressway and Lower Manhattan Expressway, did not go forward. The congestion makes Manhattan's crosstown buses the perennial \"winners\" of the \"Pokey Awards\" for slowest service in New York City., 82228=On September 11, 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center, and the towers subsequently collapsed. 7 World Trade Center collapsed due to fires and structural damage caused by heavy debris falling from the collapse of the Twin Towers. The other buildings within the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished. The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage to other surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, and resulted in the deaths of 2,606 people, in addition to those on the planes. Since 2001, most of Lower Manhattan has been restored, but there has been controversy surrounding the rebuilding. However, many rescue workers and residents of the area developed several life-threatening illnesses that have led to some of their subsequent deaths.[103] A memorial at the site was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, and the museum opened in 2014. In 2014, the new One World Trade Center, at 1,776\u00a0feet (541\u00a0m) and formerly known as the Freedom Tower, became the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere,[104] while other skyscrapers were under construction at the site., 94956=One neighborhood of New York County is contiguous with the mainland. Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan.[121] Before World War I, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.[122], 50535=The Dutch Republic regained it in August 1673 with a fleet of 21 ships, renaming the city \"New Orange\". New Netherland was ceded permanently to the English in November 1674 through the Treaty of Westminster,[70] in exchange for Run Island which was the long-coveted last link in the Dutch nutmeg trading monopoly in Indonesia.[71], 185707=The skyscraper, which has shaped Manhattan's distinctive skyline, has been closely associated with New York City's identity since the end of the 19th century. From 1890\u20131973, the world's tallest building was in Manhattan (with a gap between 1901\u201308, when the title was held by Philadelphia City Hall), with nine different buildings holding the title.[174] The New York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title in 1890, standing 309 feet (94\u00a0m) until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.[175] The nearby Park Row Building, with its 29 stories standing 391\u00a0feet (119\u00a0m) high took the title in 1899.[176] The 41-story Singer Building, constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer, stood 612\u00a0feet (187\u00a0m) high until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished.[177] The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, standing 700 feet (210\u00a0m) at the foot of Madison Avenue, wrested the title in 1909, with a tower reminiscent of St Mark's Campanile in Venice.[178] The Woolworth Building, and its distinctive Gothic architecture, took the title in 1913, topping off at 792 feet (241\u00a0m).[179], 321113=New York's iconic yellow taxicabs, which number 13,087 city-wide and must have the requisite medallion authorizing the pick up of street hails, are ubiquitous in the borough.[305] Various private transportation network companies compete in Manhattan with each other and with the city's taxicabs. Manhattan also sees tens of thousands of bicycle commuters. The Roosevelt Island Tramway, one of two commuter cable car systems in North America, whisks commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan in less than five minutes, and has been serving the island since 1978. (The other system in North America is the Portland Aerial Tram.)[306][307] The Staten Island Ferry, which runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, annually carries over 21 million passengers on the 5.2-mile (8.4\u00a0km) run between Manhattan and Staten Island. Each weekday, five vessels transport about 65,000 passengers on 109 boat trips.[308][309] The ferry has been fare-free since 1997, when the then-50-cent fare was eliminated.[310], 84390=The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[105], 344563=Manhattan, surrounded by two brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water. To satisfy the growing population, the city of New York acquired land in Westchester County and constructed the old Croton Aqueduct system, which went into service in 1842 and was superseded by the new Croton Aqueduct, which opened in 1890, but this was interrupted in 2008 for the construction since underway of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant that can supply an estimated 290 million gallons daily when completed, representing almost a 20% addition to the city's availability of water, with this addition going to Manhattan and the Bronx.[327] Water comes to Manhattan through New York City Water Tunnel No. 1, Tunnel No. 2, and Tunnel No. 3, completed in 1917, 1936, and (Manhattan's supply) 2013,[328] respectively., 220038=The biotechnology sector is also growing in Manhattan based upon the city's strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30\u00a0million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000\u00a0square feet (65,000\u00a0m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100\u00a0million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.[211], 230934=The television industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox, as well as Univision, are all headquartered in Manhattan, as are many cable channels, including MSNBC, MTV, Fox News, HBO and Comedy Central. In 1971, WLIB became New York's first black-owned radio station and the crown jewel of Inner City Broadcasting Corporation. A co-founder of Inner City was Percy Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president and long one of the city's most powerful black leaders.[225] WLIB began broadcasts for the African-American community in 1949 and regularly interviewed civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and aired live broadcasts from conferences of the NAACP. Influential WQHT, also known as Hot 97, claims to be the premier hip-hop station in the United States. WNYC, comprising an AM and FM signal, has the largest public radio audience in the nation and is the most-listened to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan.[226] WBAI, with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio stations operating in the United States., 64866=The construction of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s, Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans as part of the Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century.[90] Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.[91], 46589=A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on the citadel of Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam).[59][60] Manhattan Island was chosen as the site of Fort Amsterdam, a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals; its 1625 establishment is recognized as the birth date of New York City.[61] According to a letter by Pieter Janszoon Schagen, Peter Minuit and Dutch colonists acquired Manhattan on May 24, 1626 from unnamed American Indian people, which are believed to have been Canarsee Indians of the Lenape,[62] in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders,[13] often said to be worth US$24, though (by comparing the price of bread and other goods) it actually amounts to around US$1,050 in 2014.[63] According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.[64], 188461=The Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky, with three separate buildings pursuing the world's tallest title in the span of a year. As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, two developers publicly competed for the crown.[180] At 927 feet (283\u00a0m), 40 Wall Street, completed in May 1930 in an astonishing eleven months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan, seemed to have secured the title.[181] At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, auto executive Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build the structure's trademark 185-foot (56\u00a0m) high spire in secret, pushing the Chrysler Building to 1,046 feet (319\u00a0m) and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929.[182] Both buildings were soon surpassed, with the May 1931 completion of the 102-story Empire State Building with its Art Deco tower soaring 1,250 feet (380\u00a0m) to the top of the building. The 203-foot (62\u00a0m) high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height of the building to 1,453\u00a0ft (443\u00a0m).[183][184], 13810=New York County is the most densely populated county in the United States, and is more dense than any individual American city.[16] It is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a Census-estimated 2014 population of 1,636,268[1] living in a land area of 22.83\u00a0square miles (59.13\u00a0km2),[17] or 71,672 residents per square mile (27,673/km\u00b2). On business days, the influx of commuters increases that number to over 3.9 million,[18] or more than 170,000 people per square mile. Manhattan has the third-largest population of New York City's five boroughs, after Brooklyn and Queens, and is the smallest borough in terms of land area.[19], 207295=Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City, with its 2.3\u00a0million workers in 2007 drawn from the entire New York metropolitan area accounting for almost two-thirds of all jobs in New York City.[193] In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in Manhattan (New York County) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States.[194] Manhattan's workforce is overwhelmingly focused on white collar professions, with manufacturing nearly extinct., 172825=In 2000, 56.4% of people living in Manhattan were White, 17.39% were Black, 14.14% were from other races, 9.40% were Asian, 0.5% were Native American, and 0.07% were Pacific Islander. 4.14% were from two or more races. 27.18% were Hispanic of any race., 341533=Manhattan has three public heliports. US Helicopter offered regularly scheduled helicopter service connecting the Downtown Manhattan Heliport with John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey before going out of business in 2009.[323], 191850=In 1961, the Pennsylvania Railroad unveiled plans to tear down the old Penn Station and replace it with a new Madison Square Garden and office building complex. Organized protests were aimed at preserving the McKim, Mead & White-designed structure completed in 1910, widely considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the architectural jewels of New York City.[187] Despite these efforts, demolition of the structure began in October 1963. The loss of Penn Station\u2014called \"an act of irresponsible public vandalism\" by historian Lewis Mumford\u2014led directly to the enactment in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is responsible for preserving the \"city's historic, aesthetic, and cultural heritage\".[188] The historic preservation movement triggered by Penn Station's demise has been credited with the retention of some one million structures nationwide, including nearly 1,000 in New York City.[189], 314044=Manhattan is unique in the U.S. for intense use of public transportation and lack of private car ownership. While 88% of Americans nationwide drive to their jobs, with only 5% using public transport, mass transit is the dominant form of travel for residents of Manhattan, with 72% of borough residents using public transport to get to work, while only 18% drove.[294][295] According to the United States Census, 2000, 77.5% of Manhattan households do not own a car.[296], 273377=The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since their founding in the 1926\u20131927 season. The Rangers were predated by the New York Americans, who started play in the Garden the previous season, lasting until the team folded after the 1941\u20131942 NHL season, a season it played in the Garden as the Brooklyn Americans.[263], 176395=Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001.[167] The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 as of 2014, nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census.[168], 171010=The New York City Department of City Planning projects that Manhattan's population will increase by 289,000 people between 2000 and 2030, an increase of 18.8% over the period, second only to Staten Island, while the rest of the city is projected to grow by 12.7% over the same period. The school-age population is expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, in contrast to a small decline in the city as a whole. The elderly population is forecast to grow by 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide.[160], 277335=Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter, which has provided for a strong mayor-council system since its revision in 1989.[267] The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Manhattan., 127411=Temperature records have been set as high as 106\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 9, 1936, and as low as \u221215\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 9, 1934., 274091=The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League played their home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons, starting in 1974. In 1975, the team signed Pel\u00e9, officially recorded by FIFA as the world's greatest soccer player, to a $4.5\u00a0million contract, drawing a capacity crowd of 22,500 to watch him lead the team to a 2\u20130 victory.[264] The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium were in dreadful condition though and as the team's popularity grew they too left for Yankee Stadium, and then Giants Stadium. The stadium was demolished in 2002 to make way for the $45\u00a0million, 4,754-seat Icahn Stadium, which includes an Olympic-standard 400-meter running track and, as part of Pele's and the Cosmos' legacy, includes a FIFA-approved floodlit soccer stadium that hosts matches between the 48 youth teams of a Manhattan soccer club.[265][266], 346258=Manhattan witnessed the doubling of the natural gas supply delivered to the borough when a new gas pipeline opened on November 1, 2013.[329], 15128=Many districts and landmarks in Manhattan have become well known, as New York City received a record 56 million tourists in 2014,[20] with Manhattan hosting three of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal.[21] Times Square, iconified as \"The Crossroads of the World\"[22][23][24][25][26] and \"The Center of the Universe\",[27][28][29] is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[30] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[31][32] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[33] The borough hosts many world-renowned bridges, skyscrapers,[34] and parks. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.[35][36][37][38] The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.[39][40] Numerous colleges and universities are located in Manhattan,[41] including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.[42][43] The city of New York was founded at the southern tip of Manhattan,[14] and the borough houses New York City Hall, the seat of city government[44] and a National Historic Landmark that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[45][46][47], 61033=In 1883, the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge established a road connection across the East River. In 1874, the western portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County from Westchester County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was annexed.[88] In 1898, when New York City consolidated with three neighboring counties to form \"the City of Greater New York\", Manhattan and the Bronx, though still one county, were established as two separate boroughs. On January 1, 1914, the New York state legislature created Bronx County, and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries.[89], 296035=The United States Postal Service operates post offices in Manhattan. The James Farley Post Office in Midtown Manhattan is New York City's main post office.[279] It is located at 421 Eighth Avenue, between 31st Street and 33rd Street. The post office stopped 24-hour service on May 9, 2009, due to decreasing mail traffic.[280], 292788=No Republican has won the presidential election in Manhattan since 1924, when Calvin Coolidge won a plurality of the New York County vote over Democrat John W. Davis, 41.20%\u201339.55%. Warren G. Harding was the most recent Republican presidential candidate to win a majority of the Manhattan vote, with 59.22% of the 1920 vote.[275] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 82.1% of the vote in Manhattan and Republican George W. Bush received 16.7%.[276] The borough is the most important source of funding for presidential campaigns in the United States; in 2004, it was home to six of the top seven ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions.[277] The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the United States presidential election for all presidential candidates, including both Kerry and Bush during the 2004 election.[278], 190851=The former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were located in Lower Manhattan. At 1,368 and 1,362\u00a0feet (417 and 415\u00a0m), the 110-story buildings were the world's tallest from 1972, until they were surpassed by the construction of the Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears tower located in Chicago).[185] One World Trade Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.[186], 59811=The rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France.[86][87] The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization., 51684=Manhattan was at the heart of the New York Campaign, a series of major battles in the early American Revolutionary War. The Continental Army was forced to abandon Manhattan after the disastrous Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. The city became the British political and military center of operations in North America for the remainder of the war.[72] Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York during the British military rule that followed. British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783, when George Washington returned to Manhattan, as the last British forces left the city.[73], 49132=In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as the last Dutch Director General of the colony.[65] New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653.[66] In 1664, the English conquered New Netherland and renamed it \"New York\" after the English Duke of York and Albany, the future King James II.[67] The Dutch, under Director General Stuyvesant, successfully negotiated with the English to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer, which sought to retain for the extant citizens of New Netherland their previously attained liberties (including freedom of religion) under new colonial English rulers.[68][69], 261346=The borough has a place in several American idioms. The phrase a New York minute is meant to convey a very short time, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in \"perhaps faster than you would believe is possible\". It refers to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan.[248] The term \"melting pot\" was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908.[249] The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source of the phrase \"23 skidoo\" or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building.[250] The \"Big Apple\" dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City's racetracks and named his racing column \"Around The Big Apple.\" Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.[251], 346639=The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible for garbage removal.[330] The bulk of the city's trash ultimately is disposed at mega-dumps in Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio (via transfer stations in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Queens) since the 2001 closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island.[331] A small amount of trash processed at transfer sites in New Jersey is sometimes incinerated at waste-to-energy facilities. Like New York City, New Jersey and much of Greater New York relies on exporting its trash to far-flung areas., 42214=The area that is now Manhattan was long inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano\u00a0\u2013 sailing in service of the French king Francis I\u00a0\u2013 was the first European to visit the area that would become New York City. He entered The Narrows aboard his ship La Dauphine and named the land around Upper New York Harbor \"New Angoul\u00eame\", in reference to the family name of Francis I of France that was derived from Angoul\u00eame in France; he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the Hudson River which he referred to in his report to the French king as a \"very big river\"; and he named Upper New York Bay the Bay of Santa Margarita\u00a0\u2013 after Marguerite de Navarre\u00a0\u2013 the elder sister of the king.[54][55], 66139=On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers. The disaster eventually led to overhauls of the city's fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.[92], 171787=According to the 2009 American Community Survey,[161] the average household size was 2.11, and the average family size was 3.21. Approximately 59.4% of the population over the age of 25 have a bachelor's degree or higher. Approximately 27.0% of the population is foreign-born, and 61.7% of the population over the age of 5 speak only English at home. People of Irish ancestry make up 7.8% of the population, while Italian Americans make up 6.8% of the population. German Americans and Russian Americans make up 7.2% and 6.2% of the population respectively.[162], 169754=According to 2012 Census estimates, 65.2% of the population was White, 18.4% Black or African American, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 12.0% Asian, and 3.1% of two or more races. 25.8% of Manhattan's population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race. Manhattan has the second highest percentage of non-Hispanic Whites (48%) of New York City's boroughs, after Staten Island (where non-Hispanic Whites make up 64% of residents).[1], 8727=Manhattan /m\u00e6n\u02c8h\u00e6t\u0259n/ is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City. The borough is coterminous with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683 as an original county of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem Rivers, but also includes several small adjacent islands, as well as Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the mainland., 342644=Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison to all of Manhattan. Con Edison's electric business traces its roots back to Thomas Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company, the first investor-owned electric utility. The company started service on September 4, 1882, using one generator to provide 110\u00a0volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers with 800 light bulbs, in a one-square-mile area of Lower Manhattan from his Pearl Street Station.[324] Con Edison operates the world's largest district steam system, which consists of 105\u00a0miles (169\u00a0km) of steam pipes, providing steam for heating, hot water, and air conditioning[325] by some 1,800 Manhattan customers.[326] Cable service is provided by Time Warner Cable and telephone service is provided by Verizon Communications, although AT&T is available as well., 307288=The rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions of Manhattan, especially the Lower East Side, densely packed with recent arrivals, crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing. Tenements were usually five-stories high, constructed on the then-typical 25x100 lots, with \"cockroach landlords\" exploiting the new immigrants.[289][290] By 1929, stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential buildings, were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively ended the tenement as a form of new construction, though many tenement buildings survive today on the East Side of the borough.[290], 302002=As Italian immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs, including Al Capone, who got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang.[283] The Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) first developed in the mid-19th century in Sicily and spread to the East Coast of the United States during the late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration. Lucky Luciano established Cosa Nostra in Manhattan, forming alliances with other criminal enterprises, including the Jewish mob, led by Meyer Lansky, the leading Jewish gangster of that period.[284] From 1920\u20131933, Prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor, upon which the Mafia was quick to capitalize.[284], 254901=Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.[240], 223935=Tourism is vital to Manhattan's economy, and the landmarks of Manhattan are the focus of New York City's visitors, who were estimated to number 55 million by the end of 2014.[20] According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013\u20132014 season, an increase of 11.4% from US$1.139 billion in the 2012\u20132013 season; attendance in 2013\u20132014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012\u20132013 season's 11.57 million.[212] Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014, a 10% increase from 2013.[213], 303706=As in the whole of New York City, Manhattan experienced a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s.[285] Since 1990, crime in Manhattan has plummeted in all categories tracked by the CompStat profile.

It also has twelve administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents.
