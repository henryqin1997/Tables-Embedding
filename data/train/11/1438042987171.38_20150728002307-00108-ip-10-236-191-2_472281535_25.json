Thanks to the line driver and high resolution, it is an excellent choice for high-precision position and speed control applications. The cables of the ENX encoder are configurable in seven lengths, from 50 mm to max. 1000 mm, 102296=Description: Encoder signals transmitter (IF60) and receiver (IF61) through optical fibers Suitable for use with Line Driver (RS-422) and Push-Pull (HTL) incremental encoders and sensors Immune to electromagnetic (EMI) and radio frequency (RFI) interference Safe transmission of encoder signals up to 2000 m, 93616=Description: The TTL outputs of some incremental encoders can sink (pull down) less than 4mA and source (pull up) less than 200uA. The PC5 is a small, plug-in RS-422 cable driver board that drives long cables up to 1000 feet using differential signalling to provide improved noise immunity. The PC5 can be used, 25060=Description: The DMC-1500 stand-alone controller with RS232 is a member of the Legacy Series, a prior generation of general-purpose controllers with a widely installed base. For new applications, Galil recommends the new generation, Optima series DMC-2100 stand-alone controller with RS232/Ethernet connectivity.}",
