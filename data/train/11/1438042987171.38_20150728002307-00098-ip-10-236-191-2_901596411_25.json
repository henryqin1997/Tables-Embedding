            "If you like being near a city, having many things to do outside of school as well as enjoying in school events, this school is for you. Very open school community that works with all sorts of personalities, there is always something here for you!",
            "If you are planning on coming here from a 2 year college or even straight from high school, GMU will make the transition process quick and easy for you. The counselors are very understanding, and extremely helpful as well as nice. Going here will be one of the best decision in your life!",
            "Since i did look over two other school, VT and UVA vs. GMU, i realized that for the cost GMU was quite a bit lower per credit, even though its in a very accessible area and the classes teach you more advanced material. Another factor i looked at, is that I can live at home while attending school, thus saving me a drastic amount of money as opposed to living in a dorm, of course we must factor in cost of gas/insurance and time due to not having the ability to walk to class from your dorm.",
            "Although I do not live on campus as GMU is mostly a commuter school, i feel at home whenever I'm on campus. From staff, admins, to the counselors and students, everyone makes you feel at home, and it gives you that feeling inside that makes you proud to be a Mason student. I've enjoyed every minute since I've been here, with all of the clubs and events that go on, there is never a time where you can be bored!",
            "After going to a community college for 2 years and obtaining my Associates degree, my next plan was to choose a good 4 year university that would fit me needs. I look at Virginia Tech, UVA and George Mason, and for a technical major such as IT Security, GMU had a rather innovative path for prospective students. As I'm currently enrolled in the program, I've learned much more than i have ever thought i would, and I've spoken with many professionals currently in the field. I've let them know what I've learned and what I'm currently doing in these classes and they are rather surprised by the advanced skill set GMU has provided me with. I'm extremely pleased with GMU and what they have taught me so far, and I'm also very confident that finding a job with the skill set I've acquired form here will be quite easy."

Just within a year of being here, they have increased meal plan, tuition, unnecessary fees, and dorms are also ridiculously expensive. I project for annual tuition to be about $35,000 by 2017 with they way things are looking., 377232=It was definitely convenient to be on campus because it's very difficult to find a decent parking spot on a Tuesday or Thursday unless you come before 9:30 am. The upperclassmen dorms are nice, but Presidents Park(freshman housing) is pretty bad. Overall I had fun in the dorms and I liked my RAs and roommates, but it's very expensive., 22787=Mason, as it is most commonly referred to, is a great environment and portrays a vibrant campus. The Johnson Center, or the JC, is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and grab a bite to eat, finish up assignments, or get all your textbooks and Mason gear from the bookstore. The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way. And these activities aren't like lame programming because it's run by students. We pick high-profile celebrities for our school concerts and have real fun things to do at events. We've had Kendrick Lamar, Andy Grammar, etc. We've also had ziplining if you're into that. The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does. Tuition, at this point of 2011, is expected to increase 12% over the next two years., 990910=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 881295=In 2010, The Washington Post released an article asking if college was too easy because current students are studying less than previous generations. George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that\u00e2??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it\u00e2??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus. Mason offers shuttles there on weekdays and weekends to the closest metro station which then takes you to D.C. and there are thousands of adventures you can have in D.C. Different organizations around campus also offer a lot of events and you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t necessarily have to be a member of their organization because they are open to everyone., 607908=I have been to George Mason multiple times since deciding I would like to enroll here next August, and the Mason Staff has been nothing but kind to me. The admissions board has always responded to me promptly and been more than willing to accept any and every problem I've thrown at them. I can't wait to come next fall and become a part of the Mason Nation.}",

All races/ethnicities/genders/religions/beliefs are accepted here. It's beautiful! We're like one giant melting pot! Tips for prospective students Get involved! There is so much to choose from at Mason. All of the organizations make themselves well-known with lots of events and lots of ways to help you academically. Also, ask for help when you need it. There are many resources for help with papers, exams or even if you just don't understand the material being taught to you. One of the best types of resources provided is Blackboard where you can chat with your professors and classmates and pretty much any time of the day! And many professors provide extra notes on Blackboard =) Bang for the buck It's a little pricey if you are",
