Burnett, Ivan Nova and 2011 Phil Hughes.\u00a0 That the Yankees subsequently added three pitchers who are probably better options for the rotation than Garcia isn\u2019t his fault, and I\u2019ve seen no evidence that he hasn\u2019t acted professionally even though his short and long-term role on the Yankees has been in doubt.\u00a0 With Michael Pineda out with tendinitis and Andy Pettitte working his way back from retirement, Garcia will open the year in the rotation., 48654=2014 CAIRO Percentile Forecasts Phelps, 72819=The link between the two became indelible when the Yankees traded Montero to Seattle in exchange for Pineda before the 2012 season. At the time, both were considered potential superstars. Now each is a reclamation project. On the day the Mariners demoted Montero to Triple-A Tacoma, Pineda took another halting step toward his much-anticipated debut for the Yankees., 247640=Because of that, the only way I can see the Yankees being competitive in 2013 is going over the $189M payroll target.\u00a0 If they\u2019re not going to do that, I\u2019d suggest rebuilding, but they don\u2019t have anyone trade-able that would help reduce their payroll.\u00a0 Is anyone really going to take Rodriguez or Mark Teixeira off their hands?, 328150=That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all doom and gloom for Nova.\u00a0 Even his xFIP, which corrects for HR/FB rate, was a more than respectable 4.16, which is fine for a middle of the rotation guy.\u00a0 In addition to that, if we go a little deeper into his numbers we can find evidence of the aforementioned genuine development.\u00a0 In this case it\u2019s in his splits through May 28, and his splits afterwards.\u00a0 Why that date?\u00a0 That\u2019s the date his slider appeared to become another weapon., 254590=Michael Pineda has been diagnosed with a right anterior labral tear and will have surgery next Tuesday, May 1., 436614=2012 Projections Sabathia\u2019s the clear #1 starter on the Yankees, and probably their most valuable player right now.\u00a0 Here are his projections for 2012., 345033=The consensus now is that Nova can be a bit better than league average, particularly if you give him a full starter\u2019s workload.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big step up from his projections entering last year and that\u2019s probably a solid #3 in an average MLB rotation, at a cost-controlled salary.\u00a0 I think his 16-4 record in 2011 may lead the MSM and some fans to overrate him, but that\u2019s not his fault.\u00a0 You\u2019d have to imagine the Yankees hope to see him more like a #5 should they get a healthy and effective Phil Hughes and Michael Pineda this year, but I don\u2019t really like the odds of both of those things happening right now., 409059=Baseball Reference: Playing in the AL, For 2011, (requiring WAR_pitch\u00e2\u2030\u00a52), sorted by greatest WAR for Pitchers, 459076=We just knew in the aftermath of Cliff Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spurning and Andy Pettitte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retirement that the Yankees were in real trouble. We wondered if Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia were closer to the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rotation or their AARP cards. We viewed the battle among Colon, Garcia, Sergio Mitre and Ivan Nova for the final two spots in the rotation as, at best, a time filler until gifts arrived before the July 31 deadline., 129763=Pineda could come back healthy and Montero may not be able to catch or improve enough offensively that the Yankees could still end up coming out ahead in this trade.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like the odds of all that coming to pass, but it\u2019s possible.\u00a0 But I suppose we\u2019ll have a bit more data to judge on after 2013., 69198=Whether they have been exceedingly lucky to this point is less important than how good they will be in the future.\u00a0 In the meantime, they are winning real games even if they are not winning spreadsheet games.\u00a0 There are a lot of parallels to the 2012 Orioles, a team that seemed to be fluky for most of the year but ended the year playing about as well as any team in baseball.\u00a0 Of course those Orioles had more young talent and that\u2019s not something the Yankees really have much of right now., 334843=2012 Projections, 386293=2011 Pineda wasn\u2019t a lock to make the Mariners\u2019 rotation out of spring training last year, but he made the team thanks to a good spring training.\u00a0 His first half/second half splits have been beaten to death, but I\u2019ll re-post this table that I posted right after the trade., 560486=CC Sabathia, 220 IP, 5.5 WAR Hiroki Kuroda, 180 IP, 2.3 WAR Michael Pineda, 175 IP, 2.3 WAR Ivan Nova, 175 IP, 1.8 WAR Phil Hughes, 100 IP, 1.1 WAR A.J. Burnett, 100 IP, 0.7 WAR Freddy Garcia, 100 IP, 1.4 WAR Starters, 1050 IP, 15.2 WAR, 132296=I think this confirms that getting to the target of a $189M payroll in 2014 may be the Yankees #1 focus right now, and that\u2019s going to make it a bit harder to build a super team for 2013.\u00a0 Of course, you don\u2019t need a super team to win a World Series, but it helps., 214636=Thursday, September 6, 2012 David Phelps, RHP (3-4, 3.13 ERA) vs. Jason Hammel, RHP (8-6, 3.54 ERA), 48264=I debated whether I should even post these, because the data that was used to build them is pretty much irrelevant at this point.\u00a0 Pineda\u2019s doesn\u2019t have the fastball he had in 2011, and the numbers from last year are meaningless because he was rehabbing and probably not pitching at full strength.\u00a0 Pineda could be pretty good, or he could be horrendous., 10953=Yankees (53-41) @ Twins (51-44) , Friday July 24, 2015 , 8:10 PM (41 Comments - 7/25/2015 5:56:45 pm), 16914=The Moustakas home run was all Pineda would allow in New York\u2019s fifth straight win, a 8-1 triumph over the Royals. The Yankees visited Kansas City to make up a June 9 postponement, and they now head to Detroit to continue a tough stretch that includes 13 games\u2014and four different cities\u2014in 13 days., 83802=Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that the organization is hopeful that the right-hander will be an option at the big league level by June or July., 83648=The 24-year-old Pineda missed all of the 2012 season due to injury after being acquired from the Mariners in January., 449846=A new addition for the pitchers is Steamer.\u00a0 The hitter projections weren\u2019t ready when I started this so I didn\u2019t include them, but according to this article Steamer was the only thing that prevented CAIRO from being the best pitching projection system last year.\u00a0 Steamer is similar to Marcel, but incorporates velocity data as well and it seemed to help it leap to the top of the 2011 projections., 244926=The impact of the Pineda injury is huge.\u00a0 If the Yankees were looking at Pineda as a 3-4 win player, it probably would have helped them move towards the $189 payroll in 2014 that they\u2019ve been eyeing.\u00a0 Not having him for 2012, and possibly never having him, should possibly change the organization\u2019s plans.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it will, but let\u2019s think about it logically., 9750=Yankees (54-42) @ Twins (52-45) , Sunday July 26, 2015 , 2:10 PM (73 Comments - 7/27/2015 3:17:29 am), 560022=CC Sabathia, 220 IP, 5.5 WAR Ivan Nova, 190 IP, 2.0 WAR Phil Hughes, 175 IP, 1.9 WAR A.J.

Hughes, who has been pretty good himself in pitching to a 2.37 ERA over his past three starts, will be a free agent after the season and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure to fit into the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans given the contract he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely command this winter., 214787=Phelps hasn\u2019t been great over his last couple of starts, including his last start against Baltimore where he walked 6 in 4.2 innings.\u00a0 Hammel was the Orioles\u2019 best starter through June 22 with a 2.61 ERA, but he lost effectiveness over his last four starts, probably at least partially due to a knee injury that ended up requiring surgery that put him on the DL on July 13.\u00a0 He\u2019s making his first start since returning from the DL and may be rusty.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hope so., 216718=Sunday, September 9, 2012 Freddy Garcia, RHP (7-6, 5.09 ERA) vs. Zach Britton, LHP (5-1, 4.15 ERA), 407348=I\u2019ve included his 2011 and the league average as frames of reference.\u00a0 League average is based on role (starters vs. relievers), and is not adjusted for park so unlike with hitters mentally adjust that down a bit., 78960=Of course, Pineda never has thrown a pitch for the Yankees. He broke down in spring 2012, needed surgery in May to repair a shoulder tear and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t throw his first simulated inning until Monday. The Yankees have been encouraged by a setback-free recovery. The reports from the simulation were that he topped out in the low 90-mph range and threw well., 351359=CAIRO is actually less sanguine on Nova than the average projection, but that 65% forecast is probably about what you\u2019d expect if he were to repeat his 2011 with a bit less of the good fortune in HR/FB rate and BABIP., 42202=2014 Projections Phelps, 73859=Pineda averaged around 94 mph with his fastball in his only season in MLB in 2011 so seeing that he\u2019s sitting at 93 is pretty encouraging.\u00a0 Of course, he can\u2019t hit so he doesn\u2019t really help the Yankees in their biggest area of weakness, but I\u2019m starting to get excited about his potential return., 129079=The jury is also still out on his defense, but he didn\u2019t really seem to convince most observers that he\u2019ll be capable of being a full-time catcher at the MLB level.\u00a0 Still, he\u2019ll be 23 in 2013 and it\u2019s not hard to imagine him hitting much better with a year of adjustment and additional experience.\u00a0, 41662=Phelps\u2019s 4.98 ERA in 2013 is a bit misleading, as nine of the 48 runs he allowed came in one brutal start in Baltimore.\u00a0 Phelps saw time as a starter and reliever and his FIP of 3.81 was a better indicator of how he pitched for the most part., 525460=Before CC Sabathia, 220 IP, 6.1 WAR Ivan Nova, 190 IP, 2.4 WAR Phil Hughes, 175 IP, 2.8 WAR A.J. Burnett, 175 IP, 2.1 WAR Freddy Garcia, 150 IP, 2.6 WAR Hector Noesi, 50 IP, 0.3 WAR Adam Warren, 25 IP, 0.2 WAR David Phelps, 15 IP, 0.1 WAR Starters, 1000 IP, 16.6 WAR, 40456=2013, 390111=If you go by ERA, Pineda was much worse in the second half (2.58 through July 4, 5.71 after).\u00a0 However, there\u2019s a lot of noise in ERA that isn\u2019t necessarily related to the pitcher\u2019s performance.\u00a0 Every peripheral stat of Pineda\u2019s except for his HR/FB rate and his BABIP was better in the second half, and those are probably the two most volatile stats a pitcher can have., 78524=What might surprise you is Pitcher B is Michael Pineda through his first 14 starts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all for the Mariners in 2011. Here might come another piece of info you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know: Pineda is just 69 days older than Harvey. Still just 24., 385865=In a move that came out of nowhere, the Yankees traded Jesus Montero, their top prospect, for Michael Pineda.\u00a0 Pineda had a very good rookie year for Seattle in 2011, but getting him came at a heavy price.\u00a0 It\u2019ll probably take at least five years to see if the trade was worth it, but it\u2019s already been analyzed and judged heavily and will surely continue to be.\u00a0, 7315=Yankees (57-42) @ Rangers (47-52) , Wednesday July 29, 2015 , 8:05 PM (80 Comments - 7/30/2015 5:34:21 am), 390541=Stats are only part of the story, but what about his stuff? Here are Pineda\u2019s average velocities by pitch type for each month in 2011., 524393=Kuroda? He turns 37 next month. But he gave the Dodgers 202 innings in 2011, going 13-16 with a 3.07 ERA. He\u2019s a competitor with fierce pride., 218171=I realize we feel like the Yankees should be in the postseason every year given their payroll, but it\u2019s kind of fun to have meaningful games in September, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 Living and dying on every pitch for a month is an emotional roller coaster but that\u2019s part of the entertainment factor of baseball, and one we don\u2019t necessarily get enough of as Yankee fans who usually are watching their team set up their postseason rotation over the last few weeks of the year.\u00a0 It\u2019s like an extended version of the postseason., 483546=We really don\u2019t know how good Montero is right now and how good he\u2019ll be in the future.\u00a0 Here were the ranges of his CAIRO projections as a Yankee DH heading into 2012., 151654=I have to admit that I really have no idea how good the 2012 Orioles are.\u00a0 Much has been made of the fact that they\u2019ve been outscored this season, but that ignores the fact that their current roster is not the same as the roster they had earlier in the year.\u00a0 Team talent is not static, and any analysis that assumes that what the Orioles have done all season long is the best way to assess how good they are at this very moment is simplistic and lazy.\u00a0, 75938=It is May, of course, and the Yankees are in Colorado, getting ready to play the Rockies. Back in Tampa, rehabilitating from various injuries, are an impressive collection of Yankee players who, if healthy, could probably win a ballgame without much help from anyone else., 9312=CAIRO\u2019s updated 2015 Final Projected Standings and Postseason Odds as of July 27 (53 Comments - 7/27/2015 5:06:14 pm), 58750=Pineda is one guy I am excited about in 2014.\u00a0 While the track record for pitchers returning from shoulder surgery is not great, there have been some success stories like Anibal Sanchez and I\u2019m hopeful Pineda can be an important part of the Yankees this year., 8510=NY Post: Samardzija? Price? Rival execs insist Yankees will land pitcher (81 Comments - 7/28/2015 8:28:39 pm), 352737=2010 & 2011 Projections, 246761=Maybe they can replace Pineda\u2019s wins with someone from the farm, although at this point it sure doesn\u2019t seem like Dellin Betances or Manny Banuelos are ready and the other arms behind them are either too far away or don\u2019t project to be much more than back-end guys.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have the position player prospects to replace the hole in RF, at least not for 2013.\u00a0 They could use a rotating DH to fill the hole there, but then that necessitates having a backup player or two that you\u2019re comfortable playing in the field every day.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Eduardo Nunez is that guy given his defensive issues and the uncertainty of his offense.\u00a0 Martin\u2019s not making much of a case to be retained, but the falloff from him to some combination of Francisco Cervelli, Austin Romine or Chris Stewart is probably still significant., 248019=As of now the Yankees only have $75M commited to the 2014 payroll.\u00a0 However, that number only includes CC Sabathia, Rodriguez, Teixeira and a $3M Derek Jeter buyout.\u00a0 They\u2019d still have arbitration rights to Gardner, Robertson, Pineda, Ivan Nova, Nunez, Cervelli, Stewart and Ramiro Pena.\u00a0 How many games would that team win?\u00a0, 215911=Saturday, September 8, 2012 CC Sabathia, LHP (13-4, 3.42 ERA) vs. Joe Saunders, LHP (1-1, 4.63 ERA), 58124=Pineda, meanwhile, has not thrown a single big league pitch since the trade due to a shoulder injury. He suffered a torn labrum during spring training 2012 and has been on the mend since, throwing 40 2/3 minor league innings late last summer as he rehabbed. Pineda reported to the Yankees\u2019 complex early for camp and says he\u2019s finally ready to help the team, two years after the trade., 415447=The 65% forecast seems like the bare minimum for what Pineda can do to justify being traded for Jesus Montero, who\u2019s going to win the AL MVP and Cy Young.\u00a0 For whatever it\u2019s worth, since 2000 there have been 21 Yankee pitchers who put up a season of 3.9 WAR or more., 326646=2011 So was Nova lucky?\u00a0 Probably a bit, but we do have some evidence of genuine development.\u00a0 For the majority of pitchers, their effectiveness ties directly into their command of the strike zone.\u00a0 It\u2019s the reason Mariano Rivera has been the best closer of all time, for example.\u00a0 You can look at the percentage of batters a pitcher walks and strikes out (and or their K/BB ratio) as a proxy for strike zone command.\u00a0 But don\u2019t just take my word for it., 279296=Regarding Chris Stewart vs. Francisco Cervelli, it\u2019s a clear offensive downgrade.\u00a0 The question is how defense changes things.\u00a0 If we use Cervelli\u2019s 2011 playing time as an estimate for the 2012 backup catchers, you\u2019re looking at something like 137 PA.\u00a0 Let\u2019s round that up to 200 PA in case Russell Martin misses some more time than expected., 525853=After CC Sabathia, 220 IP, 6.1 WAR Hiroki Kuroda, 182 IP, 3.1 WAR Michael Pineda, 168 IP, 3.2 WAR Ivan Nova, 175 IP, 2.2 WAR Phil Hughes, 100 IP, 1.6 WAR A.J. Burnett, 100 IP, 1.2 WAR Freddy Garcia, 100 IP, 1.7 WAR Starters, 1045 IP, 19.1 WAR, 8124=Yankees (56-42) @ Rangers (47-51) , Tuesday July 28, 2015 , 8:05 PM (119 Comments - 7/29/2015 9:06:53 am), 327842=In 2011, Nova walked 8.1% of the batters he faced and struck out 13.9%.\u00a0 His K/BB ratio of 1.72 was less than stellar, and although he had a decent FIP of 4.01 it was buoyed by a lower than average HR/FB rate, a particularly impressive achievement in DNYS., 390007=A is Pineda through July 4, and B is Pineda afterwards., 467835=But unlike the change-up, which the Yankees believe Pineda will eventually master, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely anyone will ever clone Rivera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cutter. As the Yankees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 closer approaches retirement, the cutter will ride off into the sunset with him. Like some endangered species, the mysterious, awe-inspiring break that has been Rivera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature since 1997 will be nothing more than a memory this time next year.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "\u201cI feel like it,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that all year and we\u2019re [110] games in. It\u2019s about time. Hopefully we can take this momentum home with us this week against the Tigers, get on a little roll and get a winning streak going.\u201d Gardner\u2019s solo shot came off Craig Breslow, putting Esmil Rogers in position to pick up the victory in his Yankees debut. New York took two of the three games in Boston, and Gardner said that he sees signs that the offense is finally getting on track. \u201cIt was a good game for all of us, getting a win,\u201d Drew said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind for three days, but it\u2019s still baseball, so you go out there and do your job. That\u2019s the way I look at it.\u201d Drew had a pair of hits and drove in four runs in his third game against his former club before Brett Gardner gave the Yankees the lead with his career-high 15th home run, powering a wild 8-7 slugfest victory over the Red Sox on Sunday at Fenway Park. BOSTON\u2014The Red Sox wished Stephen Drew well when they dealt him to the Yankees last week, offering a fresh start to his season as he relocated from the home clubhouse to join the visitors\u2019 dugout, but they didn\u2019t expect that he would come back to hurt them so quickly.
