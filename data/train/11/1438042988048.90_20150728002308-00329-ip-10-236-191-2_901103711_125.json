            "Everyday Grossmont College posts on a board fun stuff to do around its campus. There are hundreds of fun things to do such as learning a new language, learning how to play an instrument, sports, art,...etc.",
            "Food and dinning is very clean and delicious. They offer a variety of food options for students to choose from.",
            "Grossmont College does not really offer dormitories to its students. Most community colleges don't offer the dorm life some students seek for.",
            "Most professors have the educational background to teach and pass down their knowledge to their students. Professors stay on point and answer question accordingly and with deep knowledge. Examples are given to facilitate their teaching. Their methods may be confusing at first but at the end of the course most students grasp and pass with a C or better.",
            "Prospective students should be ready and committed to their specific chosen degree. Students should seek help when in doubt and when unsure of what courses are need to be eligible to transfer to a university or private school. Allow some time to study for each course that will be taken. Perspective students should always ask questions to clarify the answers. Students should participate in college activities to gain more experience for when in search of a new job.",
            "Grossmont College allows for a better growth in education. Mostly all professors have great experience in their area of teaching. The campus is remolded to the perspective of the students and allows for us to greatly admire the scenery."

One thing grossmont knows is that many students are coming from high school, which means they are not used to hard work. Grammar is not a big deal, engagement is not a must, an most difficult classes allow curves which help out on transcripts but not as a student., 84561=the food and dining has changed a lot since i first started. i started school at grossmont college in the fall of 2005. things were not as they are now. they have recently remodeled and constructed a new cafeteria. but more than that, they have created a student center where students are able to go get food and still study. this new student center allows students in the food court to feel like they are home., 70371=As an out of state student tuition is of course a bit more expensive for me; however, I really can not complain. As a Veteran I will pay close to $2500 out of my pocket for 12 credit hours. I feel satisfied with the cost especially with the new campus being built., 262134=For only $1500 a semester, this is an amazing institution to start off at. The professors here are just as good at San Diego State and other big campuses, and a lot of the time work at different universities as well., 501810=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
