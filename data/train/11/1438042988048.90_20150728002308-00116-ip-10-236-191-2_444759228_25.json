            "LEAST-SQUARE DECONVOLUTION (LSD): A METHOD TO RESOLVE DNA MIXTURES - Least Square Deconvolution (LSD) uses quantitative allele peak data derived obtained from a sample containing the DNA of more than one contributor to resolve the best-fit genotype profile of each contributor. The resolution is based on finding the least square fit of the mass ratio coefficients at each locus to come closest to the quantitative allele peak data. Consistent top-ranked mass ratio combinations from each locus can be pooled to form at least one composite DNA profile at a subset of the available loci. The top-ranked DNA profiles can be used to check against the profile of a suspect or be used to search for a matching profile in a DNA database.",
