All Rich Release Format file names have an extension (.RRF). The RxNorm Rich Release Format is described in this documentation (usually abbreviated as RXNRRF). Refer to the UMLS Reference Manual for a complete description of the RRF., 38608=The RXNCONSOOCD.RRF, RXNSATOCD.RRF, and RXNSTYOCD.RRF files are being provided as of September of 2009. These files contain information pertaining to the SAB=RXNORM OCD term type atoms that were previously kept in the RXNCONSO.RRF, RXNSAT.RRF, and RXNSTY.RRF files respectively. These RRF files are stored in the 'rrf/ocd' subdirectory of the release package. If a concept in RxNorm contains OCD atoms and active atoms, then it's semantic type value will be contained in both the RXNSTYOCD.RRF and RXNSTY.RRF files., 17414=213684|||2368285|AUI|759|||NDC|MMSL|61646050116|N|| 213684|||2481750|AUI|100385|||NDC|MTHFDA|061646-*501-16|N|| 213684|||2481751|AUI|108916|||NDC|MTHFDA|058716-*327-16|N|| 213684|||1171481|AUI|213684|||NDC|RXNORM|61646050116|N|| 213684|||1171481|AUI|213684|||NDC|RXNORM|58716032716|N||, 28794=In an effort to reduce the discrepancies related to NDC codes on RxNorm forms, beginning with the March 2008 release, RxNorm has chosen to use the Oral Solution dose form in lieu of the Syrup and Elixir dose forms. Existing RxNorm normal forms (SCD, SBD, SCDF, SBDF) using Syrup and Elixir were transformed into RxNorm normal forms using the Oral Solution dose form. In some cases, this process resulted in new RxNorm forms being created, in others, an RxNorm form already existed and was reused. The RxNorm normal forms that contained Syrup and Elixir dose forms have been archived., 17803=As noted above, a single NDC code should properly be associated with only a single RxCUI, though a single RxCUI can have multiple NDCs. Beginning with the February 2009 release, RxNorm has stopped propagating NDC codes from the branded drugs to the corresponding unbranded drugs. In this way, NDC codes are associated with RxNorm atoms that are within the same concept only. This has been implemented for the BPCK, GPCK, and SBD term types. Essentially all cascading of NDC codes has been discontinued, and NLM-assigned NDC associations will only relate a single RxCUI to a given NDC., 71742=1138734|A0540716|Cefotetan Disodium|3/15/2005 8:05:03 PM|3/10/2005 2:56:21 PM| 3/15/2005 8:05:02 PM|10203141||ENG||||203141|RXNORM|IN|203141 2057262|2057262|Testosterone / Testosterone Injectable Solution [Andro-Cyp 100]|3/17/2005 2:01:59 PM| 3/16/2005 12:23:16 PM|3/17/2005 2:01:58 PM|10363337||ENG||||363337|RXNORM|SBDF|363337, 35398=Retired RXCUIs are never re-used or deleted. Each release of RxNorm includes files that detail any such changes from the previous edition. One RxNorm file (RXNCUI.RRF) tracks such changes from March, 2009 to the present, allowing you to check the fate of any CUI that is no longer present in RxNorm., 38327=The RXNCUI.RRF file is being provided as of April, 2009. This file is created by RxNorm for use in tracking the retired RxNorm Concept Unique Identifiers (RXCUIs) in RxNorm. Tracking of this information began in March, 2009 and data will be cumulative from this date.}",

There are two sets of load scripts. The main directory of the zip archive contains a 'scripts' subdirectory. This directory contains the scripts for loading all of the non-OCD related data in RxNorm. This constitutes what most people are interested in. The 'ocd' subdirectory contains a separate 'scripts' directory that contains the load scripts for the OCD-related release files. This data consists of the SAB=RxNorm OCD term type atoms and their related information. We are providing scripts and control files to help in the creation and automation of your database loading with the RxNorm Release Files. 13.0 Database Creation Automation RXCUI and STY combination can be used as a composite primary key. RXNSTYOCD.RRF RXAUI, ATN, and ATV combination can be used as a composite primary key. RXNSATOCD.RRF RXAUI can be used as a primary key. RXNCONSOOCD.RRF There is no primary key. Whole record must be unique. RXNCUICHANGES.RRF RXAUI, RXCUI, and MERGED_TO_RXCUI combination can be used as a composite primary key.
