The crosslinker used was DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate). In order to prevent the formation of crosslinked Os mediator, i.e. Os-crosslinker-Os, a large excess of homofunctional crosslinker was used in the reaction with Os histamine at 4:1 molar ratio. Under this condition, only the desired product, i.e. Os-crosslinker, was formed. The Os-DSG-Alc conjugate was similarly prepared using the procedure described earlier.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{139606=In the case of heterofunctional crosslinker, the crosslinker is first reacted with Os mediator with histamine ligand (Os histamine) at 1:1 molar ratio. One particular point needs to be noted here. Os mediator in oxidized form, i.e. Os(III), can instantly oxidize sulfhydryl group to form disulfide bond. It is important to keep Os center in the reduced form by addition of a small amount of reductant such as sodium dithionite during the conjugation processes. The reaction progress can be monitored by analytical reverse-phase HPLC on a C 18 column. Then the Os mediator-crosslinker adduct is isolated via preparative HPLC and the collected fraction is subsequently freeze-dried. Finally, the Os mediator-crosslinker adduct is reacted with the appropriate peptide to form Os mediator-peptide conjugate. Again, the product is isolated by collecting appropriate fraction in preparative HPLC and the collected fraction is then freeze-dried., 55578=This application claims benefit of provisional application 60/087,576 Jun. 1, 1998., 83544=2. Sputter 400 \u212b chromium seed layer, 2000 \u212bgold;, 165332=1. Weigh 0.2042 g DSG (0.626 mmol) ) and transfer to a 5 mL Reacti-Vial. Add 0.75 mL DMF to dissolve the reactant., 165466=2. Weigh 0.1023 g [Os(bpy)2(histamine)Cl]BF4 (0.142 mmol) and transfer to a separate 5 mL Reacti-Vial. Add 1.0 mL DMF to dissolve the reactant. Add 25 \u03bcL triethylamine. Then add Os/DNF solution dropwise to DSG/DW solution with constant stirring. After reacting for 2 hours at RT, inject a sample into HPLC to monitor reaction progress., 254942=For demonstrating inhibition reversal, antibody concentrations of 4 \u03bcM for both PAB IS and MAB and 15 \u03bcM for PAB DE were chosen from the inhibition curves shown above. Reversal curves were then generated using a series of dilutions ofBAS-Alc-polyhaptan with a\u02dc1:1 Alc:BSA. The BSA-Alc acts as our sample and binds to the antibody. FIG. 10 shows the reversal curves for the three antibodies., 130061=2. Reversible mediators are selected from those described herein and those described references (U.S. Pat. Nos.4,945,045 and 5,589,325, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). Preferably two different mediators are selected with potentials which differ by at least 100 mV, more preferably at least 200 mV. Examples of suitable mediators include the Os(bipy)ImCl described herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,326, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and ferrocene, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,045 and EP 0142301, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Mixtures of these mediators are made in aqueous solution, for example phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Concentrations between about 1 uM and 1000 uM may conveniently be measured., 187223=Potassium hexachloroosmium was reacted with 4,4\u2032-dimethyl-2,2\u2032-dipyridyl at 1:2 molar ratio by refluxing in DMF. The potassium chloride precipitate was filtered and the dimethyl-bipyridyl dichloroosmium complex was reduced from+3 oxidation state to+2 oxidation state using excess sodium dithionite. The product was recrystallized in DMF/water mixture at 0\ufffd and recovered by filtration., 161095=1. Weigh 0.1167 g [Os(bpy)2(histamine)Cl] BF4 (0.162 mmol) and transfer to a 5 mL Reacti-Vial. Add 1.0 mL DMF to dissolve the reactant. Add 25 \u03bcL triethylamine., 215598=Several technologies are available for the measurement of glycated hemoglobin. They include immunoassays for HbAlc (TinaQuant, BMC; DCA2000, Ames; and Unimate, Roche), ion exchange (Variant, BioRad; Eagle Diagnostics), and affinity chromatography (ColumrMate, Helena; GlyHb, Pierce).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While these feasibility studies for a HbAlc immunoassay used an enzyme mediated amplification method (Glucdor/PQQ/glucose was used to regenerate reduced mediator after oxidation at the electrode surface providing a higher diffusion controlled current is given by the cottrell equation), they are considered to be indicative of results attainable with the use of IDA electrodes with bipotentiostatic control is most preferred for measuring mediator labeled conjugates in accordance with this invention. For demonstrating inhibition reversal, antibody concentrations of 4 \u03bcM for both PAB IS and MAB and 15 \u03bcM for PAB DE were chosen from the inhibition curves shown above. Reversal curves were then generated using a series of dilutions ofBAS-Alc-polyhaptan with a\u02dc1:1 Alc:BSA. The BSA-Alc acts as our sample and binds to the antibody. FIG. 10 shows the reversal curves for the three antibodies. Inhibition curves were also performed for the Os-SMCC-Alc (Max=97%) and OS-SATA-Alc (Max=44%) mediator labels. Stability of the mediator labels were also evaluated by monitoring % inhibition values over time. All of the mediator labels showed some degradation when stored in dilute solutions (40 \u03bcM) at RT. Samples frozen at\u221220\ufffd C. appear to be stable. Polyclonal DE (ion-exchange) purified sheep antibody is used in the TinaQuant HbAlc assay. IS (immunosorbent) antibody is prepared using standard IS purification methodology. Samples of a monoclonal antibody were also obtained for evaluation. Inhibition curves were performed in solution with all mixing occurring in microcentrifuge tubes. Assays",
