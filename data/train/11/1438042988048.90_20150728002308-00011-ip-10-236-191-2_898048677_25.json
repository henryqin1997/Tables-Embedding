            "I always see security patrolling. Also, the Sylvania police department is only about 3 minutes from the school and from the dorm rooms.",
            "No Greek life...yet!",
            "Students who are unsure of the large campus style college and want more teacher interaction and more student interaction.",
            "A bit pricey but not as much as other private schools that I looked at. Scholarships are offered through the school.",
            "There is an organization called Leep that offers students to get out of the dorms and explore what there is to do in Toledo. Mud-hens games, concerts, and other trips are offered with school transportation. Lourdes also has grown in the athletic teams that they have. At least once or twice a week students can attend a game either on campus or off.",
            "The new cafeteria is awesome! A variety of different dishes are offered and a wide variety of drink choices are also offered.",
            "I did not live in the dorms but they are new to the school. Before the Spring of 2012 Lourdes did not have any housing for students. Now they have renovated old apartments and students are able to live in apartment style dorms.",
            "Most majors are able to be pursued. The only problem I have had is trying to get enough students into the class in order for it to be taught.",
            "If you like and want a small college this is the one. With a Catholic background surrounding the school students and faculty take pride in showing what they believe in. There are a lot of organizations to become involved with and a community to support you when you do end up graduating.",
            "It is a great transition school from high school to college. The class sizes are small and the teacher interaction is great with a lot of one on one contact. It is a growing school and growing community ready and willing to make a change in this area."

Great for these types of students anyone from traditional to non-traditional age students, those with or without families, transfer students, first-time students, commuter and residential, and graduate or undergraduate. very accepting of all religions as well. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus the campus is actually owned by the sisters of st. francis and they have a lot of beautiful sanctuary areas around the school. Bang for the buck it's a little on the expensive side being a private school but it is a great atmosphere, wonderful education, interesting and free/fun experiences, and well worth the money. What to do for fun student activities (leap) offers a lot of fun and amazing opportunities for students and always for free! there is also a mall nearby, and plenty of clubs and such. Food and Dining with a new cafeteria, there is always a multitude of different delicious flavors made fresh every day by our food crew!",
