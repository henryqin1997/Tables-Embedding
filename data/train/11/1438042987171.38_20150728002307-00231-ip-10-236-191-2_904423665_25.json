            "Security is always around/convenient. Easy access because the campus is not very big. There are call boxes in every parking lot/building for security help. This feature also gets a security guard to walk you to your car/dorm/class at night or if you feel unsafe/scared. Lock your car doors, campus security cant do much about theft, cameras are not very good in the parking lots.",
            "Quite a few sports teams for being such a small school. And also many clubs and activities always going on. Every time you turn around there are new clubs. Often emails get sent out to all students informing you of these, so you don't have to go searching for the right one-they come to you!",
            "Commuter students who just want to get to school and work. Classes are all day long, very convenient to work around. Athletes! The sports scene is small, but the seawolves are very competitive and have earned several awards in the past few years. Artists, this is a very beautiful and calm school, with countless beautiful sceneries nearby.Older and younger students. This is a very diverse school. And SMCC I believe is a great place to start off or go if you know you want a degree, but have no idea what you want yet. Wonderful and affordable place to get your core requirements out of the way.",
            "very affordable school, and many people receive very nice financial aid packages. credits are easily transferred to many schools, and all University of Maine System schools. If you decide to transfer, this is a much easier and affordable way to earn your bachelors degree!",
            "This school is on a beach! There are always activities going on. There are often frisbee, kickball, wiffle ball tournaments for fun. Also many fun competition weeks(like in the winter there is a build the best snowman contest, and sledding on cardboard boxes!). SMCC offers a few sports for men and women as well as countless clubs to join. There is a gym! nice lounges in the dorms. Very close to the mall and highway-easy access to almost anywhere. Portland also has numerous restaurants that are phenomenal! Portland Sea Dogs/Maine Red Claws games about a 10-15 drive away.",
            "SMCC has a culinary program and there are a few nice places to eat on campus with some pretty decent food.",
            "Failry new dorm building is the only one ive been into, and it is very nice. Has a great lounge with a tv, pool, fooseball tables couch, vending machines. Lots of games and activities in the office to borrow if you get bored. Always something fun going on in the dorms.",
            "Its not a very hard school. Show up to classes, on time and prepared. Do the work, on time, and you will succeed (and you teachers will like you).",
            "If you are a commuter, get early classes! SMCC is a fairly easy school, but dont get me wrong there are tough teachers and classes. It can be very fun or really sucky, but if you have time outside of school and work try to join a club or team, it will make things a lot easier for you as a student if you have friends and something to look forward to that will make you proud of being a student here.",
            "SMCC is a small school that is growing, and a wonderful place to start your college career. It is a very nice school that has a beautiful campus alongside the ocean. The only downside is parking sucks."
