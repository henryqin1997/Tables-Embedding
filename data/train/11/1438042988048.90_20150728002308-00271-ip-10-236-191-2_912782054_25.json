    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students Our Psychology department is amazing and I love our professors! So pysch majors. Also anyone who loves to get to know others and be in a great Christian Atmosphere! Tips for prospective students Get to know your admission counselor they love to work with prospective students. Don't get your books in the Cougar Corner bookstore they are so much cheaper on amazon and ohiolink. Keep your dorm room door open for at least the first month because people will stop in and become friends with you. Go to Friday Night Live, play gotcha in jterm, play every intramural you can, and work hard in classes. Bang for the buck When you pay tuition you expect to go to class and gain at degree. When you apply and go to Mount Vernon Nazarene University you are doing so much more than gaining a degree. At Mount Vernon you are gaining a wonderful life experience and you are making friends that become like family. Getting a degree may be an ultimate goal but it's important to enjoy the trip and at Mount Vernon you will. Am enjoying being here For me it is almost financially impossible to return to Mount",
