Federal Reserve officials had for years requested that Congress provide the necessary legal authority to pay interest on reserve balances (Feinman 1993; Kohn 2004). Not remunerating reserves was seen as an implicit tax on banks that were subject to reserve requirements, as these institutions were obligated to hold balances overnight in their accounts and had to forego earnings elsewhere.11 As a consequence, banks had an incentive to reduce their reserve balances to a minimum. To do so, they used tools such as sweep arrangements that move funds from deposits that were subject to reserve requirements to deposits and money market investments that were not. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 gave the Federal Reserve authority, beginning October 2011, to pay interest on reserve balances (and to reduce reserve requirements to as low as zero). Importantly, the authorization only applied to depository institutions.12, 111864=Bindseil, Ulrich, Gonzolo Camba-Mendez, Astrid Hirsch, and Benedict Weller. 2006. \"Excess Reserves and the Implementation of Monetary Policy of the ECB.\" Journal of Policy Modeling 28:491-510., 112455=Clouse, James A., and James P.

Lately, however, in an environment of heightened uncertainty in financial markets and highly accommodative monetary policy, many banks keep an elevated level of excess balances; few need to borrow to satisfy reserve requirements. In addition, the distribution of balances across Federal Reserve districts has become more concentrated. Indeed, as shown in table 1, as balances have increased markedly, the share held by the largest three Federal Reserve districts has jumped from 60 percent in July 2007 and July 2008 to 75 percent in July 2009, with the Second District's share climbing to nearly half of total balances. Furthermore, amid the recent financial turmoil and after the establishment of the conservatorship, Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's current liquidity management procedures include a higher share of assets held as cash and cash equivalents, making federal funds a more prominent share of their balance sheet.10, 67232=For our calibration of a three-type market, we use proprietary transaction-level data from the Fedwire funds transfer service that has been matched to form plausible overnight funding transactions, likely related to the federal funds market. Similar data were first used by Furfine (1999) and since then by Bartolini, Hilton, and McAndrews (forthcoming), Ashcraft and Duffie (2007), and Demiralp, Preslopsky, and Whitesell (2006) to mention a few.26 Again, our sample is drawn from the universe of matched transactions from October 10, 2008, to July 1, 2009. The transaction data set contains basic transfer information, including the amount of the transaction, the implied interest rate of the identified transaction, and the seller and buyer in the trade. These last two pieces of information allow us to differentiate the rates earned by depository institutions and GSEs to evaluate the empirical implications described above.27, 21327=Before December 16, the exact lower bound of the interest rate corridor was somewhat fuzzy to banks engaging in federal funds trading in maintenance periods with a scheduled FOMC meeting.14 If market participants placed some weight on the probability of a rate change, they might be inclined to sell funds at rates closer to the expected remuneration rate for the period, rather than the contemporaneous one. Indeed, as shown in figure 2, there were clearly periods in which an anticipated change in the target rate may have been a factor in pushing down the expected excess reserves rate, and at the same time, the effective rate., 114207=Kohn, Donald L. 2004. \"Regulatory Reform Proposals.\" Testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22., 111577=______. 2009b. \"The Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet: An Update,\" Speech at the Federal Reserve Board Conference on Key Developments in Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., October 8.

Following the December 1516, 2008 FOMC meeting the interest rates on required reserve balances and excess balances were both set at 25 basis points, that is, at the upper bound of the newly established target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 25 basis points., 13910=Trades are generally settled by the Federal Reserve's Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire) which allows account holders to transfer funds in real time until the regular close of the system at 6:30 p.m. (6:00 p.m. for non-bank financial institutions). Unlike other parts of the money market, such as the repo market, the federal funds market tends to stay active throughout the day and according to Bartolini et al.

The Federal Reserve asked Congress to move the October 2011 starting date for implementing interest on reserves forward to provide a floor for trading in the federal funds market (Bernanke 2008). Congress granted that authority as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and the Reserve Banks began paying interest on reserve balances starting with the maintenance period beginning on October 9, 2008. The rules governing the payment of interest on reserves make a distinction between balances held to fulfill reserve requirements, referred to as \"required reserve balances,\" and those paid on balances held in excess of required reserve balances and contractual clearing balances, referred to as \"excess reserve balances.\"13 The rates paid on required and excess balances evolved from the start of the program through December 2008 as shown in figure 2. Interest paid on required reserves was computed differently from that paid on excess reserves, and the rates applied differed. Initially, the rate paid on required reserve balances was 10 basis points below the average target federal funds rate for the maintenance period, while the rate paid on excess balances was 75 basis points below the lowest target for the period., 57928=In our first calibration exercise, we use proprietary data on rates and volumes of brokered trades in the federal funds market that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York uses to construct the daily effective federal funds rate.22 By doing so, we can take a close look at the data used to compile the official policy rate and attempt to identify movements in these data. One shortcoming of these data is that they provide information only on the aggregate dollar amounts traded at each rate and not the identity of either the buyer or the seller. As a result, we assume that trades at or above the interest rate paid on reserves are trades executed between banks and that trades below the IOR rate are executed between banks and GSEs.23 Over the course of our sample, as shown in figure 6(a), , the share of trades below the excess-reserves rate, was quite volatile in the early days of interest on reserves, ranging from 4 percent to 95 percent. It started dropping from mid-December 2008 onward, and hovered around 80 percent for the months following., 3665=This situation created a tension for the Federal Reserve: while the increases in liquidity would prove to help improve market functioning, these increases were also exerting downward pressure on the federal funds rate. Following enactment of legislation that gave the Federal Reserve authority to pay interest on reserve balances beginning in October 2008, depository institutions (banks), for the first time, were able to earn overnight interest on funds held in accounts at the Federal Reserve, referred to as \"reserve balances.\" The Federal Reserve essentially implemented a corridor (or channel) system similar to those operated by many other central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England.2 One feature of such a framework is that the interest rate paid on reserves normally provides a floor for the interbank interest rate that the central bank is seeking to control (Goodfriend 2002 and Ennis and Keister 2008, for example)., 114938=Stigum, Marcia, and Anthony Crescenzi. 2007. The Money Market. New York: McGraw Hill, 82167=The next set of coefficients focuses on the effects of broader market conditions on the bargaining power of these sellers. High repo rates tend to push down the bargaining power of banks, as evidenced by the negative coefficients on the spread to the target variable. By contrast, for the GSEs, bargaining power is positively correlated with the Treasury GC repo rate spread as expected. . These effects are even more pronounced after December 15, when the target range of zero to 25 basis points was introduced., 115044=Whitesell, William. 2006. \"Interest Rate Corridors and Reserves.\" Journal of Monetary Economics 53:1177-95., 113525=Furfine, Craig. 1999. \"The Microstructure of the Federal funds Market.\" Financial Markets, Institutions, and Instruments 8(5): 535-53., 113255=Feinman, Joshua. 1993. \"Reserve Requirements: History, Current Practice, and Reform.\" Federal Reserve Bulletin June:569-89., 77790=The policy group includes indicator variables that control for the excess reserves regime and the policy environment. First, we include a dummy variable that equals 1 if the rate paid on excess reserve balances changes at a later date in the maintenance period. The anticipation of excess variable is an attempt to measure the degree to which banks were able to foresee future rate changes that would affect their remuneration on reserves held overnight on any given day. Second, we control for target rate changes. The announcement of the new target rate does not generally occur until later in the day (around 2:15 p.m.), so that on those days, trading in the first part of the day can be conducted in reference to a target rate different from that for trading later in the day., 115183=Willis, Parker B. 1972.

The resulting increase in reserve balances exerted downward price pressure in the federal funds market, and the effective federal funds rate began to deviate from the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. In response, the Federal Reserve revised its operational framework for implementing monetary policy and began to pay interest on reserve balances in an attempt to provide a floor for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, following the policy change, the effective federal funds rate remained below not only the target but also the rate paid on reserve balances. We develop a model to explain this phenomenon and use data from the federal funds market to evaluate it empirically. In turn, we show how successful the Federal Reserve may be in raising the federal funds rate even in an environment with substantial reserve balances., 110160=Ashcraft, Adam, James McAndrews, and David Skeie. 2009. \"Precautionary Reserves and the Interbank Market.\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report no. 370.

Fun and Games--A Text on Game Theory. Lexington, Mass.: D.C Heath., 89960=We examine the effects of different levels of the repo-excess rate spread and total balances on the effective federal funds rate in figures 10 and 11, respectively. Both exercises assume a 2 percent rate paid on excess (and required) reserve balances, and $800 billion in excess balances. As shown in figure 10, the narrower the spread of the repo rate to the excess rate, the closer the effective rate is to the excess rate. Again a smaller GSE market share drives up the effective federal funds rate. The repo-excess rate spread has little effect on the predicted rate for banks (blue line) but for the GSEs (red line), however, rates march up as the spread between the repo rate and the target rate narrows. Even if the spread is particularly wide at 90 basis points, the GSE rate is still forecasted to be only 80 basis points below the excess rate., 110604=Bartolini, Leonardo, Spence Hilton, and James McAndrews. 2008. \"Settlement Delays in the Money Market.\" Journal of Banking and Finance, forthcoming., 110784=Bartolini, Leonardo, Spence Hilton, and Alessandro Prati. 2008. \"Money Market Integration.\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 40 (1): 193-213., 110349=Bartolini, Leonardo, Svenja Gudell, Spence Hilton, and Krista Schwarz. 2005. \"Intra-day Trading in the Overnight Federal Funds Market,\" Current Issues in Economics and Finance\u00b8 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 11:11., 113691=Goodfriend, Marvin. 2002. \"Interest on Reserves and Monetary Policy.\" FRBNY Economic Policy Review (May): 77-84., 2966=The financial turmoil following the Lehman Brothers Inc. bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 necessitated unprecedented injections of liquidity into the financial system by the Federal Reserve. With the banking system awash in funds, the rate at which banks were willing to buy and sell these funds--the federal funds rate--dipped well below the intended policy target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). As illustrated in figure 1(a), between September 16 and October 7, 2008, the average effective federal funds rate was 35 basis points below the 2 percent target rate set by the FOMC - in normal times, the effective rate is usually within 3 basis points of the target., 4788=Even with the new framework in place, the effective federal funds rate continued to be not only below the target rate, but also below the interest rate paid on reserves, as shown in figure 1(a). Between the October and December 2008 FOMC meetings the average effective federal funds rate was 32 basis points, while the target was 1 percent; the interest rate paid on reserves was 65 basis points or higher for the entire period. This deviation from the theoretical prediction was surprising for even the most astute observers of the federal funds market (Hamilton, 2008, for example). Why did interest on reserves provide an imperfect floor for the federal funds rate, even after the policy was changed so that the interest rate paid on reserves was set equal to the target rate?3 Why would any financial institution lend out funds below the rate paid by the central bank? And even if that were the case, arbitrageurs would surely relish the opportunity of making a pure profit by borrowing cheaply in the market and placing the proceeds with the central bank, and by doing so, move the market rate toward the floor., 114542=McAndrews, James J. 2009. \"Segmentation in the U.S. Dollar Money Markets during the Financial Crisis.\" Unpublished paper.
