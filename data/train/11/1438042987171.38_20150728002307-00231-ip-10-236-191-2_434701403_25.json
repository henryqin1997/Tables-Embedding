Generally speaking, most goods production follows an input-output structure in which the output of one industry becomes an input to the next industry situated along a supply or distribution chain - raw materials, then work-in-process, and finally finished goods. Table 2 depicts this inventory classification scheme by industry, along with inventory shares in 2000. Inventory-holding industries appear in approximate order according to their location in the stages of fabrication; industries tending to producing raw materials are listed first, and industries tending to producing finished goods listed last., 135861=Khan, Aubhik, and Julia K.

For instance, in our data, the standard deviation of detrended GDP falls by 0.77 percentage points between the 1960-1983 and 1984-2007 subperiods (from 1.89 to 1.12 percent). Our subsample estimates match the volatility decline, showing a reduction in the standard deviation of GDP of 0.76 percentage points. Our model also captures the decrease in the volatility of input inventories but not the one of output inventories. The model can also account for the reduced procyclicality of output inventory investment after 1983., 137228=Lee, Donghoon and Kenneth I. Wolpin.

(2006) \"Why Have Business Cycle Fluctuations Become Less Volatile?\" National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge, MA), Working Paper No. 12079, March., 105795=Table 10 breaks down how the three sets of parameters above contribute to the reduction in volatility captured by the model. Using the estimates obtained from the 1960-1983 sample as a reference point, we change one estimated parameter at a time, setting it to the value estimated for the 1984-2007 sample. This way, we can approximately measure each parameter's contribution to the change in volatility. The main result is that most of the reduction in GDP volatility is attributable to the reduction in the volatility of the underlying shocks -- especially of the technology shock in the goods sector. This is consistent with the conclusions reached by Stock and Watson (2003) and Justiniano and Primiceri (2008). By themselves, smaller shocks can explain a reduction in GDP volatility of 0.52 percentage points (as measured by the standard deviation), compared to an estimated total decline of 0.76 percentage points. Most of the remainder is attributable to larger capacity-utilization costs, as well as the increased importance (share) of services in the economy. The latter, for instance, accounts for a quarter in the reduction in GDP volatility., 185091=Table 9 - Panel B: Variance Decompositions, Subsamples - 1984-2007, 51137=Table 1 depicts our sectoral classification, compares it with the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) classification, and reports output shares in 2000. The goods sector accounts for a larger share of output than the NIPA goods sector (35.9 percent versus 21.2 percent). Nevertheless, under our definition, the services sector accounts for about three-fifths of private output (59.1 percent versus 40.9 percent for private goods), which excludes government but include foreign trade. However, the private goods sector becomes even larger after adjusting for foreign trade and the leasing of capital, as explained in the next subsection., 133101=Hansen, Gary D.

(1987) \"Inventories and the Volatility of Production.\" American Economic Review , 77(4), September, 667-679., 14289=Finally, we provide the first analysis of the Great Moderation based on an estimated DSGE model with independent roles for input and output inventories. By estimating the model over the sub-periods 1960-1983 and 1984-2007, we account for the notable changes in the steady-state values of the inventory-to-target ratios and for the relatively greater importance of the service sector since 1984. We find that most of the decline in aggregate output volatility is attributable to the lower volatility of shocks, which occurred primarily in the goods-sector technology shock.9 The volatility of the input-inventory technology shock also declined, but this decline only accounts for a very small reduction in the volatility of aggregate output or goods output. We also find that structural changes in the parameters account for a smaller fraction of the reduction in aggregate output volatility. The reduced ratio of input inventories to goods output observed in the data is associated with a decrease in goods-sector output and GDP volatility, but the size of the decrease is small., 131037=Cooper, Russell and John C. Haltiwanger. (1990) \"Inventories and the Propagation of Sectoral Shocks.\" American Economic Review, 80(1), March, 170-190., 128358=Bils, Mark and James A. Kahn. (2000) \"What Inventory Behavior Tells Us about Business Cycles.\" American Economic Review, 90(3), June, 458-481., 124540=When estimated across two subperiods, 1960-1983 and 1984-2007, the model captures the volatility reduction observed in aggregate variables, as well as the decline in procyclicality of output-inventory investment. However, the model suggests that the bulk of the Great Moderation is explained primarily by a reduction in the volatility of the technology shock in the goods sector (and of the discount rate shock). The reduction in the volatility of inventory shocks accounts for only a small portion of the decrease in output volatility. Nevertheless, the model's framework identifies several dimensions along which the economy's structure changed in an economically important manner, and contributed to the reduction in GDP volatility. Some of these structural changes are related to inventory behavior and influence the propagation role inventories play in the macroeconomy, but, at best, they have only played a minor role in accounting for the reduced volatility of output., 128120=Baxter, Marianne and Robert G.

(1989) \"Inventories as Factors of Production and Economic Fluctuations.\" American Economic Review, 79(3), June, 338-354., 69044=Another key fact, seen in the bottom panel of Figure 3, is that input-inventory investment is much more volatile than output-inventory investment (the ratio of variances is about 2), when both investment series are normalized by total output. This relative volatility is comparable to the analogous variance ratios observed within manufacturing (Blinder and Maccini 1991). However, the relative volatility of the two types of inventory investment has declined dramatically, from a ratio of 4.6 in the early sample (1960-1983) to a ratio of 2.5 since then. The volatility of input-inventory investment fell while the volatility of output-inventory investment remained about constant. Both types of inventory investment are procyclical over the full sample, but input-inventory investment is more procyclical than output-inventory investment (the correlation with goods output is 0.62 for input inventories and 0.42 for output inventories). The procyclicality of output-inventory investment decreased from 0.44 in the early sample (1960-1983) to 0.25 since then, but the cyclical correlation of input-inventory investment has remained relatively stable., 222125=19.\u00a0\u00a0 All real data are in chain-weighted 2000 dollars.

(2001) \"The Long and Large Decline in U.S. Output Volatility.\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2001:1, 135-164., 68072=Moving to inventories, the middle panel of Figure 3 shows how inventory-target ratios exhibit markedly different cyclical properties. On average, the output-inventory ratio is roughly acyclical (the correlation with goods output is 0.10), as can be seen by the lack of consistent movement during recessions (shaded regions). Although the output-inventory ratio shot up during the 1973-75 recession, it has not done so during other recessions. In contrast, the input-inventory ratio is very countercyclical (the correlation with goods output is -0.89), as can be seen by its consistent increase during recessions. Thus, the existence of countercyclical inventory-target ratios for manufacturing output inventories, as emphasized by Bils and Kahn (2000), is not evident for all inventories. This result suggests that successful theories of aggregate inventory behavior must be comprehensive enough to explain heterogenous behavior among different types of stocks., 132665=Gomme, Paul, and Peter Rupert.
