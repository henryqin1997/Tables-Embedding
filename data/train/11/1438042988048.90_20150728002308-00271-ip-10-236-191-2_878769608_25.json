Thus the \"Team of Galicia\" was born, as it was dubbed. In the last AGM of Fortuna and Vigo to approve the formation of a new club held on 10 August 1923, the members decided upon the team's name. Various names were suggested:, 34608=In the 2006\u201307 season, Celta finished in 18th position and were relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. At the end of June 2007, Celta avoided going into administration. However, if an agreement was not put in place between the club and its creditors within three months, then courts would declare the liquidation of the club's assets., 36626=On 3 June 2012 Celta Vigo returned to La Liga after 5 years in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.[2] In their first season back in La Liga, Celta Vigo avoided relegation to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n on the final day, beating Espanyol 1\u20130 to ensure 17th place. On 8 June 2013 Celta Vigo announced they had signed former Roma and Barcelona B manager Luis Enrique to lead the club for the 2013\u201314 season. Under Enrique Celta flourished achieving a 9th place finish., 26693=R.C. Celta de Vigo was formed as a result of the ambition of Vigo's teams to achieve more at national level, where the Basque sides had been their b\u00eate noire in the Spanish Championship. The idea was to merge both teams to create a more powerful team at national level. The standard-bearer of this movement was Manuel de Castro \"Handicap\", a sports writer for the Faro de Vigo who, from 1915, started to write in his articles about the need for a unitarian movement. The slogan of his movement was \"Todo por y para Vigo\" (All for and to Vigo), which eventually found support among the managers of Real Vigo Sporting and Real Club Fortuna de Vigo. It was backed unanimously when De Castro himself presented the motion at the assembly of the Royal Spanish Football Federation in Madrid, on 22 June 1923., 18969=Real Club Celta de Vigo (Galician pronunciation:\u00a0[re\u02c8al \u02c8klu\u03b2 \u02c8\u03b8elta \u00f0e \u02c8\u03b2i\u0263o]), or simply Celta Vigo, is a Spanish professional football club based in Vigo, Galicia, currently playing in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. It was founded on 23 August 1923 following the merger of Real Vigo Sporting and Real Fortuna Foot-ball Club. Nicknamed Os Celestes (The Sky Blues), they play in sky blue shirts and white shorts. The club's home stadium is Bala\u00eddos, which seats 31,800 spectators.[1], 44677=Like many other Galician clubs, such as Compostela and Racing Ferrol, the club badge is based on the red cross of Saint James. On top of the cross sits a sky blue shield with two letter Cs (Club Celta). In 1923, Celta became one of several Spanish football clubs that were granted patronage by the Spanish crown and thus entitled to use Real (Royal) in their names and the royal crown on their badge. This right was granted to Celta by Alfonso XIII and the club subsequently became known as Real Club Celta de Vigo. During the Spanish Second Republic (1931\u20141936) the title Real was removed from the club's name and the royal crown was taken off the club crest, however it was to return under the Spanish State., 254873=Celta de Vigo B is Celta's youth team. It was founded in 1996 and plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B., 30137=The late 1990s (1997\u20142003) saw the best results in Celta's history, in which they managed to consolidate themselves as a top-six league side, culminating in 2001\u201302, when they did not fall below sixth the whole season. They were dubbed EuroCelta by the Spanish press. In February 2001 the IFFHS declared Celta the best team of the world during that period, as a consequence of the fantastic results. The most important players during that period were Alexander Mostovoi, Valery Karpin and Haim Revivo. The squad counted also with other international players such as the goalkeeper Pablo Cavallero, the midfielders Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and Mazinho, the winger Gustavo L\u00f3pez or the strikers Catanha, Luboslav Penev and Benny McCarthy, among others.}",
