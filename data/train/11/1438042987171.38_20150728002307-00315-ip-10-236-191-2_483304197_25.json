Assays and reagents for detecting HBV have been previously disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,780,219 and 4,562,159; and in published International Patent Application Nos. WO94/08032 and WO95/02690., 332456=Tubes containing 15 \u03bcl of a buffered solution that included salts and reagents essentially as described under Example 2, a target polynucleotide, and a molecular beacon were first overlaid with 15 \u03bcl of inert oil to prevent evaporation. The tubes were then incubated in a dry heat block for 10 minutes at 60\ufffd C. to facilitate primer annealing. Primers for amplifying the HBV target had the target-complementary sequences of SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:15 and SEQ ID NO:11. Primers for amplifying the HIV-1 target had the target-complementary sequences of SEQ ID NO:99, SEQ ID NO:100, SEQ ID NO:103 and SEQ ID NO:102. Primers for amplifying the HCV target had the target-complementary sequences of SEQ ID NO:115, SEQ ID NO:117 and SEQ ID NO:118. Notably, amplification reactions used for testing the HBV-specific molecular beacons included all of the primers for amplifying all three targets. Amplification reactions used for testing the HIV-1 and HCV-specific molecular beacons included all of the primers for amplifying both of these targets, but not primers for amplifying the HBV target. Of course, it is intended that any of the below-described molecular beacons could be used in amplification reactions that include any combination of primers. Following the 60\ufffd C. incubation step, tubes were transferred to a 42\ufffd C. heat block and then incubated for 10 minutes. Five microliter aliquots of an enzyme reagent that included both MMLV reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase enzymes were added to each of the tubes using a multichannel pipettor. Tubes were vortexed briefly and then transferred to a ROTORGENE-2000 (Corbett Research; Sydney, Australia) rotor that had been pre-warmed to 42\ufffd C. Amplification reactions were carried out at 42\ufffd C., fluorescence readings were taken every 30 seconds, and the results analyzed in real-time using standard software that was bundled with the ROTORGENE-2000 instrument., 60723=In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, HBV nucleic acid sequences are amplified using a TMA protocol. According to this protocol, the reverse transcriptase which provides the DNA polymerase activity also possesses an endogenous RNase H activity. One of the primers used in this procedure contains a promoter sequence positioned upstream of a sequence that is complementary to one strand of a target nucleic acid that is to be amplified. In the first step of the amplification, a promoter-primer hybridizes to the HBV target DNA at a defined site. Reverse transcriptase creates a complementary DNA copy of the target DNA by extension from the 3\u2032 end of the promoter-primer. Following interaction of an opposite strand primer with the newly synthesized DNA strand, a second strand of DNA is synthesized from the end of the primer by reverse transcriptase, thereby creating a double-stranded DNA molecule. RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter sequence in this double-stranded DNA template and initiates transcription. Each of the newly synthesized RNA amplicons re-enters the TMA process and serves as a template for a new round of replication, thereby leading to an exponential expansion of the RNA amplicon. Since each of the DNA templates can make 100-1000 copies of RNA amplicon, this expansion can result in the production of 10 billion amplicons in less than one hour. The entire process is autocatalytic and is performed at a constant temperature., 25484=The risk of hepatitis virus transmission from transfusions has declined dramatically since post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) was first recognized in the 1940s. For example, in 1970 scientists at the NIH reported the results of a prospective study to determine the incidence of icteric and anicteric hepatitis in patients that had undergone open-heart surgery and received blood from commercial or volunteer blood donors. Icteric and anicteric hepatitis developed in 51% of the recipients of commercial blood, but in none of the patients who received blood from volunteer donors., 183364=HBV genotype A virions served as the source of HBV template sequences in amplification reactions that employed paired sets of primers. TMA reactions were carried out essentially as described by Kacian et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,491, the disclosure of this U.S. patent having been incorporated by reference hereinabove. Each promoter-primer included a T7 promoter sequence AATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA (SEQ ID NO:96) upstream of an HBV-complementary sequence. Amplification reactions were conducted for various primer combinations using between about 7 and 33 copies of the HBV template, and 1-20 pmoles of each primer in 100 \u03bcl of reaction buffer. Nucleic acids underwent specimen processing and target capture prior to amplification essentially according to the procedures disclosed in published International Patent Application No. PCT/US2000/18685, except that the template was captured using HBV-specific oligonucleotides rather than HIV-specific oligonucleotides. Significantly, all of the capture oligonucleotides used in the procedure were known to be capable of capturing HBV templates that could be amplified. Accordingly, this procedure focused on the ability of the different primer and probe combinations to cooperate in a multiplex amplification assay. All procedures were conducted using 500 \u03bcl aliquots of stock samples of infected serum containing 5-25 international units/ml (IU/ml) of HBV. Notably, there are approximately 3 copies of the HBV genome in one IU of the virion preparation used in this procedure. Target nucleic acids and primers were heated to 60\ufffd C. for 10 minutes and then cooled to 42\ufffd C. to facilitate primer annealing. Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (5,600 units/reaction) and T7 RNA polymerase (3,500 units/reaction) were then added to the mixtures. The final amplification reactions contained 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5), 35 mM KCl, 4 mM GTP, 4 mM ATP, 4 mM UTP, 4 mM CTP, 1 mM DATP, 1 mM dTTP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. After a one hour incubation at 42\ufffd C., the entire 100 \u03bcl amplification reaction was subjected to a hybridization assay essentially as described in Example 1. More particularly, one or more of six different probes listed in Table 3 were labeled with acridinium ester to a specific activity of about 1\u22121.2\ufffd108 RLU/pmol and then used in an amount equivalent to 7.5\ufffd105 RLU for each probe used in the hybridization reaction. To be judged as a positive result, the chemiluminescent signal indicating probe hybridization must have exceeded 50,000 RLU in an assay., 26106=It was also revealed in 1970 at an NIH Conference that the \u201cAustralia\u201d antigen (now known as the hepatitis B surface antigen) was part of an infectious agent, presumably a hepatitis virus. Only a couple of years later, the simultaneous exclusion of commercial blood and HBsAg-positive donors reduced the incidence of PTH to about 7% of the prior rate (Tobler et al., Clin. Chem. 43:1487 (1997)). These measures dramatically improved the safety of the donated blood supply., 67576=In some applications, probes exhibiting at least some degree of self-complementarity are desirable to facilitate detection of probe:target duplexes in a test sample without first requiring the removal of unhybridized probe prior to detection. By way of example, structures referred to as \u201cMolecular Torches\u201d are designed to include distinct regions of self-complementarity (coined \u201cthe target binding domain\u201d and \u201cthe target closing domain\u201d) which are connected by a joining region and which hybridize to one another under predetermined hybridization assay conditions. When exposed to denaturing conditions, the two complementary regions (which may be fully or partially complementary) of the Molecular Torch melt, leaving the target binding domain available for hybridization to a target sequence when the predetermined hybridization assay conditions are restored. Molecular Torches are designed so that the target binding domain favors hybridization to the target sequence over the target closing domain. The target binding domain and the target closing domain of a Molecular Torch include interacting labels (e.g., luminescent/quencher) positioned so that a different signal is produced when the Molecular Torch is self-hybridized as opposed to when the Molecular Torch is hybridized to a target nucleic acid, thereby permitting detection of probe:target duplexes in a test sample in the presence of unhybridized probe having a viable label associated therewith. Molecular Torches are fully described in International Publication No. WO 00/01850, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference., 22976=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/461,790, filed Jun. 13, 2003, now pending, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/389,393, filed Jun. 14, 2002. The entire disclosures of these prior applications are hereby incorporated by reference., 49357=By \u201csufficiently complementary\u201d is meant a contiguous nucleic acid base sequence that is capable of hybridizing to another base sequence by hydrogen bonding between a series of complementary bases. Complementary base sequences may be complementary at each position in the base sequence of an oligonucleotide using standard base pairing (e.g., G:C, A:T or A:U pairing) or may contain one or more residues that are not complementary using standard hydrogen bonding (including abasic \u201cnucleotides\u201d), but in which the entire complementary base sequence is capable of specifically hybridizing with another base sequence in appropriate hybridization conditions. Contiguous bases are preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably about 100% complementary to a sequence to which an oligonucleotide is intended to specifically hybridize. Appropriate hybridization conditions are well known to those skilled in the art, can be predicted readily based on base sequence composition, or can be determined empirically by using routine testing (e.g., See Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989) at \ufffd\ufffd 1.90-1.91, 7.37-7.57, 9.47-9.51 and 11.47-11.57 particularly at \ufffd\ufffd 9.50-9.51, 11.12-11.13, 11.45-11.47 and 11.55-11.57)., 59852=Amplification methods useful in connection with the present invention include: Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA), Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA), the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), and amplification methods using self-replicating polynucleotide molecules and replication enzymes such as MDV-1 RNA and Q-beta enzyme. Methods for carrying out these various amplification techniques respectively can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,491, published European patent application EP 0 525 882, U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,188, U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166, U.S. Pat. No. 5,472,840 and Lizardi et al., BioTechnology 6:1197 (1988). The disclosures of these documents which describe how to perform nucleic acid amplification reactions are hereby incorporated by reference., 291846=The oligonucleotide components used in the quantitative assay were identical to the reagents used in the preceding Example, except that the probe of SEQ ID NO:50 was omitted. Each amplification reaction additionally included an RNA pseudo target having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:97 in an amount corresponding to about 80\ufffd106 copies. HBV genotype A calibrators having concentrations ranging from 380-12,000 HBV IU/ml were used as the source of HBV templates in separate reactions to produce standard curves. TMA reactions were conducted for a period of 60 minutes, substantially as described above. Detection of amplified HBV sequences was carried out using a standard homogeneous protection assay that employed the above-described probe of SEQ ID NO:57 as a combination of acridinium ester-labeled and unlabeled species in a ratio of 1:6.25. Use of the unlabeled probe allowed all chemiluminescent signals to fall within the reliable response range of the luminometer that measured specifically hybridized probe. Pseudo target amplicons were not detected by the probe that was used in this procedure., 24253=Infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) occurs worldwide and is an important cause of both acute and chronic viral hepatitis. HBV is a partially double-stranded circular DNA virus having a viral particle size of 42 nm. This particle includes an outer lipoprotein coat and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg, circulates in the blood as a viral particle-bound form, or as a free, noninfectious protein aggregated into 22-nm spherical and tubular particles. Transmission of HBV is mediated primarily through blood and/or sexual contact. The incubation period for this virus ranges as high as 180 days (Gitlin, Clin. Chem. 43:1500 (1997)).}",
