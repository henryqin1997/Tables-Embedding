The Version field is a two byte entry representing the version of the specification used to author this file. For example, version 1.20 would be stored as 0\ufffd78 (120 decimal). The Size of MEN.HMT field is a four byte entry containing the size of MENU.HMT in bytes. The LCID field is a four byte entry for the Language ID of this MENU.HMT file. The Offset of First Menu field is a two byte entry representing the byte offset from the beginning of the MENU.HMT to the first Menu Header 706. The Menu Title Length field is a two byte entry containing the byte length of the menu title excluding the ending null UCS-2 character (two null bytes). The Menu Title field stores a menu title terminated with a null UCS-2 character (two null bytes). The maximum length for this entry is 65 UCS-2 characters including the null UCS-2 character. Players use this to display a title for the entire menu. An empty string (one NULL character) indicates that there is no title to display or that the authoring software has rendered the title onto the background image. For example: \u201cMy Hawaii Vacation\u201d, \u201c2002 School Party\u201d., 92177=[0076] The Size of Menu Header field is a four byte entry representing the size of the Menu Header 706 including the Menu Item 710 and Playlist Item 708 in bytes. The Offset to Parent Menu field is a four byte entry representing the byte offset from the beginning of MENU.HMT to the Parent Menu. This value is zero if this is the top level menu 704. The Background Image ID (4:3) field is a four byte entry defining the image to display as the background of this menu 704 on a 4:3 display. The image should be a 640\ufffd480 JPG file with an HMT extension. A value of zero indicates there is no background image. The value is the index of a Menu Image file in CONTENTS.HMT (see FIG. 9). Players should display the background image centered on the display preserving the aspect ratio. Players should use a background color if any to fill in any uncovered area. The Background Image ID (16:9) field is a four byte entry defining the image to display as the background of this menu on a 16:9 display. The image should be a 852\ufffd480 JPG file with an HMT extension. A value of zero indicates there is no background image. If this value is non zero then there should be a valid Background Image ID (4:3) as well. The value is the index of the Menu Image file in CONTENTS.HMT. Players should display the background image centered on the display preserving the aspect ratio., 157338=[0116] In alternative embodiment, the following files are included: <Thumbnail>.HMT and <Background>.HMT. There is one file for each thumbnail on the medium (e.g., 160\ufffd120 JPG format with .HMT extension). The authoring software may name the files as appropriate. The Thumbnail files are created in an \u2018IMAGES\u2019 subdirectory. There is one file for each menu background on the medium. Backgrounds with a 4:3 aspect ratio are in 640\ufffd480 JPG format with .HMT extension. Backgrounds with a 16:9 aspect ratio are in 852\ufffd480 JPG format with .HMT extension. The authoring software may name the files as appropriate. The Background files are created in the \u2018IMAGES\u2019 subdirectory., 36486=[0001] This application is based upon a U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled \u201cCOMPRESSED MEDIA FORMAT SPECIFICATION,\u201d filed Oct. 16, 2002, naming Mercer et al. as inventors. The entirety of such provisional patent application is incorporated by reference herein., 142142=[0098] As illustrated in FIG. 10, the invention is operable as part of an exemplary compressed media format 1002 having a set of small files containing metadata, menus, and playlists in a compiled binary format designed for playback on feature-rich PC media players as well as low cost media players. See Appendix A for an example of accelerator files for use as part of an exemplary compressed media format. The exemplary compressed media format of the invention encompasses audio, still images, and video media files 1004 in various formats. The compressed media format for use with the invention defines a logical format for organizing compressed media files 1004 in a file system 1006 on computer-readable media 1008 such as optical discs (e.g., CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD+R, DVD-ROM), flash memory (e.g., COMPACTFLASH brand, secure digital, MEMORY STICK brand), magnetic media (e.g., hard disks), and the like., 141241=[0096] The data structures of the invention are organized such that only the current menu needs to be in memory associated with the media player. The flexible menu system of the invention scales from a minimal device (e.g., portable CD player) to a large, 16:9 television display (e.g., a DVD player menu). The medium specifies menu hierarchy, but the layout, thumbnails (consumer images, video thumbnails, or predefined art like these), and background image vary per media player. In one embodiment, menu or playlist names are user entered or auto-generated. Menus are filtered to display only those menu items that the player is capable of displaying or playing (e.g. an audio-only player will remove all image and video menu entries to display only pure-audio selections)., 73522=[0064] The layout of thumbnails on the screen and the number of thumbnails displayed per page is player dependent. Some players may choose to display a continuous scrolling list, others may chose to paginate the menu and offer next/previous selections. On a 4:3 TV set, players will typically display a grid of 3\ufffd2 thumbnails while on a 16:9 TV set they may chose to display a 4\ufffd2 grid instead.}",
