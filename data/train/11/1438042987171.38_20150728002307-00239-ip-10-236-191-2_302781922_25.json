    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables Always good to hear from an ex-colleague and a fellow Hawkeye. I think Flowers future really depends on whether or not the White Sox are willing to take the hit on defense. He's like Jeff Clement in the sense that there's just no way to project anything but a negative in his fielding column. With Paul Konerko nearing the end of days, I think I might just move Flowers to first base and let him hit. However, that's a big positional adjustment, and it's not like A.J. Pierzynski has been providing fantastic defense the last few seasons. I wouldn't, but don't be surprised if the White Sox let him be behind the plate. (Bryan Smith) Good to see you back. There seems to be no general consensus on Tyler Flowers. What is your projection? (scottlong from indy) 2009-02-17 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) Good player, not a great one. I might be underselling him with Brian Harper comparisons. A.J. Pierzynski with more power? Lightning round. Something weird going on in chat module.",
