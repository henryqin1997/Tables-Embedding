The reaction product was cooled to room temperature and poured into 170 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid, and the precipitate was filtered out, washed with water and dried at 100\ufffd C. under a reduced pressure for 5 hours. The precipitate was purified by silica gel column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent to obtain 0.27 g of red powdery tris[2-(benzo[g]thienyl-5-phenylpyridine-C2,N]iridium (III) (Example Compound No. 22). According to MALDI-TOF MS, M+ of 1051.2 of the compound was confirmed. A toluene solution of the compound exhibited a luminescence spectrum showing \u03bbmax=627 nm and a quantum yield of 0.17 relative to 1.0 of Ir(ppy)3., 35765=[0025] More specifically, in the case of the phosphorescence material, excitons produced by recombination of carriers comprise singlet excitons and triplet excitons presented in a ratio of 1:3. For this reason, when fluorescence caused during the transition from the singlet excited state to the ground state is utilized, a resultant luminescence efficiency is 25% (as upper limit) based on all the produced excitons in principle., 449371=[0153] It is easy to synthesize the following compounds in the same manner as in Example 11 except that 4-chloropyrimidine is synthesized from 4(3H)-pyrimidone (made by Aldrich Co.) in the same manner as the process described at pages 37 and 38 of JP-A (Tokuhyo) 2001-504113 (corr. to U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,330) and is reacted with 4-phenylboronic acid (made by Lancaster Co.) to obtain 4-(biphenyl-4-yl)pyrimidine, which is used instead of 2-(benzo[b]thienyl)-5-phenylpyridine., 447306=[0150] In a 100 ml-three-necked flask, 0.29 g (0.88 mM) of the compound (1) 0.34 g (0.35 mM) of the compound (3) and 25 ml of glycerol, were placed and heated around 180\ufffd C. for 8 hours under stirring and nitrogen stream. The reaction product was cooled to room temperature and poured into 170 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid, and the precipitate was filtered out, washed with water and dried at 100\ufffd C. under a reduced pressure for 5 hours. The precipitate was purified by silica gel column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent to obtain 0.23 g of red powdery compound (4) (Example Compound No. 45).

[0165] It is easy to synthesize the following compounds in the same manner as in Example 11 except that 2-(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)pyridine is synthesized from 2-bromopyridine (made by Tokyo Kasei Kogyo K.K.) and 5-bromothiophene-2-boronic acid (made by Aldrich Co.) and was reacted with phenylboronic acid (made by Tokyo Kasei Kogyo K.K.) to obtain 2-(5-phenylthiophene-2-yl)pyridine, which is used instead of 2-(benzo[b]thienyl)-5-phenylpyridine. Synthesis of Ex. Comp. Nos. 524 and 529 EXAMPLE 17 [0164] Tris[2-(biphenyl-2-yl)pyridine-C4 1,N3)iridium (III) (Ex. Comp. No. 528). [0163] Bis[2-(biphenyl-3-yl)pyridine-C4,N3)(acetylacetonato)iridium (III) (Ex. Comp. No. 523). [0162] It is easy to synthesize the following compounds in the same manner as in Example 11 except that 2-(biphenyl-3-yl)pyridine is synthesized from 3-biphenylboronic acid (made by Lancaster",
