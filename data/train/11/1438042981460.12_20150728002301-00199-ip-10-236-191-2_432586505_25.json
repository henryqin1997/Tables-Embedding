            "Antibodies to 25-HYDROXY Vitamin D2 and D3 and Uses Thereof - Provided herein are antigenic molecules that can be used to generate antibodies capable of binding to a vitamin D derivative, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, or a 25-hydroxyvitamin D analog, such as a vitamin D-C22 immunogenic molecule or compound. Antibodies produced using these antigenic molecules, and related antigenic compounds, are also described. In addition, disclosed herein are methods for detecting vitamin D deficiency in a subject, methods for treating a subject suspected of having a vitamin D deficiency, methods for monitoring progression of vitamin D deficiency in a subject, and methods for monitoring treatment of vitamin D deficiency in a subject in need thereof. Also provided are methods and reagents for the detection or quantification of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3, methods for stabilizing vitamin D analogs, and methods for separating 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 from vitamin D binding protein in a biological sample.",

The invention is a commercial scale process for improving coal, comprising the steps of: Comminuting coal to a particle size at which individual Macerals are available. Extracting reactive Macerals from the comminuted coal as froth from the top of a deep-column flotation cell. And, dewatering the extracted Macerals. In another aspect the invention concerns a commercial scale processing plant for mined coal. 20100287828 Published Description Patent application number Greig Freeman, New South Wales AU 04-17-2014 Electronic Palette System - The present embodiments provide a system for generating design palettes over a network. In one embodiment, the system comprises a database configured to store design product data corresponding to one or more design features of a plurality of design products. A user interface is configured to allow submission of information specifying one or more requested design features. An e-palette server is in operative communication with the database and the user interface. The e-palette server is configured to receive the requested design features and to generate a subset of the design products. Each design product in the subset of the design products shares at least one design feature in common with the requested design features. An e-palette generator is configured to generate a design palette including at least one design",

Freeman, Encenitas, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20130068585 CURRENCY DISCRIMINATION SYSTEM AND METHOD - According to some embodiments of the invention, a magnetic sensor having a track width of greater than about 50 millimeters is provided. The magnetic sensor is adapted to detect a magnetic feature and produce a linear, analog output in response to the magnetic feature. The analog output is along a single data channel. 03-21-2013 Jeffrey L. Freeman, Purcellville, VA US Patent application number Description Published 20130008949 INTELLIGENT BARCODE SYSTEMS - Systems and methods using intelligent barcodes for processing mail, packages, or other items in transport are provided. Systems and methods allowing end-to-end visibility of a mail stream by uniquely identifying and tracking mail pieces are also provided. Systems and methods include the use of standardized intelligent barcodes on mail pieces, a seamless process for mail acceptance, continuous mail piece tracking, and feedback on mail quality in real time. In one embodiment, systems and methods using intelligent barcodes allow a mailing service to provide enhanced acceptance, sorting, tracking, address correction, forwarding, and delivery services. In another embodiment, systems and methods using intelligent barcodes allow a mailing service to identify a mail piece as undeliverable-as-addressed (UAA) and determine a final disposition for the mail piece. In yet another embodiment, systems and methods using intelligent barcodes allow mailers more visibility into the mail stream and",
