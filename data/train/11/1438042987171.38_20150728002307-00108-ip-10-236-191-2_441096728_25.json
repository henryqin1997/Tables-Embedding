            "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GLOBAL COVERAGE ANALYSIS - Disclosed are methods and systems for performing coverage analysis. In one approach, the methods and systems perform coverage analysis based upon both implementation-specific design data and non-implementation-specific design data. In an approach, both gate level and RTL level information are considered to perform coverage analysis.",
            "MEDICATION STORAGE DEVICE AND METHOD - Devices, systems, and methods for monitoring and enhancing patient adherence to a prescription drug regimen are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a medication storage device includes a plurality of dose containers, each dose container having an interior region configured to contain a medication. The medication storage device also includes an event detection system that includes a plurality of sensors. The plurality of sensors are configured to detect a change in each dose container of the plurality of dose containers. The medication storage device also includes an imaging system. The imaging system includes a plurality of image capture devices configured to capture an image of the interior region of each dose container of the plurality of dose containers. A communications module is configured to send an indication of the change detected by the event detection system and/or an image captured by the imaging device to a remote device.",
            "System and Methods for Dynamically Matching Sponsors with Vendors - A system and methods for dynamically matching sponsors with vendors in connection with a request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) are disclosed. In at least one embodiment, the system provides a central computing system and a database server containing data related to each of the sponsor, the vendors, and the RFP. The sponsor is able to create the RFP and provide an associated confidential disclosure agreement (\u201cCDA\u201d). The database server is searched for vendors that the sponsor would potentially find suitable and compiles said vendors in a matched vendors list. The sponsor is able to review the matched vendors list and decide which should receive the RFP. Each contacted vendor must accept the CDA before gaining access to the RFP. If interested, each contacted vendor must complete an electronic proposal form, at which point the sponsor is able to review the completed forms and select one of the matched vendors."
