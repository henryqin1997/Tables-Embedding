            "Food is awesome. You will have several kinds of food. We have Mexican, salad bar, pizza, vegetarian, sandwiches, ice cream, and several others stations that always have new dishes for every meal.",
            "JBU has four dorms and each one is unique in it's own way. I live in Hutchenson Hall and it is the newest dorm that was build on campus. Rooms are big, you have your personal sink that only you and your roommate share and, also, bathroom that you share with roommate and sweetemates (2 of them).",
            "I am a freshman in JBU. After studying there for only one semester, I feel like I have learned more in those six month's then I have learned during my whole life. Professor's are amazing! I loved all of them. Students are very kind and you are able to find a study group for your class really easy (if you are looking for one)."

    "textAfterTable": "deffinetly Will learn a lot JBU is amazing from what I have read, saw on virtual tour, and heard. the people there are from all over the country. It is a religious school, so (as at all schools) I am sure there will be SOME drinking, but when you go there, you sign an agreement saying you won't do that on or off campus. It seems like the perfect place for me. The only thing about JBU i don't like is that it is in Arkansas and I am in PA. I will have to be far from my family for a long time, and I'm not yet sure how I will handle that. To counter-set this fact is the fct that they have host families that will take you in, pray for you, hang out with you, and become your second (or third) family. JBU seems like a really genuine place, and when I call, all I have to do is say my first name and Ryan (my admissions counselor) knows EXACTLY who I am. I love the intimacy there. I haven't even gone and I can already picture myself there for the next four years Login to rate or flag the reviews Chrissy",
