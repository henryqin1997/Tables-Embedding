No. 60/346,881, filed Jul. 8, 2002, and U.S. patent application No. 60/403,249, filed Aug. 12, 2002, all of which are incorporated by reference., 105554=In one example, predetermined maximum packet length is configured to be 1000 bytes. If the transaction 160 is determined to be less than 1000 bytes, the contents of the clear, pp, and ee channels are encoded into a single packet. However, in this example, it is determined that 500 bytes of data exist in the pp channel and 4500 bytes of data exist in the ee channel. All the contents of the pp channel are encoded into a 500 byte packet 164. The data from the ee channel is encoded into four separate 1000 byte packets 166-174 and one 500 byte packet 174.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Having described and illustrated the principles of the invention in a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be apparent that the invention may be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. We claim all modifications and variation coming within the spirit and scope of the following claims. For the sake of convenience, the operations are described as various interconnected functional blocks or distinct software modules. This is not necessary, however, and there may be cases where these functional blocks or modules are equivalently aggregated into a single logic device, program or operation with unclear boundaries. In any event, the functional blocks and software modules or features of the flexible interface can be implemented by themselves, or in combination with other operations in either hardware or software. The system described above can use dedicated processor systems, micro controllers, programmable logic devices, or microprocessors that perform some or all of the operations. Some of the operations described above may be implemented in software and other operations may be implemented in hardware. If the information in the header packet 162 is authorized, the processing node decrypts and decodes data in the pp packet 164. If the data in the pp packet 164 is invalid or has been tampered with, the remaining ee packets 166-174 can be discarded without being further processed. The node receiving transaction 160 may receive, decrypt and decode",
