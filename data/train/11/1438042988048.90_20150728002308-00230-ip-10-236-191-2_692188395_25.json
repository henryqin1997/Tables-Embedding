The phrase thrie f[irlottis] beir, as recorded in an inventory, showing the abbreviation for the word firlottis. \u00a0 DRY CAPACITY The basic unit of dry capacity was the boll (from the word \u2018bowl\u2019). A quarter of a boll was a firlot (a \u2018fourth lot\u2019). A quarter of this was a peck (possibly from the word \u2018pack\u2019 or else from the French picotin, meaning a peck, or the Latin picotus, a liquid measure). A quarter of a peck was a forpet (a corruption of \u2018fourth peck\u2019) or lippie (from the Anglo-Saxon leap, meaning a \u2018basket\u2019). Sixteen bolls made a chalder or chaldron (from the French chaudron, meaning a \u2018kettle\u2019). Lippies, pecks, firlots, bolls and chalders varied depending on what was being measured.

The pint was sometimes referred to as the jug or joug. 8 pints made a gallon (from the old French galon or jalon, meaning a \u2018jar\u2019 or \u2018bowl\u2019). Half a pint was a chopin (from the French liquid measure, the chopine), and a quarter of a pint was a mutchkin (from the diminutive of a kind of cap, a mutch). A sixteenth of a pint was a gill (from the Old French, gelle, a wine measure or \u2018flask\u2019). According to the standard measure of Stirling, adopted in 1661:",
