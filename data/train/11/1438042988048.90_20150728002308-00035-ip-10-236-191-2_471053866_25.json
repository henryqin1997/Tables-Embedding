This is accomplished by exposing the system in which the ECL moiety is incorporated to electrochemical energy. The potential at which oxidation of the ECL moiety and the species forming a strong reductant occurs depends upon the exact chemical structures thereof, as well as factors such as the pH of the system and the nature of the electrode used to introduce electrochemical energy. It is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art how to determine the optimal potential and emission wavelength of an electrochemiluminescent system. Certain preferred methods of stimulating the ECL system are disclosed in commonly assigned PCT published application U.S. Ser.

No. 07/652,427, filed Feb. 6, 1991, now abandoned, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application., 207277=For the non-separation assay on HPV 18, we performed an asymmetric PCR reaction with an excess of the biotinylated primer. This PCR reaction generates an excess of biotinylated single-stranded DNAs now available for direct hybridization by the Ru(bpy)3 2+-label-probes. For hybridization, we added 1000 ECL counts of Ru(bpy)3 2+-label-oligonucleotide (\u02dc2ng) specific for the HPV gene amplified to 15 \u03bcl of the PCR after completion of the amplification followed by incubation for 15 min at 50\ufffd C. To this hybridization mixture we added 60l of ECL buffer containing 600 \u03bcg of streptavidin coupled magnetic particles I and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 15 min. The sample volume was increased to 530 \u03bcl by addition of ECL buffer followed by detection of electrochemiluminescence as described in Example 1. FIG. 5 illustrates this assay format. To demonstrate this non-separation assay we ran a standard curve of HPV18 DNA. The PCR was performed using biotinylated 2PV18 and unlabeled 1PV18 using HeLa DNA (14). The resultant PCR reaction was then hybridized with the specific probe Ru(bpy)3 2+-label- 3PV18. The hybridization mixture was then added to streptavidin coated particles and the resultant bead-bound Ru(bpy)3 2+-label was directly analyzed for ECL as described in Example 1. The results were plotted as ECL counts verses HPV18 copies added to the PCR with a control of the ras oligonucleotide probe (see FIG. 11). These results demonstrate the ability to generate rapid non-separation assays for nucleic acid sequences based on the properties of the ECL assay system., 135058=0.5 mg of mouse anti -TSH (CIBA) was labeled with Ru(bpy)3 2+. The MAb anti TSH antibody was buffer exchanged using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) into 0.15M potassium phosphate buffer, 0.15M NaCl pH 7.8, the final volume being 0.35 mL. Immediately prior to use, 0.5 mg of Ru(bpy)3 2+-NHS was dissolved in 75 \u03bcL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Aldrich). To achieve a 50:1 molar ratio of Ru(bpy)3 2+label to protein based on molecular weights of 1057 and 150,000 respectively, 0.176 mg Ru(bpy)3 2+-NHS (26.4 \u03bcL) was added to the protein solution while shaking. The reaction tube was incubated in the dark at room temperature, 30 minutes, while shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 \u03bcL of 1M glycine and incubated for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was purified by passage through a Sephadex G - 25 column (1 X 20 cm in 0.15M potassium phosphate, 0.15M NaCl with 0.05% sodium azide pH 7.2). The Ru(bpy)3 2+-labeled mouse anti- TSH fractions were collected and pooled. The labeled protein was determined to have 14 labels per protein. Reagent V., 30755=Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay techniques are an improvement on chemiluminescent techniques. They provide a sensitive and precise measurement of the presence and concentration of an analyte of interest. In such techniques, the incubated sample is exposed to a voltammetric working electrode in order to trigger luminescence. In the proper chemical environment, such electrochemiluminescence is triggered by a voltage impressed on the working electrode at a particular time and in a particular manner. The light produced by the label is measured and indicates the presence or quantity of the analyte. For a fuller description of such ECL techniques, reference is made to PCT published application US85/01253 (WO86/02734), PCT published application number US87/00987, and PCT published application U.S. Ser. No. 88/03947. The disclosures of the aforesaid applications are incorporated by reference., 190408=Dynal M450 particles were coated with antibody specific for RNA/DNA antibodies (7) following standard procedures (Example 10). Specific RNA species were generated using plasmids derived from our cloned aequorin gene (8). In brief, the plasmid pA5\u2032 was cut with EcoRI purified and subjected to in vitro transcription using T3 RNA polymerase generating T3-RI RNA (negative RNA). Also plasmid pA5\u2032 was cut with BamHI purified and subjected to in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase generating T7-Bam RNA (positive RNA). These two RNA species thus represent two complementary RNA species. These RNA species were purified by extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform (50:50) followed by chloroform extraction and precipitation of the supernatant using 2.5 vols of ethanol. The amount of RNA was determined using gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. These methods are well established and known to those skilled in the art (9). Streptavidin was labeled with Ru(bpy)3 2+-label using established methods using a 25:1 molar excess of Ru(bpy)3 2+-label over streptavidin (Example 13). This labeled streptavidin was purified using an iminobiotin column following established methods (10). The streptavidin was estimated to contain 10 Ru(bpy)3 2+-labels per streptavidin tetramer. This labeled streptavidin was then complexed with biotinylated T35, this was achieved using a one to one mix of oligonucleotide to labeled streptavidin. Specifically 20 pmoles of each were mixed in a final volume of 15Al of ECL buffer and incubated over night at 4\ufffd C., to form the labeled streptavidin-oligonucleotide (SA-T35) complex. The samples of positive and negative RNA (10 ng) were hybridized to 2 \u03bcl of the SA-T35 complex (one step assay) or 25 ng of the biotinylated T35 (two step assay). Samples were made up to 50 \u03bcl and hybridized for 3 hours at 50\ufffd C. followed by the addition of 200 \u03bcg of anti DNA/RNA antibody coated particles in 20 \u03bcl of PBS 0.1%BSA. This mixture was mixed at room temperature for 1 hour followed by two washes in ECL buffer. Samples from the hybridization with the SA-T35 complex were resuspended in 530 \u03bcl of ECL buffer and analyzed as described in Example 1. Those samples from the hybridization with biotinylated T35 alone were then incubated with 50 pmoles of labeled streptavidin and incubated for 1 hr with mixing followed by two washes in ECL buffer. Samples from the hybridization were resuspended in 530 \u03bcl of ECL buffer and analyzed as described in Example 1. The results are presented in Table IX., 133521=1 mg of mouse anti-Digoxin (Cambridge Medical Technologies Cat# 200-014 Lot A3575) was labeled with Ru(bpy)3 2+. The monoclonal antibody (MAb) anti Digoxin antibody was buffer exchanged using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) into 0.15M potassium phosphate buffer, 0.15M NaCl pH 7.8, the final volume being 0.5 mL. Immediately prior to use, 0.5 mg of Ru(bpy)3 2+-NHS was dissolved with 125 \u03bcL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Aldrich). To achieve a 25:1 molar ratio of Ru(bpy)3 2+to protein based on molecular weights of 1057 and 150,000 respectively, 0.18 mg Ru(bpy)3 2+-NHS (45 \u03bcL) was added to the protein solution while shaking. The reaction tube was incubated in the dark at room temperature, 30 minutes, while shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 \u03bcL of 1M glycine and incubated for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was purified by passage through a Sephadex G - 25 column (1\ufffd20 cm in 0.15M potassium phosphate, 0.15M NaCl with 0.05% sodium azide pH 7.2). The Ru(bpy)3 2+-labeled mouse anti-digoxin fractions were collected and pooled. The labeled protein was determined to have 12 labels per protein molecule., 77769=An apparatus for carrying out the assays of the invention is described in FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG. 1 discloses an advantageous ECL apparatus, but the methods of the present invention are not limited to application in apparatus 10, but rather may be employed in other types of ECL apparatus which include a working electrode or other triggering surface to provide electrochemical energy to trigger the ECL moiety into electrochemiluminescence. While the methods of the invention can be carried out in a static or flow-through mode, apparatus 10 includes a flow-through cell, which provides distinct advantages for many types of samples including binding assay samples. Further details of apparatus for carrying out the ECL assays of the invention are disclosed in commonly assigned published PCT applications U.S. Ser. No. 89/04854 and U.S. Ser.
