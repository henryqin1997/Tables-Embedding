            "INGEST: NGS has automated daily routines that harvests daily observational files in either binary or RINEX format at the original sampling rate, the daily broadcast ephemeris files, orbit files, and any corresponding meteorological files. For the special case use of FAA and USCG streaming data that are used as input to NOAA models, the streaming feed is harvested to a binary, incrementally-built hourly file.",
            "PROCESSING: Data ingested by NGS are processed into RINEX format and made available online in either an hourly or daily cadence. Aside from positioning, processing includes the insertion of NGS headers, quality checks, and the production of quality control files (teqc summary files). Other scheduled routines retrieve higher level orbit files as they are made available.",
            "DISTRIBUTION: NGS makes hourly and daily files available online. For the special case of binary FAA and USCG data, NGS pushes these files to NGDC every 5 minutes. NGDC stages the data for ESRL and SWPC groups, who harvests the data at a predetermined sub-hourly period. The completed binary hourly file at NGDC is kept locally. At the end of the day, a daily tar file consisting of the hourly data are created and staged for archive.",
            "RETENTION: NGS retains the data at the original at-sampling rate for 30 days. After 30 days, NGS decimates its online holdings to a 30-second sampling rate.",
            "ARCHIVE: Prior to the 30-day mark, the RINEX at-sampling rate data is copied to NGDC. Aftter 30 days, NGDC then stages, archives, and distributes the CORS data via the CLASS infrasturcture. For the special use case, the daily binary files from 4 days ago are archived by NGDC to CLASS."
