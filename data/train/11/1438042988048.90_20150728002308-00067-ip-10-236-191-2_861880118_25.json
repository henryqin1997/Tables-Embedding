            "Subjects ingest egg white solid (EWS) on Visit 1 (initial day dose escalation up to 50 mg), followed by a build-up phase (escalating daily egg doses every 2 wks, achieving a maintenance dose by 32-40 wks). Thereafter, subjects are on a maximally tolerated daily egg dose (306 mg to 2 gm) for \u22658 wks. After wk 44, subjects are given a 5 gm Oral Food Challenge (OFC) using EWS to identify desensitized [1] subjects. Subjects/study staff are unblinded following this OFC and either continue on their egg OIT maintenance dose of 2 gm/day or are allowed to attempt escalation up to 2 gm/day for the remainder of the study (1-3 years). A 10 gm OFC to identify desensitized [1] subjects occurs at specified intervals under prescribed conditions (yrs 2 - 4). Subjects who pass this 1st 10 gm OFC stop study therapy for 4-6 wks, then have a 2nd 10 gm OFC. Subjects that pass this 2nd 10 gm OFC are considered tolerant [2], stop EWS dosing and add egg to their diet.",
            "Subjects ingest placebo (cornstarch) during Visit 1 (initial day of dose escalation up to 50 mg), followed by a build-up phase (escalating daily placebo doses every 2 wks, achieving a maintenance dose by 32-40 wks). Thereafter, subjects were on a maximally tolerated daily placebo dose (306 mg to 2 gm) for \u22658 wks. After wk 44, subjects were given a 5 gm Oral Food Challenge (OFC) using egg white solid to identify desensitized [1] subjects. Subjects/study staff were unblinded following this initial 5 gm OFC. After unblinding, subjects discontinued further placebo dosing and continued on an egg-restricted diet. A 10 gm OFC was administered under prescribed conditions to subjects if their egg-specific serum IgE level was below 2 kUA/L. They were followed in the study up to 2 years. [1] Desensitized: Subject does not react to egg during OFC while taking daily doses of therapy. [2] Tolerant: Subject does not react to egg during OFC 4-6 wks after abstinence from egg consumption."
