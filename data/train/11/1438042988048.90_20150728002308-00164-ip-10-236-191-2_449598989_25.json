            "Decorative selectable arms with bayonet clip attachment of arms to eyeglass frames - An eyeglass frame system, comprising an eyeglass securing front frame portion; a pair of temple-contacting side members, each member having a proximal end and a distal end, the proximal end of each secured by a pivotal connection to a respective outermost portion of said front frame portion, said at least one of said side members having inner and outer vertical surfaces thereof, said pivotal connection effected at a first end of a male element of a bayonet clip, a second end thereof defining a plurality of projecting prongs. The system also includes female elements complemental to said male elements. Female elements are formed integrally with an inner surface at each proximal end of said temple-contacting side members. Said male and female members may be selectably engaged or disengaged from each other through the application of pressure on the male elements transversely to the axis of said temple-contacting members.",
            "Smart cap system - A medicine container cap for use with a bottle containing a plurality of pills includes a casing having a pill dispensing opening. A pill dispensing track assembly is removably coupled to the casing and includes a pill ramp for delivering pills to the pill dispensing opening and an insert that includes a pill dispenser slot that receives pills from the pill ramp and is open to the pill dispensing opening. The insert is detachably from the pill ramp and is insertable through an opening in the casing for being attached to the pill ramp. The pill ramp includes an adjustable member that modifies a characteristic of the pill ramp based on at least one characteristic of the insert that is selected, inserted through the opening in the casing and coupled to the pill ramp.",
