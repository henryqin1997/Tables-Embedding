Due to the increasing prevalence of disseminated fungal infections associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, increased utilization of organ transplantation and immunosuppression, and the increased number of invasive fungal nosocomial infections, antifungal agents are more widely used than ever before. Consequently, there is a need for alternative drugs that are both efficacious and well tolerated. Posaconazole is a triazole that is structurally related to Itraconazole. It is currently in Phase III trials by Schering-Plough Corporation. Compared to two early azole drugs, posaconazole is a significantly more potent inhibitor of sterol C14 demethylation, particularly in Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus spp. K. L. Oakley et al., 41 ANTIMICROB. AGENTS CHEMOTHER. 1124-1126 (1997)., 221474=[0103] In order to support the creation and analysis of coherent data sets, proper technical infrastructure must be available. Appropriate computer hardware is supplied, for example, by the Sun Microsystems' E420 workgroup server (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Appropriate operating systems include, but are not limited to, Solaris (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), Windows (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.), or Linux (Red Hat, Inc., Raleigh, N.C.). Appropriate software applications include, but are not limited to, relational databases such as Oracle 9.0.1 (9i) (Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.), DB2 Universal Database V8.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.), or SQL Server 2000 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.), and software for statistical analyses, such as packages available from SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.) or SPSS, Inc. (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill.). In one embodiment, the server is the E420 workgroup server (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), the operating system is Solaris (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.), and the software is Oracle 9.0.1 (9i) (Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.), and statistical software is from SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.)., 481193=[0282] Lyophilized tissue was disrupted by grinding for 5 minutes at 1800 rpm using a grinder and stored in a controlled environment until further analysis. Approximately 10 mg of dried ground tissue was extracted in 0.5 ml 10% aqueous methanol containing isotopically labeled internal standards. The extract was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes, diluted with an equal volume of 50% aqueous acetonitrile (V/V), and transferred to a temperature-controlled autosampler (4\ufffd C.) of a HP1100, HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 291879=[0179] A hereditary link has already been established for diabetes mellitus, but it is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental components. Davies et al., 371 NATURE 130-136 (1994). Some regions of the genome have been established as indicators of risk of DM, but are not wholly diagnostic. Hashimoto et al., 371 NATURE 161-164 (1994). In many cases, genetic factors are not clearly evidenced for all forms of the disease. To narrow down and understand the genetic alterations relevant to DM, additional specific information is needed with respect to genetic lesions an individual carries, as well as coherent links to more specific information about patient health (gross phenotype), gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite analysis. Coherent links are particularly instructive to establish possible causative factors in cases where a hereditary link is not clear. Although the use of human genotypic data are desirable, a mouse model system provides greater initial comparability through the controlled nature of gene knock-out and knock-in experiments, and provides a foundation upon which to build heterogenous human genetic data. Knock-out murine models have been reported in the literature as a model for the study of DM, specifically with a Akt2 gene knock-out. Cho et al., 202 SCIENCE 1728-1731 (2001)., 173967=[0062] Medical scoring of phenotypic triats are applicable to the assessment of patient well-being pre- and post-therapeutic intervention. For example, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is gaining acceptance as a generic health outcome assessment form. The SF-36 validates health outcomes with 8 indices of health and well-being including general health (GH), physical function (PF), role function due to physical limitations (RP), role function due to emotional limitations (RE), social function (SF), mental health (MH), bodily pain (BP), vitality and energy (VE). Each health object is scored on a 0 to 100 basis with higher scores representing better function or less pain. Other scoring or ranking schemas for identifying and quantifying physiologic and pathophysiologic (phenotypic) states (traits) include, not are not limited, the following: ATP III Metabolic Syndrome Criteria; Criteria for One Year Mortality Prognosis in Alcoholic Liver Disease; APACHE II Scoring System and Mortality Estimates (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health disease Classification System II); APACHE II Scoring System by Diagnosis; Apgar Score; Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia Diagnostic Criteria; Arterial Blood Gas Interpretation; Autoimmune Hepatitis Diagnostic Criteria; Cardiac Risk Index in Noncardiac Surgery (L.

For example, in cases where a practitioner is examining a patient to determine the likelihood, existence, or extent of coronary heart disease (CHD), phenotypic traits observed or identified in a clinical setting include, but are not limited to, risk factors such as blood pressure, cigarette smoking, total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and diabetes. P. G. McGovern et al., 334 NEW ENG. J. MED. 884-890 (1996). Additonal phenotypic characteristics such as weight, family history of CHD, hormone replacement therapy, and left ventricular hypertrophy are also useful in determining CHD risk. It is common in the medical arts to scale or score a patient's condition based on a set of phenotypic signs and symptoms. For example, predictive models have been described based on blood pressure, cholesterol, and LDL-C categories as identified by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. P. W. F. Wilson et al., 97 CIRCULATION 1837-1847 (1998) (incorporated herein by reference). Furthermore, predictive outcome models have also been described for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty., 126263=[0002] The present application is related to U.S. application Ser.

Comparable phenotypic data refers primarily to gross phenotypes with potentially diverse individualized measurements, as compared to the molecular phenotypes (often of limited range) and aspects of measurements from other technologies (such as genotype, gene expression analysis, metabolite analysis, SNP analysis, and proteomics). In mice, phenotypic data can extend many levels beyond those available with humans, allowing analysis of organ architecture and age-related profiles. Even with humans, however, the expansion of phenotypic data beyond the limited range currently known to have diagnostic potential could lead to an improved understanding and establishment of relevant correlations when placed within a set of coherent data. Qualitative and quantitative data are used as criteria for diagnosing diabetes, such as, for example, increased thirst, increased urine production, blurred vision, and blood sugar levels, but are not always diagnostic. New phenotypic data could be measured and those already measured could be made more exacting. A similar approach has been reported using a plant model. Boyes et al., 13 PLANT CELL 1499-1510 (2001). Linkage of phenotypic data to coherent data sets could ultimately provide earlier, more exacting and reliable diagnoses of DM. Winkelmann, 2 PHARMACOGENOMICS 11-24 (2001)., 368029=[0234] Error models describing the calibration and validation of the instrumentation were constructed to describe the properties of sample behavior. BEEBE ET AL., CHEMOMETRICS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE 348 (1998). The reliability and sensitivity of the high-throughput analytical techniques (GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC, ICP) used in the present invention have been previously demonstrated. Fiehn et al., Metabolite Profiling for Plant Function Genomics, 18 NATURE BIOTECH. 1157-1161 (2000). The range of detection and the high-throughput nature of the metabolite analysis affected the statistical treatment of the response data. The variance across a 96-well plate was measured to allow for the use of a single replicate injection for each sample. The instrumentation used was qualified for a single replicate injection according to the procedures described as follows. The instrument qualification study was a randomized, parallel assignment of at least three known compounds at three concentrations with a minimum of 12 randomized injections for each compound-concentration combination. A total of 108 injections were used for a complete 96-well study. The variance across a 96-well plate was estimated in this manner. MILLER & MILLER, STATISTICS FOR ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY 227 (2d. ed., 1988). The minimum number of replicates required to achieve a power of 0.90, at a significance testing level of 0.05, was estimated for a two-tailed analysis of variance test according to Sokal and Rohlf. SOKAL & ROHLF, BIOMETRY: THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF STATISTICS IN BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH 887 (3d. ed., 1995)., 909365=[0413] Data are analyzed using software such as Image Analysis Software (Version A.4.0.45, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) and then loaded into a database appropriate for storage and further analysis, such as the Rosetta RESOLVER database (Rosetta Inpharmatics Inc., Kirkland, Wash.)., 567545=[0368] Amphoteracin B is capable of binding irreversibly to ergosterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, thus increasing membrane permeability with ultimate fungal cell death. Despite its proven efficacy, use of the conventional formulation of amphoteracin B (amphoteracin B deoxycholate) is limited by potentially severe adverse reactions, especially nephrotoxicity and infusion-related events. Over the past 20 years, azoles, primarily ketoconazole and fluconazole that are less toxic alternatives to amphoteracin B, have become attractive. The anti-fungal activities of azole derivatives arise from a complex multimechanistic process initiated by the inhibition of two cytochromes P450 involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, namely, the P450 that catalyzes the 14-demethylation of lanosterol or eburicol (encoded by erg11), and 22-desaturase (encoded by erg5). D. C. Lamb et al., 43 ANTIMICROB. AGENTS CHEMOTHER. 1725-1728 (1999)., 465487=[0275] 1 flat=32 plants=1352 cm2, 324602=[0215] Minimal sample preparation was performed on plant tissues for metabolite analysis. Arabidopsis tissue (leaves, siliques, seeds) was harvested directly into tared and barcoded tubes (96-well format) in liquid nitrogen using an automated weighing station (Mettler-Toledo Bohdan, Inc., Vernon Hills, Ill.). Samples were lyophilized without being allowed to thaw, mechanically ground to powder, and stored at low humidity (\u226610%) until undergoing analysis. In the case of silique samples, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) was added at a ratio of 1:3 (sample:PTFE) to facilitate the grinding and dispensing steps. Similarly, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) was added at a ratio of 1:5 (sample:PTFE) to facilitate the grinding and dispensing steps for seed samples., 566445=[0367] Ergosterol is an essential component of fungal plasma membranes. It affects membrane permeability and the activities of membrane-bound enzymes. This sterol is a major component of secretory vesicles and has an important role in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. G. Daum et al., 14 YEAST 1471-1510 (1998). It can thus be expected that changes in ergosterol levels and sterol structure influence the activities of several metabolic pathways. Enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway are the targets of a number of anti-fungal agents. Over the past 40 years, amphoteracin B synthesized by Streptomyces nodosus has been the mainstay of antifungal therapy for severe systemic mycotic infections. F. C. Odds, Antifungal Therapy, in PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF CLINICAL MYCOLOGY 35-48 (C. C. Kibbler et al. eds., 1996); H. J. Vanden Bossche et al., Discovery, Chemistry, Mode of Action, and Selectivity of Itraconazole, in CUTANEOUS ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS 263-283 (J. W. Rippon & R. A. Fromtling eds., 1993)., 872667=[0389] In AF1, two different technologies were utilized: gene expression analysis (for examination of mRNA expression) and metabolite analysis. More than 6300 genes were measured by gene expression and more than 600 chemical components were measured by LC-MS and GC-MS. As noted previously, existing metabolic databases may be helpful in practicing the methods and systems of the present invention, but many databases include limitations that make their use in data analysis and pathway mapping less than straightforward. In the case of AF1, use of the KEGG database to map gene information to pathways resulted in the mapping of 1145 significantly changed genes to a total of 103 pathways. A caveat limiting the reliance on the mapping data is that KEGG mapping is not unique (one gene does not map to a single pathway), and 45% of the genes mapped to more than one pathway, as shown in FIG. 19. This caveat to KEGG makes it difficult to pinpoint the correct pathway when attempting to link a gene to a specific pathway., 539786=[0341] The site-of-action of isoxaflutole is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, E.C. 1.13.11.27), which converts 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate. Homogentisate is a precursor to \u03b1-tocopherols and plastoquinones. It is believed that carotenoid biosynthesis is indirectly inhibited by depletion of plastoquinones, a cofactor of phytoene desaturase, resulting in the bleaching phenotype observed with isoxaflutole. Tyrosine is an upstream precursor to homogentisate biosynthesis and, in some organisms including humans, phenylalanine can be converted to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydrolase., 576478=[0381] RNA samples were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using Agilent's Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Labeled cRNAs were evaluated using the RNA 6000 assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Labeled cRNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in an Ultrospec 2000 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). Probe solutions containing 125 ng of labeled cRNA for each mutant and its paired control were prepared using Agilent's in situ Hybridization Reagent Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Each pair of samples to be hybridized were independently labeled and hybridized utilizing a fluor reversal for a total of two hybridizations per sample pair. The microarrays were scanned simultaneously in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels with Agilent's 48-slide, Dual Laser DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) at 10 \u03bcm resolution using default settings., 125226=[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/414,488, filed Sep. 27, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/408,721, filed Sep. 6, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/407,840, filed Sep. 3, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/404,233, filed Aug. 16, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/384,445, filed May 30, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/379,562, filed May 10, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/374,229, filed Apr. 19, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/372,679, filed Apr. 15, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/368,776, filed Mar. 29, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/363,685, filed Mar. 12, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/356,994, filed Feb. 14, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/344,953, filed Dec. 21, 2001; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/331,948, filed Nov. 21, 2001. All of the foregoing patent applications are incorporated in their entirety by reference., 316574=[0206] One aspect of the present invention is to provide a database of endogenous metabolites suitable for use with human conditions. Preliminary estimates of the total number of compounds in a human are varied. The standard wall-chart of metabolism, which includes reactions not present in humans, lists only about 800 compounds in core primary metabolism. Most biochemical textbooks extend this list to no more than 1200 to 1500 compounds, again drawing from all life forms. Extensive querying of publicly available databases for human metabolites enables extension of the list to approximately 2000 compounds. Even assuming the final number of compounds in the human metabolome to be between 3000 and 4000, the size of the metabolome is workable and forms a firm foundation for scientific discovery., 569607=[0370] The rapid development of genomics in the past several years provided unique access to genes and regulatory elements of individual genes at the genome level. Successful application of the genomic techniques, such as DNA microarrays for exploring transcriptional profiles and genome differences for a variety of microorganisms, has greatly facilitated an understanding of mode of action of various anti-fungal drugs. M. D. De Backer, et al., 45 ANTIMICROB. AGENTS CHEMOTHER. 1660-1670 (2001); M. H. Jia et al., 3 PHYSIOL. GENOMICS. 83-92 (2000). However, microarrays might not provide direct information about how the mRNA change is coupled to the change in biological functions, because the rate of enzymatic reactions is a function of substrates and products (metabolomes). O. Fiehn, 48 PLANT MOL. BIOL. 155-171 (2002); B. H. Ter Kuile & H. V. Westerhoff, 500 FEBS LETT. 169-171 (2001)., 574655=[0379] Approx. 18\ufffd1 mg of lyophilized yeast cells in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube were rehydrated in 75 \u03bcL RNA LATER (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.) and incubated for 30 minutes. 875 \u03bcl TRIZOL Reagent (GibcoBRL, Rockville, Md.) were added to each tube. The tubes were vortexed for 15 seconds and allowed to rest for 45 seconds, repeated, and continued for a total of 5 minutes. 240 \u03bcl 100% Chloroform (RNAase-free) was added to each tube. Tubes were vortexed for 30 seconds, then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). The tubes were then spun at 14,000 rpm in a refrigerated eppendorf centrifuge at 4\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. 570 \u03bcl of the aqueous phase was removed and placed in a new, RNAase-free 2.0 ml tube. 430 \u03bcl nuclease-free water (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.), and 1.0 ml 100% isopropanol, were added to each tube and mixed thoroughly by inversion. Tubes were incubated for 10 minutes at RT. Samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes as before. Pellets were washed with 400 \u03bcl 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 10 minutes as before. The pellet was then dissolved in 100 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer 2100 and the RNA 6000 assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in an Ultrospec 2000 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). Microarrays containing approximately 6200 S. cerevisiae genes, essentially covering the entire genome, were generated by Agilent Technologies using oligonucleotides 60 bases in length synthesized in situ by an ink-jet printing method (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 154246=[0036]FIG. 19 illustrates the mapping of genes to pathways based on data obtained from experiment AF1, which examined the effects of the antifungal drugs Amphoteracin B, Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, and Posaconazole on yeast cells. Yeast gene accession numbers were parsed from KEGG pathway files resulting in the mapping of 1145 genes to 103 pathways. The percentage of genes (y-axis) is plotted versus the number of pathways (x-axis)., 483462=[0287] Gas chromatography was performed on a ThermoFinnigan Trace2000 GC (Thermo Finnigan Corp., San Jose, Calif.) equipped with an autosampler and a split/splitless injection port. The gas chromatograph was coupled to a ThermoFinnigan Tempus time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan Corp., San Jose, Calif.) fitted with an electron impact (EI) ion source. Chromatographic separations were conducted using a 50% phenyl/50% methyl polysiloxane stationary phase, helium carrier gas, and a programmed oven temperature that ramped from a starting temperature of 50\ufffd C. to a final temperature of over 300\ufffd C. Analyses were conducted with 1 \u03bcL injection volumes in split mode with a split ratio of 50:1. Electron impact mass spectra were acquired at 70 eV, at rate of 10 spectra/second, over the range m/z 41 to 640. Paraffins used as retention standards for calculating retention indices were prepared by diluting a Florida TRPH standard (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, Pa.) to a working concentration of 25 \u03bcg/mL each in methyl tert-butyl ether with 0.005% v/v tetramethylene sulfone as an internal standard., 307903=[0193] Metabolite analysis is particularly applicable to problems in which physiology is altered, e.g. through stress, disease, chemical, or other insult. Roessner et al., 13 PLANT CELL 11-29 (2001); Glassbrook et al., 18 NATURE BIOTECH. 1142-1143 (2000). Similar to transcriptomics and proteomics, the application of metabolomics is a global view of an organism, i.e. attempting to understand the current physiological status of a sample or organism in light of its full physiologic potential. Metabolomics information can be combined with data from other biological indicators in a coherent data set., 577630=[0383] Image Analysis Software (Version A.4.0.45, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) was used for image analysis. Each feature was determined from an array's associated pattern file and a detection algorithm. Intensity values for each feature were determined after subtracting background derived from an average of negative control features. Features with unusual pixel intensity statistics (e.g., high non-uniformity, saturation in either channel, and the like) were excluded from downstream analyses. Data was loaded into the Rosetta RESOLVER database (Rosetta Inpharmatics Inc., Kirkland, Wash.) for storage and analysis. Data was evaluated after combining results from fluor reversal replicate hybridizations. The annotation of yeast ORFs was obtained from Proteome BIOKNOWLEDGE Library (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, Calif.)., 915786=[0427] Data are analyzed using software such as Image Analysis Software (Version A.4.0.45, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) and then loaded into a database appropriate for storage and further analysis, such as the Rosetta RESOLVER database (Rosetta Inpharmatics Inc., Kirkland, Wash.).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0435] Although the invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be also understood that it is not to be so limited since changes and modifications can be made therein which are within the full intended scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims. [0434] Further, the data from this experiment, Specific Example 7, are combined with the data from Specific Example 5, for an analysis and comparison of the effects of the four azole drugs on both the pathogen (the yeast cells in Specific Example 5) and the host (the human cells in Specific Example 7). These types of analyses promise great utility in the pharmaceutical arena, by streamlining the search for drug compounds most harmful to the pathogen and most efficacious to the patient/host. [0433] The data are analyzed according to the methods and systems of the current invention. The data from each sample are assigned a unique identifier, and are collected and stored in a computer tracking system, wherein the data are linked to the appropriate unique identifier. All linked data are converted to a numeric format, and the numeric data are converted to a common unit system, wherein the common unit system data are a coherent data set and can serve as a model for a biological system. Additionally, the coherent data set can be compared",
