When you need to back up and restore complete file systems, use the ufsdump and ufsrestore commands described in Chapter\u00a045, The ufsdump and ufsrestore Commands (Reference). When you want to copy or move individual files, portions of file systems, or complete file systems, you can use the procedures described in this chapter as an alternative to ufsdump and ufsrestore.
