            "The campus safety is always around to help. If you are scared at night and just need a ride back to your dorm, they will take you. You won't need to be afraid because campus safety is always a phone call away.",
            "I've heard it was good, but haven't been in any Greek club yet. I've heard that all the clubs are really close spiritually and really care for one another. I've also heard that it's worth being in one.",
            "There are so many different clubs on campus, from sports to sewing. There is a club for everyone and their interests on campus. There is always some kind of different activity going on on campus for everyone.",
            "This school is an arts school. There are a lot of choirs and musically talented people. But it also has a great education program.",
            "I have only been here one year, so don't really know much, but I always liked to hang out and study on the third floor of the new SMC building. This building has Dunkin Donuts in it and is a great place to study. Also another great place to hang out is at the PCSU which as the bookstore and a lot of dining options.",
            "This school is definitely worth the money. You get your moneys worth at this school, if its from the great professors to the beautiful campus. You won't be wasting your money here because its totally worth it.",
            "Hang out with my friends. There are always events going on on campus and always free food on campus. Weekends are never boring because there is something always going on.",
            "There are many dining options. There are new places open such as Dunkin' Donuts and Subway. Sometimes the food can get expensive, so sometimes I eat in my dorm room.",
            "The dorm life is great. You meet so many new people and make so many new friends who will be with you for a long time. So many great friendships and close nit ones are made and its great.",
            "The professors are great and are there to help you. As long as you study hard and ask questions when you have the, you will do fine. The classes are not really that hard as long as you apply yourself.",
            "Always keep your head up and don't get discouraged. Don't be afraid to ask the professors for help, they're there to help you. Always study, don't slack and keep your grades high because you could be eligible for good scholarships through the school.",
            "This school is a great one. The professors really care about your education and help in anyway they can. I wouldn't of asked for a better school to attend."

They are changing companies for the cafeteria in 2012, so the food options in there should be really good, 195319=There are many greek clubs, and they each host an event for the whole campus, so there's always something for friday nights. The Student Leadership Committee plans TONS of fun events. Our sports teams have national recognition. Our choirs and theater are open to non-majors, and our choirs are nationally renowned: performing at the January 2013 Presidential Inauguration., 21503=Every Tuesday and Thursday you are required to attend Chapel at 10:40 am. Seeing as it's a Christ-Centered University, it's not too odd, but if you aren't used to the Pentecostal church, it may be a little different., 31328=Freshmen: Girls go for Sharp/Davis hall (Its the nicest freshman girls dorm) Guys go for Bowdle/O' Bannon You have a curfew; 12am on weekdays and 1am on weekends. (It's not a big deal, I promise) You are required to go to chapels, but only 70% a month. (Everyone is there so it's like a big hang out and not like a church service.) Freshmen won't be able to have cars so make friends with upper classmen. Come to LEE DAY! It's the best way for prospective students to see everything happening at Lee in one weekend. It's usually the first weekend in April. Whatever your expectation are, they will be blown away by how amazing this place is., 336841=Go to Lee Day. Meet advisors and current students to get a feel for what to expect come August., 116339=There is a strong rapport among the dorms on campus, including dorm rivalries. The rivalries culminate in an annual competition titled, Dorm Wars in February., 361665=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 66243=Lee is pretty darn cheap, considering it's a private school. As of Spring 2015, it's $6,840 a semester. ($570/credit). The maximum credit load before having to pay extra is 16 hours and you need 120 hours to graduate. It actually ended up being cheaper for me than going to one of the in-state public universities. Lee gives a lot of good scholarships, both for sports and academics. The quality of education is also very good, in my opinion. Going to ratemyprofessors.com will help you choose teachers that teach well but aren't hard and it will allow to avoid any teacher that may not be a good teacher. The housing a meal plans are overpriced, but that pretty much happens at every school. I really have learned a lot in my major courses and feel like it was worth it to come here. It's nice because it's not too small, yet it's not too big. When walking around campus, it is not unusual to see a lot of people you don't know but it's also not unusual to see a good amount of people that you do know., 133999=Lee University has many fun traditions, I will just name a few of my favorites: Dorm Wars, Chapel and Convocation Week. Dorm wars takes place every February, and it is an exciting time when each dorm competes in a huge game in the basket ball arena. It's a night that the dorms, and participants prepare for weeks ahead of time! Chapel takes place twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 10:40am to 11:30am. It's a 50 minute church service, and it's wonderful to take a break from the school day and focus on the Lord. And lastly, Convocation Week takes place once every semester where motivational speakers come to Lee University's chapel and speak- there is a different speaker each night for a week. During that week professor's are required not to give any tests or projects, so that we can focus on God for the week and learn something from the speakers., 115131=The Ocoee River is located approximately 20 miles from the campus, which provides river rafting for the area. The river was used in 1996 USA Olympics. Lee University is also located only 20 miles from Chattanooga, Tn which is home to many events for all ages and groups. Chattanooga has a beautiful downtown area with an aquarium and many places to eat. It is one of the students favorite places to go off campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I can honestly say that I have learned a lot while being here. The professors are, for the most part, very friendly, Christian people who would do anything to help their students learn. I find that if my professors are in their office, I can just walk in and ask for help no matter the time. These professors are also extremely qualified for their jobs; they really are experts in their fields. For the most part, the classes capture my interest. I find that I actually do learn in these classes and do not simply memorize the information for the test. I still can recall a lot of the things I learned during my first semester at Lee.
