This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a sequence value. The source table is not modified; instead, rows that have been read in a separate helper table are recorded. A sequence value of 1000, for example, means that every record with a sequence less than that value have been processed. Because many tables have some counter field that is always increasing and maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling. No field on the processed row must be modified by the Oracle Database Adapter., 56079=Section 9.2.10.2, \"Update a Field in the Table (Logical Delete)\", 56202=Section 9.2.10.3, \"Update a Sequencing Table\", 331954=Section 9.7.3.10, \"XSD Pruning Optimization\", 19608=Section 9.2.12, \"Specifying Advanced Options\", 56444=Section 9.2.10.5, \"Update a Sequencing File\", 474098=The default port is 1521., 244099=Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 (all SP levels included), 92318=Using this feature, you can select a stored procedure (or stored function), enter its arguments, and perform a test execution to retrieve an actual row set. The Adapter Configuration Wizard then introspects the returned row set and generates a strongly typed XSD. You can enter arguments easily through the wizard.

Alias data types are created by using the sp_addtype database engine stored procedure or the CREATE TYPE Transact-SQL statement (only for SQL Server 2005.) The use of the Transact-SQL statement is the preferred method for creating alias data types.

The XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid.

This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a last_updated value. A last_updated value of 2005-01-01 12:45:01 000, for example, means that every record last updated at that time or earlier have been processed. Because many tables have rows with a last_updated or creation_time column maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling.

In some cases, however, to pass an element such as this element, which does have a null value, you must state this explicitly (for example, <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>).
