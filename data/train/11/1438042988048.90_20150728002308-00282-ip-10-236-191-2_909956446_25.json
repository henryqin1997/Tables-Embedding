We first took you inside the States most prolific offenses and looked at the big time scoring machines.\u00a0 Next we looked at the toughest and stingiest defenses.\u00a0 That showed us who could shut down those point monsters. Who are the best teams statistically coming in to the playoffs?\u00a0 I mean there is so many ways you can break this down and we have done that here in the past few weeks.

When you factor in their tough pre-season and Skyline of Washington you have to know they are a threat. In a little bit of a surprise the West Linn Lions bested most other teams in 6A showing their defensive muscle.\u00a0 They edged out league champs Lake Oswego in this category as well. Hillsboro is showing why they are the best and headed for 6A next year.\u00a0 Marist looks like they need to move up to 6A as well.\u00a0 Let's face it.\u00a0 They need the challenge! :) Best wishes to all the teams and players tonight.\u00a0 Let's see if these regular season Kings of the Beat Down can keep it up through the play offs!",
