There is also a beautiful park a 10 minute walk from campus, complete with a marvelous wooden castle playground! Stop by the farmer's market for fresh ice cream and lunch, or just attend some of the fun-packed events sponsored by the Student Activities Council! If you're looking for more, take the train from our on-campus station to Philadelphia for the day!, 100321=DVC used to be called the National Farm School. It was founded in 1896 as a school for Jewish boys who wanted to learn how to farm. Now it is co-ed and has no religious affiliations, but the original Jewish temple that was built on campus still stands and occasionally special events are held in it. To keep with our roots, the college is closed for all Jewish holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur., 161367=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 134557=Delaware Valley College may be a small school, but the 18:1 ratio of students to teachers increases the chances of gaining a hands on experience for a future job. Del Val is very good at setting up a schedule for students to make sure they graduate on time and achieve a high level of education proficiency. Also, Del Val is excellent with ensuring a job right out of college as they provide great services at the college for us to obtain help.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I have completed my first semester here at Delaware Valley College and have learned so much already. The core classes like English 1 and Chemistry 1 tuned up my skills from high school in each of those areas. My major-specific courses were very interesting and the teachers taught all of the material in a way that we students could absorb it.
