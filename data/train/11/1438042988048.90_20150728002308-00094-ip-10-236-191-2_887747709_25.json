    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun Well, I find my learning fun and going to church, but for others there is social life around the town, a big lake and lots of woods. Food and Dining There is all kinds of restaurants around the town. We have colleges in our small town. I have recently graduated from the one college and now will be attending the other. Dorm Life There is no dorms with Empire because there is online learning. Academic Rigor I do not know about their academic rigor yet; however, I was warned to ask for someone else for a mentor if I got a certain professor, but it appears I did not get here. Tips for prospective students I was informed that you need to be able to write well and that there is no test there. I do find this appealing, because I suffer from test anxiety. I have learned how to write a paper well so I feel very encouraged about attending. In three sentences I am starting there in the fall, so far out of six people I have spoken",
