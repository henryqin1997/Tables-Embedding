Understanding the Importance of Transducer Orientation When monitoring vibration on large gas or steam turbines and generators with fluid-film bearings, the relative movement of the shaft within the bearing is typically measured by a pair of shaft proximity (eddy current) transducers. Data from these transducers is used to produce a variety of plots Should You Use Current or Voltage in Analog Transducer Readings? Several instrumentation monitoring applications including equipment monitoring, quality assurance and others require you to choose among the different signal types for your analog measurement transducer. The most common of these are either voltage (0-5 volts DC, or 0-10 volts DC) or current Understanding Current Sinking, Current Sourcing, and Ground Loops You've just purchased some current to pneumatic transducers and are ready to try them. Each transducer has been carefully installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and wired to its own 4-20 mA analog",
