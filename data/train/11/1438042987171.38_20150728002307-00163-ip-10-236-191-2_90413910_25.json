    "textBeforeTable": "Men's Pyjama Suit Fable III Outfits Edit [show] Contents Clothing is back in Fable III and more customisable than ever. There are many outfits that the Hero can purchase or earn throughout the game. Clothing items can also be found in chests, spots, or received as gifts. Clothing offers no armour value, but is not simply aesthetic. Your outfit affects how people see and interact with you. Most clothing items offer a modifier to attractiveness but not all items will have a positive impact. Several clothing items offer additional modifiers like silliness and scariness. All of the female outfits offer an additional modifier to appearance for male Heroes: transvestism. Clothing can be dyed several colours with dye packs unlocked on the Road to Rule and with downloadable content. There are four clothing shops around Albion and Aurora, all of which need to be visited to earn the Fashion Victim achievement. } document.write(' Advertisement",
