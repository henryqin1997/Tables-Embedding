    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{956034=I took 13 hours my first semester, which was the Fall of 2012. 13 hours was just the right amount for me and I loved all my instructors. I was 17 and wanted to get acclimated to college. I am currently enrolled for 17 hours this semester., 8293=I am looking forward to experiencing this school in July and getting a head start before the Fall session begins., 108857=Get all of your requested items in before February, 442592=The food isn't that bad surprisingly. There are a lot of options to chose from. The best dining hall by far on campus has to be Harris. It is the one that is most far away but, its buffet style so you can get as much food as your heart desires. Commons closed but they are reopening it in the Fall of 2012 so, incoming freshman will get that extra option. There are a lot of different places to pick from. There are five dining halls on campus and each you can use your meal swipes. Each dining hall has a variety of food options to pick from so you won't ever get bored of the same food., 185418=The San Marcos River runs through campus. I've often seen people swimming or tanning by the river, and this is in January. If you're a nerd like me, then you'll probably enjoy the large, beautiful library., 547682=Orientation will confuse you and leave you frustrated. Make sure you are not herded into the wrong group, and if you are, make sure to meet with advisors AS SOON AS CLASSES START. You may be in the wrong major, which will lead to loss of money and time. Make sure you find out FOR SURE who your advisor is and that you see them at least once every semester. If you have questions about financial aid, GOOD LUCK! May just ask a friend if you can. Do not take Economics, History, Math, English, etc. all in the same semester! Break it up with something fun, like a PFW. Do not take 16 hours or more a semester. Also, this is a GREEK school, beware of the frat boys/sorority girls, they are everywhere and extremely annoying., 763076=Texas State is a great school for students who are education majors. It is recognized for that, in fact Texas State used to be a teachers college when it first opened 1899. It provides great opportunities to meet new students and the professors here are great, they will do anything they can to help you succeed., 909649=The classes are worth the price. But the required dorm fees for all freshman is where things get bad. Any apartment would be at least 5 times nice than the dorms, and about a third of the cost. The meal plan works out well but only if you get the biggest one which is about $1400. It's good that many things are covered in student fees. All washing machines and printers are free to use., 286405=there is never a dull moment at texas state! there is constantly something going on on-campus and off. ranging from free orchestra concerts at evans liberal arts building to april fest in the spring, which consists of a festival and a headlining singer., 526641=There is always something going on! Whether there are performances at the theater or sporting events, there is always fun. In San Marcos there is the Square which is nice for an evening out. For the outdoorsy type there is floating on the river or walking around the beautiful campus. Not to mention all the events held by the university, for example Mr. Fest which is a music festival hosted by the university radio station every April., 456905=One of my favorite Texas State traditions is the Riverfest. Every year Texas State puts on a concert series at the river with performances by students and a headliner. In 2011, the Ying Yang Twins headlined Riverfest and in 2012 Yung Joc performed as the headliner. They also give away free things such as sunglasses and frisbees., 903618=The dorm life on Texas States campus is phenomenal. For me to be able to roll out of bed at 8:30 for a 9am class is amazing. You meet so many new people and never have to worry about driving to class. Yes having to share a room or a suite with someone can get kind of aggravating I promise it's an experience of a lifetime., 586114=Well, every person is different, so I will say that anything you do will be fun. For a few examples, there is a lot of places to go shopping such as the Outlet malls in San Marcos. There are a lot of athletic events that happen throughout the week, and the athletic program is joining the Western Athletic Conference, so go watch the big football games against large schools like Texas Tech on September 8th. What is also nice about Texas State is the nice crystal clear river that runs on campus.}",

We have a budding nursing program, as well as pre-law, and are expanding our masters and doctorate programs as well! Tips for prospective students Don't hesitate! Incoming freshmen are required to live on campus their first year, and housing is limited. Apply as soon as possible so you can get a room! Bang for the buck Back on topic of the education business, if you are looking for a great education, but don't want to spend alot doing it, Texas State is definately where you want to go. Tuition here at Texas State is almost as cheap as attending a community college, but the education you get is definately above par. Your tuition includes free usage of the Student Rec center (which, by all accounts is",
