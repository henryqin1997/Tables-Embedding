Out[20]= In[20]:= A second application of is used to obtain a method of order six, which uses adaptive step sizes. The inner specification of constructs a method of order five. The following example extrapolates the classical Runge\u2013Kutta method of order four using two applications of (3). Higher Order are used to raise the order and provide an adaptive step-size estimate. Nested applications of In[19]:= property is specified. This shows how to define the property. assumes by default that a method is not appropriate for stiff problems (and",
