    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1=The second potential econometric difficulty involves the length of time for the transactions. While the length of time for the transaction with the payment instrument actually chosen is observed, the expected length of time for the transaction with any other payment instrument is not. As a result, the differences for transaction are unobservable. The econometrician must predict the time differences based on the observed data. To control for potential sample selection bias, one estimates parameters on observation subsets and then predicts values for the entire sample, as shown by Lee [1978, 1979, 1983]. Because the expected time difference potentially affects payment choice, the observed times for a particular payment type may be subject to selection bias. Specifically, the theory that this paper is designed to test suggests that consumers choose the payment instrument that minimizes the expected time for the transaction, all other things equal. If this is the case, the observed data reflects these expectations of the \" fastest\" choice. Thus, while there is a complete distribution of transaction times with each payment type, only the transaction times that were significantly less with that particular payment type relative to other payment types are observed if the theory is correct. In order to construct consistent expected transaction times for all payment types, one needs to construct terms that correct for the potential sample selection bias. These selection terms are then included in the regression specification. By including these terms in the regression specification, the resulting parameter estimates are unbiased and the remaining error term has a zero mean.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{10308=In order to control for availability and financial portfolio factors, the analysis uses debit card and check transactions only. Checks and debit cards both transfer funds from checking accounts; thus there should be little difference in availability or impact on consumers' financial portfolio, conditional on having the account, and the analysis is focused specifically on the effect of time on the choice of media of exchange. Furthermore, in order to control for the unobserved expectation of the length of time of a transaction, the analysis constructs expected transaction times following the method outlined by Lee [1978, 1979, 1981] and used in later work by Brueckner and Follain [1988], Dowd, Feldman, Cassou and Finch [1991] and Oettinger [1999]., 89571=Table 6 provides some back-of-the-envelope calculations that provide support for the claims in the previous paragraph.24 Using data from the January 2001 National Compensation Survey and the predicted times for the 50th-60th percentile of items bought shown in table 4, the shadow values of payment choice can be easily calculated. The difference in price for checks and debit cards is 66 cents for the highest hourly earners, a substantial difference. Work by Bolt et. al (2005) shows that consumers indeed change payment choices when payment instruments are priced explicitly. The results in this paper show that consumers change their choices when faced with implicit costs as well., 92934=As explained in the text, each stage's standard errors should be corrected to account for the fact some terms are predicted from the previous stage. The standard errors reported in this paper reflect the necessary corrections. This section outlines the methods used, based on Lee [1982 and Murphy and Topel [1985]., 50583=The scanner data are over 10 million checkout transactions over a three month period, from September to November, 2001. For computational tractability, the estimates are based on a sample. The sampling procedure is as follows. From the population of over 10 million transactions, a random sample of 100,000 observations was drawn without replacement. This process was repeated 100 times, to provide 100 samples. Thus, each subsample represents a sample without replacement, but observations may be repeated across subsamples. Most reported estimates reflect the results from evaluating the model on one random sample only. In general, results are qualitatively similar across random samples. However, some coefficients change sign and significance. These cases are noted within the text., 93504=There are two ring time regressions reported: one for the subsample that used a debit card and the other for the subsample that used a check. Using the OLS standard errors may lead to mistakes in inferences regarding parameters due to sample selection. This section outlines the method used to correct the standard errors, based on Lee [1978, 1979, 1982]. The notation follows Lee [1978], p. 422., 6990=To overcome weaknesses from survey data, this paper uses scanner data from grocery store transactions to examine time costs associated with media of exchange. Grocery store scanner data has been used extensively in other contexts, for example, in estimating elasticities of demand for consumer products (Chevalier, Rossi and Kashyap [2003]) and in constructing price indexes for goods (Feenstra and Shapiro [2003]). Scanner data is an ideal medium for examining time costs associated with media of exchange as well. First, these data represent actual market exchanges, are very accurate, and are available at a very high frequency. Second, grocery store retailers spend much time and effort in minimizing the length of time for checkout transactions, partly driven by the industry's relatively low margins - the average after-tax net profit as a percent of total sales was approximately 1 percent in fiscal year 2003.6 And third, everyone eats, everyone eats often, and everyone shops for groceries. Because groceries are perishable, consumers shop often, and thus this type of exchange is arguably one of the more frequent that a typical consumer makes. In fact, food purchases from grocery stores and other retail outlets represented 6.2 percent of disposable personal income in 2001.7, 52422=The second data source used in the analysis is 2000 census tract information from the U.S. Census. The addresses of the retail outlets were matched with census tract level information from the U.S. Census Bureau to proxy for demographics of the local market. Evidence suggests that people shop locally for groceries.16 Thus, census tract information may proxy for heterogeneity that may exist in length of time of transactions due to demographics of the local market. These census tract variables were matched with transactions by the retail outlet number on the scanner dataset.}",
