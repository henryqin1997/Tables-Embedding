This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a sequence value. The source table is not modified; instead, rows that have been read in a separate helper table are recorded. A sequence value of 1000, for example, means that every record with a sequence less than that value has already been processed. Because many tables have some counter field that is always increasing and maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling. No field on the processed row must be modified by the Oracle Database Adapter., 273498=Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, 382784=Enter numbers and strings directly, dates as literals (for example, 2009/11/11), and structs as say MYOBJ('a', 'b')., 451575=The default port is 1521., 363793=Note that the XML schema type, dateTime, represents TIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP. This means that the XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid. XML schema defines dateTime as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss. Therefore, the correct DATE value is 2005-01-01T00:00:00. Values for these parameters must be specified using this format in the instance XML., 192148=Choose this operation to employ the sequencing table: last updated strategy. This polling strategy involves using a helper table to remember a last_updated value. A last_updated value of 2005-01-01 12:45:01 000, for example, means that every record last updated at that time or earlier has already been processed. Because many tables have rows with a last_updated or creation_time column maintained by triggers or the application, this strategy can often be used for noninvasive polling. No fields on the processed row ever need to be modified by the Oracle Database Adapter., 235392=SQL Server 2005 installs with Windows authentication as the default. Therefore, you do not log in with a user name and password; rather, your Windows user account either has privilege or does not. JDBC requires you to provide a user name and password., 71725=Using this feature, you can select a stored procedure (or stored function), enter its arguments, and perform a test execution to retrieve an actual row set. The Adapter Configuration Wizard then introspects the returned row set and generates a strongly typed XSD. You can enter arguments easily through the wizard. For example, you can enter numbers and strings directly, dates as literals (2009/11/11), and you can even enter structs like MYOBJ('a', 'b')., 236835=Ensure that SQL Server Browser is running and that your SQL Server service has TCP/IP enabled and is listening on static port 1433. Disable dynamic ports. In SQL Native Client Configuration/Client Protocols, ensure that TCP/IP is enabled and that the default port is 1433., 282278=Structured data types (user-defined) were introduced in SQL Server 2005. The command-line utility, however, does not support them. Therefore, structured data types may not be used as the data type of a parameter in a stored procedure or function., 272860=The command-line utility can be used to generate the required service artifacts for IBM DB2 v8.x, v9.x; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005; and MySQL v5.x, v6.x. The data types and properties that are supported vary for each database., 263009=The command-line utility is invoked with a properties file that provides information for generating the necessary BPEL artifacts. The Adapter Configuration Wizard supports Oracle Database, IBM DB2, AS/400, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and MySQL v5.2.6 or higher so using the command-line utility is not necessary. The utility continues to support all of its current databases, but is now only required for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and versions of MySQL before v5.2.6. The command-line utility does not support AS/400., 217639=Microsoft SQL Server 2008, 274023=The Adapter Configuration Wizard can be used to access stored procedures and functions on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 using catalog tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema. Thus, using the command-line utility is no longer necessary for SQL Server 2005. However, you must continue to use the command-line utility for SQL Server 2000., 333590=The nillable attribute is always set to true to allow the corresponding element in the instance XML to have a null value (for example, <X/> or <X></X>). In some cases, however, to pass an element such as this, which does have a null value, you must state this explicitly (for example, <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>). The namespace, xsi, used for the nillable attribute, must be declared explicitly in the instance XML (for example, xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\")., 281040=Besides, the data types mentioned in the preceding table, alias data types are also supported. Alias data types are created by using the sp_addtype database engine stored procedure or the CREATE TYPE Transact-SQL statement (only for SQL Server 2005.) Note that the use of the Transact-SQL statement is the preferred method for creating alias data types. The use of sp_addtype is being deprecated., 278976=XML (2005 only)}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 9-19 Third-Party Database: Binding Binary and Date Values to Parameters of a Stored Procedure Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, AS/400, and MySQL support binding various forms of binary and date data types to parameters of a stored procedure, as summarized in Table 9-19. This section describes the conversion of data types such as CLOB, DATE, TIMESTAMP, and binary data types including RAW, LONG RAW and BLOB, as well as similar data types supported by third-party databases. Data Type Conversions <X xsi:nil=\"true\"/>  To specifically assign a null value to X when the type of X is user-defined, add the xsi:nil attribute to the element in the XML file, as in X := OBJ(NULL, NULL, NULL);  Similarly, in the preceding OBJECT example, an initialized instance of OBJ, whose attribute values have all been null assigned, is bound to X. Similar to the VARRAY case, this is equivalent to calling the type constructor. For example, X := ARRAY();  In the preceding VARRAY example, if <X/> or <X></X> is specified, then the value bound to X is an empty instance of the VARRAY. In PL/SQL, this is equivalent to calling the type constructor and assigning the value to X. For example, The second case, <X/>, behaves differently if the type of X is user-defined. Rather than assigning null to X, an initialized instance",
    "textAfterTable": "For a CLOB parameter, if the length of the CLOB parameter is less than 4 kilobytes, then the text extracted from the XML file is bound to the parameter as a String type with no further processing. If the length of the CLOB parameter is greater than 4 kilobytes or if the mode of the parameter is IN/OUT then a temporary CLOB parameter is created. The XML file data is then written to the temporary CLOB before the CLOB is bound to its corresponding parameter. The temporary CLOB parameter is freed when the interaction completes. For other character types, such as CHAR and VARCHAR2, the data is simply extracted and bound as necessary. Note that it is possible to bind an XML document to a CLOB parameter (or VARCHAR2 if it is large enough). However, appropriate substitutions for <, >, and so on, must first be made (for example, &lt; for < and &gt; for >). A few data types require special processing before their values are bound to their corresponding parameters. These include data types represented by the XML Schema types base64Binary and dateTime. Note that the XML schema type, dateTime, represents TIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP. This means that the XML values for these data types must adhere to the XML schema representation for dateTime. Therefore, a simple DATE string, 01-JAN-05, is invalid. XML schema defines dateTime as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss. Therefore, the correct DATE value is 2005-01-01T00:00:00.
