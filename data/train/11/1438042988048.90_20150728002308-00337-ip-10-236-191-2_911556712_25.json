            "I feel very safe here on campus. IF there is ever a time you need a ride, you can call the schools free shuttle service and they will pick you up. They will drive you to the Lowell commuter rail station, and the campus police are real police, not just security guards. So you can always call them if you feel uneasy about anything.",
            "Greek life is on its way back up! we have a greek week the first month of school!",
            "So many clubs. If you can think it, they have it, and if they don't it is super easy to make it. Find 9 friends, find a faculty member to advise (they don't have to attend the meetings they are there for support and to be the mediator between you and the administration), and pow you have yourself a club!",
            "So much to do for fun! The school is BIG on hockey, the whole school is at the hockey games on the weekends. There is always some live music, and the theater department always has something going on.",
            "Food is EXCELLENT! and there are many different places and many different options.",
            "It is awesome, especially as a freshman. You are living with all freshmen and you have classes together and its so easy to walk down the hall and meet someone new.",
            "depends on what classes you take, but the workload is manageable.",
            "Be friendly, everyone there is friendly and outgoing and they love making new friends!",
            "The campus is amazing, the seperate east campus for most residence halls makes it have a homey feel, you get to drive a mile home on the bus after school everyday. It is very nice!"

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students A state school with great rating!!! You really can't go wrong with this school. Make sure you get a tour of the dept. your interested in. If you go see Computer Science, you will be blown away! Bang for the buck UML has a great reputation as a state school and the grads get good jobs! The professors are very connected to the working world and know how to direct the students towards job placement. That says it all to me! Am enjoying being here The campus is near a city for many cultural & sports activities. I can also drive out to skiing, hiking and other rural activities. The academic attitude is strict & I have to study pretty hard but teams are set up for freshman to help with study groups and develop a community atmosphere. It works for me. Am learning a lot The Computer Science Department is the best I have seen. I could study robotics, gaming & programing- everything I am interested in. Then the school is connected to many businesses in the area & I can work or research with outside projects. They prepare you for the real world.",
