            "Public safety is very accessible. There is an officer here on campus 24/7 every day of the year.",
            "There are four different sororities and two different fraternities. There are no historically black or other minority greek organizations, unfortunately. Although there are not a lot of different Greek organizations like other schools about 45% of the campus belongs to one of the Greek organizations that we do have.",
            "There are lots of clubs. We have cultural, religious, and academic clubs. We also have tons of club and intramural sports.",
            "Lake Forest College is great for a student who is looking to come to a small school with a diverse student body and an amazing group of professors and faculty. We are very open to all types of people and try to find a way to make every student feel like they belong.",
            "The tuition is pretty steep here, because it is a private institution but they offer some of the best financial aid packages in the country and try to work as best they can with each individual student to make it as affordable as possible.",
            "Lake Forest is 20 minutes north of Chicago, if there is no traffic and if you take the train it is 45 minutes. A lot of the students go into the city often to have fun. The Lake Forest beach is a 10 minute walk away and there are plenty of events, parties and games that the students go to as well.",
            "The food is AMAZING!!! The is absolutely the best, there are vegan ad vegetarian options and there is something new everyday and plenty of crowd favorites.",
            "We are a very small school so dorm life is not all that exciting. You do become very close with the other students that live in your building, that is a plus!",
            "I would not say that classes here are hard but there is a lot of work all the time. If you do not utilize the availability of your professors and the other academic resources, like the writing and math centers, you will suffer academically. We also have plenty of opportunities for students to study abroad. Our school has programs in New Zealand, which is our newest, Greece, our most popular, China, Spain, and Paris. If these are not your cup of tea there are plenty of other programs to choose from as well.",
            "At Lake Forest the professors focus a lot on writing and there are a lot of papers, even in the natural sciences. Because there is such a diverse student body there are plenty of clubs for students to get involved with and plenty of opportunities for student to take on leadership positions in these organizations as well. For incoming athletes, we have varsity, club and intramural sports depending on the amount of time and effort that you are willing to put in. Lastly, one of the nicest things about Lake Forest is that all of the professors are required to have office hours where students can come and discuss any issues that they are having in or out of class.",
            "Lake Forest College is very diverse. Lake Forest College is cozy. Lake Forest College is somewhere a student can come if they are willing to work hard and have a lot of fun at the same time."

The teacher to student ratio is 12:1 and the average class size is 15. The professors and dean are nice, accessible and approachable. Lake Forest College is mainly what you make of it., 33886=Although I know students often have difficulty with roommates, the dorms themselves are beautiful. There is currently both academic and all-female housing available. While there is usually a substance-free dorm, the dorm is being completely renovated and will be available again in Fall 2013. Nollen and Deerpath are the newest residence halls, and Harlan and Blackstone are the most historic. There are quad spaces available with balconies for an apartment feel, and there are also several apartments available on campus. Cleavland-Young is the international house, and has a kitchen available for use to every student on campus. The college recently opened up the opportunity for students to live off-campus in the Fort Sheridan Apartments as part of a housing plan. The dorms are cleaned well, as general maintenance is updated regularly, but I have heard of a small bug problem in some dorms that is easily taken care of each year., 160230=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Lake Forest has a little something for everyone I truly believe. I have friends of all kinds and they all have found a place that fits them at school. From music to art to science and community service, there are groups of people passionate about anything you are! Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus A few times every month Lake Forest has ACPs or All Campus Programs which allow students to go out on the weekend and dance and eat and have a good time away from their studies. Bang for the buck Lake Forest seems expensive at first but they give some of the most financial aid I have ever heard of. What to do for fun Because Lake Forest is so close to the Lake Forest train stop, Chicago and all of its glory is only a train ride away. More locally however, there are many cute shops and restaurants a walk away from campus. In the surrounding towns there are also many options for entertainments which the provided shuttle from the school will bring you to. Food and Dining The dining experience at Lake Forest is pretty good.",
