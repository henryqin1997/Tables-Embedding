            "ARRANGEMENT TO CONNECT A TOOL WHEEL AND A TOOL HOLDING FIXTURE - An arrangement for the non-rotational connection between a toothed tool wheel for the machining of end peripheral areas of tooth flanks, having an axis of rotation, and a tool holding fixture that can be rotationally driven around an axis of rotation. Said arrangement has an elastic means with a restoring force against which the direction of the axis of rotation of the tool wheel can be displaced relative to the direction of the axis of rotation of the tool holding fixture.",
            "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR REMOVING A SECONDARY BURR ON AN END-CUT WORK PIECE WHEEL - A method and a device for removing secondary burrs raised on the tooth flanks of a work piece wheel by a chamfering of the end tooth edges of said work piece wheel provides a tool wheel that rotationally meshes with the work piece wheel. Said tool wheel has cutting edges on its tooth flanks ("
