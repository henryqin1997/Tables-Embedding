So coming from an associate degree to a bachelor degree was definitely a big change when it came to tuition and fees. I started at a private college Fall 2010. It was $1,065 for a 3 credit class; this spring semester I'm spending $707 for 3 credit class. Not only does UWGB seem as if it's a better experience than the private college, but it's also a lot cheaper! Another great thing is that you get discounts with your student ID from UWGB. Such as men's basketball games are at a discounted rate and women's basketball games are FREE!, 133595=The campus food is pretty good, the corner store is expensive, but good. The only problem is that if you live in a dorm you need to buy the meal plan for $2000 a year. You get $950 each semester, but it doesn't transfer over and spending that much in 4 months is really hard. I feel this is a big part about why students gain weight at first., 191195=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
