Conceptually, the search engine is applied separately for each region. Regions are formed dynamically, and the objects on which search engines function are statically built indexes. Therefore, calling the search engine on a region is realized in approximation: for each region, a covering set of indexes is found from the mapping of nodes to indexes. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 18, taxonomy 1500 comprises regions 1510 and 1520. Region 1510 is comprised entirely of the green cluster (FIG. 14) so the search on this region would be limited to index 1150. Region 1520, on the other hand, comprises the orange cluster (FIG. 14) and the purple cluster (FIG. 14). Therefore, a search on this region would have to include indexes 1145 and 1155., 47487=U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/139,5094, Jun. 15, 1999, entitled \u201cKnowledge Management Software System,\u201d., 247380=a) Taxonomy Selection: Users may be asked to indicate which of the returned taxonomies are relevant or irrelevant to the question at hand. For example, referring to FIG. 20, there is shown a typical user interface 1700 comprised of four \u201cbuttons\u201d 1710-1740. When the user presses the Taxonomy Selection button (1710), the user is presented with taxonomies 1750-1770. The system may then ask the user if Geographic considerations (as an example) are an important aspect of the user's question, based on tagging the question via autocontextualization to a Geography taxonomy. The user's response to this type of question are added to the Taxonomic Restrictions of the user's question, resulting in the system discarding taxonomy 1770, which leads to a more precise response in the next round of the dialog., 233956=knowledge containers that are tagged to nodes close in the taxonomy to the concept nodes identified by the query taxonomy tags. The rationale for this strategy is that concept nodes that are close together in the taxonomy are likely to be about similar topics. In addition to augmenting the knowledge container set, this step groups the concept nodes identified by the query taxonomy tags such that an identified region includes concept nodes whose knowledge containers are about a set of closely related concepts, and distinct regions denote concept nodes whose knowledge containers are about significantly different concepts. This allows the system to treat distinct regions in distinct ways (ranking knowledge containers from one region higher than knowledge containers from another, for example) as well as allowing for relationships between regions. In one embodiment, all regions are treated equally for region designation purposes. In another embodiment, a knowledge container tagged to one region is preferred over knowledge containers tagged to other regions. In yet another embodiment, all regions are treated conjunctively, in a further embodiment all regions are treated disjunctively; and in still another embodiment some regions are treated conjunctively and some regions are treated disjunctively. A conjunctive interpretation is one in which knowledge containers tagged to more regions are preferred to knowledge containers tagged to fewer regions; a disjunctive interpretation is one in which knowledge containers tagged to a single region are preferred to knowledge containers tagged to multiple regions. For example, a conjunctive interpretation is generally appropriate for a query about tax consequences of variable rate mortgages, where a knowledge container that is tagged to both a node about mortgages and to a node about taxes would be preferred over a knowledge container that is tagged to just one or the other. A disjunctive interpretation is generally appropriate for a lexically ambiguous query that is tagged to one concept node because of some query term, and is tagged to another concept node because of that same term used in a different sense, in which case it would be preferred to not have a particular knowledge container tagged to both nodes. The term \u201cjaguar\u201d occurring in a query, for example, may result in query taxonomy tags to concept nodes \u201cJungle Cat\u201d and \u201cAutomobile\u201d, but the query is about one or the other, not both. The actual process of region designation has three steps: marking, smoothing, and aggregation. In the marking step, concept nodes are identified that are below some taxonomic distance threshold from query taxonomy tags that the concept nodes are likely to be about. The threshold and the number of query taxonomy tags they must be close to are parameters of the system that may be set based on experimentation. FIG. 15, further shows the operation of the marking step in accordance with the present invention. As shown in FIG. 15, distance is measured based on the edge distance in the taxonomy, where edges are treated as undirected and equal (unweighted). A setting of the parameters for which experimentation has been performed is a closeness of \u201cone\u201d (how close a node must be to query taxonomy tags) and number of query taxonomy tags being twenty per cent (i.e., how many query taxonomy tags to which a node must be close in order to be marked). Using these settings, assuming in one example that there are ten query taxonomy tags, a node with two or more immediate neighbors that are query taxonomy tags is marked. In FIG. 15, nodes 1210, 1220, 1230, 1240 and 1250 are marked nodes., 229999=An example of a taxonomy according to this implementation is shown in FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 12, taxonomy 30 comprises a plurality of nodes 310 and edges 320. Each node in FIG. 12 is a concatenation of all documents tagged to that node. The clustering algorithm is then run over these concept-node-documents. The information returned by concept-node-document clustering can be viewed as identifying clusters of nodes. As shown in FIG. 13, taxonomy 1000 comprises nodes 1005-1125. Nodes 1005, 1015, 1030, 1040, 1045, 1050, 1080 and 1085 belong to the orange cluster; nodes 1010 and 1025 belong to the blue cluster; nodes 1020, 1055, 1060, 1065, 1100, 1105 and 1110 belong to the green cluster; and nodes 1035, 1070, 1075, 1090, 1115, 1120 and 1125 belong to the purple cluster. As further shown in FIG. 13, clusters may not necessarily be related (ancestors/descendants) to each other. Referring now to FIG. 14, it is seen that for each cluster, an index 1110-1140 is constructed of the knowledge containers tagged to the nodes in the cluster. The nodes comprising the blue cluster (FIG. 13) are placed in index 1140. The nodes comprising the orange cluster (FIG. 13) are placed in index 1145. The nodes comprising the purple cluster (FIG. 13) are placed in index 1150, and the nodes comprising the green cluster (FIG. 13) are placed in index 1155. If a knowledge container is tagged to multiple nodes in a cluster, the knowledge container appears once in the index for that cluster. If a knowledge container is tagged to nodes in different clusters, the knowledge container appears in the index for each cluster to which the knowledge container is tagged., 248253=b) Region Selection: As shown in FIG. 21, users may similarly be asked to indicate which knowledge map regions are relevant. More specifically, interface 1700 again presents the user with buttons 1710-1740. When the user presses the Cluster Selection button (1720), the user is presented with taxonomy 1810. This can take the form of a list of regions for users to choose from; or alternatively, using cues in the taxonomy structure such as two distant regions from the same taxonomy, the system may present two or more regions as mutually exclusive alternatives. For example, suppose a user asks a question about Jaguars. Autocontextualization may produce tags related to both automobiles and animals, and these may be expanded by the retrieval process into different regions. The system may determine based on the taxonomic structure that these are likely to be mutually exclusive regions. Thus the user may be presented with the question \u201cIs your question more relevant to automobiles or to animals?\u201d Just as for taxonomy selection, the user's responses to this type of question are added to the taxonomic restrictions of the user's question, resulting in a more precise response in the next round of the dialog., 237668=After the marking step, smoothing may then performed. Smoothing identifies nodes that are immediate or near neighbors of marked and query taxonomy tags and includes these identified nodes in the augmented set of query taxonomy tags. Referring now to FIG. 16, it is shown that nodes 1300-1370 are sufficiently close to marked nodes 1210-1250 to qualify as smoothed nodes., 238086=The aggregation step then defines subsets of the set of marked, smoothed (if smoothing is performed) and query taxonomy tags. If two nodes in the set of smoothed, marked, and query taxonomy tags are within some distance of each other (e.g., are immediate neighbors), then these nodes are defined to be in the same region. That is, a region is the transitive closure of this distance relation. The region definition is related to (maximal) connected components, but is defined on nodes rather than edges. Referring now to FIG. 17, it is shown that taxonomy 1400 comprises nodes 1210-1250 (as defined in FIG. 15), 1300-1370 (as defined in FIG. 16), and regions 1410 and 1420. Nodes 1210-1230 and 1300-1350 are in region 1410, and nodes 1240-1250 and 1360-1370 are in region 1420.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Explicit profiling allows the user to select items of interest explicitly from one or more taxonomies. These, along with a default or explicit weight, become taxonomy tags for their customer knowledge container. Implicit profiling, on the other hand, relies on the system to add or modify customer knowledge container taxonomy tags in order to profile the customer. For example, when creating the customer knowledge container, the system may set a concept in \u201caccess level\u201d or \u201centitlement level\u201d taxonomies that match the privileges they wish to accord the end user whom the knowledge container represents. The system may alternatively observe user behavior and then modify taxonomy tags accordingly. That is, the system can increase the weight of taxonomy tags that are frequently spotted in the user's questions during the autocontextualization segment of the retrieval process and it can increase the weight of taxonomy tags for answers given by the user during the dialog segment of the retrieval process. Finally, the business context of the interaction, including the application screen, can create an implicit profiling which drives the retrieval. For example, a particular web page or email address from which or to which a question is entered into the system may implicitly add taxonomy tags to the user's question. This particular kind of implicit profiling is typically transient in that it only modifies the current interaction, but does not change the tagging of the user's customer knowledge",
