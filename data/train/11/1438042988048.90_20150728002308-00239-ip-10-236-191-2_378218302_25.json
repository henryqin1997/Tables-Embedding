            "The BGP Support for 4-Byte ASN feature introduced support for 4-byte autonomous system numbers. Because of increased demand for autonomous system numbers, in January 2009 the IANA will start to allocate 4-byte autonomous system numbers in the range from 65536 to 4294967295. In Cisco IOS Release 12.0(32)SY8, 12.0(33)S3, 12.2(33)SRE, 12.2(33)XNE, and 12.2(33)SXI1, the Cisco implementation of 4-byte autonomous system numbers uses asplain as the default regular expression match and output display format for autonomous system numbers, but you can configure 4-byte autonomous system numbers in both the asplain format and the asdot format as described in RFC 5396. To change the default regular expression match and output display of 4-byte autonomous system numbers to asdot format, use the bgp asnotation dot command. In Cisco IOS Release 12.0(32)S12, and 12.4(24)T, the Cisco implementation of 4-byte autonomous system numbers uses asdot as the only configuration format, regular expression match, and output display, with no asplain support. The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: bgp asnotation dot, bgp confederation identifier, bgp confederation peers, all clear ip bgpcommands that configure an autonomous system number, ip as-path access-list, ip extcommunity-list, match source-protocol, neighbor local-as, neighbor remote-as, neighbor soo, redistribute (IP), router bgp, route-target, set as-path, set extcommunity, set origin, soo, all show ip bgp commands that display an autonomous system number, and show ip extcommunity-list.",
            "BGP Support for the L2VPN address family introduced a BGP-based autodiscovery mechanism to distribute L2VPN endpoint provisioning information. BGP uses a separate L2VPN routing information base (RIB) to store endpoint provisioning information which is updated each time any Layer 2 VFI is configured. When BGP distributes the endpoint provisioning information in an update message to all its BGP neighbors, the endpoint information is used to set up a Pseudowire mesh to support L2VPN-based services. The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: address-family l2vpn, show ip bgp l2vpn.",
            "The Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) Support for CLNS feature provides the ability to scale Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) networks. The multiprotocol extensions of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) add the ability to interconnect separate Open System Interconnection (OSI) routing domains without merging the routing domains, thus providing the capability to build very large OSI networks. The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: clear bgp nsap, clear bgp nsap dampening, clear bgp nsap external, clear bgp nsap flap-statistics, clear bgp nsap peer-group, debug bgp nsap, debug bgp nsap dampening, debug bgp nsap updates, neighbor prefix-list, network (BGP and multiprotocol BGP), redistribute (BGP to ISO ISIS), redistribute (ISO ISIS to BGP), show bgp nsap, show bgp nsap community, show bgp nsap community-list, show bgp nsap dampened-paths, show bgp nsap filter-list, show bgp nsap flap-statistics, show bgp nsap inconsistent-as, show bgp nsap neighbors, show bgp nsap paths, show bgp nsap quote-regexp, show bgp nsap regexp, show bgp nsap summary.",
            "Cisco IOS software supports multiprotocol BGP extensions as defined in RFC 2858, Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 . The extensions introduced in this RFC allow BGP to carry routing information for multiple network layer protocols including CLNS, IPv4, IPv6, and VPNv4. These extensions are backward compatible to enable routers that do not support multiprotocol extensions to communicate with those routers that do support multiprotocol extensions. Multiprotocol BGP carries routing information for multiple network layer protocols and IP multicast routes."

    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6164=BGP is an interdomain routing protocol designed to provide loop-free routing links between organizations. BGP is designed to run over a reliable transport protocol; it uses TCP (Port 179) as the transport protocol because TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. The destination TCP port is assigned 179, and the local port assigned a random port number. Cisco IOSsoftware supports BGP version 4 and it is this version that has been used by Internet Service Providers to help build the Internet. RFC 1771 introduced and discussed a number of new BGP features to allow the protocol to scale for Internet use. RFC 2858 introduced multiprotocol extensions to allow BGP to carry routing information for IP multicast routes and multiple Layer 3 protocol address families including IPv4, IPV6, and CLNS.}",

These extensions are backward-compatible to enable routers that do not support multiprotocol extensions to communicate with those routers that do support multiprotocol extensions. Multiprotocol BGP carries routing information for multiple network-layer protocols and IP multicast routes. BGP carries different sets of routes depending on the protocol. For example, BGP can carry one set of routes for IPv4 unicast routing, one set of routes for IPv4 multicast routing, and one set of routes for MPLS VPNv4 routes., 90065=Cisco IOS software supports multiprotocol BGP extensions as defined in RFC 2858, Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 .
