As a result, the user had to implement alternative strategies on multiple occasions to compensate. However, the user did not find this particularly troublesome and considered the ease and time to accomplish the tasks acceptable., 24148=The NVDA 2009.1 participant attempted all of the tasks in both document sets (twelve tasks), and succeeded in six (50% success rate).

JAWS 9 & 10 The Orneta reader failed to open any of the PDF documents used for the evaluations. It did open a pre\u2013installed PAC Mate user guide from Freedom Scientific available on the PAC Mate. However the efficiency of this interaction was very poor and the PDF reader crashed repeatedly. The best experience was when the participant managed to move through the first page using the keyboards up and down arrows. All other reading and navigation commands failed to work. Based on this experience, no evaluations were conducted and the level of technical capability provided by PAC Mate was deemed to be not sufficient for this Study. The one PAC Mate participant was unable to undertake any of the twelve tasks due to technical problems using the PAC Mate and the Orneta PDF Reader Mobile \u2013 the PDF reader recommended by PAC Mate\u2019s Australian distributor, Quantum Technology.

    "textAfterTable": "User Evaluation tests were conducted with users describing their experience with using their ATs as low, medium or high level skill. Participants of varying skill level were included \u2013 see Table 3: Participant profiles by disability group. There were no significant differences in the success rates (for tasks) between the different experience/skill levels of the participants using JAWS, nor in their acceptance of the time taken to complete the tasks. However, there was an apparent variation across skill levels when users were asked to assign a level of ease to the task they had just completed. For Collection A, the participants with a high level of experience/skill found the tasks very easy overall. In contrast, the participants with moderate and low experience/skill levels acknowledged that there had been a learning curve as they worked their way through the tasks.
