It is to be understood that TABLE 1 is for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be an exhaustive list of amino acid residues which may comprise the peptides and peptide analogues described herein. Other amino acid residues which are useful for making the peptides and peptide analogues described herein can be found, e.g., in Fasman, 1989, CRC Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, CRC Press, Inc., and the references cited therein.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{487440=[0370] Primers: 2603 & 2605, 459005=[0340] cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR from HPV cell line (cervical epidermoid carcinoma, ATCC# CRL-1550 and CRL-1595 for HPV E6 16 and 18, respectively) derived RNA, using random (oligo-nucleotide) primers (Invitrogen Cat.#48190011). DNA fragments corresponding to HPV E6 were generated by standard PCR, using above purified cDNA fragments and specific primers (see Table 5). Primers used were designed to create restriction nuclease recognition sites at the PCR fragment's ends, to allow cloning of those fragments into appropriate expression vectors. Subsequent to PCR, DNA samples were submitted to agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to the expected size were excised. DNA was extracted by Sephaglas Band Prep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Cat#27-9285-01) and digested with appropriate restriction endonuclease. Digested DNA samples were purified once more by gel electrophoresis, according to the same protocol used above. Purified DNA fragments were coprecipitated and ligated with the appropriate linearized vector. After transformation into E. coli, bacterial colonies were screened by colony PCR and restriction digest for the presence and correct orientation of insert. Positive clones were innoculated in liquid culture for large scale DNA purification. The insert and flanking vector sites from the purified plasmid DNA were sequenced to ensure correct sequence of fragments and junctions between the vectors and fusion proteins., 335281=[0180] Monoclonal antibodies to a peptide may be prepared using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Koehler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495-497, the human B-cell hybridoma technique, Kosbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72; Cote et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:2026-2030 and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96 (1985)). In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al., 1984, Nature 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, Nature 314:452-454) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce peptide-specific single chain antibodies., 519266=[0436] Primers: 1928 & 1929, 575475=[0560] Incubate membrane with anti-E6 (6F4) for 30 minutes at 4\ufffd C. (1:5000 dilution, or 1:50 of 1:100 6F4 in PBS/2% BSA). (Need 0.4 ml/well, and for 36 wells need 16 ml a) 1) 320 ul of 1:100 6F4, 15.68 ml PBS/2% BSA., 43875=[0031] Exemplary PDZ domain-containing proteins and PDZ domain sequences are shown in TABLE 2 and EXAMPLE 4. The term \u201cPDZ domain\u201d also encompasses variants (e.g., naturally occurring variants) of the sequences (e.g., polymorphic variants, variants with conservative substitutions, and the like) and domains from alternative species (e.g. mouse, rat). Typically, PDZ domains are substantially identical to those shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/724553, e.g., at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% amino acid residue identity when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. It is appreciated in the art that PDZ domains can be mutated to give amino acid changes that can strengthen or weaken binding and to alter specificity, yet they remain PDZ domains (Schneider et al,., 1998, Nat. Biotech. 17:170-5). Unless otherwise indicated, a reference to a particular PDZ domain (e.g. a MAGI-1 domain 2) is intended to encompass the particular PDZ domain and HPV E6-binding variants thereof. In other words, if a reference is made to a particular PDZ domain, a reference is also made to variants of that PDZ domain that bind oncogenic E6 protein of HPV, as described below. In this respect it is noted that the numbering of PDZ domains in a protein may change. For example, the MAGI-1 domain 2, as referenced herein, may be referenced as MAGI-1 domain 1 in other literature. As such, when a particular PDZ domain of a protein is referenced in this application, this reference should be understood in view of the sequence of that domain, as described herein, particularly in the sequence listing. Table 9, inserted before the claims, shows the relationship between the sequences of the sequence listing and the names and Genbank accession numbers for various domains, where appropriate., 305138=[0126] When antibody-mediated immobilization methods are used, glass and plastic are especially useful substrates. The substrates may be printed with a hydrophobic (e.g., Teflon) mask to form wells. Preprinted glass slides with 3, 10 and 21 wells per 14.5 cm2 slide \u201cworking area\u201d are available from, e.g., SPI Supplies, West Chester, Pa.; also see U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,350). In certain applications, a large format (12.4 cm\ufffd8.3 cm) glass slide is printed in a 96 well format is used; this format facilitates the use of automated liquid handling equipment and utilization of 96 well format plate readers of various types (fluorescent, colorimetric, scintillation). However, higher densities may be used (e.g., more than 10 or 100 polypeptides per cm2). See, e.g., MacBeath et al, 2000, Science 289:1760-63., 539460=[0481] Goat anti-GST mAb stock @ 5 mg/ml, store at 4\ufffd C., (Amersham Pharmacia cat#27-4577-01), dilute 1:1000 in PBS, final concentration 5 ug/ml, 540674=[0494] 4) Prepare PDZ proteins (50:50 mixture of supernatant from TIP-TIP-IgG transfection and 2% BSA/PBS), 379918=[0254] In another embodiment, the two-hybrid system for selecting interacting proteins in yeast (Fields and Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246; Chien et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:9578-9582) can be used to identify molecules that specifically bind to a PDZ domain-containing protein. Furthermore, the identified molecules are further tested for their ability to inhibit transmembrane receptor interactions with a PDZ domain., 488798=[0386] Primers: 2548 & 2549, 490175=[0401] Primers: 2615 & 2616, 491134=[0411] Primers: 2612 & 2613, 400105=[0285] If the peptide is composed entirely of gene-encoded amino acids, or a portion of it is so composed, the peptide or the relevant portion may also be synthesized using conventional recombinant genetic engineering techniques. For recombinant production, a polynucleotide sequence encoding a linear form of the peptide is inserted into an appropriate expression vehicle, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence, or in the case of an RNA viral vector, the necessary elements for replication and translation. The expression vehicle is then transfected into a suitable target cell which will express the peptide. Depending on the expression system used, the expressed peptide is then isolated by procedures well-established in the art. Methods for recombinant protein and peptide production are well known in the art (see, e.g., Maniatis et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y.; and Ausubel et al., 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y.)., 575093=[0558] Incubate membrane with cell lysate, \u02dc300 ul, 3 million cells total, for 30 minutes at room temperature (rock solutions). Also perform 1:10 dilutions (3 million, 300K, 30K, 3K) in PBS/2 % BSA (33.33 ul sample, 300 ul PBS/2% BSA), 25571=[0001] This application: a) claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/409,298, filed Sep. 9, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/450,464, filed Feb. 27, 2003 b) is a CIP of of PCT Application No. US02/24655, filed Aug. 2, 2002, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/309841, filed Aug. 3, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/360061, filed Feb. 25, 2002 c) is a CIP of U.S. Non-Provisional Application Ser. No. 10/080,273, filed Feb. 19, 2002, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/269,523, filed Feb. 16, 2001, and d) is a CIP of U.S. Non-Provisional Application Ser. No. 09/710,059, filed Nov. 10, 2000, all of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 486033=[0355] Primers: 2560 & 2561, 379339=[0253] In a specific embodiment, screening can be carried out by contacting the library members with a PDZ-domain polypeptide immobilized on a solid support (e.g. as described supra in the \u201cG\u201d assay) and harvesting those library members that bind to the protein. Examples of such screening methods, termed \u201cpanning\u201d techniques are described by way of example in Parmley and Smith, 1988, Gene 73:305-318; Fowlkes et al., 1992, BioTechniques 13:422-427; PCT Publication No. WO 94/18318; and in references cited hereinabove., 488251=[0379] Primers: 2606 & 2608, 405669=[0290] In one insect expression system that may be used to produce the peptides of the invention, Autographa californica nuclear polyhidrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express the foreign genes. The virus grows in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. A coding sequence may be cloned into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedron gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example, the polyhedron promoter). Successful insertion of a coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedron gene and production of non-occluded recombinant virus (i.e., virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded for by the polyhedron gene). These recombinant viruses are then used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda cells in which the inserted gene is expressed. (e.g., see Smith et al., 1983, J. Virol. 46:584; Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 4,215,051). Further examples of this expression system may be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, Ausubel et al., eds., Greene Publish. Assoc. & Wiley Interscience., 83303=[0077] As used herein, the terms \u201ctest compound\u201d or \u201ctest agent\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to a candidate agent that may have enhancer/agonist, or inhibitor/antagonist activity, e.g., inhibiting or enhancing an interaction such as PDZ-PL binding. The candidate agents or test compounds may be any of a large variety of compounds, both naturally occurring and synthetic, organic and inorganic, and including polymers (e.g., oligopeptides, polypeptides, oligonucleotides, and polynucleotides), small molecules, antibodies (as broadly defined herein), sugars, fatty acids, nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, analogs of naturally occurring structures (e.g., peptide mimetics, nucleic acid analogs, and the like), and numerous other compounds. In certain embodiment, test agents are prepared from diversity libraries, such as random or combinatorial peptide or non-peptide libraries. Many libraries are known in the art that can be used, e.g., chemically synthesized libraries, recombinant (e.g., phage display libraries), and in vitro translation-based libraries. Examples of chemically synthesized libraries are described in Fodor et al., 1991, Science 251:767-773; Houghten et al., 1991, Nature 354:84-86; Lam et al., 1991, Nature 354:82-84; Medynski, 1994, Bio/Technology 12:709-710; Gallop et al., 1994, J. Medicinal Chemistry 37(9):1233-1251; Ohlmeyer et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10922-10926; Erb et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11422-11426; Houghten et al., 1992, Biotechniques 13:412; Jayawickreme et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:1614-1618; Salmon et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11708-11712; PCT Publication No. WO 93/20242; and Brenner and Lemer, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5381-5383. Examples of phage display libraries are described in Scott and Smith, 1990, Science 249:386-390; Devlin et al., 1990, Science, 249:404-406; Christian, R. B., et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 227:711-718); Lenstra, 1992, J. Immunol. Meth. 152:149-157; Kay et al., 1993, Gene 128:59-65; and PCT Publication No. WO 94/18318 dated Aug. 18, 1994. In vitro translation-based libraries include but are not limited to those described in PCT Publication No. WO 91/05058 dated Apr. 18, 1991; and Mattheakis et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:9022-9026. By way of examples of nonpeptide libraries, a benzodiazepine library (see e.g., Bunin et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:4708-4712) can be adapted for use. Peptoid libraries (Simon et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:9367-9371) can also be used. Another example of a library that can be used, in which the amide functionalities in peptides have been permethylated to generate a chemically transformed combinatorial library, is described by Ostresh et al. (1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11138-11142)., 486492=[0360] Primers: 2560 & 2562, 58661=[0057] The mimetics of the invention can also include compositions that contain a structural mimetic residue, particularly a residue that induces or mimics secondary structures, such as a beta turn, beta sheet, alpha helix structures, gamma turns, and the like. For example, substitution of natural amino acid residues with D-amino acids; N-alpha-methyl amino acids; C-alpha-methyl amino acids; or dehydroamino acids within a peptide can induce or stabilize beta turns, gamma turns, beta sheets or alpha helix conformations. Beta turn mimetic structures have been described, e.g., by Nagai (1985) Tet. Lett. 26:647-650; Feigl (1986) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 108:181-182; Kahn (1988) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 110:1638-1639; Kemp (1988) Tet. Lett. 29:5057-5060; Kahn (1988) J. Molec. Recognition 1:75-79. Beta sheet mimetic structures have been described, e.g., by Smith (1992) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:10672-10674. For example, a type VI beta turn induced by a cis amide surrogate, 1,5-disubstituted tetrazol, is described by Beusen (1995) Biopolymers 36:181-200. Incorporation of achiral omega-amino acid residues to generate polymethylene units as a substitution for amide bonds is described by Banerjee (1996) Biopolymers 39:769-777. Secondary structures of polypeptides can be analyzed by, e.g., high-field 1H NMR or 2D NMR spectroscopy, see, e.g., Higgins (1997) J. Pept. Res. 50:421-435. See also, Hruby (1997) Biopolymers 43:219-266, Balaji, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,895., 521921=[0443] Primers: 1453 & 1454, 406779=[0291] In mammalian host cells, a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, a coding sequence may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing peptide in infected hosts. (e.g., See Logan & Shenk, 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659). Alternatively, the vaccinia 7.5 K promoter may be used, (see, e.g., Mackett et al., 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:7415-7419; Mackett et al., 1984, J. Virol. 49:857-864; Panicali et al., 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:4927-4931)., 301395=[0122] The fusion proteins of the invention may be expressed as secreted proteins (e.g., by including the signal sequence encoding DNA in the fusion gene; see, e.g., Lui et al, 1993, PNAS USA, 90:8957-61) or as nonsecreted proteins., 491471=[0415] Primers: 2612 & 2614, 344653=[0196] (2) PDZ-ligand complexes can be separated from unbound labeled peptide using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, the complexes can be separated using high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC, gel filtration) (Rabinowitz et al., 1998, Immunity 9:699), affinity chromatography(e.g. using glutathione Sepharose beads), and affinity absorption (e.g., by binding to an anti-GST-coated plate as described supra)., 404536=[0289] In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of sequences encoding the peptides of the invention may be driven by any of a number of promoters. For example, viral promoters such as the 35S RNA and 19S RNA promoters of CaMV (Brisson et al., 1984, Nature 310:511-514), or the coat protein promoter of TMV (Takamatsu et al., 1987, EMBO J. 6:307-311) may be used; alternatively, plant promoters such as the small subunit of RUBISCO (Coruzzi et al., 1984, EMBO J. 3:1671-1680; Broglie et al., 1984, Science 224:838-843) or heat shock promoters, e.g., soybean hsp17.5-E or hsp17.3-B (Gurley et al., 1986, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:559-565) may be used. These constructs can be introduced into planleukocytes using Ti plasmids, Ri plasmids, plant virus vectors, direct DNA transformation, microinjection, electroporation, etc. For reviews of such techniques see, e.g., Weissbach & Weissbach, 1988, Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, NY, Section VIII, pp. 421-463; and Grierson & Corey, 1988, Plant Molecular Biology, 2d Ed., Blackie, London, Ch. 7-9., 336499=[0181] Antibody fragments which contain deletions of specific binding sites may be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include but are not limited to F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed (Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281) to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for the peptide of interest., 377951=[0252] Although described supra primarily in terms of identifying interactions between PDZ-domain polypeptides and PL proteins, the assays described supra and other assays can also be used to identify the binding of other molecules (e.g., peptide mimetics, small molecules, and the like) to PDZ domain sequences. For example, using the assays disclosed herein, combinatorial and other libraries of compounds can be screened, e.g., for molecules that specifically bind to PDZ domains. Screening of libraries can be accomplished by any of a variety of commonly known methods. See, e.g., the following references, which disclose screening of peptide libraries: Parmley and Smith, 1989, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 251:215-218; Scott and Smith, 1990, Science 249:386-390; Fowlkes et al., 1992; BioTechniques 13:422-427; Oldenburg et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5393-5397; Yu et al., 1994, Cell 76:933-945; Staudt et al., 1988, Science 241:577-580; Bock et al., 1992, Nature 355:564-566; Tuerk et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6988-6992; Ellington et al., 1992, Nature 355:850-852; U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,815, U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,346, all to Ladner et al.; Rebar and Pabo, 1993, Science 263:671-673; and PCT Publication No. WO 94/18318., 489248=[0391] Primers: 2563 & 2564, 294319=[0113] Certain PDZ domains are bound by the C-terminal residues of PDZ-binding proteins. To identify PL proteins the C-terminal residues of sequences were visually inspected for sequences that one might predict would bind to PDZ-domain containing proteins (see, e.g., Doyle et al., 1996, Cell 85, 1067; Songyang et al., 1997, Science 275, 73), including the additional consensus for PLs identified at Arbor Vita Corporation (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/ 360061). TABLE 3 lists some of these proteins, and provides corresponding C-terminal sequences., 46184=[0033] As used herein, the term \u201cPDZ-domain polypeptide\u201d refers to a polypeptide containing a PDZ domain, such as a fusion protein including a PDZ domain sequence, a naturally occurring PDZ protein, or an isolated PDZ domain peptide. A PDZ-domain polypeptide may therefore be about 60 amino acids or more in length, about 70 amino acids or more in length, about 80 amino acids or more in length, about 90 amino acids or more in length, about 100 amino acids or more in length, about 200 amino acids or more in length, about 300 amino acids or more in length, about 500 amino acids or more in length, about 800 amino acids or more in length, about 1000 amino acids or more in length, usually up to about 2000 amino acids or more in length. PDZ domain peptides are usually no more than about 100 amino acids (e.g. 50-60 amino acids, 60-70 amino acids, 80-90 amino acids, or 90-100 amino acids), and encode a PDZ domain., 337152=[0182] The antibody or antibody fragment specific for the desired peptide can be attached, for example, to agarose, and the antibody-agarose complex is used in immunochromatography to purify peptides of the invention. See, Scopes, 1984, Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., N.Y., Livingstone, 1974, Methods Enzymology: Immunoaffmity Chromatography of Proteins 34:723-731. Antibodies can also be linked to other solid supports for diagnostic applications, or alternatively labeled with a means of detection such an enzyme that can cleave a colorimetric substrate, a fluorophore, a magnetic particle, or other measurable compositions of matter., 306016=[0127] Typically, antibodies are bound to substrates (e.g., glass substrates) by adsorption. Suitable adsorption conditions are well known in the art and include incubation of 0.5-50 ug/ml (e.g., 10 ug/ml) mAb in buffer (e.g., PBS, or 50 to 300 mM Tris, MOPS, HEPES, PIPES, acetate buffers, pHs 6.5 to 8, at 4\ufffd C.) to 37\ufffd C. and from lhr to more than 24 hours., 42876=[0029] As used herein, the term \u201cPDZ domain\u201d refers to protein sequence (i.e., modular protein domain) of less than approximately 90 amino acids, (i.e., about 80-90, about 70-80, about 60-70 or about 50-60 amino acids), characterized by homology to the brain synaptic protein PSD-95, the Drosophila septate junction protein Discs-Large (DLG), and the epithelial tight junction protein ZO1 (ZO1). PDZ domains are also known as Discs-Large homology repeats (\u201cDHRs\u201d) and GLGF repeats. PDZ domains generally appear to maintain a core consensus sequence (Doyle, D. A., 1996, Cell 85: 1067-76)., 303553=[0125] Methods for immobilizing proteins are known, and include covalent and non-covalent methods. One suitable immobilization method is antibody-mediated immobilization. According to this method, an antibody specific for the sequence of an \u201cimmobilization domain\u201d of the PDZ-domain containing protein is itself immobilized on the substrate (e.g., by adsorption). One advantage of this approach is that a single antibody may be adhered to the substrate and used for immobilization of a number of polypeptides (sharing the same immobilization domain). For example, an immobilization domain consisting of poly-histidine (Bush et al, 1991, J. Biol Chem 266:13811-14) can be bound by an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.); an immobilization domain consisting of secreted alkaline phosphatase (\u201cSEAP\u201d) (Berger et al, 1988, Gene 66:1-10) can be bound by anti-SEAP (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.); an immobilization domain consisting of a FLAG epitope can be bound by anti-FLAG. Other ligand-antiligand immobilization methods are also suitable (e.g., an immobilization domain consisting of protein A sequences (Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) can be bound by IgG; and an immobilization domain consisting of streptavidin can be bound by biotin (Harlow & Lane, supra; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). In a preferred embodiment, the immobilization domain is a GST moiety, as described herein., 530183=[0458] Primers: 2753& 2762, 527497=[0454] Primers: 1319& 1320, 373114=[0242] Although most often, the residues shared by the inhibitory peptide with the PL protein are found at the C-terminus of the peptide. However, in some embodiments, the sequence is internal. Similarly, in some cases, the inhibitory peptide comprises residues from a PL sequence that is near, but not at the c-terminus of a PL protein (see, Gee et al., 1998, J Biological Chem. 273:21980-87)., 532870=[0462] Primers: 2584& 2585, 363297=[0221] In one embodiment, the inhibition profile is determined as follows: A plurality (e.g., all known) PDZ domains expressed in a cell (e.g., cervical cells) are expressed as GST-fusion proteins and immobilized without altering their ligand binding properties as described supra. For each PDZ domain, a labeled ligand that binds to this domain with a known affinity is identified. If the set of PDZ domains expressed in lymphocytes is denoted by {P1 . . . Pn}, any given PDZ domain Pi binds a (labeled) ligand Li with affinity Kdi. To determine the inhibition profile for a test agent \u201ccompound X\u201d the \u201cG\u201d assay (supra) can be performed as follows in 96-well plates with rows A-H and columns 1-12. Column 1 is coated with P1 and washed. The corresponding ligand L1 is added to each washed coated well of column 1 at a concentration 0.5 Kd1 with (rows B, D, F, H) or without (rows A, C, E, F) between about 1 and about 1000 uM) of test compound X. Column 2 is coated with P2, and L2 (at a concentration 0.5 Kd2) is added with or without inhibitor X. Additional PDZ domains and ligands are similarly tested., 294934=[0114] Synthetic peptides of defined sequence (e.g., corresponding to the carboxyl-termini of the indicated proteins) can be synthesized by any standard resin-based method (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,108,846; see also, Caruthers et al., 1980, Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser., 215-223; Horn et al., 1980, Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser., 225-232; Roberge, et al., 1995, Science 269:202). The peptides used in the assays described herein were prepared by the FMOC (see, e.g., Guy and Fields, 1997, Meth. Enz. 289:67-83; Wellings and Atherton, 1997, Meth. Enz.289:44-67). In some cases (e.g., for use in the A and G assays of the invention), peptides were labeled with biotin at the amino-terminus by reaction with a four-fold excess of biotin methyl ester in dimethylsulfoxide with a catalytic amount of base. The peptides were cleaved from the resin using a halide containing acid (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid) in the presence of appropriate antioxidants (e.g. ethanedithiol) and excess solvent lyophilized., 398245=[0282] The peptides of the invention or analogues thereof, may be prepared using virtually any art-known technique for the preparation of peptides and peptide analogues. For example, the peptides may be prepared in linear form using conventional solution or solid phase peptide syntheses and cleaved from the resin followed by purification procedures (Creighton, 1983, Protein Structures And Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman and Co., N.Y.). Suitable procedures for synthesizing the peptides described herein are well known in the art. The composition of the synthetic peptides may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing (e.g., the Edman degradation procedure and mass spectroscopy)., 490658=[0406] Primers: 2615 & 2617, 486958=[0365] Primers: 2603 & 2604, 297739=[0118] In various embodiments, fusion proteins are used in the assays and devices of the invention. Methods for constructing and expressing fusion proteins are well known. Fusion proteins generally are described in Ausubel et al., supra, Kroll et al., 1993, DNA Cell. Biol. 12:441, and Imai et al., 1997, Cell 91:521-30. Usually, the fusion protein includes a domain to facilitate immobilization of the protein to a solid substrate (\u201can immobilization domain\u201d). Often, the immobilization domain includes an epitope tag (i.e., a sequence recognized by an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody) such as polyhistidine (Bush et al, 1991, J. Biol Chem 266:13811-14), SEAP (Berger et al, 1988, Gene 66: 1-10), or M1 and M2 flag (see, e.g, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,912; 4,851,341; 4,703,004; 4,782,137). In an embodiment, the immobilization domain is a GST coding region. It will be recognized that, in addition to the PDZ-domain and the particular residues bound by an immobilized antibody, protein A, or otherwise contacted with the surface, the protein (e.g., fusion protein), will contain additional residues. In some embodiments these are residues naturally associated with the PDZ-domain (i.e., in a particular PDZ-protein) but they may include residues of synthetic (e.g., poly(alanine)) or heterologous origin (e.g., spacers of, e.g., between 10 and 300 residues)., 538890=[0478] Nunc Polysorp 96 well Immuno-plate (Nunc cat#62409-005) (Maxisorp plates have been shown to have higher background signal), 485582=[0350] Primers: 2542 & 2543, 489708=[0396] Primers: 2563 & 2565, 33624=[0009] The following publications are of interest: Munger (2002) Front.

Further, it is reported that a limited number of ligand amino acids directly contact the PDZ domain (generally less than eight) (Kozlov et al., 2000, Biochemistry 39, 2572; Doyle et al., 1996, Cell 85, 1067) and that peptides as short as the C-terminal three amino acids often retain similar binding properties to longer (>15) amino acids peptides (Yanagisawa et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8539)., 80815=[0074] As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d in the context of comparing amino acid sequences, means that the sequences have at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% amino acid residue identity when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. An algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the FASTA algorithm, which is described in Pearson, W. R. & Lipman, D. J., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85: 2444. See also W. R. Pearson, 1996, Methods Enzymol. 266: 227-258. Preferred parameters used in a FASTA alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are optimized, BL50 Matrix 15: \u22125, k-tuple=2; joining penalty=40, optimization=28; gap penalty -12, gap length penalty=\u22122; and width=16.}",
