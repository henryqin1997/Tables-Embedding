    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{209945=Nine groups of eggs were inoculated at day 18 of incubation. Seven of the groups were inoculated with one of seven different M. gallisepticum strain F-MGA complexes. One group was inoculated with the bacterium only and another group was inoculated with a 1:4 dilution of FMS in PBS., 161407=The data in Examples 10-12 show initial increases leading to gradual decreases in the number of CFUs as antiserum to P. multocida became more dilute. The combined data suggest that both strains of P. multocida may actually use the serum as a growth medium. As the serum concentration decreases so does the growth of P. multocida. Some of the results suggest that P. multocida dies off when diluted in PBS and sits at room temperature for between one and four hours. This may account for the fewer than expected CFUs observed from the 1:8192 dilutions through 1:32768 dilutions. As the serum becomes less concentrated, the PBS concentration increases. There was not a large difference, though, in the stock colony counts in the present example, before and after a one hour waiting period, yet the low counts in the higher dilutions still existed., 145426=The data in Table 10 shows the same decreasing colony count with increasing antiserum dilution as was seen in the previous experiment, slightly more pronounced. There appears to be more CFUs/ml than expected in dilution mixtures 1:16 through 1:4096. Similar findings were also presented in Table 7. The colony counts found in Table 9 suggest the CFUs die off in PBS over time in the absence of serum. This may account for the lower than expected colony counts in dilutions 1:8192 through 1:32768 in both studies. The antiserum may be demonstrating some growth inhibiting capabilities at the higher dilutions while exhibiting growth enhancement effects in the least dilute mixtures. The next experiment was conducted to investigate possible causes of these observations., 108553=This experiment was designed to determine if different numbers of colony forming units (CFUs) of P. multocida strains Cu and M9 affect the hatchability of SPF eggs following in ovo inoculation at day 18 of incubation. Each strain of P. multocida was diluted in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to produce three dilutions: 1000 CFUs per 0.1 ml; 100 CFUs per 0.1 ml; and 10 CFUs per 0.1 ml. At day 18 of incubation, 0.1 mls of each dilution for each strain was inoculated into fourteen SPF eggs. Thirteen eggs were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a mixture of Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI), PBS, and Glycerol (vehicle control) and thirteen eggs received no inoculation., 116881=Each inoculated egg was inoculated with 0.1 ml of a culture/PBS mixture containing the appropriate number of CFUs. The dilutions containing 1\ufffd10(2) CFUs/ml were titered for each strain and the titers differed somewhat from the target numbers. Group 4 actually contained 10.5 CFUs/egg, Group 3 contained 105 CFUs/egg, and Group 2 contained 1050 CFUs/egg. Group 7 contained 12.5 CFUs/egg, Group 6 contained 125 CFUs/egg, and Group 5 contained 1250 CFUs/egg. Group 1 eggs were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a BHI/PBS/Glycerol mixture., 210267=A vial of M. gallisepticum strain F stock was thawed and diluted 1:5 and 1:10 in 10% FMS and 90% PBS diluent. Appropriate amounts of these dilutions were used to create the bacterium-MGA complexes. Each egg received a 0.1 ml injection containing the same number of M. gallisepticum CFUs with the appropriate amount of antiserum for a particular group, except for Group 1. The eggs in Group 1 received 0.1 ml of the FMS/PBS diluent. The complexes were allowed to react together for 10 minutes before inoculation. The eggs were then incubated until hatch., 210867=The 1:10 dilution of the bacterial stock was titered by making 3 serial dilution series through 10(\u22129) and plating the 10(\u22126) dilutions of two dilution series TSA and incubating at 37\ufffd C. All tubes in all three serial dilution series showed M. gallisepticum growth. The titer was 8\ufffd10(8) CFUs/ml. Hatchability results are provided in Table 17., 146295=The effects of P. multocida antiserum and negative serum (chicken serum containing no P. multocida antibodies) on the growth of the M9 strain of P. multocida was compared in vitro. Serum dilutions and P. multocida culture dilutions were prepared as in Example 11. One ml of culture containing 139 CFUs per ml (Table 6) was mixed with one ml of dilute serum. Three dilutions (1:16, 1:512, and 1:32768) of negative serum were prepared and mixed with the appropriate amount of bacterial culture. The bacterial culture/serum dilution mixtures reacted together for one hour at room temperature., 180530=This experiment investigated the growth of a given amount of M. gallisepticum strain F over time after the organism was mixed with different amounts of MGA. A sample of MGA was initially diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Then, the antiserum was further diluted by making 10 serial 1:2 dilutions by adding 0.5 ml of the previous dilution to 0.5 ml of PBS (dilutions 1:20 through 1:10240). One vial of M. gallisepticum F stock culture was thawed at room temperature and diluted 1:100. This 10(\u22122) stock solution contained 5.8\ufffd10(6) CFUs/ml. Bacterium-antibody complexes were prepared by adding 0.4 ml of the 5.8\ufffd10(6) stock solution to 0.4 ml of each of the 11 MGA dilutions. These complexes were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 minutes. Treatment 12 consisted of 0.4 ml PBS added to 0.4 ml of the same bacterial stock solution., 219470=A vial of M. gallisepticum strain F stock was thawed at room temperature and diluted 1:5 (stock 2). The titration of stock 2 showed that it contained 7\ufffd10(7) CFUs/ml. Stock 2 was then divided into 0.9 ml aliquots and combined with 0,5,10,20 or 40 \u03bcl of MGA. Once mixed, the bacterium-MGA formulations were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. These bacterium-MGA complexes were administered to eggs of each group in 0.1 ml doses. Group 1 eggs received inoculations containing only bacteria. Each group of 16 eggs was then placed in separate small hatcher units until day of hatch. The MGA-M. gallisepticum formulations tested CFUs are shown in Table 18., 29635=This application is a divisional of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/938,740, filed Sep. 26, 1997 (issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,408 B2), which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/027,084 filed Sep. 30, 1996, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties., 231763=The eggs receiving the bacterium without antiserum (Group 1) and the two lower amounts of MGA plus M. gallisepticum (Groups 2 and 3) had the lowest percent hatches and no normal birds hatched. The vehicle control group (Group 6) experienced a delayed hatch as well as a poorer hatch than expected. This probably was caused by the fact that the eggs were incubated in a large hatcher intended for the incubation of 2000 eggs. Despite this hatch problem, 10 chicks were healthy and they tested negative for M gallisepticum isolation and the two serum antibody tests. Groups 4 and 5 experienced percent hatches and percent normal hatches that showed great improvement over those of Groups 1, 2 and 3. The eggs in these two groups received higher levels of MGA and Group 5 (3.5\ufffd10(6)CFU+40 \u03bcl MGA) experienced the best hatch of all the groups. All birds remaining alive at the time of serum collection were healthy. The antibody response to M. gallisepticum measured by the SPA test and ELISA indicate that the M. gallisepticum strain F complex vaccines were efficacious for birds in Groups 3, 4 and 5.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Examples 14-18 were designed to test the usefulness of a bacteria:antibody vaccine complex. The data support the concept that addition of specific antiserum (specific for the vaccine bacteria) to live bacteria in the appropriate ratio provides protection to the chick embryo by decreasing or delaying the pathogenic effects of the bacterium while at the same time allowing an efficacious immune response to develop in the hatchlings, as evidenced by an active humoral immune response. It is interesting to note that one bird in Group 5 was negative for M. gallisepticum reisolation at hatch, the SPA test, and ELISA. All the other birds that were sampled from Groups 3,4 and 5 tested positive in each case. It appears that one bird in Group 5 never became infected. The eggs receiving the bacterium without antiserum (Group 1) and the two lower amounts of MGA plus M. gallisepticum (Groups 2 and 3) had the lowest percent hatches and no normal birds hatched. The vehicle control group (Group 6) experienced a delayed hatch as well as a poorer hatch than expected. This probably was caused by the fact that the eggs were incubated in a large hatcher intended for the incubation of 2000 eggs.
