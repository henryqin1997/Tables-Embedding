It utilises a DAC chip from the ESS Technology whose DAC chips is highly regarded. The ES9023 chip is their simplest DAC chip which keeps many of the features of their bigger brothers at a minimal cost. You pay for the sound, not the enclosure! We use a small lightweight simple box, so you don't have to pay extra for a bigger and more expensive enclosure. The power supply is very important for the sound quality. We use a high end ultra low noise regulator (LT1763).\u00a0 New version uses SA9023 USB chip which also accepts 88.khz. We also still have TE7022 version, look at our other auctions.",
