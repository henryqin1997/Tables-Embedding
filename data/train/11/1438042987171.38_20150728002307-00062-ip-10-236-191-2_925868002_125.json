            "There is always something fun to do on campus. Usually campus fairs or even inflatables.",
            "Right now there are many renovations so that means less choices for now. Most people don't realize there are a few food places at the top of the hill, they just close early.",
            "If I could recommend a place to stay it would be anything in the middle of campus or in the valley. DO NOT LIVE IN PFT.",
            "This may not be the easiest university but most professors are great at what they do and make learning entertaining. Most students actually have recent post on Rate My Professor and some I would say are very accurate.",
            "Take university experience your first semester! This class literally prepares you for the college experience. Also, make sure you attend MASTER PLAN the week before classes! When scheduling classes make sure you know what building the class is in too because you don't want a class way down the hill and have another class all the way up the hill in 15 minutes.",
            "Western is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen! Needs more diversity when it comes to the student and faculty. Some say it is impossible to graduate,but I beg to differ."

However there is this thing where the desk clerk has to see your ID when you enter the building because of a girl being murdered back in 2006. The windows do not open all the way because of a guy was on mushrooms and jumped out of his window from the 20th (or so) floor. It's a pain sometimes but it's also easy to get used to and forget all about it. The upperclassmen dorms are the best., 555545=I will attend dorm life in the Fall 2013., 46914=Don't cruise through General Ed. classes. The more you know of English, History, Geography, Psychology, Sociology, and other cultures, the more well-rounded you will be in your chosen field of work. The most important class you can take is English: being able to express yourself and write with confidence and good grammar., 585829=GO TO STUDENT ACTIVITIES. WKU has a rich history in sports. Big Red, WKU's mascot, has found his way into college bowl games in football, March Madness in basketball, and conference championships in Softball, Baseball, Swimming, Track, and Cross Country. If it wasn't enough that WKU keeps winning championships, the student body continues to support them every step of the way. Every game, the entire student body will pour into the arena, dressed in red, singing the Western fight song. You shouldn't ever have to leave campus to find something fun. Western's campus is always buzzing with opportunity., 722316=Get involved! After attending the ATP Freshmen Orientation there in late March, I realized there are so many activities, especially in the realm of intermural sports. Even if you're not on a varsity team of some kind, you can still get involved in the sport or program you love by starting a club or joining one that already exists., 763703=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 161986=The food is alright. This fall 2012 we are supposed to get a panda express and Starbucks! We also have a subway and down the road there is McDonald's, Taco-bell, sonic and things in that area., 571341=Campus life is really awesome here at the hill. We have football games that all the students get into for free. Just this past year, I got to see Phillip Phillips in concert and I get to see Andy Grammar in concert in a few weeks. This campus is always bouncing with oppurtunities and there is always something to do., 474977=This university has brought a world of new exploration to mine. I'm living in Madrid after the abroad program I took in 2010 and I'm teaching English as well as a wedding photographer., 68225=I graduated in 1990 with an associate degree of science, nursing. The time I have had to reflect on my education at western was it is one of the best colleges in Kentucky. I was very fortunate to have been a student at Western.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students American, international, focused, social, adventurous, ambitious....there's really something for everyone on campus. Tips for prospective students Visit WKU and look into the college for yourself, and this goes for any university you think you are interested in. Think about what interests you and see how well fits into any school's program. Once you step foot onto the campus, look into different clubs and organizations that pique your curiosity. Through those groups you will meet some of the best friends you will ever have, and this is important when starting this next chapter of your life. Bang for the buck Every penny is worth the education here. You can be sure that not only will you graduate feeling more confident about the knowledge you gained, but you will come away with life-altering experiences that will allow you to grow as an individual. WKU strongly supports study abroad and is always encouraging students to choose from hundreds of programs that will allow them to travel the world, while they obtain a few credit hours. There is even thousands of dollars in scholarship money available to help in several of these opportunities. Am enjoying being here WKU has a wide range",
