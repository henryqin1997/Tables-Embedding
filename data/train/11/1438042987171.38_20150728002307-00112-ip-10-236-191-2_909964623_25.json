Great for these types of students Students who love to have fun as well as inrich themselves with further education. Bang for the buck I believe NJCU is a school that makes the students' tuition and fees worth while. There is also a very convenient Bank of America ATM machine located right on the campus. What to do for fun Make friends. Meet with them in the student union or Gothic lounge. There is always tons to do. Attend all of the sports games and events such as movie or game night, held by the fraternities and sororities. Most importantly, be sure to spend time in the Library.
