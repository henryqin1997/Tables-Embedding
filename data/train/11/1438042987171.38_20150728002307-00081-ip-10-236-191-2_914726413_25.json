            "The school is not in the best location in the entire world, but they have security guards at the school 24/7 and the campus is completely gated off. I never felt unsafe at school or in the dorms.",
            "None",
            "They have them, I was never extremely involved in them though.",
            "Hardworking, selfdriven, creative, outgoing",
            "I feel like I pay too much, but in the end I feel like I am getting what I paid for.",
            "Well it's LA so there is a lot to do. If you want good grades you won't go out much though. The campus isn't far from the beach and you're close enough to the city where you can go out to eat with people or go to the club. You will need a car if you want to do much. Don't be scared to go explore the city, there is so much to see in California.",
            "School's cafeteria is good but they don't have much of a selection and the food is very expensive. There are a few restaurants and fast food places a few minutes from the school but you will get sick of eating at those after a few months.",
            "The dorms are only for first year students and are basically just part of an apartment complex. They are extremely nice apartments, but for the price they better be.",
            "If you can manage time well you will be fine. If you want to go out and party every weekend and not do any homework I would choose another school.",
            "Save your money early or you will be graduating with a lot of student loans. Know how to manage your time correctly so you can finish all the projects. It's art school but the homework and in class work is far from easy. It's always challenging, but always fun if you really love art or design.",
            "If you aren't determined and hard working you will have a hard time passing your classes. The tuition is crazy and there isn't much help out there unless you went to high school in California. But overall Otis gets students prepared to get a job and the teachers and staff are all a lot of fun and love what they do."

The dorms look like a resort with furnished kitchens and living room and bedrooms. There is a pool and jacuzzi and bbq grills to use, also a fire pit for bonfires. There is even a gym for dorm residents. The dorms are not in the campus but a 5 min walk away. The school is working on dorm on campus; they will be built by 2016}",

(You'll have a whole year to decide.) I think this school is also great for Toy Design, Fashion Design, and Digital Media majors. The other majors are good as well, but this school is particularly good for the aforementioned majors (or so I've heard.) Tips for prospective students * Try to get into the Honors Program. It's difficult, but quite satisfying. * It's nice to have a car, especially if you're in housing and you want to explore the city.",
