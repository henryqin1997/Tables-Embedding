    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{81890=The hydroisomerization is operated at hydrogen partial pressures (reactor inlet) of at least 1000 psig (about 7000 KPa), usually 1000 to 3000 psig (7000 to 20785 kPa) and in most cases 1500-2500 psig (1435 to 17340 kPa). Hydrogen circulation rates are usually in the range of about 500 to 5000 SCF/Bbl (about 90 to 900 n.l.l.\u22121). Since some saturation of aromatic components present in the original feed takes place in the presence of the noble metal hydrogenation component on the catalyst, hydrogen is consumed in the hydroisomerization even though the desired isomerization reactions are in hydrogen balance; for this reason, hydrogen circulation rates may need to be adjusted in accordance with the aromatic content of the feed and also with the temperature used in the hydroisomerization since higher temperatures will be associated with a higher level of cracking and, consequently, with a higher level of olefin production, some of which will be in the lube boiling range so that product stability will need to be assured by saturation. Hydrogen circulation rates of at least 1000 SCF/Bbl (about 180 n.l.l.\u22121) will normally provide sufficient hydrogen to compensate for the expected hydrogen consumption as well as to ensure a low rate of catalyst aging., 95277=This Example illustrates a wax hydroisomerization process using a low acidity zeolite beta hydroisomerization catalyst. The process was operated under both low (400 psig/2860 kPa) and high (1750 psig/12170 kPa) conditions., 30103=The process is operated under high pressure, typically with a hydrogen partial pressure of at least 1000 psig (about 7000 kPa abs), usually from about 1500 to 2500 psig (about 1435 to 17340 kPa abs). The yield benefits associated with the use of the low acidity hydroisomerization catalysts at these high hydrogen pressures are unexpected since the use of high hydrogen pressures with catalysts of higher acidity has been shown to result in lower isomerization selectivity., 93705=An as-synthesized boron-containing zeolite beta of Example 1 was mulled and extruded with silica in a zeolite:silica weight ratio of 65:35, dried and calcined at 900\ufffd F. (480\ufffd C.) for 3 hours in nitrogen, followed by 1000\ufffd F. (540\ufffd C.) in air for three hours. The resulting extrudate was exchanged with 1N ammonium nitrate solution at room temperature for 1 hour after which the exchanged catalyst was calcined in air at 1000\ufffd F. (540\ufffd C.) for 3 hours, followed by 24 hours in 100 percent steam at 1025\ufffd F. (550\ufffd C.). The steamed extrudate was found to contain 0.48 weight percent boron (as B2O3), 365 ppm sodium and 1920 ppm Al2O3. The steamed catalyst was then exchanged for 4 hours at room temperature with 1N platinum tetraammine chloride solution with a final calcination at 660\ufffd F. (350\ufffd C.) for three hours. The finished catalyst contained 0.87 weight percent platinum and had an alpha value of 4., 73681=Although a variety of molecular sieves may be used, a preferred hydroisomerization catalyst for the second stage employs zeolite beta as a support since this zeolite has been shown to possess outstanding activity for paraffin isomerization in the presence of aromatics, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,220. The low acidity forms of zeolite beta may be obtained by synthesis of a highly siliceous form of the zeolite e.g with a silica-alumina ratio above about 50:1 or, more readily, by steaming zeolites of lower silica-alumina ratio to the requisite acidity level. Another method is by replacement of a portion of the framework aluminum of the zeolite with another trivalent element such as boron which results in a lower intrinsic level of acid activity in the zeolite. The preferred zeolites of this type are those which contain framework boron and normally, at least 0.1 weight percent, preferably at least 0.5 weight percent, of framework boron is preferred in the zeolite. In zeolites of this type, the framework consists principally of silicon tetrahedrally coordinated and interconnected with oxygen bridges. The minor amount of an element (alumina in the case of alumino-silicate zeolite beta) is also coordinated and forms part of the framework. The zeolite also contains material in the pores of the structure although these do not form part of the framework constituting the characteristic structure of the zeolite. The term \u201cframework\u201d boron is used here to distinguish between material in the framework of the zeolite which is evidenced by contributing ion exchange capacity to the zeolite, from material which is present in the pores and which has no effect on the total ion exchange capacity of the zeolite., 77692=The zeolite will be composited with a matrix material to form the finished catalyst and for this purpose conventional non-acidic matrix materials such as alumina, silica-alumina and silica are suitable with preference given to silica as a non-acidic binder, although non-acidic aluminas such as alpha boehmite (alpha alumina monohydrate) may also be used, provided that they do not confer any substantial degree of acidic activity on the matrixed catalyst. The use of silica as a binder is preferred since alumina, even if non-acidic in character, may tend to react with the zeolite under hydrothermal reaction conditions to enhance its acidity. The zeolite is usually composited with the matrix in amounts from 80:20 to 20:80 by weight, typically from 80:20 to 50:50 zeolite:matrix. Compositing may be done by conventional means including mulling the materials together followed by extrusion of pelletizing into the desired finished catalyst particles. A preferred method for extruding the zeolite with silica as a binder is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,815. If the catalyst is to be steamed in order to achieve the desired low acidity, it is performed after the catalyst has been formulated with the binder, as is conventional., 76059=In the preferred low acidity zeolite beta catalysts, the zeolite should contain at least 0.1 weight percent framework boron, preferably at least 0.5 weight percent boron. Normally, the maximum amount of boron will be about 5 weight percent of the zeolite and in most cases not more than 2 weight percent of the zeolite. The framework will normally include some alumina and the silica:alumina ratio will usually be at least 30:1, in the as-synthesized conditions of the zeolite. A preferred zeolite beta catalyst is made by steaming an initial boron-containing zeolite containing at least 1 weight percent boron (as B2O3) to result in an ultimate alpha value no greater than about 10 and preferably no greater than 5., 15775=This application is a continuation in part application of Ser. No. 09/115,255, filed Jul. 13, 1998 now abandoned., 33571=Suitable pre-treatment steps for preparing feeds for the hydroisomerization are those which remove the aromatics and other low VI components from the initial feed. Solvent extraction using a solvent such as furural, phenol or N,N-dimethylformamide is suitable for this purpose, as is hydrotreatment, especially at high hydrogen pressures which are effective for aromatics saturation e.g. 1500 psig (about 10,445 kPa) or higher. Hydrotreatment may be preferred over solvent extraction in view of the losses which take place during the extraction process.}",
