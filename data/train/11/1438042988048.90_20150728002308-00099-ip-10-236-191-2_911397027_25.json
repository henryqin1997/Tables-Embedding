However there are two apartment complexes, Commodore Arms Apartments and College Park Townhouses, that are located directly across the street from the college. They offer a variety of features, including Internet, washer and dryer, patios, air conditioning, and much more. They also offer a $1000 dollar scholarship for LCCC! They are close to shopping centers and major highways, making them ideal spots to live if you do not or cannot live at home., 17569=For a community college that costs about 1500 a semester it's decent. Especially if you are looking for a place to get your foot in the door. I'm sure plenty of other students had wonderful experiences, I ,unfortunately, did not., 51477=It is rather affordable to go to this school, about 1500 a semester. Plus books, but if you work and live at home it is a nice price. They have a few scholarships and FAFSA normally provides a decent amount of money, i honestly got paid to go to school at one point. I had extra financial aid and got a check for about 500 dollars.}",

Am enjoying being here I don't like being there for my own personal reasons, but it's a different experience for everyone. Am learning a lot I think most of the professors are extremely intelligent and know what they are talking about. I've liked all of my professors so far and I've taken a lot of classes. Even your teachers online have a number of helpful tools to get you through the course.
