In addition, there has been a considerable decline in the multiyear ice pack in this region (Eicken et al. 2006). To help understand these anomalies, this data set contains information on recurring spring leads and landfast ice extent in this area. This data set maps and documents the spatial and temporal distribution of recurring leads and landfast ice off the coast of northern Alaska in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (Eicken et al. 2006). The leads data span from 1993 through 2004 and are based on visible and infrared Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data onboard the NOAA 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 satellites. The landfast ice extent data extend from 1996 through 2004 and are based on RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The data are available in a number of formats including ArcGIS geodatabases (the geodatabases are held in Microsoft Access files (.mdb)), shapefiles (.shp), ArcGIS grids (.adf), ArcGIS grids in ArcInfo interchange format (.e00), and GeoTIFFs (.tif). Statistics are also provided in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls) and metadata in several formats including XML (.xml), SGML (.sgml), HTML (.html), and ASCII text (.txt).

Both visible and infrared AVHRR images were used; visible images were used when sunlight was available and infrared (IR) images were used during dark months in Alaska.

Each scene covers more than one subregion. If clouds were misidentified as leads or if an AVHRR image was mostly cloud covered over the study region, the images were either corrected by removing cloud covered sectors from the image or eliminated, meaning some months may not contain data for a specific year due to the cloud coverage. This resulted in a total of 385 AVHRR images in this data set. Figures 18 and 19 show the number of AVHRR images by region and month. Since most AVHRR scenes cover more than one subregion, Figure 18 illustrates that data coverage is slightly better in the middle of the study area. Figure 19 shows that the months were consistently sampled and that there are fewer cloud-free scenes during the transition months of December and June. \u00a0, 50726=There are four landfast metadata templates that reside in the landfast1996-2004/metadata_templates directory with the following names:, 101364=Mahoney, A., H.

POAC '05 Proceedings Volume 3, Potsdam, NY, June 26-30, 2005., 7119=The Arctic sea-ice cover has undergone significant changes in the past two decades. These changes include a reduction in summer ice extent (with four consecutive record minima attained between 2001 and 2005) as well as substantial thinning of the ice pack. The western Arctic, i.e., the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, has seen the largest anomalies in summer ice extent, as well as a substantial reduction in the amount of multiyear ice over the Beaufort and Chukchi shelves. The present project was aimed at mapping and documenting changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of spring lead systems and landfast ice extent off the coast of northern Alaska. In addition to providing baseline data against which to evaluate further changes, the work also examined present-day conditions in relation to earlier studies conducted in the 1970s as part of the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Project and discussed the role of different forcing mechanisms in controlling spatial and temporal patterns of variability in lead distribution and landfast ice extent (Eicken et al. 2006)., 100692=Kwok, R. and G.

Boulder, CO : National Snow and Ice Data Center. Digital media. http://nsidc.org/data/g01111.html., 86253=The landfast ice extent was determined by the distance between land (the Alaskan coast) and the SLIE that is derived from RADARSAT-1 SAR data from 1996 through 2004. Off the northern coast of Alaska, landfast ice extent starts advancing between October and November and then breaks up by July. The landfast ice extent exists for a majority of the year, and then the coastal area becomes ice-free for a couple of months (August and September). For the landfast ice extent region in this study, there are approximately 1,000 SAR scenes that were originally analyzed. Because one SAR scene does not cover the entire study area, three or four scenes were combined or mosaiced to cover the entire landfast ice extent study area (subregions 2-11). Refer to Figure 1. However, due to orbital constraints of the RADARSAT-1 satellite, the scenes were not acquired at the same time, each mosaic typically spans two to three days. Complete mosaics were produced approximately every 10 days. Sets of three consecutive RADARSAT-1 SAR mosaics, spanning a period of approximately 20 days, were then used to identify landfast ice extent. Figure 15 shows an example of a RADARSAT-1 SAR mosaic comprised of five individual SAR scenes. \u00a0, 106240=June 2009, 84423=The instrument used to acquire the landfast ice extent images was the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard RADARSAT-1.
