It was formally blessed in 2009 and is a new and beautiful part of campus. The famous artist, Fr. Marko Rupnik and his team created two breathtaking mosaics made with hundreds of thousands of tiles. His team comes from all over the world, places like Italy and Romania, to put together these masterpieces., 158267=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 148987=I am planning on attending Sacred Heart in the fall of 2014 so I have not had any classes, but as an exercise science/pre-physical therapy major I know i will have to buckle down and devote a lot of time to my studies.

Tips for prospective students don't let the price tag scare you. you will get a great education. sacred heart is a small school. you will definitely have a better chance to graduate. everyone is here to help you graduate. there plenty of scholarships and financial aid. Bang for the buck a little expensive, but your getting a high education. small classes make it so much easier. you get to know your staff. you are not a number, you get to know everyone. Am enjoying being here I enjoy the small school environment, students and staff included. Customer service is wonderful. Academic Rigor the projects and research papers keep me busy.",
