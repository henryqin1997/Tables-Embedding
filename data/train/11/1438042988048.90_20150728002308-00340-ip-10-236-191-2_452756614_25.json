The X-ray CT apparatus includes device for setting a plurality of X-ray tube voltages and sets imaging conditions used in the photography using the respective X-ray tube voltages in such a manner that respective image noise of tomographic images photographed at the X-ray tube voltages become substantially identical to one another. The setting of the imaging conditions is the setting of X-ray tube currents. The X-ray tube currents are set based on geometrical characteristic amounts of the subject determined from each scout image in such a manner that the respective image noise of the tomographic images photographed at the plurality of X-ray tube voltages become substantially identical to one another. 20090122952 Published Description Patent application number Kosuke Sasaki, Tokyo JP 12-30-2010 COMPOSITION FOR COATING AGENT - To provide a composition for a coating agent capable of forming a coating film excellent in the weather resistance, having high uniformity and having favorable gloss on the surface. 20100331482 Published Description Patent application number Koichi Sasaki, Tokyo JP 12-23-2010 PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HIGH-PURITY CHLOROPHOSPHITE - There is provided a process capable of preventing the adhesion",
