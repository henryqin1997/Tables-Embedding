However, after the recent discovery of another, previously unknown card (a second Newsy Lalonde), it is now known to comprise 37 different specimens. This discovery has been discussed on numerous websites and forums and various theories have been given for its existence. The 2007\u00a0unearthing of the original lithographic stone used to print the C56 series has provided additional confirmation that 37 cards were originally produced by Imperial Tobacco. This final card is numbered with \"37\" in the top left corner instead of \"36,\" but has the same pose of \u00c9douard \"Newsy\" Lalonde. The mystery surrounding card #37 remains, however, since speculation is that the card is similar to the T206 Honus Wagner in that it may have been pulled from production early with very few examples ever making it into cigarette packs., 65724=Among the three known examples of this card, there are two variations. Two cards, including this one, possess commas after the team names on back, while the other does not. For more information about the 1910-11 C56 #37 Newsy Lalonde, visit www.c55proofs.com.}",
