            "ACTIVATION OF SODIUM POTASSIUM ATPASE - Activation sites on the alpha subunit of sodium potassium ATPase have been discovered. It has also been discovered that certain antibodies that bind to the alpha subunit of sodium potassium ATPase dramatically increase enzyme activity. There has never before been a report of precise activation sites or drug interaction sites for sodium potassium ATPase. Certain methods have also been discovered for treating or preventing diseases associated with low sodium potassium ATPase activity by administering antibodies, antibody fragments and small molecules that bind to the activation sites on the alpha subunit of sodium potassium ATPase.",

The resulting cell has stable performance in a wide temperature range between \u221240\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. The resulting cell operates across this wide temperature range with a commercially acceptable capacity retention, power loss characteristics, and safety characteristics across this temperature range. 05-27-2010 20120009485 ELECTROLYTES IN SUPPORT OF 5V LI ION CHEMISTRY - This invention described the preparation of a series of compounds that can be used as co-solvents, solutes or additives in non-aqueous electrolytes and their test results in various electrochemical devices. The inclusion of these novel compounds in electrolyte systems can enable rechargeable chemistries at high voltages that are otherwise impossible with state-of-the-art electrolyte technologies. These compounds are so chosen because of their beneficial effect on the interphasial chemistries formed at high potentials, such as 5.0 V class cathodes for new Li ion chemistries. The potential application of these compounds goes",
