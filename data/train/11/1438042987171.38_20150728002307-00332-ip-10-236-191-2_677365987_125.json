That means his contract would pay him about $5M per win.\u00a0 It would also add a win to the Yankees\u2019s in 2014 vs. his 3 win projection., 403634=Supposedly, Carlos Beltran has always wanted to be a Yankee.\u00a0 The Yankees could have signed him after the 2004 season but chose to go with trading for Randy Johnson instead.\u00a0 Over the last nine years Beltran has provided his teams with 35.1 WAR.\u00a0 Nine years too late, the Yankees have finally brought Beltran in., 1801362=2013 Projections - David Robertson, 2532697=His average and OBP were right around his projections and he picked up a bit of value with better than expected base stealing, but his power was down pretty significantly, as he hit 6 fewer doubles and 6 fewer homers than he projected to on a pro-rated basis.\u00a0 Rodriguez was hitting .276/.358/.449 through July 24 when he got hit on the hand by a Felix Hernandez pitch that cost him about six weeks and hit .261/.341/.369 after his return.\u00a0 As you are likely aware of, he had a dreadful postseason including getting pinch-hit for although it was eventually revealed that his hip had been bothering him for quite a while and may have had something to do with his disappointing late season performance., 783379=I still haven\u2019t done defensive projections for 2014 but eyeballing it I\u2019m guessing Phillips would project as 2-4 runs better defensively., 538977=After carrying the Yankee rotation for most of the season, Hiroki Kuroda struggled over the last six weeks.\u00a0 After August 12 his ERA stood at 2.33.\u00a0 From August 17 on it was 6.56., 1211422=So outfield is the biggest need and while getting Curtis Granderson could conceivably help one of those spots it\u2019s not helping both.\u00a0 And outfield is going to be an issue in 2014 as well with Granderson likely gone and a free outfield group that looks like this., 2115617=There\u2019s a new floormat in the AL West, and it\u2019s the Houston Astros.\u00a0 Can they lose 100+ games for the third year in a row?\u00a0 The projections think they can.\u00a0 Houston projects to be so bad that they have essentially balanced out the league difference between the AL and NL.\u00a0 Last year, the AL went 1150-1118 thanks to interleague play.\u00a0 If you add Houston\u2019s 55-107 to that you get a record of 1205-1225.\u00a0 Los Anaheim looks like the favorite here and project to win more games than any other team in baseball, with Texas a strong second.\u00a0 The Angels do have some concerns in their rotation, which could open the door for the Rangers.\u00a0 Oakland projects to fall back a bit from last year, but still should be in contention.\u00a0 Seattle still doesn\u2019t look particularly good, although they should score some more runs this year, which is something., 1252012=As Jeff Sullivan wrote about here, Brett Gardner\u2019s been a different player in 2013 than he\u2019d been prior to this season.\u00a0 Sullivan goes through some of Gardner\u2019s plate discipline stats which show that he\u2019s hitting more fly balls and being more aggressive.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a comparison of some of his other stats., 2658458=On the other hand, Stewart has had very good DRS numbers over the last two years.\u00a0 He was +12 in 460 innings in 2011 and +4 in 395 innings last year.\u00a0 According to the data from Mike Fast\u2019s study linked above shows Stewart as being worth another 10 runs over 93 games., 1408107=If you don\u2019t want to go back to 2010 here are their splits since 2011:, 621988=Theories about C. C. Sabathia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declining performance the last two seasons include the effect of his heavy workload \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an average of 227 innings over 16 seasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and his operation for bone chips in his pitching elbow after the 2012 season., 1263564=Since Gardner\u2019s now tallied 63 games this year, I figured I\u2019d go through his game logs and find the best 63 game samples of each season in his career so far to see how 2013 compares., 1186482=RV is just the difference in runs between the player\u2019s current wOBA and rwOBA given their 2013 plate appearances., 535567=From what I\u2019ve read, the Yankees have scouted Tanaka extensively.\u00a0 According to Brian Cashman they\u2019ve been scouting him since 2007 and watched 15 of his games this year. Given the total outlay they were willing to give to Tanaka, it\u2019s seems that their scouts think his stuff will translate to the majors well enough to put him at his 65% projection or better.\u00a0 Tanaka doesn\u2019t have the velocity or diversity of pitches in his arsenal that Yu Darvish has, but he has much better walk rates.\u00a0 My concern would be that it is easier to exhibit control when the people you are throwing too aren\u2019t as scary.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as easy to get away with grooved pitched in the majors as it is in any other baseball league in the world., 520012=Yankee shortstops hit .228/.286/.312 in 645 PA in 2013 and were somewhere around 20 runs below average defensively.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to think the combination of Jeter and Ryan can do better than this year., 280693=Nova made three starts for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre then was recalled to start June 23.\u00a0 From that poiint on he was the Yankees\u2019 best starter, throwing 116.2 innings with a 2.70 ERA.\u00a0 Nova scrapped his slider that had been a pretty effective pitch for him at points in the past and made more use of his curveball and it made a big difference., 622520=A 6-foot-7 pitcher with a wide girth and a longtime fondness for Cap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n Crunch cereal, Sabathia said he lost 25 pounds after the 2011 season to help take pressure off his knees after arthroscopic surgery., 1711692=I\u2019m using the CAIRO winning percentages instead of the averages, but other than that the concept is the same.\u00a0 Figure out the Log 5 win expectation for the games in April and try and estimate where the Yankees should end up if our estimate of their talent level is reasonably accurate., 305591=Kuroda had arguably the best season of his career in 2012, and followed it up with a very good 2013.\u00a0 He pitched about 18 fewer innings in the same number of starts, and tailed off appreciably from mid-August with a 7.33 RA and a 4.74 FIP after August 17 compared to a 2.39 RA and 3.41 FIP prior.\u00a0 His BABIP against through August 12 was .251 and it leaped to .355 after.\u00a0 His HR/FB rate was 8.3% through August 12 and 16.0% after.\u00a0 He was likely outpitching his peripherals through the first selective set of endpoints and then was probably a bit unlucky over the second set., 315607=In a vaccum I\u2019d peg Kuroda somewhere between the 65% and baseline forecast, but there\u2019s a pretty significant concern with him this year that has nothing to do with him specifically.\u00a0 Among the 37 starting pitchers who qualified for the ERA title in the AL in 2013 (minimum of 162 innings), Kuroda ranked sixth in highest ground ball percentage.\u00a0 It\u2019s fair to say the Yankee infield defense right now is questionable at best, and it could be disastrous.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to see what kind of impact that has on him., 10953=Yankees (53-41) @ Twins (51-44) , Friday July 24, 2015 , 8:10 PM (41 Comments - 7/25/2015 5:56:45 pm), 247260=2014 Projections, 9750=Yankees (54-42) @ Twins (52-45) , Sunday July 26, 2015 , 2:10 PM (73 Comments - 7/27/2015 3:17:29 am), 317510=After being worth just about every penny he was paid over his first four seasons as a Yankee, CC Sabathia had a very tough season in 2013., 2249093=Starting pitching is probably the deepest area on the Yankees, but these are the two key guys.\u00a0 I think Andy Pettitte can approximate Kuroda on a rate basis, but he hasn\u2019t thrown a full season since 2009.\u00a0 If CC can return to something approximating his 2011 form and Kuroda doesn\u2019t lose much from 2012, the Yankees will be able to lose quite a few 1-0 games instead of 2-0 games., 290366=That being said, Nova\u2019s shown flashes before and then disappointed and it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that it could happen again.\u00a0 Nova is out of options, so he shouldn\u2019t have to worry about going back down to the minors like he had to in 2011 and 2013., 1068312=My guess is for now we\u2019ll see Soriano in LF, and a Wells/Hafner platoon at DH, with Wells also occasionally resting one of Brett Gardner and Ichiro!\u00a0 What will be interesting to see is what happens if Curtis Granderson ever comes back.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to see a spot for Hafner at that point and while his play since May 1 hasn\u2019t deserved a spot, I am still holding out hope he can bust out of his slump., 1923730=You can\u2019t help but think back to 2007 and 2008 and imagine 80% Joba, but regardless of what he does this year I\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll end up signing elsewhere after the year, and may get a chance to start again., 2121891=2013 Projections - Andy Pettitte, 1830136=Rivera has confirmed that 2013 will be his last season.\u00a0 The heir to Mo seems like about the hardest job for a relief pitcher to inherit, but right now Robertson looks like the guy who\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 He\u2019s got the stuff to do it, and the performance results back that up.\u00a0 But let\u2019s hope he spends all of this year setting up the greatest closer of all time, and doing it as well as he\u2019s been doing it over the last two years., 786152=McCann, who will turn 30 in February, would help in both areas, but he might be too expensive to end up in the Bronx. He has hit at least 20 homers in each of the past six seasons and was selected to his seventh All-Star Game last year., 1912073=Probably not quite what we were hoping for back in 2008, Chamberlain basically projects as a serviceable middle relief arm.\u00a0 He may be better as he moves further away from ligament replacement surgery., 1973329=2013 Projections - Ivan Nova, 1411749=NEW YORK\u2014Twice this month, the Yankees have traded with the Rockies for a reserve infielder. New York acquired Reid Brignac from Colorado for cash considerations on Saturday, using the same avenue that brought Chris Nelson to the team on May 1., 2187048=For the first time in his Yankee career, CC Sabathia missed some starts.\u00a0 In fact, he wound up on the disabled list twice.\u00a0 Once for a groin strain in June and then again in August due to elbow soreness.\u00a0 He returned from the second stint and finished out the season, highlighted by a dominant nine innings to beat Baltimore in the clinching game of the ALDS, but he followed that with a brutal start against Detroit in the ALCS and after the season got arthroscopic surgery on his elbow to remove a bone spur., 537474=Although the official contract is 7 years and $155M, it\u2019s more realistic to think of it as a 4 year/$108M contract (including the posting fee) with a 3 year/$67M player option.\u00a0 Despite never throwing a pitch in MLB, Tanaka\u2019s going to be paid like one of the top 10 starters in baseball.\u00a0 Will he be?\u00a0 I won\u2019t even attempt to answer that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just say that he could be, and that instantly makes the Yankees a more interesting team in 2014.\u00a0, 329877=Including Sabathia, there have been 27 pitchers who amassed at least 45 bWAR by their age 30 season.\u00a0 Excluding CC, 24 of those 27 pitched from age 31 on.\u00a0 They averaged 20.6 WAR and 1224 innings over the remainders of their careers.\u00a0 10 of them did not amass at least 10 more WAR, including Johan Santana who is currently at 4.8 and probably not likely to get to 10.\u00a0 Roger Clemens is the runaway leader with 73.7 post-30 career bWAR., 1212517=I don\u2019t think I\u2019d sign any of those players.\u00a0 So if the Yankees are looking to upgrade, getting an outfielder seems to be the way to go, and getting one that is young enough to be useful in 2014 and beyond should be the focus.\u00a0 As far as who, I have no idea.\u00a0 So speculate away!, 50159=Around this time every year I take a run at some projected standings for the upcoming season.\u00a0 As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using the latest version of CAIRO which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably update this week and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the 2014 MLB season looks as of November 20., 2586044=Rodriguez had a very good defensive season in 2011 but fell below average again in 2012.\u00a0 He projects around average in 2013., 486452=I think the gains Gardner made in power last year were real as his swing appeared a bit stronger.\u00a0 His line drive percentage of 23.3% was higher than the 18.6% and 19.4% he put up in 2011-2012, and he hit the highest percentage of fly balls in his career.\u00a0 Losing some grounders may cost him some batting average, but the increase in power may help him recoup some of that in other ways.\u00a0 Because of that, I think Gardner\u2019s 65% forecast is reachable., 470201=Gardner followed up a 2012 season essentially lost to injury with a very good 2013.\u00a0 He set a career high in plate appearances and slugging percentage, although his OBP was down a bit and he wasn\u2019t very aggressive on the bases, stealing successfully only 24 times in 32 attempts compared to 47 of 56 and 49 of 62 in his preveious two full seasons.\u00a0 Gardner missed the second half of September with a rib cage injury but should be healthy to start 2014., 1856619=Walk and K rates tend to stabilize more quickly than other stats and major league performance should get more weight than minor league performance, but 2961 PA vs. 491 PA is also an important consideration., 2503538=Heading into 2012, my biggest concern with Alex Rodriguez was his health.\u00a0 He actually ended up playing a bit more than I thought, but his rate of performance was worse than expected.\u00a0 Here are his 2012 projections compared to what he actually did., 1941740=2013 Projections - Boone Logan, 2316194=2012, 9312=CAIRO\u2019s updated 2015 Final Projected Standings and Postseason Odds as of July 27 (53 Comments - 7/27/2015 5:06:14 pm), 388387=The projection systems like the lefty-swinging McCann as he moves to DNYS, with the average forecasting him to exceed his career high of 24 homers.\u00a0 As you would expect, McCann\u2019s offense falls of significantly vs. LHP (career .239/.320/.424 vs. LHP and .285/.362/.495 vs. RHP) but the Yankees have an ideal platoon mate for him in Francisco Cervelli if Cervelli isn\u2019t traded, so catcher should be one of the team\u2019s strengths in 2014., 145224=Calculating expected batting average on balls in play is not nearly an exact science, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that Solarte was playing over his head to start the year and has probably not been as bad as his numbers since May 15.\u00a0 I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that his walk rate and strikeout rate have been fairly consistent, but not so encouraged by the drop in his line drive percentage., 376508=That\u2019s not worth $22M per season, but it would be about two wins better than what the Yankees got out of 1B in 2013.\u00a0 So that\u2019s something., 470711=2014 Projections, 267599=2014 CAIRO Percentile Forecasts Phelps, 110594=Brett Gardner came into 2014 with a career SLG of .381 in 2228 PA.\u00a0 Gardner\u2019s been a very valuable player for the Yankees in his career, but it\u2019s primarily been due to his ability to get on base at an above-average rate, his ability to use his speed on the bases, and his defense in the outfield.\u00a0 Since he was often called \u201cThe Speedy Brett Gardner\u201d and I am too lazy to keep typing that, he became TSBG., 8124=Yankees (56-42) @ Rangers (47-51) , Tuesday July 28, 2015 , 8:05 PM (119 Comments - 7/29/2015 9:06:53 am), 2657763=So the question becomes defense.\u00a0 Cervelli had a pretty good defensive season as he threw out 10 of 23 base runners attempting to steal (43.5%) and was worth 4 runs above average in just 241 innings according to DRS.\u00a0 Since then he\u2019s only thrown out 13 of 92 runs (14.1%) and has been 4 runs below average in about 1040 innings.\u00a0 DRS doesn\u2019t consider pitch framing, although Mike Fast\u2019s data on Cervelli shows him as around -4 over 141 games., 1940900=Aardsma\u2019s projections aren\u2019t very useful given how much time he\u2019s missed since 2010 and the fact that he\u2019s been rehabbing from a ligament replacement surgery of his own, but they\u2019re not very good.\u00a0 Aardsma used to average over 94 mph with his fastball but has been around 91 mph this spring, although he was throwing a bit harder over his last few appearances.\u00a0 Whether he lost velocity after surgery or is still rebuilding his arm strength is something we won\u2019t know for a while, but to be honest I think projecting him is a waste of time.\u00a0 He could end up being pretty useful or he may provide nothing.\u00a0 Because of the uncertainty of his return to health I am not going to run his percentile forecasts in CAIRO., 786509=Let\u2019s see how CAIRO projects McCann as a Yankee in 2014., 8928=Yankees (55-42) @ Rangers (47-50) , Monday July 27, 2015 , 8:05 PM (103 Comments - 7/28/2015 10:54:09 am), 148582=In 2013, the Yankees scored 650 runs.\u00a0 In terms of runs scored, it was the fewest runs they scored as a team since 1990.\u00a0 The run environment has fluctuated a fair amount so looking at straight runs scored may be misleading.\u00a0 Their OPS+ in 2013 was 88.\u00a0 That was their worst since 1990 as well, when they had an OPS+ of 86., 624486=Part of the reason I\u2019m so pessimistic about the 2014 Yankees is the morphing of CC from ace to a #3 or #4 starter.\u00a0 CAIRO has 50 pitchers projected to throw at least 165 innings with a better RA than CC\u2019s projected 4.33., 627822=I\u2019ll probably release the 2014 CAIRO v0.1 projections tomorrow, so here\u2019s a taste, looking at just the current free agent position players., 181001=A 15-10 true talent team should win about 97 games over a full season.\u00a0 An 11.5-13.5 true talent team (their Pythagenpat) would win about 75.\u00a0 A 12.7-12.3 team (their linear weights Pythagenpat) would win around 83 games., 1972432=There\u2019s no question that Ivan Nova and David Phelps are important to the Yankees in 2013.\u00a0 But what they do in 2013 will be even more important in the long-term.\u00a0 With three-fifths of the likely 2013 rotation unsigned past this year, can they establish themselves as part of the Yankees rotation in 2014 and beyond?, 478869=2014 CAIRO Percentile Forecasts, 2345350=2013 Projections, 1063026=Although it\u2019s not actually official yet, all indications are that Alfonso Soriano will be a Yankee by this weekend.\u00a0 Soriano left the Yankees as a shaky defensive second baseman with speed and power in the Alex Rodriguez trade and returns as a plus defensive LF who still has pop but doesn\u2019t run all that much.\u00a0 Soriano has never been much of a walker although his 3.9% BB/PA this season would be his lowest since 2002.\u00a0 He still loves swinging at pitches in the left-handed hitters batters box, so that will be fun to watch., 555866=When the rumors began about the Yankees being interested in Brian McCann I posted his CAIRO projections but now that it\u2019s official let\u2019s go through them again.\u00a0 First up, his 2014 percentile forecasts., 1831907=With Derek Jeter starting the year on the DL, the Yankees will have a new Opening Day shortstop for the first time since 2001.\u00a0 And it\u2019s Eduardo Nunez.\u00a0 Because of his defensive struggles early in 2012 Nunez spent most of 2012 in the minors, with part of that spent on the DL.\u00a0 He dit hit .292/.330/.393 in his 100 MLB PA, pushing his career MLB line to .272/.318/.384 which is a lot better than his career minor league line of .271.314/.365.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how he projects in 2013., 278616=2013 started out badly but ended well for Ivan Nova, who has had to fight for a rotation spot throughout his career.\u00a0 He may not have to do that anymore., 478339=Gardner will be in left field this year, which means his offensive value relative to position will be a bit less.\u00a0 But he projects to hit a hair above the average LF with a wOBA of .321 (average LF is usually around .320).\u00a0 The significant amount of time he missed in 2012 is suppressing his playing time projections in CAIRO and ZiPS here.\u00a0 Then again, Gardner tends to miss time for various reasons so it\u2019s probably not realistic to pencil him for 650 PA this year., 250996=2014 CAIRO Percentile Forecasts, 2041174=4) These are NOT my predictions. These are projections based on running a computer simulation hundreds of thousands of times with projection data that is inherently limited. If your favorite team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame me, blame the computers and spreadsheets that projected them. I guess you can blame me for the CAIRO results if you want, otherwise you can take heart in the 2006 Tigers projecting to win 80, the 2010 Giants projecting to go 81-81 or the 2012 Orioles projecting to win 70 games.\u00a0 These are not meant to tell you how the season is going to play out.\u00a0 I prefer to think of them more as a starting point for discussion, with a range of something like 10 wins in either direction based on how things actually end up playing out.\u00a0 You can look at them and argue about why you think some teams will be better or worse., 401541=We got spoiled from 1998 through 2010 with the offense that Jorge Posada provided out of catcher.\u00a0 You can count the number of catchers who hit as well as Posada did over his career in a significant number of PAs on two hands and two feet.\u00a0 Through age 29, McCann actually has a higher OPS+ than Posada did (117 vs. 115) although McCann has 2100 more PAs through that point.\u00a0 That being said, one of the things that made Posada unique is what he did from age 30 on (.276/.376/.478, OPS+ of 124).\u00a0 It\u2019s not likely McCann will hit better over the next five years than he has so far.\u00a0, 2032927=Since 2009, here is the average number of starts made by starters 1-7., 2139538=Projecting a 40 year old pitcher is tricky, but most of the projections expect Pettitte to be pretty good on a rate basis.\u00a0 The bigger issue with Pettitte is how many innings the Yankees can get out of him.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t thrown a full season since 2009.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s injury was more fluke than age-related, but that doesn\u2019t mean his age and ability to stay healthy for a full year aren\u2019t a concern.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably also worth mentioning that Pettitte\u2019s 2012 FIP and xFIP were a fair amount higher than his ERA and that his fastball velocity was down to 87.8 mph vs 89.0 mph in 2010., 2036779=With Opening Day rapidly approaching, it\u2019s time for my 2013 MLB projected standings blowout.\u00a0 The idea behind this series of posts is to try and project how the 2013 MLB season might look given what we think we may know right now.\u00a0 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing a version of this since 2005, and you can see the results by looking at the following links., 1533813=I don\u2019t see Wells hitting .319/.385/.613 for the rest of the year, obviously.\u00a0 But can he hit .270/.330/.450?\u00a0 That\u2019s not far off his expected line for 2011-2012 if he can maintain his improved walk rate.\u00a0 Add that to what he\u2019s done this year and he\u2019d end the year in the .275/.340/.490 range.\u00a0 That\u2019d be pretty good., 1249922=Whether they have been exceedingly lucky to this point is less important than how good they will be in the future.\u00a0 In the meantime, they are winning real games even if they are not winning spreadsheet games.\u00a0 There are a lot of parallels to the 2012 Orioles, a team that seemed to be fluky for most of the year but ended the year playing about as well as any team in baseball.\u00a0 Of course those Orioles had more young talent and that\u2019s not something the Yankees really have much of right now., 259128=Pineda spent 2013 rehabbing from labrum surgery and pitched 40 or so innings scattered at various levels in the minors.\u00a0 He appears to be healthy, but his velocity hasn\u2019t recovered back to where it was in his rookie season with Seattle., 2003310=2013 Projections - David Phelps, 1210619=According to linear weights, the Yankees are dead last in production out of LF.\u00a0 You know, the position that\u2019s being manned by a guy who\u2019s signed for next year too.\u00a0 The ugliness doesn\u2019t end there of course.\u00a0 They are also getting abysmal production out of RF, 1B and C.\u00a0 Shortstop is also not doing particularly well.\u00a0 Really, they have three positions that are outperforming MLB average in 2B, CF and DH and could look to improve just about anywhere else.\u00a0 In theory, getting Francisco Cervelli, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez back (all uncertain to varying degrees) would be a big help and I suppose if Teixeira is able to eventually return at even his 2012 level that\u2019s an overall improvement., 990151=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 586490=But they are better now than they were before they signed McCann, and he\u2019s young enough to be an asset past 2014 provided he can stay healthy.\u00a0 The Yankees lose the 18th pick in the MLB entry draft with this signing, but I\u2019m ok with that, more so than I would have been if they had lost it signing someone like Carlos Beltran who is not likely to be a part of a contending Yankee team., 2344789=It is worth mentioning that Cano\u2019s season was probably not as valuable as his raw numbers indicate because his performance in more crucial situations as measured by run expectancy wasn\u2019t as good.\u00a0 It may have cost him about 15 runs of value.\u00a0 He was still pretty clearly the Yankees\u2019 most valuable position player in 2012, and figures to be again in 2013.\u00a0 Speaking of 2013, here are his projections for his final season as a Yankee., 352173=Johnson projects to be a borderline average player.\u00a0 Yankee 3B hit .231/.293/.340 last year so he should be better than that.\u00a0 That could be the theme of the 2014 Yankees.\u00a0 Not great, but better than 2013., 2407532=As far as after 2013, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to lock up a player long-term starting from their age 31 season, and that\u2019s the dilemma facing the Yankees with Cano.\u00a0 He\u2019s their best offensive player and an MVP candidate now, but what will he be when he\u2019s 35 or 36?, 622910=He indeed looked thinner on the mound in 2013, down to perhaps 270 pounds after weighing more than 300 in his first seasons in New York, which included a World Series championship in 2009., 783573=CAIRO says the four remaining years of Phillips\u2019s contract would have him hitting .258/.309/.390 over 2476 PA and being worth about six WAR offensively.\u00a0 Maybe you can give him another win for defense although given the fact that he\u2019ll be 36 by the end of his contract we can assume decline from his current level.\u00a0 Is seven wins or so worth $50M?\u00a0 Not if you have a self-imposed budget, it\u2019s not.\u00a0 And if you actually have to give up something of value on top of an already bad contract, does it really make any sense at all?, 1710820=To determine how much I should panic after an 0-2 start, I put together a log 5 expectation chart for the Yankees in April.\u00a0 Bil James developed the log 5 methodology to assign win probabilities for a baseball game, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically team 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winning percentage plus 0.5 minus team 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winning percentage.\u00a0 For winning percentages I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m using the average of my 2012 projection blowout and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also incorporating a 0.04 home field advantage., 2599248=Although it looks like Francisco Cervelli is the likely starting catcher heading into the season, I figured I\u2019d run both he and Chris Stewart through the projection gauntlet.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to go over their 2012 since neither played that much., 428320=Is the 2014 version of Beltran better than the 2013 Ichiro?\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Is it a significant difference?\u00a0 I guess it depends on how much you trust the defensive metrics that still peg Ichiro as a positive contributor., 620004=But if you are a Yankee fan, like I used to be, this is pretty disheartening.\u00a0 It\u2019s not surprising, and if you put the lineup and pitching staff together based on how they project in 2014 you will see they are about as far from championship caliber as any team in the American League.\u00a0 Maybe moreso considering the relative strength of their division.\u00a0, 243718=That can certainly happen, of course.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s Red Sox team looked like an 84 win team heading into the season.\u00a0 The 2012 Giants looked like one as well.\u00a0 But I\u2019d feel better if the Yankees had better depth to cover for the risks they are carrying in the infield., 1563020=A league average hitter in 2013 MLB is probably worth about 77-78 BR in 650 PA.\u00a0 So the Yankees so far have gotten better than average performance against lefties from exactly two players., 2032392=With Phil Hughes starting the season on the DL, Phelps will be in the rotation.\u00a0 But when Hughes comes back, unless Nova is getting shelled or someone else is injured he may get shifted to the bullpen.\u00a0 I\u2019d rather see him starting games in the minors if that happened, because he probably needs innings if he\u2019s going to be in the rotation in 2014, but the Yankees have a habit of doing things that appear sub-optimal., 2207077=2013 Projections - Kuroda, 400733=If McCann adds five runs of value with pitch-framing, he projects as around a four win player.\u00a0 500 PA of McCann and 175 PA of Francisco Cervelli could be worth about five wins, which is five wins more than Yankee catchers were worth in 2013., 2184053=It also wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see Hughes have a good enough year that he\u2019ll entice several teams to bid for him as a free agent.\u00a0 The better the year he has, the less likely it is that he\u2019ll be a Yankee in 2014 unfortunately.\u00a0 And the worse he is, the less we\u2019ll want him back., 48233=diffW: Change in final 2015 projected wins from pre-season CAIRO projections. diffDiv: Change in final 2015 projected division win percentage from pre-season CAIRO projections. DiffPS: Change in final 2015 projected post-season qualifying percentage from pre-season CAIRO projections (division titles plus either of the two wild cards)., 114268=Using Baseball-Reference\u2019s play index, I found 472 players that had at least 2000 PA and a SLG of less than .400 through age 29.\u00a0 Of those players, just 14 had at least 2000 more PA and slugged over .400., 1972865=Nova had a bizarre season in 2012.\u00a0 Despite improving his walk rate and strikeout rate, he got hammered.\u00a0 Nova gave up more extra base hits than any pitcher in the league, and by some measures (component ERA, tERA) was actually lucky to only have a 5.02 ERA.\u00a0 But by other measures he was unlucky.\u00a0 Here are his 2013 projections., 267197=I debated whether I should even post these, because the data that was used to build them is pretty much irrelevant at this point.\u00a0 Pineda\u2019s doesn\u2019t have the fastball he had in 2011, and the numbers from last year are meaningless because he was rehabbing and probably not pitching at full strength.\u00a0 Pineda could be pretty good, or he could be horrendous., 285071=The projections are expecting Nova to give back some of his gains from 2013, which is what projection systems do.\u00a0 But they are all in agreement that Nova is an above average pitcher now.\u00a0 200 innings of his average projection would be worth close to 3 WAR., 796927=The Yankees got about 0.5 WAR out of catcher in 2013.\u00a0 So McCann plus a good backup could be a 3-4 win upgrade.\u00a0 McCann\u2019s missed a fair amount of time over the last two years which is why CAIRO has him around 497 PA but if he can get to 550 or so he\u2019d be worth about 3.6 WAR offensively., 2409823=It was a pretty safe bet that Curtis Granderson would not be able to replicate his MVP-caliber 2011 season.\u00a0 The question was whether or not the changes that Kevin Long implemented would carry over more than the projections expected them to.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how he projected heading into 2012., 1618739=Jeter\u2019s not nearly as valuable as he was at his peak, and that\u2019s the important thing to remember.\u00a0 Losing him doesn\u2019t help, but they\u2019re not losing the Jeter from 1999 or 2006 or 2009.\u00a0 So while Nunez figures to be worse, the impact is likely not going to be much more than a win at most, even if Jeter ends up missing the rest of the season., 625127=On the plus side, Sabathia\u2019s peripherals in 2013 were better than his actual performance would indicate.\u00a0 His FIP of 4.10 and xFIP of 3.76 both paint a rosier picture than his 4.78 ERA.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not ready to say that his BABIP against was flukishly high because of bad luck alone.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a ton of change in opposing hitters\u2019 batted ball profiles against him in 2013 (22.3% line drives vs. 23.1% in 2011 and 21.1% in 2012) but that doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t getting hit harder.\u00a0 His runners stranded percentage of 67.4% was a fair bit worse than his career rate of 72.7% but again we don\u2019t know if that was just bad fortune or bad pitching., 464382=I\u2019d be surprised if Roberts is the Yankee 2B by the All Star Break.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see any reason to think he\u2019s going to suddenly remain healthy after four seasons of not being healthy.\u00a0 I also see no reason to think he\u2019s going to hit particularly well if he does remain healthy.\u00a0 So at some point he could be replaced by Scott Sizemore or Dean Anna or Yangervis Solarte or (heaven forbid) Eduardo Nunez.\u00a0 But it\u2019s safe to say no matter who ends as the primary 2B for the 2014 Yankees, he will be significantly worse than Robinson Cano was in 2013., 137097=ytd_wOBA: Weighted-on base average for 2014 through June 30 ros_wOBA Steamer\u2019s projected wOBA over the rest of the season, 776047=The Yankees, looking to set themselves up in case star second baseman Robinson Cano signs elsewhere, have checked in with the Reds regarding Brandon Phillips and also asked about free-agent second baseman Omar Infante., 2533522=Rodriguez ended up having hip surgery this January and will likely miss at least the first half of the season.\u00a0 Here are his 2013 projections., 190590=Clay Davenport\u2019s 2014 Projected Standings Fangraphs\u2019 2014 Projected Standings using a combination of Steamer and ZiPS Baseball Prospectus\u2019s PECOTA projected 2014 standings, 1569992=The main thing here is that Adams and Mustelier offer upside that Francisco does not.\u00a0 They are also players who could figure into the team\u2019s plans after 2013.\u00a0 It makes a ridiculous amount of sense to have one of them getting the PAs that are going to Francisco right now for negative run production., 589229=As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using CAIRO v0.2 which I\u2019ll probably post tomorrow and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the 2014 MLB season looks as of November 20., 797473=Unfortunately, you can\u2019t sign McCann for just 2014, so here\u2019s how he projects over the next four seasons., 539217=There\u2019s no secret the Yankees are hoping to bring Kuroda back in 2014.\u00a0 The question is whether it\u2019s a good idea.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at some selective endpoints from Kuroda\u2019s two seasons as a Yankee., 1924043=2013 Projections - David Aardsma, 1760459=The Yankees are already 1.1 games behind where they projected to be based on this.\u00a0 If they would have played as expected they\u2019d have finished April around 14-14 but now they are expected to finish at 13-15.\u00a0 Another loss today before heading to Detroit for three games gives us the very realistic possibility of the Yankees starting the year 0-6.\u00a0 At that point, they\u2019ll be 3 wins behind their 85 win projection and essentially looking like a .500 team., 1990706=Nova\u2019s average projection has him about a win better than 2012.\u00a0 Steamer is the most optimistic, and ZiPS is the most pessimistic although Dan Szymborski (creator of ZiPS) likes Nova more than his projection system does.\u00a0 As do I., 2248870=I don\u2019t think Kuroda can repeat 2012.\u00a0 I do think he can beat the baseline projection though.\u00a0, 2206880=Sabathia\u2019s average projection is expecting him to be about a half-win better in 2013., 1069500=I guess they should go ahead and try and make one last push for the postseason at this point because I can\u2019t see any way this team is competitive in 2014.\u00a0 But someone like Soriano isn\u2019t really a push, he\u2019s more like a slight nudge.\u00a0 And if they ended up giving up a viable prospect for him I will really dislike this move., 1800664=David Robertson had another good year in 2012, even if it wasn\u2019t quite as good as his 2011. Robertson actually cut his walk rate pretty significantly last year., 2599612=First up, here are Cervelli\u2019s 2013 projections., 2033296=Phelps got 11 starts last year.\u00a0 He has worked as many as 158 innings in a season, but that was in the minors where the innings are less taxing and it was in 2010.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see him getting at least 160 innings this year, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s likely to happen.\u00a0 Then again, Phelps will be 27 next year and is perhaps not the injury risk a younger pitcher would be., 1518827=As Vernon Wells continues to defy reasonable expectations, I continue to wait for him to revert back to being Vernon Wells.\u00a0 The thing is, as I started poking around inside his numbers for the last few years I found some things that could lead us to believe he may actually not revert back to the 2011-2012 version of Vernon Wells., 2187761=Sabathia\u2019s velocity was down by about 1.5 mph from 2011.\u00a0 His BB rate and K rate actually both improved from 2011 to 2012, but he gave up more homers.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if the bone spur affected his velocity, but let\u2019s hope he can get some of that back., 2119362=And there you have it.\u00a0 The 2013 projection blowout.\u00a0 Results are not guaranteed., 2396543=Cano won the AL Gold Glove at 2B in 2010 and 2012.\u00a0 The defensive metrics are mixed on him, although the overall net is that he\u2019s a plus defender., 140144=Yangervis Solarte seemingly came out of nowhere with a strong spring training to win a spot on the Yankees\u2019 25 man roster on Opening Day.\u00a0 He forced his way into a full-time role with his hitting and had an impressive line of .336/.414/.521 entering May 15.\u00a0 Since then he\u2019s been pretty bad., 1108346=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 377559=Catcher was a gaping hole on the 2013 Yankees, and one the Yankees addressed quickly in the offseason when they signed Brian McCann to a five year contract for $85M., 1710386=Last year on April 8, I wrote a post about the April Log 5 expectations for the Yankees.\u00a0 To quote from that post:, 522177=Tanaka\u2019s projection is based on the principles that I discussed in this post.\u00a0 In a nutshell, I\u2019m looking only at pitchers who were starters in NPB and came over to MLB and remained starters, and I accounted for the fact that they pitched in varying run environments both before and after they entered MLB.\u00a0 Tanaka\u2019s raw performance in Japan blows away just about everyone who came over prior to Yu Darvish.\u00a0 Tanaka\u2019s allowed runs at a rate of 54% of his leagues\u2019 averages.\u00a0 For comparison\u2019s sake, here are some numbers for the pitchers who have come over from Japan since 2007., 520624=It will be tough to see Jeter go, but I prefer that to the alternative of seeing him playing past the point of usefulness and dragging the team down.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see that in 2014., 2596897=At this point I don\u2019t think Rodriguez will ever stay healthy for a full season again, and I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get to 700 HRs.\u00a0 I can see him out-hitting his projections when he plays, especially if he can get more drive from his hips.\u00a0 If he can manage 13 homers this year he ties Willie Mays and gets a $6M bonus.\u00a0 If he can\u2019t do that and it happens in 2014, it could screw up the Yankee\u2019s goal of getting under a $189M payroll.\u00a0, 2501520=Granderson\u2019s probably one of my favorite current Yankees, both for what he does on the field and the way he carries himself off of it.\u00a0 After 2011 I was hoping to see him in pinstripes for a few more years and I was disappointed that he fell off as much as he did in 2012.\u00a0 But given that, at this point it doesn\u2019t appear to be in the Yankees\u2019 best interest to bring him back after this year., 422070=I think the 35% forecast is what I would expect from Beltran, maybe with a bit more playing time.\u00a0 Beltran\u2019s been pretty healthy after missing the bulk of 2009 and 2010, but at 37 I\u2019m not sure how long the Yankees can count on his continued good health., 1801122=His strike out rate was down from 2011 but still higher than his career average (32.7% vs. 31.5%).\u00a0 Here are his 2013 projections., 329032=I think Sabathia can be better than last year but I don\u2019t see him pitching much better than the baseline, particularly given the fact that he was topping out at 88 mph in his spring debut.\u00a0 If he can hit the baseline, he\u2019d allow 22 fewer runs than last season over basically the same workload, which means a two win improvement relative to 2013., 1407812=Here are Overbay and Teixeira\u2019s respective splits vs. RHP since 2010., 2186791=In the interest of time, I\u2019m doubling up on the pitchers and I\u2019m not going to bother with their 2012 projections compared to their actuals.\u00a0, 1658003=CLEVELAND \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Since becoming a regular with the Orix Blue Wave in 1994, Ichiro Suzuki has never worried about playing time. If he was healthy, he was in the starting lineup \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whether the game was being played in Japan or the United States., 2224531=The projections are expecting a big drop with Kuroda this year.\u00a0 His peripherals in 2012 indicate that he may have been a bit lucky but he\u2019s got a career ERA of 3.42 vs. a career FIP of 3.62 and a career BABIP against of .282 (vs. around .304 for league average) so he may have some skill there.\u00a0 Anyway, Kuroda seems to be a unique pitcher.\u00a0 No starter from Japan\u2019s NPB has been able to translate as well as he has in his career, and the fact that he\u2019s done it from ages 33-37 makes it even more impressive.\u00a0, 2003083=David Phelps doesn\u2019t have Nova\u2019s arm or stuff, but he probably has a higher floor.\u00a0 Here are his 2013 projections., 550764=Kuroda will be 39 in 2014.\u00a0 Because of that alone he carries a fair amount of risk.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think his late season performance in 2013 is of particular concern as far as what it means for next year.\u00a0 Most of his peripherals were still pretty good, and his velocity was fine.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if skipping a few starts during the year or managing his innings a bit more judiciously would help him pitch a little better at the end of the year.\u00a0, 2597476=The good news is that he\u2019s signed for only four more seasons after 2013., 622787=Then, Sabathia said, he lost about 20 pounds after the 2012 season., 7315=Yankees (57-42) @ Rangers (47-52) , Wednesday July 29, 2015 , 8:05 PM (80 Comments - 7/30/2015 5:34:21 am), 2037246=2005 2006 2007 2008 Pt 1 2008 Pt 2 2009 AL 2009 NL 2010 AL 2010 NL 2011 AL 2011 NL 2012, 215385=W: Projected final 2014 wins L: Projected final 2014 losses RS: Projected final 2014 runs scored RA: Projected final 2014 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 8510=NY Post: Samardzija? Price? Rival execs insist Yankees will land pitcher (81 Comments - 7/28/2015 8:28:39 pm), 1533074=Batted ball data is limited, so any analysis based on using it needs to be viewed with that understanding.\u00a0 But I find it encouraging and interesting that Wells may actually have underperformed his underlying periphals this year and that he appears to have done so by a very significant amount in 2011-2012.\u00a0 His 2011-12 performance would still have been substandard if he hit closer to his xBABIP but not nearly as bad as his actual performance was., 1215458=On May 14, the Yankees were 25-14 and in first place in the AL East, two games up.\u00a0 Since then they\u2019ve gone 12-16 and now sit three games back., 331782=2013, 430378=The Yankees decided to let their best player leave, and replaced him with Brian Roberts.\u00a0 Roberts was a pretty good player as recently as five years ago, but since 2010 he\u2019s suffered from concussion-related issues and injuries that have kept him off the field and hindered his performance when he was on it.\u00a0 He did manage to stay healthy in the second half of 2013 and he\u2019s penciled in(hopefully very lightly) as the Yankees\u2019 starting 2B this year., 245227=2013, 1298230=But in the world where the projections accurately reflect what Jeter could be doing in 2013, 150 games of what the Yankees have gotten from shortstop compared to 150 games of Jeter\u2019s projections is worth about 29 runs, or three wins.\u00a0 Even if you regress that in both directions and say the gap is closer to 15 runs, it\u2019s pretty obvious the Yankees miss Jeter badly., 1298682=I hope the Yankees have some kind of plan in place to address this in 2014 if they aren\u2019t going to do anything about it this year., 624766=Now CAIRO has no idea if Sabathia is going to be able to make adjustments to his pitching style and be more effective than that.\u00a0 And I suppose it\u2019s possible that including his performance prior to 2013 in his projections is overrating him and he\u2019s even worse than a 4.33 RA.\u00a0 We just don\u2019t know., 191009=And here are CAIRO\u2019s projected standings for 2014., 1894880=2013 Projections -, 67010=W: Projected final 2015 wins L: Projected final 2015 losses RS: Projected final 2015 runs scored RA: Projected final 2015 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 623154=But coincidence or not, and maybe that is all it is, Sabathia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pitches have lost velocity and crispness over the last two seasons. According to Fangraphs, the hefty version of Sabathia threw a fastball that averaged 93.9 miles per hour in 2011. Two years later, that velocity dropped to 91.2 m.p.h., 785688=So while the Yankees have many pressing needs, they are no closer to finding answers for 2014., 10571=Yankees (53-42) @ Twins (52-44) , Saturday July 25, 2015 , 7:10 PM (40 Comments - 7/26/2015 6:14:53 am), 1068789=My thought on this trade, and really on the way this team has done business over the past season is this.\u00a0 It stinks.\u00a0 They\u2019ve blown so much money on players like Kevin Youkilis, Wells and now Soriano to build a team that\u2019s got a lower chance at the postseason than half the teams in the league.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done it with an eye on getting below the salary cap in 2014 so they can get some savings, but I don\u2019t think the savings they\u2019ll get will even come close to making up the $40+M of essentially wasted money that they\u2019ve spent on replacement level production and the ratings and attendance drop that this team has spearheaded., 71363=In yesterday\u2019s thread, there was some discussion about FanGraphs\u2019 depth charts pegging the Yankees at around 82 wins.\u00a0 Quickly eyeballing their depth charts told me that their playing time estimates are way off.\u00a0 So I figured I\u2019d take a shot at my own version of this and see how good the 2015 Yankees appear to be as of today, using the latest version of CAIRO which I just uploaded., 280360=After four mostly bad starts, Ivan Nova was placed on the disabled list on April 27.\u00a0 He was activated a month later, made two relief appearances and then was demoted to AAA so the Yankees could activate Kevin Youkilis and Mark Teixeira from the disabled list.\u00a0 Yeah, that worked out., 2189082=2013 Projections - Sabathia, 1017357=Since May 20, Sabathia has made 14 starts.\u00a0 He\u2019s got an RA of 6.28 and opposing batters have hit .284/.329/.488 against him.\u00a0 He\u2019s got a component ERA of around 5, and a FIP of 4.5.\u00a0 His BABIP against of .320 is a bit high, but I see no evidence it\u2019s going to come down with the way he\u2019s pitching now., 1818287=Robertson\u2019s a closer-quality pitcher pitching the eighth inning and he provides a safety net for the Yankees should Mariano Rivera miss time.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t go so well last year, but I wouldn\u2019t make any sweeping generalizations about Robertson\u2019s incapability of closing games because of three or four games where he struggled in 2012.\u00a0 CAIRO likes him a bit more than the other forecasts, and I think that\u2019s always been the case for whatever reason., 2152276=2013 Projections - Phil Hughes, 495142=2013 Because of his broken ankle in the 2012 ALCS, Jeter wasn\u2019t able to do his normal conditioning work in the 2012-2013 offseason.\u00a0 Because of that he never got healthy enough to contribute much., 2039683=2) Playing time distribution in these simulations will not match actual 2013 playing time. I used the rosters and depth charts available at MLB Depth Charts plus whatever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read over the offseason as my guide to set these up as realistically as possible, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible source of error. Rosters were set up to have 35-40 or so active players per team, and to get a reasonable amount of playing time from the bench and extra pitchers, to more closely model reality. Basically, no players are set to play more than 90% of the time, starting catchers are restricted to at most about 75% of the games, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sure teams get a non-trivial amount of starts from their 6-8 starters. The healthier a team is in 2013, the more likely they will be to exceed these projections, and vice versa., 1798648=I don\u2019t know if Rivera will get one last shot to shine on the postseason stage this year.\u00a0 Right now the odds are better that he won\u2019t than that he will.\u00a0 But however 2013 plays out, Rivera will be one of the main reasons to watch this season.\u00a0 Savor every chord from Enter Sandman.\u00a0 Savor the cheers he\u2019ll get from the fans in every stadium he\u2019ll pitch in this year.\u00a0 Savor every cutter in on a left-handed batter that breaks their bat, and every called strike that might not have been a strike if it wasn\u2019t Mo throwing it., 189993=I\u2019ve posted the final pre-season version of the 2014 CAIRO MLB projections and they are available at this link., 1608595=First baseman Mark Teixeira, 33, is supposed to return from a partially torn tendon sheath in his right wrist in early May. Believe that when you see it, too., 514535=I thought Jeter was done after 2010 but then he had a strong 2011 and an even better 2012.\u00a0 I would not be surprised to see him at his 65% forecast, but I would bet he\u2019ll be around the baseline in both rate stats and playing time.\u00a0, 777578=Here is how CAIRO projects Phillips and Cano as Yankees in 2014., 1119148=The Orioles are the beasts, fighting the Boston Red Sox for first place in the American League East, and everyone knows now that it is no fluke. Since the end of July of last season, the Orioles have been the best regular-season team in baseball., 1762710=2013 will be the final season of Mariano Rivera\u2019s career.\u00a0 Rivera\u2019s rehabbed his way back from a serious knee injury and looks like he\u2019s healthy and good to go.\u00a0 Here are his projections for this year., 550317=Kuroda\u2019s problem was not velocity, as it was actually higher over the last 5-6 weeks of the season in both 2012 and 2013.\u00a0 In 2013 his control got worse, and he gave up twice as many home runs per fly ball.\u00a0 His BABIP against went from a unrealistically low .251 to .355.\u00a0 He saw a similar issue with HR/FB and BABIP against in 2012, although not to the same extreme in either one., 230060=The most glaring thing here to me is that the Yankees don\u2019t have a true superstar hitter.\u00a0 They\u2019re paying a few players like they are superstars, but they aren\u2019t.\u00a0 The average AL team scored 702 runs in 2013, so that\u2019s about where the Yankee offense likely projects for this season., 551283=For whatever it\u2019s worth Kuroda gave the team two good postseason starts in 2012 so I don\u2019t think we can assume he\u2019ll be useless after mid-August., 161299=If I had to guess, I don\u2019t think that Solarte is really a .336/.414/.521 player.\u00a0 But I do like a comp I saw somewhere.\u00a0 Melvin Mora didn\u2019t get a chance in MLB until age 27 but ended up carving out a nice career.\u00a0 Mora hit .284/.355/.383 in 1894 PA in AA and AAA prior to being called up in 1999 and then had 6158 PA of .277/.350/431 which was good for an OPS+ of 105.\u00a0 Solarte is a year younger than Mora was when he got his chance and hit .294/.338/.422 in 1781 AA/AAA PA although more of those PA came in the PCL(a very hitter-friendly league) relative to Mora., 10126=NY Times: Alex Rodriguez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Three Home Runs Help Yankees Rally to Stun the Twins (11 Comments - 7/26/2015 2:14:54 pm), 217129=I\u2019m still not sure how the rest of the 25 man roster will fill out by Opening Day, but I figure it will change throughout the year anyway so I took a stab at creating depth charts anyway.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to run my full projection blowout this year, but I should be able to post CAIRO\u2019s projected standings by Monday.\u00a0 Before that, let\u2019s take a look at what the 2014 Yankees might look like on virtual paper., 436772=Roberts didn\u2019t hit much in 2013, but he did stay on the field for most of the second half and he hit .250/.306/.450 in September., 809501=I haven\u2019t run a real 2014 projection yet for Masahiro Tanaka because I generally wait until I have a more comprehensive list of players who could be moving over from Japan to MLB, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t start playing around with some crude ways to estimate how his performance in Japan would translate to the majors.\u00a0 So for this first quick and dirty iteration, I just took a 3/2/1 weighted average of what Yu Darvish did in his last three seasons in Japan and compared it to his average over his first two MLB seasons, pro-rated to match his MLB innings., 2373283=Cano is expected to be less productive in 2013, which makes sense given his age and regression towards the mean.\u00a0 He still projects to be in the range of an MVP candidate., 7706=CBS Sports: Yankees have 11-run inning, end with 21 runs: By the numbers (59 Comments - 7/29/2015 6:19:55 pm), 2490774=I\u2019m considering Granderson as a CF now because the injury effectively ended the Yankees\u2019 experiment of swapping him with Brett Gardner.\u00a0 Granderson was very good in CF in 2010 for the Yankees, but has followed that up with a below average season and then a pretty bad season.\u00a0 He projects to be a below average defensive CF in 2013., 2467472=Granderson\u2019s 2013 projections expect him to recoup some of that lost average and OBP, and also expect him to hit fewer homers.\u00a0 Granderson projected to be roughly equivalent to his 2012 in terms of value, even if the value came in different ways.\u00a0 Of course, this was all before Granderson got injured.\u00a0 It appears he\u2019ll miss 8-10 weeks recovering from a fracture in his foream., 259407=2014 Projections Phelps, 498473=It was a disappointing followup to a great 2011 where he led MLB in hits.\u00a0 Jeter claims to be healthy now and ready to go, but his health is probably a major concern this season., 316171=Kuroda\u2019s still a good bet to be a pretty good pitcher this year in what could be the last year of his career.\u00a0 He may also serve an important role in Masahiro Tanaka\u2019s transition to MLB, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his best pitch is a splitter much like Tanaka\u2019s.\u00a0 Because of that, I think it\u2019s fair to say Kuroda\u2019s value may be greater to the Yankees than just his contributions on the field in 2014, which should still be pretty valuable in their own right., 246816=Robertson had a very strong 2013, include the best strikeout to walk ratio of his career.\u00a0 Robertson has steadily decreased his walk rate, which was the major concern with him.\u00a0 His strike out rate has also been declining, but it has led to a more efficient Robertson.\u00a0 Over his first four seasons Robertson averaged 4.40 pitches per batter faced, over the last two seasons he\u2019s been at 3.98., 1487586=It\u2019s tough to gauge how good a player coming from the Rockies is, because of the way the park in Colorado plays.\u00a0 Nelson had a superficially strong season in 2012 (.301/.352/.458)but it was only good for a wRC+ of 105.\u00a0 For his career he\u2019s hit .279/.322/.416 which translates to a wRC+ of 86.\u00a0 Although he played 522 of his 604 minor league games at shortstop he\u2019s primarily played 3B in the majors with some time at 2B as well.\u00a0 His defensive numbers aren\u2019t very good as he\u2019s been around -17 by both defensive runs saved and ultimate zone rating in about 2/3 of a full season at 3B and -12 or so in less than 1/3 of a full season at 2B.\u00a0 He projects around a -18 defender at 3B over a full season, and a -25 defender at 2B., 2315780=Cano has really stepped up his game over the last four seasons, as he\u2019s hit .314/.365/.534 with an OPS+ of 136 and has finished in the top 10 in MVP voting for each of the last three seasons.\u00a0 By raw numbers, his 2012 was the best season of his career and not one that the projections saw coming., 111032=After a couple of big games in Texas Gardner is now slugging .455 this year and he has hit 13 home runs in 385 at bats this season after hitting 23 in 1932 prior at bats in MLB.\u00a0 If Gardner has roughly a .381 true talent SLG, here is the standard deviation of his slugging percentage., 2183094=Pettitte and Hughes have an interesting link, in that Hughes was drafted with the compensation pick that the Yankees got when Pettitte signed with the Houston Astros.\u00a0 They may also be linked in 2013 being their final seasons in pinstripes.\u00a0 In Pettitte\u2019s case, he may decide to retire again.\u00a0 In Hughes\u2019s case, the Yankees may decide to let him walk instead of adding dreaded dollars to the 2014 payroll.\u00a0 That decision will likely be influenced by how Ivan Nova, David Phelps, Michael Pineda and some of the other pitchers on the farm look., 2183766=It really wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see Pettitte pitch well enough that returning again in 2014 is a no-brainer.\u00a0 Of course the Yankees wouldn\u2019t be able to afford him.\u00a0, 428593=If you go by Jay Jaffe\u2019s JAWS Beltran has put together a Hall of Fame resume.\u00a0 His 67.5 career bWAR is 2.9 WAR behind the average of the 18 CFs that are in the Hall.\u00a0 His counting stats fall a bit short of the typical milestones (2228 hits, 358 HRs), but if he can stay healthy and productive over the next three seasons he could end up over 2600 hits and 400 HRs.\u00a0, 2438808=None of the projections expected Granderson to hit 40 HRs again, but he did.\u00a0 Unfortunately he also struck out about 44 more times than he projected to on a rate basis and had 21 fewer non-HR hits, dropping his average to a career-low .232 and his OBP to a career-low .319.\u00a0 Whereas Granderson likely figured into the Yankees long-term plans after 2011, 2012 essentially removed him from them., 258843=Phelps\u2019s 4.98 ERA in 2013 is a bit misleading, as nine of the 48 runs he allowed came in one brutal start in Baltimore.\u00a0 Phelps saw time as a starter and reliever and his FIP of 3.81 was a better indicator of how he pitched for the most part., 2045698=With all the disclaimers out of the way, on to the projected standings.\u00a0 These are the combined results for all five projection systems.\u00a0 The standings are rounded to the nearest win so if the total W-L doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to 2430-2430 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why., 1470837=The Yankees have gotten 492 PA out of their outfield in 38 games which means they should have about 1600 over the rest of the season.\u00a0 I think they\u2019ll figure out a way to get everyone at least 300 PA, with the ones who perform better earning more., 625845=Steamer has CC projected for 192 innings of 4.22 RA.\u00a0 CAIRO has him at 207 innings of 4.33.\u00a0 For every 0.40 points of RA at those innings total, you can add a win or so this projection.\u00a0 If Sabathia can replicate his RA of 3.62 from 2009-2012, then he\u2019d be about 1.5 wins better than projected.\u00a0 And that goes up if he can pitch more innings as well., 1856445=MLB PA: 491, 6.3% BB, 10.4% K miLB: PA: 2961, 5.5% BB, 12.8% K, 586118=In a vacuum, this is a good move.\u00a0 In the context of the Yankees as presently constituted, it barely moves the needle.\u00a0 They still have a lot of holes to plug, and if they are going to try and do that while sticking to their $189M payroll limit this year, they probably aren\u2019t going to be a contender in 2014.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "For a happy medium, we can look at the team\u2019s component stats on offense and on defense and see if the offensive events to this point line up with the actual results on the field.\u00a0 To do this, I\u2019ll use my favorite basic run estimator, linear weights batting runs.\u00a0 We can use the team\u2019s offensive stats, and the offensive stats of the opposing batters to calculate a revised context-neutral version of their runs scored and runs allowed which will smooth out some of the anomalies that can occur over a set of games that may give a misleading picture of how good or bad a team actually is. A more advanced version of luck would take a look at the players\u2019 individual performances compared to their projections and trying to determine which performances are fluky and/or unsustainable.\u00a0 If the team has more players playing over their heads than players who are not, you\u2019d expect them to play worse going forward. That\u2019s worth looking at at some point, but I think a month into the season is too soon to try and make much use of that. There are few different ways that a team\u2019s actual results could be skewed by that dreaded sabermetric concept of luck.\u00a0 There\u2019s the most basic statistical version of luck in baseball, where a team\u2019s run differential does not support their actual record.\u00a0 In the case of the Yankees to this point their 124 runs scored and 93 runs allowed has given them",
