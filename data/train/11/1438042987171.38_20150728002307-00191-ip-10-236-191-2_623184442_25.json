However, most demanding games of 2013 will run fluently only in low detail settings., 11039=The improved feature set now includes\u00a0support for up to 4 active displays. Furthermore, high resolution monitors of\u00a0up to 3840 x 2160 pixels can now be connected using DisplayPort 1.2 or HDMI 1.4a\u00a0if available. HD-Audio codecs, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD, can be\u00a0transmitted via bitstream mode through the HDMI port. However, as most laptops\u00a0will feature Optimus, the integrated GPU will likely have direct control over\u00a0the display ports and may limit the feature set available by the Nvidia Kepler\u00a0cards.\u00a0Please note: The K610M does not supprt 3D Vision Pro., 13377=The\u00a0NVIDIA Quadro K610M\u00a0is a DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.3 compatible graphics card for mobile workstations. It is a Kepler-based GPU built on the GK107 chip with 192 out of 384 shader cores activated and is manufactured in 28nm at TSMC. The Quadro K610M is built for the Intel Shark Bay generation (Haswell) and is a successor to the\u00a0Quadro K500M\u00a0(Chief River platform). As a new feature, PCIe 3.0 is supported for the first time. The K610M usually comes with 1 GB GDDR5 VRAM clocked at 650 MHz (2600 MHz effective, 20.8 GB/s).\u00a0}",
