In another embodiment, the coating is prepared from a powder coating composition. Powder coating compositions are well known in the art and are discussed in Organic Coatings: Science and Technology, Vol. II, Z. W. Wicks, Jr., F. N. Jones, and S. P. Pappas, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, Chap 31. A binder for a powder coating composition such as a thermosetting powder coating composition contains a first component, typically referred to as a primary resin and a second component, typically referred to as a hardener. Suitable binders include epoxy binders crosslinked with a material selected from dicyandiamide, modified dicyandiamide, and trimellitic anhydride hardeners; polyester binders containing hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups, which are crosslinked with a material selected from triglycidyl isocyanurate, tetra(2-hydroxyalkyl)bisamide, blocked aliphatic isocyanates, and tetramethoxymethylglycoluril hardeners; acrylic binders containing epoxy groups which are crosslinked with dicarboxylic acids; and acrylic binders containing hydroxyl groups which are crosslinked with blocked isocyanates., 181218=To the flask was added 1800 g deionized water, which was then heated to a temperature of 80\ufffd C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. A mixture of 11.8 g sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in 10 g deionized water was added to the flask followed by a mixture of 6.0 g sodium persulfate in 60 g deionized water.

To the flask was added 1100 g deionized water. The deionized water was heated to a temperature of 85\ufffd C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. A mixture of 11.6 g sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) (28% solids) in 10 g deionized water was added to the flask, followed by a mixture of 3.8 g sodium carbonate in 50 g deionized water. These additions were immediately followed by the addition of a solution of 3.9 g sodium persulfate in 50 g deionized water.

After the 30 minutes, the feed rate was increased to 12 grams/minute. When the ME feed was complete, the reaction was held at a temperature of 85\ufffd C. for a period of 15 minutes and then the contents of the flask was cooled to room temperature and filtered to remove any coagulum.
