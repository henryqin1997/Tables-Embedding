    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Bethel is roughly 36,000 a year currently which makes it expensive, but there are relatively good academic scholarships available as well as work study. Am enjoying being here Bethel is a beautiful campus in Arden Hills right by St. Paul and very close to Rose dale Mall. It is by various restaurants as well as it allows for students to explore the cities. The academic buildings are all connected which is nice for winter walking to class and the Christian atmosphere is, in my opinion, one of the strongest in MN. Am learning a lot As Bethel is a small school there are many opportunities for students to have close interaction and communication with their professors. Teachers notice when a student is not in class and the classes, such as the Humanities program is very well renowned. Bethel has a top rated nursing program as well as is very strong in their science departments.
