There are 12 biographical regions: 65 to 2 million years ago Tertiary Period 145 - 65 million years ago Cretaceous Period 208 to 145 million years ago Jurassic Period 245 to 208 million years ago Triasic Period 362 to 270 million years ago Carboniferous Period 508 to 362 million years ago Devonian Period 570 to 510 million years ago Cambrian Period Interactions between these plates result in sea floor spreading, earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain formation. There are 5 types of tectonic movement: mid-ocean ridge, oceanic plate meeting (example - Mt. Pinatubo), diving plates (example - Andean Mountains), sliding plates (example - San Andreas Fault), and colliding plates (example - The Alps). The shifting of these plates is such that there are 7 major periods of continental drift: The only ocean only plate is the Pacific Plate. Because of the ocean-continental interactions resulting in potential volcanism, the area surrounding the Pacific Plate is called the Ring of Fire. This is",
