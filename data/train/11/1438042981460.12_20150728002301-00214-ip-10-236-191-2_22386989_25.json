However, I'd definitely go with Matsui in 2002 due to the advantage in walks., 41294=Hideki Matsui, of 2002, 12641=Wally Yonamine, of 1954, 9127=Tetsuharu Kawakami, 1b 1951, 31240=Seitzer walked more and had a better slugging percentage, and probably was also worth more defensively due to his work at third. I'd take him over Arai in 1987., 3059=When I wrote the article comparing top seasons of NPB's candidates for Cooperstown to their major league contemporaries, I decided to take the cream of the crop of the seasons of other hitters in Japan and do essentially the same thing for them. The methods for determining similarity are identical to the other article, but in this case the standards are based on NPB performance: 50 HR, a Triple Crown, or a .360 or better average. I also limited this to seasons after 1945, as NPB seasons before then could be quite short, plus NPB was a startup league and/or was playing during the total war of World War II, when many top athletes were serving their countries., 21557=Boomer Wells, 1b 1984, 46619=Alex Cabrera, 1b 2003, 18034=Hideji Kato, 1b 1979, 15941=Davis played more, stole more bases, and hit more homers. The slugging percentages of the two are close because Bloomfield played less and had a lot more triples. Bloomfield played a demanding defensive position in second base, while Davis was an outfielder/third baseman. The question of which one was better in 1962 comes down to how good Bloomfield was defensively., 10835=Hiroshi Oshita, of 1951, 39481=Tuffy Rhodes, of 2001, 31408=Warren Cromartie, of 1989, 19809=Kenichi Yazawa, 1b-of 1980, 27832=Warren Cromartie, of 1986, 12420=Oshita was awfully good in 1951, and he'd have to be to even be considered a decent match for Musial. That said, Musial was clearly better. Musial played more, had a higher average, walked more and had more power., 39130=It's hard to get a good match for Ichiro in 2000, and Stynes is the one the method comes up with. He's as good as anybody. He played even less than Ichiro and didn't steal or walk as often and had a lower average. However, he did have more power. Ichiro's excellent defensive skills seal the deal, as Stynes can't make up much ground that way., 35306=Bobby Rose, 2b 1999, 7386=Fumio Fujimura, 3b 1950, 35047=This is the year ended by strike in the majors. Lofton probably is better defensively at this point, but, if not, he's not going to concede much ground. Lofton has more power and a better on base percentage, and that's why I'd take his season in 1994., 25844=Randy Bass, 1b 1986, 50113=Nobuhiko Matsunaka, 1b 2004, 51713=Matsunaka won a Triple Crown in the Pacific League in 2004. Matsunaka's edge of 30 walks is significant, but Guerrero has more steals and power to balance the scales. I think that Vlad's defense gives him the nod, but not by much., 16317=Yoshinori Hirose, of 1964, 27418=This is Bass' second NPB Triple Crown year. Mattingly played more, and may deserve some consideration because his home park of Yankee Stadium may have hurt him overall. However, Bass had a higher average, walked 40 more times, and had a better slugging percentage. I think Bass had the better year in 1986, though only a fool would have traded Mattingly even up for Bass since Bass was about 7 years older., 14351=Jack Bloomfield, 2b 1962, 37322=Ichiro, of 2000, 43044=Alex Cabrera, 1b 2002, 48413=Michihiro Ogasawara, 3b 2003, 8971=Fujimura played more and walked more while playing just as demanding a defensive position. As good as Doby was in 1950, I think Fujimura was better.}",
