You will no longer feel alone with your intelligence, in fact you will now be just one of the 'normal' kids, and it\u2019s quite nice. Don\u2019t be fooled, we are not mere nerds playing Dungeons & Dragons on the weekend, although it\u2019s there if you want to, we have parties, movie nights, dances, and lots of other activities.
