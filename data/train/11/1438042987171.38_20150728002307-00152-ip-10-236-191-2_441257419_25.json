            "EMISSION REDUCTION RETROFIT METHOD AND KIT FOR EMD TWO-CYCLE DIESEL ENGINES - A method for retrofitting an existing EMD 567/645 two-cycle diesel engine to reduce exhaust emissions includes the steps of removing mechanical fuel injectors and associated components and installing of electronic unit fuel injectors and associated components. Also disclosed is a kit for retrofitting an existing EMD 567/645 two-cycle diesel engine to reduce exhaust emissions.",
            "SPEED AND POSITION SENSING DEVICE FOR EMD TWO-CYCLE DIESEL ENGINES - A device is disclosed for sensing the speed of an EMD 567/645/710 two-cycle diesel engine having a crankcase, electronic fuel injectors and an electronic control system for controlling the electronic fuel injectors. The device includes a spline shaft sized for insertion into the crankcase of the engine so that the spline shaft rotates with the engine, a gear operably secured to the spline shaft to rotate with the spline shaft and sized to rotate with the engine in a 1:1 ratio, and at least one electronic sensor located adjacent the gear to sense rotation of the gear. The at least one electronic sensor is connectable to the electronic control system to provide electronic signals to the electronic control system for determining when to inject fuel with the electronic fuel injectors. Also disclosed is a method for retrofitting the engine and a kit for retrofitting the engine.",

The fabrication of multi-functional articles using the additive deposition of gradient alloys represents a paradigm shift from the traditional way that metal alloys and metal/metal alloy parts are fabricated. Since a gradient alloy that transitions from one metal to a different metal cannot be fabricated through any conventional metallurgy techniques, the technique presents many applications. Moreover, the embodiments described identify a broad range of properties and applications. 20150044084 Published Description Patent application number Jerry L. Mulder, La Crescenta, CA US 06-28-2012 Systems and Methods for Creating and Using a Research Map - Systems and methods create a graphical representation of a research map that allows performance of search functions using the nodes of the graphical representation. In one implementation, a system includes a processor and a memory. The memory stores instructions that cause the processor to receive a query for searching a document repository and run the query in the document repository. The processor stores the results of the query and the query as a root node in a research tree. The processor receives a filter for the results of the query. The processor stores the filter and the result list for the filter as a filter node connected to the root node of",

The table apparatus includes a support assembly, a surface assembly and an adjustment assembly. The adjustment assembly allows for the movement of a work surface between a first bottom position and a second top position while remaining in the same, preferably, horizontal, orientation throughout the movement thereof. Additionally, the work surface is permitted to rotate about an axis that is perpendicular to the work surface. A secondary work surface is provided, which, when properly set to the same height, cooperates with the work surface to provide a matingly engaged configuration which allows for a substantially continuous joined work surface, while allowing for rotation of the work surface about an axis that is perpendicular to the work surface. 04-17-2014 Nicholas D.
