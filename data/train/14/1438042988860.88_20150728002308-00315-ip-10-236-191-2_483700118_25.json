Hullett and Robert M. Newman in \u201cQueueing Protocol\u201d. U.S. Pat. No. 4,922,244, May 1, 1990) and with staged queueing (e.g. described by Zigmantas L. Budrikls, Antonio Cantoni, and John L. Hullett in \u201cDistributed Queue Dual Tree Digital Network\u201d (DQDT), AIPO PCT/AU94/00XXX, Jun. 30, 1994). Whereas in these antecedents service is in each case by an implicit single server, in the method described here it is by explicit multiple dedicated servers. But similar to the antecedents, the service is regular FIFO with limited participation in the queues, and backpressure control ensuring loss-free, minimum latency transfer., 27227=An example of an ATM switch which can support Class I connections is the Prelude switch of France Telecom CNET (e.g. J.-P. Coudreuse and M. Servel \u201cPrelude\u2014an asynchronous time-division switched network\u201d.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, for a given RTD, the minimum buffer required is larger by at least a factor of two with the GFC procedure at UNI 16 than with the proposed procedure at NNI 20. A buffer requirement equal to RTD is in fact the smallest possible, consistent with controlled flow and 100 per cent link utilization. Even more important than the lesser buffer requirement, is the fact that it is not directly tied to the physical delay on the link, but to a chosen parameter. This gives the freedom to trade buffer requirement against percentage of link capacity made available to controlled traffic. That may be of considerable practical advantage when dealing with very long, e.g. transoceanic, links. With the GFC procedures at UNI 16, the required minimum buffer at the controlling end is (T+GO_VALUE+RTD), where T is threshold fill of the buffer above which the controlling end sends to the controlled end NULLs instead of SETs, and RTD is again the round-trip delay on the link expressed in number of cells. To make 100 per cent of link capacity available to controlled traffic, the sum (T+GO_VALUE) must be at least equal to RTD. With a smaller value, the available percentage of link capacity is ((T+GO_VALUE)/RTD)\ufffd100. The GO_VALUE in itself is not required to be of any size larger than unity which is the default value specified for it by the Recommendation. With the GFC procedure proposed",
