The MonitorManager 1102 initializes the HWaccess module 1116 to start the initialization function. Subsequently, the MonitorManager 1102 obtains information about a monitored device and uses an IP address assigned to the monitored device to communicate with the monitored device. The MonitorManager 1102 accesses DeviceODBC 1104 to obtain configuration information of the monitored device. The configuration information returned to the MonitorManager 1102 includes, for example, an IP address of the monitored device, parameter names and associated values for each protocol, and vendor/manufacturer and model information of the monitored device. Once the IP address is obtained, the MonitorManager 1102 sets the IP address, parameter names and associated values for each protocol, to create a software object based on class structure of the Device module 1110 through the CDeviceFactory class 1302 of FIG. 35. When the device software object is successfully created, the HWaccess module 1116 is used to obtain Vendor, Model, and Unique ID from the monitored device to be stored in the created device software object.}",

An input controller 372 has connected thereto a keyboard 374 and a mouse 376. There is a serial interface 378 connected to a serial device 380. Additionally, a parallel interface 382 is connected to a parallel device 384, a universal serial bus (USB) interface 386 is connected to a universal serial bus device 388, and also there is an IEEE 1394 device 400, commonly referred to as a fire wire device, connected to an IEEE 1394 interface 398. A system bus 390 connects the various elements of the computer 360. A disk controller 396 is connected to a floppy disk drive 394 and a hard disk drive 392. A communication controller 406 allows the computer 360 to communicate with other computers (e.g., by sending e-mail messages) over a network 404. An I/O (Input/Output) controller 408 is connected to a printer 410 and a hard disk 412, for example using a SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) bus. There is also a display controller 416 connected to a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) 414, although any other type of display may be used including a liquid crystal display, a light emitting diode display, a plasma display, etc., 122701=Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) related communication is described, for example, in the book \u201cTCP/IP Illustrated,\u201d Vol. 1, The Protocols, by W.

The method of the FirstHTTPImplementation package uses the first occurrence of the key word to locate the desired information, which might be incorrect for some of the desired information., 258043=As discussed above, status information can be obtained by SNMP from the network device even if the vendor and model are not obtained or supported. As long as the network device supports SNMP and can be accessed by SNMP, information can be obtained from the Management Information Base (MIB) of the network device. In step 3702, if the network device cannot be accessed through SNMP, then the SNMP protocol may be removed from the protocol parameter map 1400 in step 3704. However, if the network device can be accessed through SNMP, then the SNMP protocol remains in the protocol parameter map 1400 whether or not the vendor or model is obtained and supported. Network devices that support SNMP provide a MIB so that the remote system can always obtain information from the devices. However, the type and number of information that can be obtained from the network device depends upon if the vendor and model are obtained and supported. More information can be obtained from the network device by SNMP is the vendor and model are obtained and known. If the vendor and model cannot be obtained, SNMP is still able to obtain information that all devices can provide, such as the system description or the time the system has been running. SNMP can be used to obtain information from the network device under the three conditions: (1) vendor and model are supported, (2) vendor supported but model not supported, and (3) vendor and model are not supported. HTTP and FTP do not have the characteristics as SNMP. Where SNMP has a standard MIB that all network devices can follow so that information can be obtained, web pages and FTP files will vary among network devices of different vendors and models. There is no standard for web pages and FTP files which network devices follow to obtain information., 67457=29. Ser. No. 10/927,158, filed Aug. 27, 2004;, 62808=6. Ser.

The function returns true if there is data returned, false if there is no more data., 180161=When the value, such as, for example, model name of the monitored device, is found within the same data line of the key (Product Name), the m_nPosition field is \u201c0.\u201d m_sDelimiter 1210 indicates a specific delimiter used to extract the value associated with the key. The SKeyValueInfo data structure indicates how to extract the value information from information received from a monitored device in an HTML format., 67535=30. Ser. No. 10/927,257, filed Aug. 27, 2004; and, 166825=Once the IP address of a monitored device is obtained, the IP address is used by the monitoring system to contact the monitored device to obtain information such as, manufacturer (vendor) and model information. Some of the functions executed by the monitoring system 1000 include:, 170098=Before this function is called, the calling function is preferred not to replace the vendor and model entries if obtain functions return a null string. This function updates the device information database of the current record in the DeviceODBC 1104. This function is most efficient when the ObtainConfig below is called initially. First, this function checks if the IP address is the same at the DeviceODBC 1104. If the IP address fields are not the same, the record with the correct IP address is obtained from the database. Then, the other fields are copied and the record is updated., 132511=A local connection interface 171 is a connection through local ports such as RS232, the parallel printer port, USB, and IEEE 1394. FireWire (IEEE 1394) is described in Wickelgren, I., \u201cThe Facts About \u201cFireWire\u201d, IEEE Spectrum, April 1997, Vol. 34, Number 4, pp. 19-25, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
