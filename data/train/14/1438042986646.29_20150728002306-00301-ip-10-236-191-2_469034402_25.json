Instead, the corrects results arc given in Table 9, which is the same as Table 7, and are obtained by going back to the 2D (Currency, Issuer) cube and performing a netting operation by issuer, analogous to the operation resulting in Table 6. Then, a netting operation is performed on the MTMs, and a grossing operation is performed on the Exposures., 33011=This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, although VaR is identified as a measure of risk used by financial institutions for quantitative assessment and comparison purposes, the present invention is applicable to other non-linear measures of risk assessment and management. While the present invention has been described with respect to what is presently considered to be the preferred embodiment(s), it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s). To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions. The results in Table 20 are the same as those in Table 7 but were obtained in a generic manner. Through the use of multi-layered and multi-dimensional cubes, context independent and heterogeneous aggregations are possible. Whereas conventional aggregation schemes result in the loss of information as dimensions are eliminated by projections, the data analysis method of the present invention preserves all",
