            "After visiting and touring the place several times safety looks good. The security guard stops you at a big gate and writes down your plates and ask you all of these questions before you can get on campus.",
            "There are at least 7 Greek Organizations on campus so the variety is great.",
            "There are lots of academic organizations depending on your major, athletic organizations, and surprisingly a a lot of ministry organizations to pick from. Then you have HIV education clubs, Drama, Women's Empowerment, plus a Gentleman's club and an international student club",
            "HT is an HBCU but it's a diverse campus and being in Austin there are people from every race and walk of life.",
            "HT has the usual campus gatherings but the also have some unusal ones like, an annual masked ball, and The Great American Smokeout Day where they feed you lots of food. Then there's Poetry on the Patio, Hispanic and African American months, plus Constitution Day and the list goes on.",
            "Tuition is expensive, but they offer a lot of grants and send out scholarship emails all the time so that helped a lot. Also, the financing was easy to understand and to get. Plus, the W.E.B Dubois honors program sounds like a good program and the alumi get a lot perks in the community.",
            "I've been getting lots of HT webmail already telling me about lots of events and clubs that I can sign up for. Plus, with the campus being in the middle of downtown Austin, I think I'll have plenty to keep me busy.",
            "I've eaten in the cafeteria several times now and was pleased with the variety and taste of the food. As well as the layout.",
            "The guys dorm is being overhauled so I haven't seen them yet, but other students tell me that the improvements are great and include free cable and free laudromats.",
            "From everyone I've spoken to, HT staff do everything and I do mean everything on their end to make sure students do well in courses regardless of their difficulty. Current students told me, professors walk up to you on campus and ask if you need more help without making you stupid.",
            "Huston Tillotson is a small university on a quiet hilltop in a big city with much bigger universities. It can easily get overlooked so be sure to take the time to visit and talk with staff before you decide to attend. If you decide to go, be sure and attend early registration!!! I went in, got registered last month and found out I'm exempt from testing so I'll be able to relax and get acclimated without a lot of hassle.",
            "Small in size but big in style and concentration. I've been there 3 times preparing for registration and the staff recognizes me already! Everyone is courteous and helpful too."

    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining I was told by upperclassmen that the food will get worse as the year progresses, but it has been 5 weeks so far and I has failed to get worse. Dorm Life I feel the dorms are excellent to say they haven't been renovated since they were built. Academic Rigor I'm a freshman, so maybe that is why I don't feel the work is hard yet, but I do feel it is fast paced. Tips for prospective students Don't get trapped in unnecessary drama. Put your work before your social status. It is always good to have upperclassman friends. I suggest Your keep extra snacks around your room.
