            "Campus Public Safety is available 24/7 and can always be reached when called and seen driving around campus. There is also the blue emergency light system all throughout campus.",
            "Champlain does not have Greek houses, fraternities, or sororities.",
            "There are plenty of clubs and new ones are starting all the time. There's everything from a car club to a paddle board club to an improv group to an equestrian club. Definitely something for everyone.",
            "Writing majors, game programming or design majors, business majors, career and future oriented students.",
            "Humans vs Zombies is an event that happens every year that I was particularly struck by as being unusual. That's all I'll say about it.",
            "Champlain does accept transfer credits which can potentially allow a would be freshman to transfer in as a sophomore and spend three years in college instead of four.",
            "The RAs plan at least one event each month for the dorm and there are usually social events on campus every weekend. There are plenty of clubs to join as well. You can also walk right down to Church Street for food, shopping, or just hanging out. There is a movie theater within walking distance. Champlain students also get free rides on the public transportation.",
            "The dining hall can get a little crowded at times but they do have great food options. There are gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options always. Cooks are friendly and tend to know you as an individual - even after only a couple of visits. Dining hall is opened just about all day during the week and even reopens for late night later in the evening but has limited hours during the weekend so it is easy to miss dinner. Always plenty of dessert options as well.",
            "Dorms are Victorian era mansions for the most part. Some do not have air conditioning though all have cable, wi-fi, and heating. All dorms are smoke and substance free - this is a dry campus. RAs and PAs are real friendly and so are the other students. Some dorms don't have common rooms so it is a bit difficult to get to know your housemates, especially if there isn't a social person on your floor. A great experience to have.",
            "The programs are quite rigorous but the workload is very doable so long as you know how to manage your time.",
            "Visit the campus before making a decision. The dorms are Victorian era mansions and may not be for everyone. Really do your research and apply early, some programs require a portfolio submission to get in. Apply with plenty of time to complete that. Be aware of deadlines.",
            "A small, beautiful campus overlooking Lake Champlain. Easy walk down to downtown Burlington and the waterfront. Programs tailored for career opportunities after graduation."

Whenever people said that I'd always think they were being paid but honestly it's true. It's only been one year but I've improved a lot since I came here.

If your interested in studying something like business, I would steer you towards a school like UVM. You'll save money and still be in Burlington, which is unique city and a pretty cool place to live. Tips for prospective students Visit the school first. Eat",
