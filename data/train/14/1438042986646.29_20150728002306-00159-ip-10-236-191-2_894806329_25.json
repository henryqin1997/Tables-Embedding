    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Sure this school is expensive, but what school isn't these days. For a great education that will take you places in this growing economy, Roger Williams is a great choice for your dollar. All the hard work and effort that is put into the school is shown, you never feel like your not getting what you deserve for what you pay. Am enjoying being here I love the friendly atmosphere, and the people. From orientation on i have been able to make great friends. I love walking to class and watching people play football or frisbee in the quad. Students are all dedicated to the school and so involved, it really is a family away from home! You will never feel left out! Am learning a lot Ever since going to Roger Williams i learned more about my major alone then i ever could, with the great one on one support from faculty, and my wonderful advisor. It has really opened my eyes life around me in a positive way. Going into the real world is not so bad when you are going to roger William's. You learn not only about your area of study, but you also learn alot about yourself.",
