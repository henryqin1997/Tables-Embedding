At the outset, a stock HTTP server (e.g., Apache server) is invoked with an online request (e.g., HTML request), such as a URL from a (browser) client, for retrieving a target image (e.g., from an image repository), as indicated at step 601. This HTTP invocation (online request) from the client includes an HTTP GET command, which comprises a URL plus headers (including a header identifying client browser type). The URL itself may comprise a typical Web-based URL, for example specifying a location and accompanying name/value pairs. As the client invokes the HTTP server directly, the HTTP server may be thought of as the front end of the system. A plug-in module (eSwitch\u2122 handler) is used to fork the incoming request, as indicated at step 602. Now, the eSwitch\u2122 handler may examine the HTTP GET headers to identify the browser client, as indicated at step 603, and from this identification, the handler may infer the type or identity of the client device (i.e., device type). During operation of the step, the handler consults a device database to match the headers with an appropriate device, for example, as described in the above-referenced commonly owned application Ser. No. 09/588,875, filed Jun. 6, 2000, and application Ser. No. 10/010,616, filed Nov. 8, 2001.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention is described in some detail with specific reference to a single-preferred embodiment and certain alternatives, there is no intent to limit the invention to that particular embodiment or those specific alternatives. For instance, examples have been presented which focus on \u201cdisplaying\u201d images at client devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other client-side outputting or rendering, such as printing, may benefit from application of the present invention. Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that modifications may be made to the preferred embodiment without departing from the teachings of the present invention. . For example, if the fully rendered image is transformed to JPEG, the resulting JPEG file is not acceptable as the final output if the file exceeds the maximum specified file size. Therefore, the process may iterate, including \u201cremapping\u201d the Viewport and re-rendering the image (if necessary), to generate a final image file that complies with the constraints applicable to the target client. Internally, the File Size Control block estimates a different set of (control) parameters (e.g., reducing Viewport size, bit depth, JPEG quality, or the like) to get a new file size. For example, if the file size of the transformed candidate image is too large, the method may reset the Viewport with a smaller screen size for generating a transformed candidate image with a smaller file size.
