            "Campus Safety is great and reliable. Emergency phone booths available across campus and phone number for security office available.",
            "Unlike most schools, Augustana's sororities and fraternities are not national and are not recognized by other schools (with the exception of a few national service based frats). However, Greek Life is full and thriving, pledging occurs in the spring, and 60% of Augustana students are involved in Greek Life.",
            "Many student based organizations and clubs, and if a student has an interest they are free to start their own club as well. Student organizations based on majors, ethnicity, religion, and just common interests.",
            "Students who want to experience college with a unique perspective on academics and the arts, a perspective that's more than college football and partying.",
            "The famous Slough Path, a lovely path along a pond that surrounded by trees and is the most beautiful place on campus during the fall.",
            "Although a bit pricey, Augustana offers a great deal in helping out financially and has numerous scholarships available. The cost of attending comes out to be about the same after scholarships and financial help is applied as a state university.",
            "Student clubs, club sports, recreational sports, free movies and social events on campus",
            "2 cafeterias (one on upper campus one on lower campus), which provide great meals and variety throughout the week.",
            "Five dorm buildings total, all ranging from a typical 2-person dorm to a 3-person style suite. Provided with air conditioning and heat, showers as well.",
            "Excellent academic classes available, along with plenty of honors and advanced placement courses.",
            "Come with an open mind, and don't be afraid to try new things.",
            "A small, privet, liberal arts college with a variety of interesting classes that both challenge and excite the mind. Various programs and majors are available, as well as one of the top education programs around. Small campus that's perfect walking distance and numerous clubs and extracurricular activities to get involved in."

The class sizes are small so if you don't understand something it's easy to ask the teacher within the class so that your question can be clarified and possibly help someone else.
