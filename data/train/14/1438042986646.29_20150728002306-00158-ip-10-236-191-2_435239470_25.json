            "NETWORK WITH DISTRIBUTED SHARED MEMORY - A computer network with distributed shared memory, including a clustered memory cache aggregated from and comprised of physical memory locations on a plurality of physically distinct computing systems. The clustered memory cache is accessible by a plurality of clients on the computer network and is configured to perform page caching of data items accessed by the clients. The network also includes a policy engine operatively coupled with the clustered memory cache, where the policy engine is configured to control where data items are cached in the clustered memory cache.",
            "NETWORK WITH DISTRIBUTED SHARED MEMORY - A computer network with distributed shared memory, including a clustered memory cache aggregated from and comprised of physical memory locations on a plurality of physically distinct computing systems. The network also includes a plurality of local cache managers, each of which are associated with a different portion of the clustered memory cache, and a metadata service operatively coupled with the local cache managers. Also, a plurality of clients are operatively coupled with the metadata service and the local cache managers. In response to a request issuing from any of the clients for a data item present in the clustered memory cache, the metadata service is configured to respond with identification of the local cache manager associated with the portion of the clustered memory cache containing such data item.",

Gross, Portland, OR US 02-24-2011 DENTAL FLOSSER - A dental flosser includes a housing having a pair of arms spaced apart to define a gap therebetween, a supply core rotatably coupled to the body, a wind-up spool rotatably coupled to the body for rotation in a single direction with respect to the body, a pawl movable between an engaged position that restricts rotation of the supply core with respect to the body assembly, and a disengaged position that allows the supply core to rotate with respect to the body. The flosser also includes an actuator operatively coupled to the pawl and the take-up spool. The actuator is operable to move the pawl from the engaged position to the disengaged position and to rotate the take-up spool in the first direction. 20110041870 Published Description Patent application number Jason Gross, Chicago, IL US 09-29-2011 Cloud computing enabled robust initialization and recovery of it services - A system and a method for provisioning of Information Technology (IT) services to a plurality of computers is provided. The system includes a network and transport device and local IT resources. The network and transport device has internet connectivity via a controlled switching interface. One or more of the computers are coupled to the network and transport device via the controlled switching interface. The local IT resources are also coupled to the one or more computers and include data storage",
