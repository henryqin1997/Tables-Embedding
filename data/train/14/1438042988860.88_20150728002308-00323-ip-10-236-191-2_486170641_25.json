    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64701=This film also includes a sealant layer 28 constructed of 1) a bulk polyolefin that is thermally stable at sterilization temperatures, yet melts below the outside layer melting temperature; such polymers are preferably polypropylene-ethylene copolymers, such as Z9450 from Fina Oil and Chemical; and 2) a thermoplastic elastomer which produces a more flexible and free radical resistant sealant layer and gives the sealant layer two melt points with the elastomer having the lower value; such polymers preferably are styrene-ethylene-butene-styrene block copolymers such as Kraton G-1652 from Shell Oil and Chemical. The sealant layer preferably has a thickness of from about 1.28 mils to about 1.92 mils, e.g., 1.60 mils., 119593=Irganox\ufffd 1076, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, and 25-Crown-5 in the lipid emulsion samples were at levels below the estimated detection limits of the method, 0.57 \u03bcg/mL, 0.44 \u03bcg/mL and 0.24 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. 1,2-Bis (sec-butoxycarboxy) ethane (SBCE) and 2,6-di-t-butyle-4-methylphenol (BHT) were detected in the samples at levels near the estimated detection limits of 0.28 \u03bcg/mL and 0.095 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. There were no apparent differences in the extractive levels due to the length of sterilization. Additionally, no non-targeted extractives were seen in a total ion chromatogram of an extract of 20% lipid emulsion stored in a test article., 147870=The study provided preliminary data on the accumulation of target extractives in retorted 20% lipid emulsion. 2-EHA, Irganox\ufffd 1076 and 25-Crown-5 in the lipid emulsion samples were at levels below the detection limit of the methodology. SBCE and BHT were detected in the samples at levels near the detection limits. There were no apparent differences in the extractive levels due to the length of sterilization. Additionally, no non-targeted extractives were seen in the total ion chromatograms of the extracts of the 20% lipid emulsion., 186059=The purified extracts from the lipid emulsion mixture from the containers, control article and spiked controls were assayed for Irganox\ufffd 1010, Irganox\ufffd 1076 and A0330 antioxidants by high temperature GC and for oligomeric propylene and ethylene vinyl acetate by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with ultraviolet (UV) and refractive index (RI) detection. The high temperature GC and gel permeation chromatography conditions are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively., 164499=Responses for the target extractives were detected at each spike level with the exception of the 0.58 \u03bcg/mL 2-EHA spike and the Irganox\ufffd 1076. The lower sensitivity for 2-EHA results in a corresponding higher detection limit for 2-EHA. No Irganox\ufffd 1076 was observed in the GC/MS analysis of the spiked lipid control solutions of the standard solutions which were used to spike the control lipid emulsion. This result indicates that the GC/MS conditions which were utilized may have not been suitable for detecting Irganox\ufffd 1076. In an earlier study, Irganox\ufffd 1076 was not detected in samples of 20% lipid emulsion stored and retorted in containers prepared from the film at a detection limit of 0.57 \u03bcg/mL., 186564=The levels of the Irganox\ufffd 1010, Irganox\ufffd 1076 and A0330 antioxidants in the product could not be determined in aliquots from the containers units due to the presence of residual lipid emulsion in the extracts interfering with the detection. In the extracts of the samples, no oligomeric propylene or ethylene vinyl acetate was observed. A detection limit for the oligomeric propylene or ethylene vinyl acetate was calculated at three times the signal to noise ration in the GPC/RI chromatogram. The detection limit determined for the oligomeric propylene and ethylene vinyl acetate is 5.6 \u03bcg/mL., 120858=In other studies, the levels of target extractives were determined. The extractive levels in the lipid emulsion solutions were determined by extracting the lipid emulsion and analyzing by gas chromatography with selected ion mass spectrometry. The intent of this study was to provide preliminary information on the accumulation of 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 1,2-bis (sec-butoxycarboxy) ethane (SBCE), 2,6-di-t-butyle-4-methylphenol (BHT), 25-crown-5 ether and Irganox\ufffd 1076 in 20% lipid emulsion retorted in containers. Additionally, a sample extract was analyzed by gas chromatography with total ion mass spectrometry., 158156=A 5.0-mL aliquot of the lipid emulsion sample and of the 4% lipid emulsion control were transferred into 125-mL reparatory funnels containing 15 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. A 1.0-mL, volumetrically pipetted, aliquot of a 30.3 mg/mL di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) internal standard solution, 20 mL of methanol and 40 mL of methylene chloride were added. The samples were extracted and the methylene chloride was collected in a 200-mL Zymar Turbo Vap\ufffd collection tube. The samples were then extracted with a second 40-mL portion of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride fractions were pooled, concentrated to approximately 1 mL under a stream of N2 and analyzed by the GC/MS-SIM system listed in Table 4., 61119=Preferably, peelable seals 18 and 20 are provided between the chambers 12 and 14 and 14 and 16 respectively. Such a peelable seal is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/033,233 filed on Mar. 16, 1993 entitled \u201cPEELABLE SEAL AND CONTAINER HAVING SAME\u201d. The disclosure of that application is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The peelable seals allow for the selective opening of the chambers to allow for the selective mixing of the liquids contained therein., 137651=The levels of 2-EHA, Irganox\ufffd 1076 and 25-Crown-5 in the lipid emulsion samples were below the estimated detection limits of the methodology. The detection limits were calculated at three times the signal to noise ratio of the spiked standard (STD-L)., 43829=This is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/015,475, which was filed on Jan. 29, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,243, and is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/712,174, which was filed on Sep. 11, 1996 (abandoned)., 184526=Spiked lipid controls were prepared by adding extractive materials into the 50-mL aliquots of a 4% control lipid emulsion solution. The target extractive compounds for the antioxidant assay consisted of Irganox\ufffd 1010, Irganox\ufffd 1076 and A0330 standard materials. The antioxidants were analyzed at approximate concentrations of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, 0.9 \u03bcg/mL and 1.8 \u03bcg/mL in the lipid emulsion. The target extractive material for the oligomeric propylene and ethylene vinyl acetate assay, consisted of an organic solvent extract of the film., 151152=The study design follows previously developed methodologies for: 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-ethylphenol 1,2-bis(sec-butoxycarboxy)ethane, 25-crown-5 ether, isopropyl myristate, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, Irganox\ufffd 1010, Irganox\ufffd 1076, A0330, 1,2-bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), aluminum, volatile organic compounds and propylene and ethylene vinyl acetate oligomers in lipid containing solutions. To access the extractable burden of the container, the peel seals of the three chambered test articles were opened and the three solutions were mixed prior to all analyses except for cyclohexanone. Due to an expected loss of cyclohexanone during the lipid extraction procedure, only the peel seal separating the water-filled chambers was opened, mixed and assayed for cyclohexanone.}",
