Specifically, this document announces the effective date of initial and annual reliability certification requirements for covered 911 service providers, including any associated record retention requirements., 435835=In this document, the Commission proposes to expand to cable operators, satellite TV providers, broadcast radio licensees, and satellite radio licensees the requirement that public inspection files be posted to the FCC's online database. In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 582533=In this document the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) affirms core principles guiding its approach to 911 governance and proposes mechanisms to ensure, in cooperation with state and local partners, that the nation's 911 governance structure keeps pace with evolving technology so that all entities providing 911 service capabilities remain accountable for reliable 911 call completion and accurate situational awareness. This document proposes steps to address vulnerabilities in 911 reliability that have been revealed by a series of recent \u201csunny day\u201d 911 outages, including the April 2014 multi-state outage that was the subject of a recent report by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau). Specifically, this document proposes to amend the Commission's 911 reliability certification rules to cover additional entities and network reliability practices; require public notification for major changes in multi-state 911 networks and services, and Commission approval for discontinuance of existing 911 services; require entities seeking to provide new 911 capabilities to certify as to their technical and operational capability to provide reliable service; and designate certain 911 service providers to take lead responsibility for situational awareness and coordination with other service providers in the event of a 911 outage., 558270=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, \u00a7 73.202(b) of the Commission's rules, by allotting Channel 277A at Shelter Island, New York, as a first local service.

The reference coordinates are 40-57-54 NL and 72-22-59 WL., 236907=In this document the Commission implements certain changes to the rules governing the 700 MHz public safety narrowband spectrum (769-775/799-805 MHz). We eliminate the requirement for licensees to narrowband to 6.25 kHz technology by December 2016, thereby enabling licensees to extend the life of existing systems and providing public safety with greater flexibility in determining the optimal future use of the band. In addition, we revise and update the technical rules for the band to enhance interoperability and open up certain channels to new uses, and we release reserve spectrum to provide additional capacity, particularly for public safety licensees relocating to the 700 MHz band from the T-Band (470-512 MHz). These rule changes enhance the ability of public safety licensees to use this spectrum to protect the safety of life and property., 32429=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes the next critical steps to modernize the Universal Service Fund's Schools and Libraries program, known as E-rate. Building on the E-rate Modernization Order, the Commission adopted in July, the improvements to the program that the Commission adopts in this Order seek to close the high-speed connectivity gap between rural schools and libraries and their urban and suburban counterparts, and provide sufficient and certain funding for high-speed connectivity to and within all eligible schools and libraries. The Commission takes these actions to ensure the continued success of the E-rate program as it transitions from supporting legacy services to focusing on meeting the high-speed broadband connectivity needs of schools and libraries consistent with the recently adopted program goals and long-term connectivity targets. In the Order on Reconsideration, the Commission grants in part the petitions for reconsideration of the areas designated as urban for purposes of the E-rate program. The Commission also denies petitions for reconsideration of the document retention period, the phase out of support for telephone components and other services, and funding commitments that cover multiple years. At the same time, the Commission clarifies our cost effectiveness test for individual data plans and the cost allocation rules for circuits carrying voice services., 121882=In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved on December 5, 2014, for a period for three years, a revision to an information collection for the FCC Application for Radio Service Authorization for the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, FCC Form 601. With this document, the Commission is announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the revised requirements for FCC Form 601.}",
