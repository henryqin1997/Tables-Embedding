American Psychiatric Association. Ed.: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - lll. American Psychiatric Association, May 1980., 29001=One guide to the relative clinical importance of adverse events associated with buspirone is provided by the frequency with which they caused drug discontinuation during clinical testing. Approximately 10% of the 2200 anxious patients who participated in the buspirone premarketing clinical efficacy trials in anxiety disorders lasting 3 to 4 weeks discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The more common events causing discontinuation included: central nervous system disturbances (3.4%), primarily dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, drowsiness, and lightheaded feeling; gastrointestinal disturbances (1.2%), primarily nausea; and miscellaneous disturbances (1.1%), primarily headache and fatigue. In addition, 3.4% of patients had multiple complaints, none of which could be characterized as primary., 32952=The safety and effectiveness of buspirone were evaluated in two placebo-controlled 6-week trials involving a total of 559 pediatric patients (ranging from 6 to 17 years of age) with GAD. Doses studied were 7.5-30 mg b.i.d. (15-60 mg/day). There were no significant differences between buspirone and placebo with regard to the symptoms of GAD following doses recommended for the treatment of GAD in adults. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that, for identical doses, plasma exposure to buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-PP, are equal to or higher in pediatric patients than adults. No unexpected safety findings were associated with buspirone in these trials. There are no long-term safety or efficacy data in this population., 5012=Buspirone HCl Tablets USP are supplied as follows: 5 mg tablets: White, oval, biconvex, scored tablets, debossed WATSON and 657, in bottles of 100, 500, and 1000., 3363=Revised: October 2007, 3668=Manufactured for: Watson Laboratories, Inc.
