Optionally, choppers may also be used to avoid unwanted agglomeration or the formation of oversized conglomerates. For example, a high speed chopper, knife head, accelerator, intensifier, turbine, mill or other suitable tool (all referred to herein generically as a \u201cchopper\u201d) is used to destroy undesired agglomerates which hamper mixing. Choppers can be applied at any suitable point in the process, and may operate at high speeds, e.g., in excess of 500 rpm, 1000 rpm or 1800 rpm. Choppers also assist in distributing binder liquid more uniformly., 53473=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/569,793, filed May 10, 2004, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood that the foregoing is only illustrative of the principles of the invention, and that various modifications, alterations, and combinations can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. It will further be appreciated that articles produced with the compositions and/or methods described above can be used in a variety of other applications. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be applicable to technologies involving radiation shields, x-ray marker, counter weights, ballast weights, golf club weights, golf ball cores, fishing weights, and diving belt weights. Embodiments of the shots described above advantageously provide a shot which is extremely uniform in dimension, density, and surface hardness for cartridge loading and therefore superior in density pattern. The processes described above are dedicated processes, with definitive process input and output criteria, enabling mass production of shots. Therefore, there is no limit on the production size. The shots are advantageously as dense as lead alloy or higher. Shots as produced herein may be provided in multiple layers, making them structurally extremely strong and capable of withstanding impact with maximum penetration power. Shots can be provided with a thick, relatively soft outer layer protect the gun barrel. It will be appreciated that compositions with combinations of materials other than those described above may be used. For example, in one embodiment zinc is incorporated",
