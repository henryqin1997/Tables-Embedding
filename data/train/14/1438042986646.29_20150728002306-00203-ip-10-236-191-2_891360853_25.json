            "It's more cost than Bervard C.C by $20. per credit hour but you get what you pay for no matter where you are. I like Indian River State College so far. I felt like they wanted to treat me rite. Clean facility... Everyone was friendly :). Short wait time.",
            "Didn't have any food, but I know it's important.",
            "If you're a student that has filled out a FAFSA and plan on attending, make sure you bring in your federal taxes, W2s, and a verification worksheet for financial aid. Go to there website and apply it's real easy and no cost. I am a transfer student from AZ so I've had to wait 1.5 years to qualify for in-state.... if you're in this boat then you will need to submit all of your other transcripts + H.S. All in all it seemed like a nice place to continue my education b/c I checked out Bervard C.C... and it was really crowded + when I was waiting for the financial aid office their TV had Price is Rite on.... I though it was supposed to be an institute for higher education!",
            "The atmosphere there was good. Good help when asking questions, friendly people. Less students so that means more attention for yourself."
