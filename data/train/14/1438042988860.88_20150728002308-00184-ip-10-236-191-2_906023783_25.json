            "Be on top of things! Make sure you're asking questions regarding financial aid, registering for classes, academic stresses you may have, etc. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, but they will not baby you. This is your first step into the real world after high school, YOU are responsible for you now.",
            "TVCC is a great start to your college education. Flexible and quality classes at affordable community college prices. I highly recommend attending here before you go to a 4 year university."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It's really affordable! I have no complaints on the pricing. Am enjoying being here For the most part, the staff and students are really down to earth. And since it's a small town, it's not uncommon to have a classmate (that you've never met) stop you in the grocery store and discuss your course with you. Am learning a lot It really depends on the class, and the professor! My math teachers have been awesome! And one of the Psychology professors (Chip Chilton) is incredible! Like all schools, there are still the professors that don't give a flip.
