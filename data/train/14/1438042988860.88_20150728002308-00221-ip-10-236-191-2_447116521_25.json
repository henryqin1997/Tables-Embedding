            "Description",
            "Gateway Device - Provided is a gateway device for interconnecting an IEEE1394 network and an IP network, which automatically detects and operates an AV device connected to the IEEE1394 network from a player device connected to the IP network, thereby enabling the player device to watch and hear contents stored in the AV device. The gateway device interconnects a network, to which an AV/C installed IEEE1394 device is connected, and a network, to which a player device compliant with a UPnP is connected, and includes: a conversion unit for converting Plug-and-Play processing of the IEEE1394 device to each step of Plug-and-Play of the UPnP; a conversion unit for converting an action of a UPnP AV to an AV/C command of the IEEE1394 device; and a stream transfer unit for transferring stream data transmitted from the IEEE1394 device to the IP network.",
            "DISPLAY SYSTEM - A display system is provided which determines an effective image area by automatically detecting a boundary between the effective image area and a non-image area created owing to the difference between the pixel numbers of the camera image sensor and television signal, to thereby display the images on a monitor by adjusting a display size and position suitable for the effective image area, whereby an inappropriate display size and position are avoided from being set while a lighting device for illuminating a camera's field of vision is off. The display system receives a signal notifying about activation of the lighting device from the lighting controller that provides on/off control of the device; the system then determines the effective image area if the device is on, and does not if it is off.",
            "FILE TRANSFER METHOD AND FILE TRANSFER SYSTEM - A file transfer method and a file transfer system are provided for making it possible to minimize aggregate waiting time of the whole users for data transfer using a multicast protocol. In the file transfer method of transferring a plurality of program files from a recorder storing a plurality of program files via a network to a plurality of mobile terminals using a multicast protocol, the recorder determines order of transfers of the plurality of program files for the purpose of transferring the plurality of program files in order of digital data files, which is the ascending order of file size of the plurality of program files (step S",
            "INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE AND METHOD - An information processing device including a reader unit connected through a connection switch to a first control section and a second control section. The first control section is connected to the connection switch by a first bus supporting a first specification. The second control section is connected to a conversion unit by a second bus supporting a second specification. The conversion unit is connected to the connection switch by a third bus supporting the first specification. When the connection switch connects the reader unit to the first control section, the second control section halts communication with the conversion unit, thereby avoiding unnecessary use of processing resources.",
            "REPRODUCING DEVICE, CONTROL METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM - A reproducing device includes: one or more input source selectors for selecting content to reproduce; two or more decoding processors for decoding the content; two or more output controllers for reproducing and outputting the decoded content; an instruction reception unit for receiving a reproduction instruction specifying arbitrary content, to have the specified content reproduced and output by one of the output controllers; a reproducibility determiner for deciding, on a basis of usage conditions of the input source selectors and the decoding processors, whether or not the specified content can be reproduced with one of the decoding processors; a reproduction path determiner for designating, on a basis of the decision, which decoding processor and which output controller to use to reproduce the specified content; and a reproduction controller for using the designated decoding processor and output controller to reproduce the specified content.",
            "IMAGE INFORMATION PLAYBACK UNIT, IMAGE INFORMATION PLAYBACK DEVICE AND SYNCHRONIZATION CONTROL METHOD - Each of image information playback units (",
            "SLAVE DEVICE, MASTER DEVICE, AND COMMUNICATION METHOD - A slave device is equipped with: a parameter setting portion for setting different values according to the content of commands sent from a master device, as parameter values for detecting anomalies; and an anomaly detecting portion for detecting anomalies by comparing the time corresponding to a parameter value that has been set by the parameter setting portion and the measured time of a process carried out in response to a command.",
            "COMMUNICATION DEVICE, COMMUNICATION METHOD, AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM - A slave device (",
            "INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM - An information processing device includes: a nonvolatile memory having a program area storing a program for booting a system, and backup areas each storing a backup program identical in content to the program; a process executing unit that executes the program to perform a boot process of the system; an error detection unit that performs error detection on the program in parallel with the boot process; and a reboot unit that, when the error detection unit detects an error in the program, performs a recovery process to replace the program with one of the backup programs, and reboots the system using the replaced program. In the recovery process, the reboot unit refers to history information indicating a history of replacement of the program with the backup programs, selects the backup program used for the replacement from among the backup programs, and replaces the program with the selected backup program."
