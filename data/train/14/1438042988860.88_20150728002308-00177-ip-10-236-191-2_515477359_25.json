For questions asking opinions of services, the results shown include in order: the average opinion score (labeled \"Average\"), the percentage of people who were satisfied with the service (graded it as a 3 or better, labeled \"Satisfaction\"), the percentage of people who use the service (which we have taken to be the percentage of people who expressed an opinion about it, labeled \"Usage\").}",
