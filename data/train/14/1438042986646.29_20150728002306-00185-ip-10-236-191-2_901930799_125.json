Should be comfortable to live in from 2014 onwards....., 128885=Don't be afraid to email or call the school with questions. I've probably emailed the poor Admissions Office 50 times asking them anything and everything I had to ask. They have, however, always replied with friendly and helpful answers that aided me in completing my application and such. Also, apply as soon as you can. UW has a rolling application, which means you can apply whenever you want, and as soon as all your application materials are received, you can expect a reply in as little as four weeks. Then, if you want to go there, you don't have to worry about applying to three or four (or however many) schools just in case. There is no essay on the application so it takes less than an hour to complete and then you're done with that. Some of the scholarships also have an apply by deadline. For example, to be considered for the WUE, you must submit all your application materials by the beginning of December. Finally, don't worry about how to apply for scholarships too much. A lot of the scholarships (the WUE and Rocky Mountain Scholarships) only require your application to apply for the scholarship. And if you have any questions about scholarships and how to apply, like I said, don't be afraid to email or call them with questions., 590290=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52444=Be careful with your travel! Snow storms can swoop down as early as August and continue through May. (June and July snow is rare, but does happen.) The roads into and out of town wind through mountainous passes, so they close pretty quickly in bad weather., 161106=i am enrolled in fall of 2012 with a partial swimming scholarship. gooo cowboys!, 300653=Definitely be prepared for a freezing winter. Summer clothing will only be used in August, possibly September and May. As for schooling, just be organized. That's how it is with any university., 16869=I am a freshman at the University of Wyoming, so although I have not experiences finals or anything yet, I feel as if I am learning a lot. There is a good mix of professors and graduate students that teach the classes so experience different teaching styles and approaches to learning. There are quite a few large lecture classes but most do not reach over 200 students so there is still a good student to professor ratio. The teachers present well rounded, new information in every class and I find myself eager to attend class every day. The only place that I sometimes find that my learning is curbed is some of the classes with graduate students. They are learning new things parallel to their students so points they try to make are sometimes unclear. Otherwise, the professors are all very knowledgeable and have taught me a lot since the semester started a month ago. The 1000 level courses that most freshmen take are a good transition from high school to college and demand just enough attention from the students that if you work hard enough A's and B's are not unattainable., 235289=If you decide to come to the University of Wyoming, pack very warmly. Temperatures can reach significantly below zero in the winter, with the coldest months being between December through February. Also, if you decide to stick around Laramie through the summer, don't put away your winter gear, because Laramie will usually get snow up through May, and sometimes in June or July (but those situations are rare). Don't let the weather discourage you though, the education is great, the people are amazing, and there is so much you can do downtown and outside of town., 27696=The classes I have taken have overall been intellectually challenging. The 1000 level courses are definitely easy to do well in, but I still seem to learn a lot from them. As the class levels have increased, so has my work load--but also my intellect. I definitely feel like I am getting a solid education. Regarding the classes in my major, I feel I am being adequately prepared for a career--the assignments and knowledge base have all been directed towards what will help us in the pursuing a career and what will help us in the workplace. This has proven to be very beneficial thus far. In general, my professors have been very good--extremely knowledgeable in their respective subjects and very willing to help the students succeed., 222980=The University of Wyoming shows many of the same characteristics that the state of Wyoming has. You can party on weekends if you would like, but for weekends there are not a ton of options besides hanging with a group of friends. Make sure to bring warm clothes because winter lasts from late October to mid-March.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I was an out of state student who received a scholarship to go to UW, so I figured why not? But once I was there, I had to jump through every department's hoops, from financial aid to the office of the registrar in order to get all my student loan stuff, my work study stuff, and my scholarship stuff done. That process took me over 3 weeks to do, to the point where I was already well into classes and still didn't have money to buy books because my scholarship, student loans, and work study still hadn't cleared with the financial aid dept. at the school. As apposed to where I'm at now, where I got all that stuff taken care of in a day, and classes haven't even started yet. This school is way to expensive for out of state students, and they are not very helpful in taking care of your problems. When I was dealing with all the various offices, every person that ever helped my take care of financial things acted like it was not their problem and they couldn't believe I couldn't take care of this myself. The quality of education is great, but with everything else I didn't like about this school great education wasn't enough to keep me there. Did enjoy being here I",
