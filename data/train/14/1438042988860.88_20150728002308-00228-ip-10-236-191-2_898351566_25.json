GET TO KNOW YOUR PROFESSORS. I felt like a lot of mine had picks. Just stay on top of things and do your work. Don't believe the hype on the food, just like any other college, the food gets nasty after a while. Plus, the cafe hours suck, especially around dinner time, I'm starving around 7:30. Not a lot to do around the campus, especially if you're from the city and you a use to doing things. Friendly but weird people. Advisors don't do a lot. Not a party school at all. Dead on weekends, well pretty much every night. If you're from Dallas/Fort Worth, DO NOT come. The dorms are really nice but NO WIFI!!!! You will make friends quickly though, everyone's friendly. The percentage of returning students from other cities is low. Mostly athletes and commuters., 657=Need money? Join the Honors program, you'll get 1500 a year if you're in good standing with the program. Come check it out, it's a great campus!, 203615=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Am enjoying being here Very enjoyable, everyone is friendly, upper classmen are helpful. Food is pretty good too! Am learning a lot My professors/instructors are really great at what they do! None of them make the classroom boring and they keep the information fresh with new ways of presenting it to you.
