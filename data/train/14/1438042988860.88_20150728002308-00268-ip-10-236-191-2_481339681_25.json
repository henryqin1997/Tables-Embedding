    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Numerous modifications and variations in practice of the invention are expected to occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the foregoing detailed description of the invention. Consequently, such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. No out-gassing in films as thick as 3 mils; No viscosity drop during mixing of part A and B; Excellent Film buildup for vertical surfaces; Low demanding of isocyanates for film curing. A polyester dispersion for 2 component waterborne polyurethane applications has been developed. The polyester dispersion demonstrated the following improved performance. Summary The paint discussed above was made with an NCO/OH ratio of 2/1. NCO/OH Ratio 240 cp 2 wks at 120 F. 360 cp 1 wk at 120 F. 560 cp Initial viscosity The heat stability of the dispersion at 120\ufffd F. is listed below:",
