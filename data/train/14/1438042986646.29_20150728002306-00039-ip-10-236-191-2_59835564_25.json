However, VDPs are not always the trigger that gets a shopper to choose your store over your competitor\u2019s. Because the lines have blurred and there are so many touchpoints throughout the purchase process, you have to consider VDP metrics in context of other consumer actions. Looking at things holistically will help you gain insight into the complex interdependencies that drive sales. The VDP is a much better diagnostic tool than indicator of purchase intent on third-party sites or a comparative measure of ROI. You could have the best inventory in your market, if you don\u2019t merchandise effectively, you\u2019re likely to see a drop in VDPs. Fewer than average views of your vehicles may indicate problems with pricing, merchandising or the inventory on your lot.",
