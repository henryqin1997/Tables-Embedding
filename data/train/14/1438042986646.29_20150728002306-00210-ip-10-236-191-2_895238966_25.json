We don't have a sperate link for deleting the comment like node has node/nid/delete there is nothing for the comment like this when we converted comment paths to route this question came up but that was consider out of scope because priority was route conversion at that time. When we introduced list builder for entities we ignore comments because we have to isolate between admin page and delete page which we never did. Operations links can only exist if we have a list builder and for comments and that is why we have to use dropbutton here. See #2491875-14: EntityViewsData adds Operations links to all entities, which won't work if the entity type has no list builder as well. Thank you for adding the related issue., 364438=Will tackle this in Sprint 29 March.}",
