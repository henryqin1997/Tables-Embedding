            "totally safe. I have heard it is the most dangerous of the UCs, but I do not see how that is, because I have never once felt in danger in Davis.",
            "There is a lot. In fact there are too many to describe, which is good, because that way people know that there is a club for anything on campus, and if there is not a club you are looking for, then you can just start one. It is super easy to start a club, I've done it a few times.",
            "chill students that can be spontaneous and recognize the humor in people doing stupid things... also students with a high tolerance to pepper spray",
            "3rd n u. 2 pints for 5 dollars. free coffee past 2pm and 2 dollars for a basket of fries. All this while you sit outside in the sun with friends and since it is literally right across the street from campus, you always see people you know walk by.",
            "Parties are too cliche for college; you will inevitably find yourself at a few, but if you really want to have fun, then you have to come up with crazy adventures and stay up late with your friends studying. That last thing may seem contradictory to fun, but staying up late with a lot of friends is a lot of fun, because you watch them go crazy and then we have fun doing random things.",
            "So this one is a toss up. It's sort of like i mentioned earlier, with not taking it for granted. When you first come to orientation, you are like OH WOW, all you can eat of all this awesome food! But then you get quite sick and tired of the same stuff and avoid going until your sophomore friends ask you to swipe them in, because they miss the DC. It's also a great way to meet people and sound like a big shot by saying hey I'll swipe you into the DC.",
            "I lived in Cuarto, which is the farthest from campus, but it was also amazing, because it was a suite style dorm, and when my friends came to visit, they said it looked like a resort. I also made friends that will last a life time in the dorms, and everyone is always doing something wacky and fun. The memories were so amazing, that I started keeping a journal to remember them all.",
            "Depending on your major people will either sympathize with or belittle your major, but don't listen to them, because I took a plethora of eclectic classes and it's not the subject. It's the teachers that make it easy or hard; however, be it easy or difficult,(and in many cases it is difficult) it is all about what you put into the class, so if you go into class ready to actually learn, then you will be fine. If the class is something you are taking just as a prerequisite or GE, then it will probably be more difficult.",
            "you will make a lot of friends in your first year, and even question whether you learn more in the class or out of class, but it is important to keep focused on why you are in school in the first place. You will be living close to (or on) campus, so try and spread some free time between classes. That way you can relax a little bit and be prepared to soak in more info in class, and maybe even have time to study or get a bite to eat. That being said, don't take the Dining Commons for granted, because you will miss them in your second year.",
            "If you like relaxed people in a small town where everyone is your own age, and, oddly enough, there is always something to do, whether that is going downtown to see bands or poetry readings, or events that the various clubs do, then Davis is perfect for you."

Everything happens for a reason and never ever lose hope. If there's a will there's a way., 746350=There are over 500 active organizations at UC Davis, so there is already a huge variety of clubs that are based on interests, academics, politics, sexual identity, race, religion, and more. But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, there\u00e2??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my \u00e2??What to do for fun\u00e2??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. It\u00e2??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California. It's an excellent school with many opportunities. The ratio of cows to bicycles here seems to be 1:1., 131694=The campus host the Whole Earth Festival, usually in May, where there is live music and cool crafts being sold all week. It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal. I am a pre-vet animal science major, and UC Davis has the best veterinarian program in all of California and most parts of the world. During my visits everyone has been very nice and accommodating, as well as genuinely interested in prospective students., 41713=I was able to get a lot of financial aid, almost a full scholarship for the 2011-2012 year. Especially if your family's income is low-middle class to low, Davis does it's best to keep you from spending $10,000 out of pocket which means no emptying savings or taking private bank loans. They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years. When i was admitted in Fall of 2007, my tuition per quarter was about $2800; now it has skyrocketed to $4600 per quarter., 542848=First make friends with your roommates. Buy a bike with fenders or get fenders for your tires, they come in great use all of Oct. through February. Make the most from eating at the dining commons, it will be only time you won't be thinking what your next meal will be., 321820=Because it's a UC, it's a bit on the pricey side. Out of pocket, I paid about $3500 my freshman year with the help of all the grants I got. The university itself gave me about $1500 last year. I refused to get loans., 424078=picnic day is held in april and is the largest event that every student (or non-student) looks forward to! :), 891985=Get a bike! Don't get 7:30 classes. Go easy the first quarter, 533254=Jeremiah 29:11 For He knows the plans he has for you, to give you a hope & a future., 503477=For the third time, Picnic Day! Also, the football games are fun to attend if you get in the Aggie Pack. The Whole Earth Festival is fun to check out too. Ask around about the Death Star. Did you know there's a pub on campus? Go to the Silo, and right next door is a convenient little pub. At least it was back in 2006.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I believe that the cost of tuition at UC Davis is worth every penny. The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because they\u2019re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center I\u2019ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. I\u2019ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that it\u2019s worth all the somewhat expensive cost. Am enjoying being here I had the time of my life at UC Davis and am counting down the days until I return as a sophomore. The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of",
