Licencia bajo los t\u00e9rminos de la Apache License, Version 2.0., 40819=This directive enables the generation of Content-MD5 headers as defined in RFC1864 respectively RFC2616., 140379=LimitRequestBody 102400, 144773=The LimitRequestFieldSize directive allows the server administrator to reduce or increase the limit on the allowed size of an HTTP request header field. A server needs this value to be large enough to hold any one header field from a normal client request. The size of a normal request header field will vary greatly among different client implementations, often depending upon the extent to which a user has configured their browser to support detailed content negotiation. SPNEGO authentication headers can be up to 12392 bytes., 180019=With the file-based mechanisms fcntl and flock, the path, if provided, is a directory where the lock file will be created. The default directory is httpd's run-time file directory relative to ServerRoot. Always use a local disk filesystem for /path/to/mutex and never a directory residing on a NFS- or AFS-filesystem. The basename of the file will be the mutex type, an optional instance string provided by the module, and unless the OmitPID keyword is specified, the process id of the httpd parent process will be appended to to make the file name unique, avoiding conflicts when multiple httpd instances share a lock file directory. For example, if the mutex name is mpm-accept and the lock file directory is /var/httpd/locks, the lock file name for the httpd instance with parent process id 12345 would be /var/httpd/locks/mpm-accept.12345., 228431=After version 2.0.44, this directive also controls the information presented by the ServerSignature directive., 141886=Number is an integer from 0 (meaning unlimited) to 32767. The default value is defined by the compile-time constant DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDS (100 as distributed)., 239391=This directive overrides the behavior of TRACE for both the core server and mod_proxy. The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE requests per RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request. TraceEnable off causes the core server and mod_proxy to return a 405 (Method not allowed) error to the client., 225565=After version 2.0.44, the details of the server version number presented are controlled by the ServerTokens directive.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Some format string items accept additional parameters in braces. A number as modifier can be used to assign a log severity level to a format item. The item will only be logged if the severity of the log message is not higher than the specified log severity level. The number can range from 1 (alert) over 4 (warn) and 7 (debug) to 15 (trace8). The above behaviour can be changed by adding modifiers to the format string item. A - (minus) modifier causes a minus to be logged if the respective item does not produce any output. In once-per-connection/request formats, it is also possible to use the + (plus) modifier. If an item with the plus modifier does not produce any output, the whole line is ommitted. It can happen that some format string items do not produce output. For example, the Referer header is only present if the log message is associated to a request and the log message happens at a time when the Referer header has already been read from the client. If no output is produced, the default behaviour is to delete everything from the preceeding space character to the next space character. This means the log line is implicitly divided into fields on non-whitespace to whitespace transitions. If a format string item does not produce output, the whole field is ommitted. For example, if the remote address %a in the log format [%t] [%l] [%a] %M\u00a0 is not available, the surrounding brackets are not logged",
    "textAfterTable": "The log ID format %L produces a unique id for a connection or request. This can be used to correlate which log lines belong to the same connection or request, which request happens on which connection. A %L format string is also available in mod_log_config, to allow to correlate access log entries with error log lines. If mod_unique_id is loaded, its unique id will be used as log ID for requests.
