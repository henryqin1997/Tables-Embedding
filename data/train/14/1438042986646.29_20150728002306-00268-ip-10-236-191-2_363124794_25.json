We are likely to see Lord Windermere campaigned towards a repeat Gold Cup success in March so expect him to improve with every run. Other races to keep an eye on include the King George Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day and the Lexus Chase over in Ireland which are both excellent trial races., 4740=Gold Cup Trial Races 2014/15}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{57780=November 2014, 958=Won this in 2013 but doesn't seem as good nowadays. Excellent record here includes victory in this race in 2013, when powering clear on the run-in; however, he has been disappointing to varying degrees in three of his four runs since, including when 4l fifth in this last year, and suspicion is that some bruising scraps have taken a toll on him; would have a big chance on old form but risky nowadays., 49530=May improve on latest second to Many Clouds here; ground suits and a fresh horse too. Needs to find improvement on latest second to Many Clouds (who was conceding 8lb) in a soft-ground Grade 2 here in January but that was only his second run of his season and firmer ground may well help - he ran a career best when second in the RSA Chase on good here last March; may find enough to be a place contender but winning looks too big a task., 56579=The King George VI Chase is a massive race in its own right as well as a key trial for the Gold Cup in March and once again we saw a cracking race on Boxing Day. In the end it was Silviniaco Conti who claimed the race for the second successive year to confiorm himsekf as the best in Britain when it comes to staying chasers. The Paul Nicholls horse led for much of the way with just enthusiasm before pulling clear on the run in with the remainder of the field unable to land a blow. Champagne Fever travelled well before tiring and he is likely to drop back in trip for Cheltenham., 65181=More Cheltenham Festival 2015 Previews, 69897=Who will win the 2015 Gold Cup?, 57193=The big Gold Cup trial over Christmas in Ireland was of course the Lexus Chase and on paper it looked like a stellar field as they went to post at Leoprdstown. The winner was Road To Riches as he continued his upward curve with a big career best for Noel Meade and he is now on target for the Festival in March for Gigginstown. Bobs Worth was first beaten on his seasonal debut which is a major worry for his fans while defending Gold Cup champ Lord Windermere plodded on at the one pace but never got close to the winner., 55829=January 2015, 56535=December 2014, 38922=Progressing well and won 3m Grade 1 events on last two starts; should stay; big chance. Fulfilling early promise in spades this season since training regime and diet were changed, winning the Galway Plate and 3m Grade 1s at Down Royal and Leopardstown, in that last win in December strong at the finish and giving firm impression that this trip would suit him; absence since is a plus if anything as he goes well fresh; versatile tactically, leading contender as his form stands and still on the upgrade so of strong interest., 57824=The JNWine Champion Chase is always a an important race in the staying chase division at the start of November and we saw a very taking performance from the improving Road to Riches. The Gigginstown owned horse won the Galway Plate during the summer but this was a career best from the Noel Meade horse. He jumped well and pulled 11 lengths clear of Rocky Creek with Boston Bob and First Lieutenant nowhere in sight which looks decent form by any standard., 67409=Some of the biggest names in horse racing are scheduled to run in the 2014 Cheltenham Festival., 28606=Won this last year; likely to be at a peak again but it's a better race this year. Two from two here, in the RSA Chase in 2013 and when edging home in this race last year; has shaped as if all of his ability is intact in Ireland this season and clearly comes alive at Cheltenham in March but last year's renewal was substandard and he looks highly vulnerable for win purposes in a stronger race this year., 55872=The Betbright Cup (formerly the Argento Chase) is often a decent race with the Gold Cup in mind and we saw an excellent renewal this time on Trials Day. In the end it was Many Clouds who held off all comers to win the race and follow up from his Hennessy win back in November. The Oliver Sherwood horse travelled and jumped strongly throughout before showing great strength on the run in to hold off both Smad Place and Dynaste. This was an important win for Many Clouds as he built his experience at Prestbury Park and although he will need more again to win a Gold Cup, he is open to that and is a live contender., 59871=The Hennessy Gold Cup often produces a live Gold cup contender and it will be interesting to see if Many Clouds can make an impression on the big race in 2015. The Oliver Sherwood trained horse showed his solid jumping skills and his stamina as he won a testing Hennessy at Newbury and it was hard not to be impressed by the performance. You get the feeling that he will need to improve again to win a Gold Cup but maybe he has just that in the locker.}",

The one to appeal most is ROAD TO RICHES (nap), who has barely looked back since a change in diet and training regime and whose performances when winning Grade 1s in Ireland late last year give him leading form prospects, with the distinct possibility of better to come. He confirmed at Leopardstown last time that he doesn't have to lead, which may be no bad thing with the trailblazing novice Coneygree likely to be blasting away up front.
