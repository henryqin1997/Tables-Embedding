The university usually has something fun going on but if not there was always something happening in St. Louis. For instance, Kevin Hart just made an appearance on Friday, April 13th. We also receive different discounts on events that come to the area, like Cardinal tickets!!, 248803=On campus you can hang out with friends. Go to the Library or even travel a couple miles down the highway or take the train which will connect you with the Delmar Loop which includes great restaurants, shopping, and many social activities. If you ride a little further you can connect with Downtown St. Louis which has many activities that are extremely fun., 11656=For future students: -Do not wait until the day of or before classes to buy your books or you will be standing in line for hours. -Arrive to school early to find a parking space. The most chaotic times for parking is 10:45-12:30 because thats around the time the 11:00 classes begin. Those are the most favorable classes and most people have those classes so there's literally no parking around that time., 447990=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 153123=Apply early, since scholarship deadlines are in March. Think about housing, but keep costs in mind., 61078=There are always, and I stress always, many great activities to do on and off campus. With a free metro-link and metro-bus pass you can get to downtown St. Louis and to the famous strip of the Delmar Loop to do just about anything and everything from concerts to shopping., 28801=The food is ok. The dining hall on south campus gets old after a while, and the meals are so expensive. I think the meal plan is a rip off. $1600 for 4 months? What 120 lb. girl can eat that much food? None of them.}",
