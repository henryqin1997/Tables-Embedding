            "Not a great place to go unless you like small towns and folksy people. Most of the classes are far away from the dorms (15-20 mins to walk to classes) and the food isn't very good. Everything is also highly over priced."

The dorms in general are nicer than many schools I've visited. Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people and make friends. The RAs do a good job in building community in each floor. As to the niceness of the residence hall, the Honors College has the nicest dorms, and then after that, the halls on the Redstone Campus are pretty nice.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Will learn a lot This school is amazing, and not only for the great classes and professors they have- they are one of the most green campuses in the country. You don't only learn in your classes, you learn life skills like recycling. Also, UVM is not the kind of school that teaches to the tests- it's not what you think, it's HOW you think. Here you learn critical thinking skills. to help you in whatever career you choose.

UVM has a really laid back atmosphere that is very accepting of all different types of people. There are groups for everyone! There are a lot of different types of people on campus and since the student body is so large, you'll definitely find people with similar interests. Tips for prospective",
