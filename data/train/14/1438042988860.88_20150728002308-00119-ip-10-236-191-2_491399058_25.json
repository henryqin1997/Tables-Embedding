    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6802=In FIG. 12, data 1202 regarding differentiation tests of genetic structure between paclitaxel responders and non-responders with Ovarian Cancer are shown. Analyses for haplotype systems (Column 2) within two genes (Column 1) are presented. Two criteria for response were used: a 20% and a 50% reduction in CA125 reading post-paclitaxel treatment. The analyses were performed on two levels (Column 4). The \u201cindividual level\u201d uses an average CA125 response per individual and counts each individual only once. The \u201ctest pair\u201d level uses each paclitaxel treatment\u2014CA125 reading pair, and any one individual may be counted several times depending on the number of treatments they received. P values for a pair-wise F-statistic (Column 4) and an Exact test of Differentiation (Column 5) are shown. In FIG. 12, the results from the first two haplotype systems processed can be compared. This reveals that the second haplotype system (TX3A41120) revealed poor P-values, no matter how the data was looked at.}",

One folder exists for each query type (i.e. Lipitor\u2122 drug and ASTSGOT readings), and each of these folders contains several hundred contingency tables names by query unique identifier plus a suffix to identify them as chi-square input files;, 93860=One software-based modeling algorithm is described herein (namely, the linear and quadratic analysis), although such algorithms are generally outside the scope of the present invention. Other software-based modeling algorithms may be utilized, alone or in combination, such as a classification tree analysis and a correspondence analysis, as described in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/338,771 filed Dec. 3, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein., 77511=Other relevant publications include Shou M, Lu, T, Drausz, K., Sai, Y., Yang, T., Korzekwa, K R., Gonzalez, F., Gelboin, H., 2000, \u201cUse of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies to assess the contribution of cytochromes P450 to human drug metabolism,\u201d Eur J Pharmacol 394(2\u20133):199\u2013209; and Dai, D., Zeldin, D C, Blaisdell, J., Chanas, B., Coulter, S., Ghanayem, B., Goldstein, J., 2001, \u201cPolymorphisms in human CYP2C8 decrease metabolism of the anticancer drug paclitaxel and arachidonic acid,\u201d Pharmacogenetics 11(7):597\u2013607., 76457=The modeling algorithms and software applications that function downstream of the haplotype feature extraction system are also novel applications of existing methods for genetic analysis. Correspondence analysis for complex genetic analysis is believed to be a novel and non-obvious methodology, although correspondence analysis has previously been used by sociologists to model sociological variables and by mechanical engineers to model physical variables. This is also true for the linear & quadratic as well as the classification tree techniques for complex genetics analysis. The process of drawing haplotype cladograms (part of a geometric modeling method) was introduced by Templeton et al., 1995. Although methods for drawing these haplotype cladograms have been previously described, it is believed that a method for encoding and plotting haplotypes in geometrical space, based on their position within a haplotype cladogram, for the extraction of complex genetics information, is also novel and non-obvious., 146383=Using the single SUN 420R server with an initial 2-locus search provides for better efficiency. Beginning with 2-locus combinations, genotype data, phenotype data, and inferred haplotypes for (14*13)/(2) SNP combinations=91 must be obtained. Each combination took about 10 minutes for data retrieval, 1 hour to infer haplotypes, 10 minutes to prepare output and input files, and 10 minutes for statistical analysis (same as above). For 91 combinations, 8190 minutes were spent performing this analysis. Significant results were obtained and 9 SNP combinations whose haplotype alleles are associated with the trait were identified. The intelligence method identified the same 8 SNPs that contributed most towards this significance, and (8*7*6)/(3*2)=56 3-SNP combinations (rather than (14*13*12*11)/(4*3*2)=1001 without the intelligence method) were tested and then (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2)=70 4-SNP combinations (rather than (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2)=2002 without the intelligence method) were tested, and then (8*7*6*5*4)/(5*4*3*2)=120 5-locus combinations (rather than (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2)=2002 without the intelligence method) were tested. This adds another (90 minutes*56)+(90 minutes*70)+(90 minutes*120)=22,140 minutes for a combined run time of 8190+22,140=30,330 minutes or 505 hours to find the same 4-locus combination., 139711=After having screened through thousands of haplotype systems, in this and other genes, the TX3A41119 system proved to be the optimal system for genetically distinguishing between TAXOL\u2122 responders and non-responders. The program took about one week to run for this example, but if done by hand it is estimated that the process would have taken a year or more. If the longest possible haplotype had been focused on, the contribution of the three most important SNPs would have been missed (those SNPs that comprise the TX3A41119 haplotype system because of the confounding affect of irrelevant SNPs and because of dilution of the sample size within each genetic class)., 115010=TX3A41119, 102997=The second constraint is imposed by the user. Continue to assume that a classification solution for LIPITOR\u2122 response is to be found. TYR is a pigmentation gene and has nothing to do with drug metabolism or drug disposition as far as medical science knows. The other five genes are known to be involved in drug metabolism (their names start with CYP indicating that they are cytochrome P450 genes=xenobiotic metabolizers). In fact, LIPITOR\u2122 is known from the scientific literature to be metabolized by CYP3A4 (which is on the list) and therefore SNPs within this gene would certainly be included in a \u201crun\u201d of the system. See Casciano, W. et al., Hmb-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) Characterized As Direct inhibitors Of P-glycoprotein, Pharm Res, June 2001,; 1816: 800\u20136. CIn fact, it is shown below that this is the only gene identified to have associations using the system. This result confirms the sensitivity and specificity of the method., 38933=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/338,771 filed Dec. 3, 2001., 175347=Several techniques for the analysis of subtables are provided. Lancaster (1949) and Irwin (1949) have shown that the overall chi-square statistic for R\ufffdC contingency table can always be partitioned into as many components as they have one degree of freedom. Each component chi-square value corresponds to a particular 2\ufffd2 table arising from the original table, and each component is independent of the other. Gabriel (1966, 1969) proposed a simultaneous method to test homogeneity across multiple subtables of an R\ufffdC contingency table. Finally, George (1997) proposed an STP that ameliorates the difficulties in earlier methods., 107763=Once approved by the user, the job is processed by the haplotype selection and testing routine. The program computes all possible haplotype systems (i.e. all possible SNP combinations) using the list of haplotypes defined in the job. More particularly, a haplotype system is selected and individual patient genotypes for this SNP combination are written to a text file. This text file serves as the input for another software component which is used to infer the phase corresponding to the haplotype system. This component may be a third party program, such as PHASE by Stephens and Donnelly, 2001, or Clark's algorithm. Once the phase has been determined for each patient, the results are written to another text file which contains the diploid pair of haplotype sequences for each person part of the job. This text file serves as input to another software component which replaces the phase-unknown genotypes of the HTML file with the diploid pair of phase-known haplotypes., 39073=This patent hereby incorporates by reference a Sequence Listing on compact disc (CD) in accordance with 37 C.F.R. 1.821\u20131.825. More particularly, two CDs (one original and one duplicate copy) named DNAPRINT_SEQLIST have been submitted to the U.S.P.T.O., each of which includes the Sequence Listing in a file named \u201cseq_listing\u201d created on Jul. 10, 2002 and having a size of 4.27 KB., 75577=Other components of the software system have ideological and practical counterparts in existing methodologies. One or more software-based statistical tests may be used to evaluate a haplotype system as a genetic feature. Ideas for one these tests were first propounded by Raymond and Rousset. See, e.g., Raymond, M. and F. Rousset, \u201cAn Exact Test For Population Differentiation\u201d, Evolution 49(6), 1280\u20131283, 1995. As we have described earlier, however, if a scientist desired to use Raymond and Roussets' algorithm to do the type of work we have described, it would take them years to do a job that the inventive platform system would take only days to do. Ideas for another test, the F-statistic test, were first propounded by Fisher. See Fisher, R. A., \u201cThe Logic of Inductive Inference,\u201d Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 98:39\u201354, 1935., 72995=The difficulty is that computational tools for this process do not currently exist, and it is this need that is addressed by the inventive methods and apparatus described in the present application. On the other hand, there are various existing software applications that could serve as individual components of such a pipeline system. For example, consider the inventive \u201cfeature extraction\u201d method. Some existing programs are designed for calculating whether alleles of a given haplotype system are useful for resolving between trait classes. For example, see Raymond, M. and F. Rousset, \u201cAn exact test for population differentiation,\u201d 1995, Evolution 49(6), 1280\u20131283. However, there are no software applications which incorporate such a method into a systematic feature extraction process., 113790=QUERYNAME=TX3A1117, 145290=Beginning with the 3-locus combinations, genotype data, phenotype data, and inferred haplotypes for (14*13*12)/(3*2) SNP combinations=364 must be obtained. Each combination takes about 10 minutes for data retrieval, 1 hour to infer haplotypes, 10 minutes to prepare output and input files, and 10 minutes for statistical analysis. For 364 combinations, 32,760 minutes were spent performing the analysis. Significant results were obtained and 5 SNP combinations whose haplotype alleles are associated with the trait were identified. The intelligence method identified 8 SNPs that contributed most towards this significance, and (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2)=70 4-SNP combinations (rather than (14*13*12*11)/(4*3*2)=1001 without the intelligence method) were tested and then (8*7*6*5*4)/(5*4*3*2)=56 5-SNP combinations (rather than (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2)=2002 without the intelligence method) were tested. This adds another (90 minutes*70)+(90 minutes*56)=11340 minutes for a combined run time of 32,760+11340=44,100 minutes or 735 hours to find the 4-locus combination.}",

None of the terms or phrases in the specification and claims has been given any special particular meaning different from the plain language meaning to those skilled in the art, and therefore the specification is not to be used to define terms in an unduly narrow sense. Thus, methods and apparatus for identifying associations between genetic information and particular genetic traits have been described. A candidate SNP combination is selected from a plurality of candidate SNP combinations for a gene associated with a genetic trait Haplotype data associated with this candidate SNP combination are read for a plurality of individuals and grouped into a positive-responding group and a negative-responding group based on whether predetermined trait criteria for an individual are met. A statistical analysis on the grouped haplotype data is performed to obtain a statistical measurement associated with the candidate SNP combination. The acts of selecting, reading, grouping, and performing are repeated as necessary to identify the candidate SNP combination having the optimal statistical measurement. In one approach, all possible SNP combinations are selected and statistically analyzed. In another approach, a directed search based on results of previous",
