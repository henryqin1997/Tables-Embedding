The circuitry is able to handle a higher current at 3A 5V output. This translate to a higher cost and circuit size, since all component must be able to handle that high power capacity. These component include the LM2576, inductor and the diode. Since most electronics kit requires less than 1A power supply, it is wise learning how to apply a low power dc-dc regulator like LM2575. Cost can be reduce by 50%., 102449=LM2594 (0.5A), 110711=- LM2678-12 (12Vdc output), 225491=Keyword: Buck Regulator, voltage regulator, switching mode power supply, High efficiency, voltage supply, dc-dc converter, LM2576 LM2575 IC, regulated 5Vdc output, Shottky diode, 100uH, 330uH inductor, Low cost, 1A 3A., 73421=- LM2825-ADJ (1.23Vdc to 37Vdc output), 31794=There is one day that I happen to come across this IC LM2575 while searching high and low for LM2576. LM2576 is actually quite difficult to find. There is only 2 shop I know of, but I have rule out one shop because they are selling a faulty batch of LM2576 IC. LM2575 seems very common from shops around and I decided to find out more about this chip. Indeed it is what I have been looking for, a low power regulator. So I purchase the IC and its component to try it out. When I started writing this acticle, only did I realize that I have actually tried it about 6 months ago. The experiment was forgotten after a series of failure., 147380=- LM2577-15 (15Vdc output), 78677=220uH, 3A\u00a0 <for LM2576-12, LM2576-15>, 131125=- LM22678-ADJ (1.285Vdc to Vin output), 43215=NJM2367, 74619=LM2576 (3A), 102915=- LM2594-3.3 (3.3Vdc output), 75295=- LM2576-15 (15Vdc output), 107339=LM2596 datasheet, 120570=- LM22675-5.0 (5Vdc output), 9047=The interfacing of most dc-dc IC requires the use of inductor. This is the case for LM2576 too. Try sourcing your local electronics shop for one if possible. I am not stopping you to make your own inductor. Just that making your own inductor takes up time and it is very likely to cost you more than what a shop might be selling., 73182=- LM2825-3.3 (3.3Vdc output), 19214=Bill of Material (BOM) for LM2576 circuit, 130605=LM22678 (5A), 106611=- LM2596-5.0 (5Vdc output), 42756=- LM2575-5.0 (5Vdc output), 146864=LM2577 (3A), 153056=Click for MAX1708 circuit, 44476=Click for LM2575-adj circuit, 156109=MCP1640.pdf, 36340=Bill of Material (BOM) for LM2575 circuit, 75056=- LM2576-3.3 (3.3Vdc output), 114597=- LM2574-5.0 (5Vdc output), 76989=Click for LM2576-adj layout, 77230=- AN-946, lm2576 as a charger, 155863=Output 3.3V from a 1.2V alkaline battery using MCP1640, 116410=LM22674 (0.5A), 73991=LM2825 datasheet, 103719=LM2594 datasheet, 22648=Failure, my first prototype circuit to test out the performance of LM2575, LM2576., 33803=The photos on the left column shows the LM2575 circuit using the correct inductance value at 330uH but the inductor is low power rated.

One fine day I went back to the shop where I first purchase my LM2576 and brought 2 additional LM2576 for more testing. A new circuit was build and the familiar failure was observed. The output voltage of 5V cannot be sustain and eventually drop when more than 1A of current is draw by the load. The lab power supply display a current loading limit warning. IC becomes very hot. The datasheet specify that LM2576 should be able to supply 3A without any\u00a0 problem. Both brand new IC are tested to have the same problem., 148632=Click for LM2577-adj layout, 143898=LMZ12003 (3A), 116853=- LM22674-5.0 (5Vdc output), 75137=- LM2576-5.0 (5Vdc output), 6916=A switching mode power supply such as LM2576 dc-dc converter, uses switching control to reduce the input dc voltage on average. This is equivalent to a lower input voltage resulting in minimum heat dissipated. The control results in better regulated output, less energy wasted through heat and the use for high current application. Nowadays dc-dc converter are getting smaller and comes in the TO-220 package too. You can simply change your LM7805 to dc-dc converter without any change in your design., 110114=LM2678 (5A), 23807=One day, I visited a shop selling ready made inductors and brought LM2576 at the same time. The circuit was rebuild and it finally works. My deduction at that time was either the inductor or the capacitor is giving me the problem. After further testing, I find out that ordinary capacitor works as well. There is hardly any difference in performance. Various type of inductor were tested (except the resistor like type). All inductor works too, big or small. Quite weird actually, and I couldn't figure it out the actual problem I had in my previous attempt., 120650=- LM22675-ADJ (1.285Vdc to Vin output), 76825=Click for LM2576-adj circuit, 5842=LM2576 circuits perform same function as the commonly known voltage regulator LM7805 from National Semiconductor. The 7805 voltage regulator dissipates a lot heat. The higher input voltage, the more heat is generated. The extra input energy is converted to heat, keeping the output voltage regulated at 5V., 106690=- LM2596-12 (12Vdc output), 42914=- LM2575-15 (15Vdc output), 112530=360uF (100V aluminium electrolytic, low ESR) <for LM2678-3.3, LM2678-5.0>, 137197=Adjustable Vout computation (very similar to LM2576, LM2575) with Vref = 1.25V, 42675=- LM2575-3.3 (3.3Vdc output), 120129=LM22675 (1A), 35594=02 Dec 2008, Lim Siong Boon, 147459=- LM2577-ADJ (1.23Vdc to 37Vdc output), 44324=LM2575 datasheet, 167245=LT1301.pdf, 111355=LM2678 datasheet, 124446=- LM22676-5.0 (5Vdc output), 35960=LM2575 Schematic taken from National Semiconductor LM2575 datasheet, 108913=33uH, 3A\u00a0 <for LM2596-3.3, LM2596-5.0>, 106093=LM2596 (3A), 113272=22uH, 5A\u00a0 <for LM2678-12>, 110790=- LM2678-ADJ (1.2Vdc to 37Vdc output), 103076=- LM2594-12 (12Vdc output), 73342=- LM2825-12 (12Vdc output), 78574=100uH, 3A\u00a0 <for LM2576-3.3, LM2576-5.0>, 24936=This is weird, as the same inductor and capacitor previously tested do not result in this same old problem. However the circuit shows the same failure symptom. The next thing that comes to mind, is the IC. The IC LM2576 from the previous working circuit is then transfer over the new circuit board for testing. Everything works fine. It is then clear that the problem comes from the IC itself., 155981=Output 5.0V from a 3.2V LI-ION battery using MCP1640, 72747=LM2825 (1A), 34744=12 June 2006, Lim Siong Boon, 116933=- LM22674-ADJ (1.2Vdc to Vin output), 177626=To find the range of resistor value that is available in the industrial, multiply the normalise standard found in the table in terms of 100, 1000, 45980=680uH, 1A\u00a0 <for LM2575-12, LM2575-15>, 148044=tested working on 2007-06-21, 108274=330uF (100V aluminium electrolytic, low ESR) <for LM2596-3.3, LM2596-5.0>, 42993=- LM2575-ADJ (1.23Vdc to 37Vdc output), 147301=- LM2577-12 (12Vdc output), 76060=tested working on 2007-06-26, 117483=LM22674 datasheet, 75216=- LM2576-12 (12Vdc output), 23514=Still it doesn't work. I guess that both IC LM2575, LM2576 must have been damage by my previous attempt. The capacitor used is suspected because the datasheet call for low ESR capacitor. It is very difficult to find these in the local shops, therefore I use a normal capacitor instead., 33530=The following experiment is done during the 1st test on LM2575 circuit.
