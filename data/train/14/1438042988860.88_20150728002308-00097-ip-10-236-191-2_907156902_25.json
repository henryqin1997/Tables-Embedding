The cost of attending CBC is more affordable than a university. It costs around $1000 per quarter, depending on how many credits you take. I am able to drive there from home and not have to pay additional housing costs., 110420=Finicial Aid is helpful if you apply. Books are always expensive if you buy from the campus book store, obviously. Usually tuition for 15 credits is $2000, that for one quarter., 194369=I'm in Running Start, so the cost is minimal, but others that I've talked to say that it's pretty cheap. About....1500 per quarter I think. Obviously, it depends on how many classes you take, though., 140362=Check out the CBC Foundation scholarship due February 21st. If you are a hard-worker, chances are you can get one. Make sure to register the first day available, thus, always check the CBC calendar. They have some cool classes such as Cardio Kickboxing and Lord of the Rings. Also, always arrive early for class at CBC. Plan to arrive twenty minutes before your first class, so you can find parking!, 14496=about $1500 a quarter, before paying for books. considering there are not really any other choices in the area, it's a good deal. if you're willing to move there are financial aid transfer options that make even an out-of-state college just as/more reasonably priced, too., 251344=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 177069=5 stars all the way. I pay roughtly $1600 a quarter for 18 credits a quarter. That is the cheapest (least expensive) college education I could find. And most of my professors are PhD's, which is awesome., 137699=If you are wanting to transfer and are tight on money, this is the way to go. You need about $1500 per quarter plus books which can be around $400. Then it's three quarters per year. Schools like the UW and WSU will honor your credits but they were less expensive.}",

Tips for prospective students You can register and pay for your classes online. You can even order your books from the bookstore online and they\u2019ll hold them for you. After you sign up for classes, you have to take an FYI class before you begin. It\u2019s a three hour class, three days in a row. You learn about educational planning, take a campus tour, and learn",
