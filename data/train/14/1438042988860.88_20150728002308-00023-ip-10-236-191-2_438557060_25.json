            "POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING POLYPROPYLENE - A composition can comprise: linear low density polyethylene having a melt mass flow rate as determined using ASTM D-1238 (190\u00b0 C./2.16 kg) in the range from 4 to 125 g/10 min or high density polyethylene having a melt mass flow rate as determined using ASTM D-1238 (190\u00b0 C./2.16 kg) in the range from 4 to 125 g/10 min and polypropylene, wherein the amount of polypropylene is from 0.005 to 10 wt % based on the total weight of the linear low density polyethylene or the high density polyethylene and the polypropylene, wherein the polypropylene has a melt temperature (T",
            "CATALYST COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME - The present invention relates to a catalyst composition for the polymerisation of olefins comprising a support containing a single site catalyst component, a catalyst activator and a modifier wherein the modifier is the product of reacting an aluminum compound of general formula AI(R1, R2, R3) with an amine compound of general formula N(R4, R5, R6). The catalyst composition reduces fouling and/or sheeting when used to catalyse the polymerisation of olefins. The present invention also relates to a method for the polymerisation of olefins using the catalyst composition of the invention."
