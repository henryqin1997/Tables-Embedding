When detecting congestion in itself, the congestion point samples each of the received packets based on a predetermined algorithm, and transmits a feedback message to the reaction point as a transmission source of the sampled packet. Each of the plurality of reaction points controls a target rate based on a reception situation of the feedback message, and sets the target rate to an initial value at an initialization timing which does not depend on the feedback message. 20130159415 Published Description Patent application number Miki Yamamoto, Osaka JP 08-23-2012 WASTE TONER RECOVERY UNIT - A waste toner recovery unit includes a waste toner conveying screw, a coating member, and a waste toner storing portion. The waste toner conveying screw has a first end and a second end and conveys waste toner, the first end being linked with a driving portion and the second end being set as a free end. The coating member coats the free end of the waste toner conveying screw by being fitted in a processing unit, has an opening to which waste toner conveyed by the",
