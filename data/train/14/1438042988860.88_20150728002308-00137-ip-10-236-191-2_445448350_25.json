Minor, Wells, ME US Patent application number Description Published 20130014526 Cryopreservation Device with Retrofitted Electronic Tracking Device - The present invention is a cryopreservation device that has the ability to track and record preserved specimens using an integrated electronics system. The cryopreservation device stores specimens within a preservation chamber. A sealing cap encloses the preservation chamber. The integrated electronics system is embedded within a base attachment. The base attachment can be retrofitted into the cryopreservation device using a mechanical locking system and a recessed surface and cavity within the cryopreservation device. The mechanical locking system secures the base attachment into the cryopreservation device using multiple spring-loaded barbs and locking receptacles. The base attachment inserts within the recessed surface and cavity. The integrated electronics system uses a control block to operate a plurality of sensors and to attain time dependent specimen data. The specimen data is saved within a storage device. The specimen data can be retrieved without physically connecting to the integrated electronics system using a communication device. 01-17-2013 Ray Carl Minor, Abingdon, VA US Patent application number Description Published",
