The use of ruby was not very popular while \"TOYO KANJI HYO\" (The list of KANJI characters for everyday use, issued by the Government on November 16, 1946) was put in effect because it discouraged the use of 'FURIGANA' in principle in its 'directions of use' section. \"Jouyou Kanji Hyou(\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868)\" (The list of kanji characters in common use, issued by the Government to replace \"Toyo Kanji Hyou (\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868)\" on October 10, 1981) has changed the scope of the list (\"Toyo Kanji Hyou\" defined the list of all Kanji characters that can be used for any documents, while \"Jouyou Kanji Hyou\" was designed to be a 'reference guide' for the use of Kanji to compose contemporary Japanese for general use in society.). For example, the preface of \"Jouyou Kanji Hyou\" states that one may consider the use of 'Furigana (Annotation to indicate pronouciation'\u00a0 when the text appears too difficult to read, which is why the use of ruby has been increasing today. The use of ruby was common in magazines and books, and even newspapers have begun to use ruby these days.}",

However, JIS X 4051 does not provide this information as a two dimensional table, but only as a textual description. (note 1) Also, it can be defined for each combination of the character classes (in a two dimensional table) whether the characters of classes appearing in sequence allow for having a break into two lines inbetween, or whether it is possible during line adjustment processing to add inter character space. In JIS X 4051 these items are also shown in a two dimensional table. Table 6 shows whether a break into two lines is possible, and table 7 shows if it is possible to add inter character space. For the presentation as a two dimensional table, it becomes necessary for each class to have separate items",
