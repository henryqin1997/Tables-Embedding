Significant conceptual advances will be made in the study of memory, Holocaust and immigration history, class and identity debates, gender analysis, oral and video history and the theory of testimony. A team of experienced CIs will analyse a broad sample of videos, while the APAI will concentrate on studying a single episode. The JHC will act as industry partner."

    "textBeforeTable": "This project investigates the challenges posed by cultural diversity in multicultural schools. It will focus specifically on students from Arabic-speaking background (ASB) attending secondary schools in the Northern and Western regions of Melbourne. The study will assess whether individual students' attitudes and the schools' structures and pedagogical ideology impact upon ASB students' achievements. In using focus group discussions and attitudinal surveys, the study will also test the cultural appropriateness of such methodological procedures. The study's proposed multi-dimensional model will be tested in order to determine the optimal social environments and inter-ethnic relations needed to successfully fulfill the potential of multicultural education.

At a time of declining unionisation, these issues have become urgent and give rise to key research questions about email and the Internet in trade union organisation and communication with members. The project promises to provide broader theoretical insights into union responses to deregulated labour markets and the globalisation of the economy. The results will be useful to other political and social organisations, as well as government policy makers.
