If the source value mapped to Accounted Amount Overwrite is 'Y', then an accounted amount must be provided. Accounted Amount Overwrite Accounting attribute groups are represented in the tables below: Accounting Attributes An example of accounting attributes of this type is Accounting Reversal Indicator. You may have values that control the behavior of the Create Accounting program when processing a specific accounting event or transaction object line. Values that Control the Behavior of the Create Accounting Program Examples of accounting attributes are Entered Currency Code and Entered Amount. You may have values that are subject to special processing or values that are stored in named columns in journal entry headers and lines. Values that are Subject to Special Processing The types of accounting attributes values are as follows: Line: To be used when creating subledger journal entry lines. Header: To be used when creating subledger journal entry headers. Each accounting attribute is associated with a level: The Create Accounting program uses these assignments to copy values from transaction objects to subledger journal entries. For example, you may map the invoice entered currency to the subledger journal entry entered currency. Once sources are assigned to accounting event classes, they are eligible for assignment to accounting attributes for the same accounting event classes.",

The Create Accounting program uses them to identify transaction (distributions) whose accounting impact should be reversed. For the Create Accounting program to successfully create a line accounting reversal, the accounting reversal indicator, distribution type, and first distribution identifier should always be assigned to sources.
