Afterwards thou shalt expose it in the pathway by which the sportsman will pass, and once he has passed by it, he need not hope to kill any game during that day. If thou shalt wish a second time to lay a spell upon him in like manner, thou needest but to expose the stick again in his path; but take care to bury it again in the earth under an elder tree, so as to be able to take it from thence each time that thou shalt have need of it; and to take it up each time as soon as the Sportsman shall have passed., 4133=There is another manuscript of this text in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France numbered Fr. 25,314, dated \"MDCXXXIV\" (1634), which can hardly be that old. Its title reads, \"LES CLAVICULES / DE SALOMON / Traduit de l'H\u00e9breux en Langue Latine, / Par le Rabin Abognazar, / ET / Mis en langue Vulgaire Par M. BARAULT Archev\u00eaque d'Arles.\" It is 141 pages long. The calligraphy appears to be the same as Lans. 1203, and both appear to have been executed by 'F. F. FYOT.' Because each of these two manuscripts contain errors not found in the other it is likely that both were copied from a common ancestor, and not one from the other. In general the two texts coincide exactly, but there are also many places where the wording of the two vary slightly. Since the two versions are too close to make a retranslation likely, the apparent explanation for the differences is simply creativity on the part of the scribe., 349810=[46. figure. Cp.

(M: Write thou this upon virgin parchment or paper with the blood of a bat, in the day and hour of Mars; and uncover it within the Circle, invoking the Demons whose Names are therein written; and thou shalt immediately see hail and tempest.) The versicle reads: Posuit pluvias eorum grandinem ignem coinburentem in terra justorum & destruxisti. Cp. Ps 104:32 \"posuit pluvias eorum grandinem ignem conburentem in terra ipsorum (33) et percussit vineas eorum et ficulneas eorum et contrivit lignum finium eorum\"], 227777=Then hang it from your collar with a cord, which has some wool from the stockings of the person that you desire.

According to Mathers, \"1203 Lansdowne MSS. is 'The Veritable Keys of Solomon translated from the Hebrew into the Latin language by the Rabbin Abognazar (?Aben Ezra).'
