The Packers-Giants game was the first Monday Night game hosted by the Giants., 125306=There was a player strike called after the completion of Week 2's games. As a result all games for Week 3 were canceled but unlike the 1982 players' strike, owners decided to resume play with replacement players. Replacement players were used in games played from Week 4 until Week 6 (including the 49ers-Giants, Raiders-Broncos, and Redskins-Cowboys MNF games). Once a new collective bargaining agreement ended the strike, regular players came back and played starting with Week 7., 15932=Wide receiver Dave Smith of the Pittsburgh Steelers became a part of Monday Night Football lore with an infamous mistake in the October 18th game against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Allen's new team, the Washington Redskins, clinched its first playoff berth since 1945 with a 38-24 victory over the Rams, also handing the NFC West championship to the San Francisco 49ers. Ironically, the 49ers ousted the Redskins from the playoffs with a 24-20 victory 13 days later.

Bears coach Mike Ditka elected not to start McMahon because of various ailments keeping him out of practice all week. ABC cameras kept showing McMahon begging Ditka to put him in the game. Finally, with the Vikings leading 17-9, McMahon entered the game and threw a 70-yard TD to Willie Gault on his first snap. The Bears immediately got the ball back at the Vikings' 25-yard line on the next series on a Wilber Marshall fumble recovery, and McMahon hit Dennis McKinnon on the very first play for a TD. Then, on the very next series, McMahon completed 3 of 5 passes and another TD to McKinnon. For the third quarter, McMahon had taken seven snaps and completed five passes for three TD's., 45348=The October 18 game featured Alex Karras singing a fight song written for the New York Jets by then-head coach Lou Holtz before the kickoff (which was repeated for the NFL Top 10 series in the episode on \"Coaches Who Belonged in College\")., 8498=Following their humiliating shutout in the November 16 game, the Cowboys would go on a seven-game winning streak, not losing until a deciding field goal in the final seconds of Super Bowl V against the Baltimore Colts., 71750=The November 24 game was the one where New Orleans Saints fans, watching what would become a dreadful 1-15 campaign that season, began wearing paper bags over their heads and referring to the team as the \"Aints\"., 93893=The October 24 game between the Cardinals and the Giants is the only five-quarter deadlock in MNF history, as the Cardinals' Neil O'Donoghue blows three field goal attempts in the extra period, one of them from extra-point distance.

NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, a former publicity director at the University of San Francisco, did not consider postponing the game. During the game, a large protest march to the steps of City Hall took place. A rarely discussed moment happened before the game just prior the national anthem. The stadium observed a moment of silence to honor the fallen mayor. Between that and the national anthem a truck backed into the stadium flag pole sending it crashing to the ground. It was a large wooden pole near the southern end zone. It shocked the crowd who were already uneasy from a very tragic day in San Francisco., 85291=In the January 3 game between the Cowboys and the Vikings, Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett ran for 99 yards and a touchdown - still the longest running play from scrimmage in the NFL. Worth noting is that the Cowboys had only ten players on offense when the ball was snapped on that play, fullback, Ron Springs did not get on to the field, in time, after Minnesota kicked off to Dallas, in the third quarter., 33494=The season-opening contest in Buffalo on September 16 marked the start of a three-year stint for Alex Karras as a color commentator for the show.
