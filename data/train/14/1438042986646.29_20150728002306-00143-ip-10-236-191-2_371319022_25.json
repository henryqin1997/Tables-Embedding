As a result, the rxbufsize for Fibre Channel interfaces is fixed at 2112 bytes. If the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch receives an rxbufsize from a peer that is different than 2112 bytes, it will fail the exchange of link parameters (ELP) negotiation and not bring the link up., 40391=Enter the system jumbomtu command to define the upper bound of any MTU in the system. The system jumbo MTU has a default value of 9216 bytes. The minimum MTU is 2240 bytes and the maximum MTU is 9216 bytes., 39355=The default drop system class has a default MTU of 1538 bytes.

The class map is a named object that represents a class of traffic. In the class map, you specify a set of match criteria for classifying the packets. You can then reference class maps in policy maps. Configuring Class Maps Configuring System Classes The priority flow control configured on an EtherChannel applies to all member interfaces. The service policy configured on an EtherChannel applies to all member interfaces. When configuring EtherChannels, note the following guidelines: Type qos policies can be activated only on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series interfaces and Cisco Nexus",

Traffic is classified by the criteria defined in the ACL. The permit and deny ACL keywords are ignored in the matching; even if a match criteria in the access-list has a deny action, it is still used for matching for this class.
