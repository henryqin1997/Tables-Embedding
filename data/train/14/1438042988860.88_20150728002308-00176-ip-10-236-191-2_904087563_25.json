The newest edition to ETSU campus is the disk golf course they added this past 2011-2012 school year., 368155=I look forward to my visit at ETSU in December.

There are some scholarships you can only apply for before your first year at ETSU., 367337=Touring in December, 184138=Familiarize yourself with a map of the campus. Get things done early to avoid lines. Parking is hardest to come by in the first couple of weeks, so arrive early, or pick classes later in the afternoon.
