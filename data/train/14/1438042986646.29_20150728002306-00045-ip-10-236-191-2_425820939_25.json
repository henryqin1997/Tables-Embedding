Cheng, Cypress, TX US 05-21-2015 BALL SEAT SYSTEM - The system and method for hydraulic fracturing includes a downhole tool with a sub, a sleeve, a ball seat support, and a ball seat holder. A ball dropped through the wellbore sits on the ball interface of the ball seat holder. Fluid flowing through the system pushes the ball against the ball interface, causing the ball seat holder to slide through the ball seat support and the ball interface to clamp the ball. A ball matches only a particular ball interface. Additional pressure forms a seal of the ball, the ball seat holder, and the ball seat support and moves the sleeve to slide through the sub and expose the throughbore to the annulus for the fracturing. Contact distributed between the ball, ball interface of the ball seat holder, and ball seat support withstands the temperature and pressure of the fracturing without deformation or failure of the ball. 20150136403 06-12-2014 PRESSURE CONTROLLED MULTI-SHIFT FRAC SLEEVE SYSTEM - A frac sleeve system includes an outer sleeve with openings, an inner sleeve with ports, a pressure seat, a bottom locking device and a spring device. In a closed configuration of the inner sleeve, the openings and ports are not aligned for any fluid connection. In an opened configuration, at least one opening is aligned with at least one port for a fluid connection through the system. The",

Castellated regions are formed on the edge of the component package using the appropriate sized drill or milling bit. Edge plating is applied to the castellated surfaces to create edge pads. The edge plating provides electrical continuity between the edge pads and the SMT pads. Solder mask, or other materials, is applied to prevent solder from wicking between each SMT pad and its respective edge pad. Such component may be attached to a larger device PWB using either the edge pads or the SMT pads, or may even be attached using a combination of the two, such as in the event of a pad failure or other defect. 10-08-2009 20120086270 Configurable Distributed Power Module - The present invention provides a configurable dc-dc power converter module and method of manufacture for such module.
