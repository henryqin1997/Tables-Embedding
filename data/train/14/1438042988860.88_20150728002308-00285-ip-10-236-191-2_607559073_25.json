            "The Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Program is an interactive processing system that allows the trained satellite analysts within the Satellite Services Division (SSD) to manually integrate data from various automated fire detection algorithms with GOES and polar (AdvancedVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Fire Algorithm (MODIS) images. The result is a quality controlled display of the locations of fires and significant smoke plumes detected by meteorological satellites.The Analyzed Fires from Satellites is the Hazard Mapping System (HMS) fire and smoke product, made by a satellite analyst who quality checks the fire positions (red) and annotates visible smoke (gray). The analysts' shift runs from about 1-11pm EST/EDT. The first thing the analyst does isupdate the analysis for the previous day, to ensure it includes all fires detected for that calendar day. Then work begins on the current day's analysis, which will be updated periodically throughout the shift.",
