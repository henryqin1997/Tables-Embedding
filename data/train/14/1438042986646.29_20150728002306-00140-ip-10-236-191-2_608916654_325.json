    "textAfterTable": "Introduction First of all, thanks for reading my FAQ. A thing you should know before stepping into the world of Totori's is that the game is tedious and time sensitive. It would be a good idea to read through any Character Endings requirements ahead of time or you will find yourself playing through the game multiple times. With 10 different endings, each with its own requirements, you will need to make multiple saves through the game to make sure you don't make any mistakes. I will explain this more in the ending section of this guide. I will try and guide you through this overwhelming information in the least amount of playthroughs possible, but mistakes are possible and you do not have to follow my advice. If you want me to add something or notice a mistake, please email me at the above address with the correct information. Donation Info Firstly, thanks to everyone who takes the time to read this.
