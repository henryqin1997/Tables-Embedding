Then to change the color scheme, you would change these core/accent color ramps and it will affect all the components it is including in. Global Selectors Global Selectors are selectors that affect more than one component. If the selector name ends in the :alias pseudo-class, then the selector is most likely included in other component-specific selectors. Defining properties for a selector that ends in :alias will most likely affect the skin for more than one component. For example, most, if not all of our components use the .AFDefaultFontFamily:alias definition to specify the font-family. If your skin overrides the .AFDefaultFontFamily:alias selector with a different font-family, that change will affect all the components that have included it in their selector definition. } background-color: red; { af|inputText::content /* Component-specific selector. */ } font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; .AFDefaultFontFamily:alias { /* Global selectors affect more than one component */ Examples of some ADF Faces Skin selectors:  This document lists the skin-selectors that can be used in an ADF Faces skin .css file to skin ADF Faces components.
