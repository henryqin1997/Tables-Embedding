    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students looking for a Historically Black College or University that can cater to the major of their choice. Tips for prospective students Student teacher ratio is where you are not just a number on the roll. Each professor gets to know each student on a one on one basis. Bang for the buck The tuition is based on a private institution, so financial aid is a very important asset. Am enjoying being here I enjoy the surroundings of Dillard University and the Staff has welcomed me with open arms. Am learning a lot I have been elected as the Freshman Class President and my classes are very interesting and the professors really care about the students learning abilities and assist with getting help if needed.
