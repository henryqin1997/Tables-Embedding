The implanted matrix releases the therapeutic agent by diffusion, chemical reaction, or solvent activators. See, for example, Lange, Science, 249, 1527 (1990)., 25795=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/361,194, filed Jul. 26, 1999, now U.S. Pat.

No. 5,015,578), UCN-01 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,415), TAN-999 (Japanese Patent Application No. 01,149,791), TAN-1030A (Japanese Patent Application No. 01,246,288), RK-286C (Japanese Patent Application No. 02,258,724) and functional equivalents and derivatives thereof. Derivatives of staurosporin include those discussed in Japanese Patent Application Nos. 03,72,485; 01,143,877; 02,09,819 and 03,220,194, as well as in PCT International Application Nos. WO 89 07,105 and WO 91 09,034 and European Patent Application Nos. EP 410,389 and EP 296,110. Derivatives of K-252, a natural product, are known. See, for example, Japanese Patent Application Nos. 63,295,988; 62,240,689; 61,268,687; 62,155,284; 62,155,285; 62,120,388 and 63,295,589, as well as PCT International Application No. WO 88 07,045 and European Patent Application No. EP 323,171., 195315=For the kinetic binding studies, A375 M/M and BO54 cells were seeded in sterile 96 well microtiter plates at 2500 cells/well. Plates were wrapped in aluminum foil, and incubated at 37\ufffd C. overnight in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. After approximately 18 hr, incubation plates were removed and cells were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes to prevent membrane turnover. Following fixation, the plates were exhaustively washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20\ufffd. Serial two-fold dilutions of an NR-AN-01 therapeutic conjugate containing Roridin A were prepared at protein concentrations of 10 mg/ml to 20 ng/ml, and each dilution was aliquoted into two wells. The plates were incubated at 4\ufffd C. with the NR-AN-01 for 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, after which the unbound protein was removed by aspiration and 100 ml of CS buffer was added (5% chicken serum/ 0.5% Tween-20\ufffd in PBS) to each well. CS buffer was removed and the NR-AN-01 therapeutic conjugate bound to the cells was visualized by adding 100 ml of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) to each well; incubating at 4\ufffd C. for 1 hr.; washing with PBS/0.05% Tween\ufffd to remove unbound goat IgG; and, adding 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS) chromogenic substrate (i.e., for HRP). After incubating for 30 minutes, the amount of NR-AN-01 bound to the cells was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 415 nm and 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader equipped for data acquisition by a Compaq computer., 140809=Another example is a delivery system in which a polymer that contains the therapeutic agent is injected into the area of the lesion in liquid form. The polymer then solidifies or cures to form the implant which is retained in situ. This technique is described in PCT WO 90/03768 (Donn, Apr. 19, 1990)., 501647=Five animals (3-1 mg and 2-0.01 mg) died post-surgically due to technical difficulties. Grossly, myonecrosis of the adjacent skeletal muscle (pale white regions of the musculature) was present in 3/3, 1/5, 0/4 and 0/5 animals in the 1 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.01 mg and control groups, respectively. Histologically, myonecrosis was confirmed in the adjacent skeletal muscle and in some regions of the tunica media of the left carotid artery in the 1 mg treatment group but not in the other groups. Morphometrically, there was no statistical significance in luminal area, neointimal area, area bounded by the internal elastic lamina, area of the tunica media, area bounded by the external elastic lamina or neointimal/medial ratio when compared by analysis of variance using the excell data analysis software package., 246602=Vascular smooth muscle cells at 40,000 cells/ml were seeded in sterile 24 well plates at 1 ml/well. The plates were incubated overnight at 37\ufffd C., 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified atmosphere (saturation). Log dilutions of the therapeutic agent of interest were incubated with the vascular smooth muscle cells for 5 minutes or 24 hours. Samples of the therapeutic agents were diluted in DMEM:F-12 medium (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, Md.) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) and 5% Serum Plus( (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kans.). Following therapeutic agent incubation, the solution was aspirated, and 1 ml/well of 0.5 microcurie/ml 3H-leucine in leucine-free DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) with 5% Serum Plus\ufffd was added. The plates were re-incubated overnight at 37\ufffd C., 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The cells were visually graded using an inverted microscope using a scoring scale to determine viability and cell number. The 1 to 3 grade is based upon percent of cell viability and number compared to control wells, with 3=100%, 2=70%-100% and 1=0%-70%. A record of this scoring assisted in determining the immediate cytotoxic effect of the therapeutic agents. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with cold 5% TCA. 400 microliters of 0.2 M NaOH was added per well, and the plates were incubated for two hours at room temperature on a rotating platform. 200 microliters per well of the cell solution was transferred into plastic scintillation vials (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and 4 milliliters of Bio-Safe\ufffd II liquid scintillation fluid (Research Products InterCorp., Mount Prospect, Ill.) was added prior to vortexing. Vials were counted on a Beckman LS2800 liquid scintillation counter interfaced with Beckman \u201cData Capture\u201d software for conversion to a Lotus 1-2-3\ufffd file and analysis using Lotus 1-2-3\ufffd., 459114=The artery from animal 1281, which had been treated for at two weeks with taxol, had no intimal proliferation, minimal adventitial fribrosis and marked cell necrosis in the tunica media with mild heterophil infiltration. Focal areas of necrosis and dystrophic mineraliztion were present in the adventitia and perivascular clot tissue. The artery from the control animal (1280) had moderate intimal proliferation, with marked organization of the adventitia and perivascular clot. The lumen was 100% re-endothelized and the tunica media SMCs were viable in the control artery., 73145=Characteristics of pericytes include a histological morphology (under light microscopic examination) characterized by an irregular cell shape. Pericytes are found within the basement membrane that surrounds vascular endothelial cells and their identity may be confirmed by positive immuno-staining with antibodies specific for alpha smooth muscle actin (e.g., anti-alpha-sm1, Biomakor, Rehovot, Israel), HMW-MAA, and pericyte ganglioside antigens e.g., MAb 3G5 (Schlingemann et al., Am. J. Pathol., 136: 1393-1405 (1990)); and, negative immuno-staining with antibodies to cytokeratins (i.e., epithelial and fibroblast markers) and von Willdebrand factor (i.e., an endothelial marker). Both vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes are positive by immunostaining with the NR-AN-01 monoclonal antibody., 163681=A therapeutically effective dosage is generally the pericellular agent dosage in smooth muscle cell tissue culture, i.e., a dosage at which at a continuous exposure results in a therapeutic effect between the toxic and minimal effective doses. This therapeutic level is obtained in vivo by determining the size, number and therapeutic agent concentration and release rate required for particles infused between the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall to maintain this pericellular therapeutic dosage. The dosage form should release the therapeutic agent at a rate that approximates the pericellular dose of the following exemplary therapeutic agents: from about 0.01 to about 100 micrograms/ml nitroglycerin, from about 1.0 to about 1000 micrograms/ml of suramin, from about 0.001 to about 100 micrograms/ml for cytochalasin, and from about 0.01 to about 105 nanograms/ml of staurosporin as well as from about 0.001 to about 100 micrograms/ml taxol. Thus, for cytochalasin B, the sytemic dose results in about 5 to about 40, preferably about 8 to about 30, lambda of the solution entering the interstitial space surrounding the cells of the tunica media, and about 0.01 to about 4, preferably about 0.05 to about 3, ml of the solution delivered to the wall of the vessel via the adventitia., 27906=The processes responsible for stenosis after PTCA are not completely understood but may result from a complex interplay among several different biologic agents and pathways. Viewed in histological sections, restenotic lesions may have an overgrowth of smooth muscle cells in the intimal layers of the vessel (Johnson et al., Circulation 78 (Suppl. 11): II-82 (1988)). Several possible mechanisms for smooth muscle cell proliferation after PTCA have been suggested (Popma et al., Amer. J. Med., 88: 16N-24N (1990); Fanelli et al, Amer. Heart Jour., 119: 357-368 (1990); Liu et al., Circulation, 79: 1374-1387 (1989); Clowes et al., Circ. Res., 56: 139-145 (1985))., 248653=Vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated in complete medium with 5% FBS (Gibco) overnight at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment in sterile 24 well plates. The medium was aspirated from the wells and serum free medium supplemented with growth factors (DMEM: F-12 basal medium supplemented with growth factor cocktail, catalog number 11884, which contains insulin (5 micrograms/ml), transferrin (5 micrograms/ml) and sodium selenite (5 nanograms/ml), available from Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) was added. Cells were incubated in this medium for 24 hours. For a 5 minute therapeutic agent exposure, log dilutions of the therapeutic agent were incubated with the cells in complete medium. After 5 minutes and medium aspiration, 1 ml/well of 1.0 microcurie/ml 3H-thymidine dispersed in complete medium was added. The 24 hour exposure involved incubation of the cells with 1 ml/well of 1.0 microcurie/ml of 3H-thymidine dispersed in complete medium and log dilutions of the therapeutic agent being tested. In both exposure trials, the cells were then incubated overnight at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. The cells were visually scored for viability and cell number. Cells were washed and prepared for transfer into plastic scintillation vials as described for the 3H-leucine protocol. Vials were counted on a Beckman LS2800 liquid scintillation counter interfaced with Beckman \u201cData Capture\u201d software for conversion to a Lotus 1-2-3\ufffd file and analysis using Lotus 1-2-3\ufffd., 141130=Another example is the delivery of a therapeutic agent by polymeric endoluminal sealing. This technique uses a catheter to apply a polymeric implant to the interior surface of the lumen. The therapeutic agent incorporated into the biodegradable polymer implant and is thereby released at the surgical site. This technique is described in PCT WO 90/01969 (Schindler, Aug. 23, 1989), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 448589=The arteries in the animals in Group 1a and 1b were treated with 20 mg of cytochalasin B in 1 g of a bovine collagen gel (BioCore, Inc., Topeka, Kans.) that was supported by, or enclosed in, a bovine collagen mesh wrap (Skin Temp-Biosynthetic Skin Dressing, BioCore, Inc., Topeka, Kans.). At 1 week post treatment, the cytochalasin B treated artery in animal 1233 showed no intimal or adventital proliferation. There was marked cell death in the outer zone of the tunica media with heterophils infiltrating the tunica media. Heterophils were present outside the wrap, but cytochalasin B inhibited heterophils and macrophages from infiltrating the wrap. The artery of the control (1249) animal had moderate intimal proliferation, and heterophils and histiocytes were infiltrating into the wrap. Cell death in the tunica media was minimal., 400244=To determine the metabolism of 3H-cytochalasin B in human blood, 3H-cytochalasin B (8 \u03bcg/ml) was dissolved in saline; 1:1 dilution of saline and human plasma; or 1:1 dilution of saline and human whole blood. The mixtures were incubated for 20 hours at 37\ufffd C. and then analyzed by HPLC for stability and metabolism. 3H-cytochalasin B was not metabolized when mixed with either saline or plasma. However, 3H-cytochalasin B was metabolized by human whole blood with the metabolite having an HPLC retention time and profile consistent with that seen in the human liver slice assay (see above)., 184529=To 0.5 g (0.94 mmol) of Roridin A, 15 ml of dichloromethane was added. To this solution with stirring was added 0.104 g (1.04 mmol) of succinic anhydride. To the reaction mixture, 0.2 ml of triethylamine in 5 ml dichloromethane was added. To the homogeneous reaction mixture, a catalytic amount of dimethylaminopyridine was added and stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. Completion of the reaction was followed by thin layer chromatography (CH2Cl2: CH3OH=9.7:0.3 with few drops of acetic acid). At the end of the reaction, 0.3 ml of glacial acetic acid was added and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The dried crude residue was partitioned between water and methylene chloride. The combined methylene chloride extracts (3\ufffd50 ml) were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, solvent was removed under vacuum and dried to yield 0.575 g (96%) of a crude mixture of three compounds. Preparative C18 HPLC separation of the crude mixture in 50% acetonitrile-water with 2% acetic acid yielded 0.36 g (60%) of 2 as a white solid., 465053=Animals 1307, 1308 and 1309 were exposed to a cytochalasin B (1%) wrap for 2 weeks which was then removed. Four weeks after removal the animals were sacrificed. The artery from animal 1307 had moderate initmal proliferation with focal areas of thickening due to mural thrombus organization by SMCs. There was significant loss of cells from the tunica media and the elastic elamina appear collapsed. A few heterophils were present in the adventitia. There were areas or sections in the wrap area with minimal intimal proliferation. The artery from animal 1308 showed moderate intimal proliferation with areas of marked cell loss in the tunica media and dystrophic minearalization in the outer zone of the tunica media. The vessel was 100% re-endothelized. The artery from animal 1309 had marked intimal proliferation with a well organized aventiticia and perivascular region. Animal 1311 was not evaluated due to thrombosis. The results of the artery from animal 1312 were quite variable, with sections showing a range of intimal proliferation, from mild to moderate. Endothelization appeared to be complete in these arteries., 463324=While there was moderate intimal proliferation in the arteries of some animals, the proliferation in these arteries was still less than the controls in Group 9b. The mannitol control silicone wraps were on the artery for two weeks following balloon trauma and then removed and the animal necropsied and the artery histologically evaluated 1 week following wrap removal. Two of the arteries (1267 and 1268) had moderate intimal proliferation with 100% re-endothelization and one had maximum proliferation. The one with maximum intimal prolifertion had an acute occluding thrombus present., 162944=Thus, in a preferred embodiment, about 0.3 atm (i.e., 300 mm of Hg) to about 3 atm of pressure applied for 15 seconds to 3 minutes to the arterial wall is adequate to achieve infiltration of a sustained release dosage form bound to the NR-AN-01 binding protein into the smooth muscle layers of a mammalian artery wall. Wolinsky et al., \u201cDirect Intraarterial Wall Injection of Microparticles Via a Catheter: A Potential Drug Delivery Strategy Following Angioplasty,\u201d Am. Heart Jour., 122(4):1136-1140, 1991. Those skilled in the art will recognize that infiltration of a sustained release dosage form into a target cell population will probably be variable and will need to be determined on an individual basis., 185736=To 0.3 g (0.476 mmol) of 2\u2032 Roridin A hemisuccinic acid in 30 ml dichloromethane, 0.055 g (0.478 mmol) N-hydroxysuccinimide was added. To the clear reaction mixture, 0.108 g (0.524 mmol) dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. Completion of the reaction was followed by TLC (CH2Cl2: CH3OH=9.7:0.3 with a few drops of acetic acid) as a developing solvent. A few drops of glacial acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. To the dried residue dichloromethane was added and the precipitated DCU was filtered. Solvent from the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure to yield a white solid. From the crude product, 0.208 g (60%) of 3 was purified by preparative HPLC in 50% acetonitrile with 2% acetic acid as a mobile phase., 59302=\u201cVascular remodeling\u201d means a diminution in vessel lumen volume, diameter or area that is not the result of neointimal thickening or smooth muscle cell proliferation, and which generally occurs after a procedural vascular trauma. Thus, a reduction in the area (\u201cconstriction\u201d) circumscribed by the internal elastic lamina or membrane (IEL) without significant amounts of neointimal formation is termed \u201cvascular remodeling.\u201d See Isner, Circ 89, 2937 (1994). The luminal cross-sectional area of a vessel can be measured by direct planimetering, e.g., by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or at necropsy. As used herein, \u201cvascular remodeling\u201d does not include compensatory enlargement of a vessel which accompanies neointimal proliferation so as to accomodate the intimal increase. This compensatory enlargement has also been referred to as \u201cpositive\u201d vascular remodeling., 65821=There are two broad classes of trichothecenes: those that have only a central sesquiterpenoid structure and those that have an additional macrocyclic ring (simple and macrocyclic trichothecenes, respectively). The simple trichothecenes may be subdivided into three groups (i.e., Group A, B, and C) as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,744,981 and 4,906,452 (incorporated herein by reference). Representative examples of Group A simple trichothecenes include: scirpene, roridin C, dihydrotrichothecene, scirpen-4, 8-diol, verrucarol, scirpentriol, T-2 tetraol, pentahydroxyscirpene, 4-deacetylneosolaniol, trichodermin, deacetylcalonectrin, calonectrin, diacetylverrucarol, 4-monoacetoxyscirpenol, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol, 7-hydroxydiacetoxyscirpenol, 8-hydroxydiacetoxy-scirpenol (neosolaniol), 7,8-dihydroxydiacetoxyscirpenol, 7-hydroxy-8-acetyldiacetoxyscirpenol, 8-acetylneosolaniol, NT-1, NT-2, HT-2, T-2, and acetyl T-2 toxin. Representative examples of Group B simple trichothecenes include: trichothecolone, trichothecin, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 5-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol, nivalenol, 4-acetylnivalenol (fusarenon-X), 4,15-idacetylnivalenol, 4,7,15-triacetylnivalenol, and tetra-acetylnivalenol. Representative examples of Group C simple trichothecenes include: crotocol and crotocin. Representative macrocyclic trichothecenes include verrucarin A, verrucarin B, verrucarin J (Satratoxin C), roridin A, roridin D, roridin E (satratoxin D), roridin H, satratoxin F, satratoxin G, satratoxin H, vertisporin, mytoxin A, mytoxin C, mytoxin B, myrotoxin A, myrotoxin B, myrotoxin C, myrotoxin D, roritoxin A, roritoxin B, and roritoxin D. In addition, the general \u201ctrichothecene\u201d sesquiterpenoid ring structure is also present in compounds termed \u201cbaccharins\u201d isolated from the higher plant Baccharis megapotamica, and these are described in the literature, for instance as disclosed by Jarvis et al. (Chemistry of Alleopathy, ACS Symposium Series No. 268: ed. A. C. Thompson, 1984, pp. 149-159) and Jarvis & Mazzola (Acc. Chem. Res. 15:338-395, 1982)). Trichothecenes are also produced by soil fungi of the class Fungi imperfecti (Bamburg, J. R. Proc. Molec. Subcell. Biol. 8:41-110, 1983)), 455850=The arteries of the animals in Group 4a and b that were treated with 100 mg cytochalasin B (10% wt/wt) in a 1 g silicone wrap had significant inhibition of intimal proliferation at all time points. In the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery of animal 1259, there was no intimal proliferation or adventitial fibrosis present at one week after treatment. Ectatic vessels were present in the adventitia and the perivascular clot was unorganized and composed of only fibrin. There was marked cell loss from the tunica media, especially in the outer zone. Heterophils were seen infiltrating the tunica media. In the control artery (1206), there was no intimal proliferation at 1 week; however, there was early fibrous organization of the perivascular clot. Cellular loss from the tunical media was more diffuse than in the cytochalasin B wrap which was most severe in the outer zone., 191222=Conjugation reactions were performed at pH 8.0 in borate buffer in the presence of 25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent at room temperature with gentle mixing for 45 minutes prior to purification by gel permeation chromatography. The molar trichothecene drug precursor to antibody offerings were 25:1 and 40:1 for the 2\u2032 and 13\u2032 Roridin A analogues (3 and 8), respectively. Antibody concentration was 0.9 to 1.0 mg/ml during the conjugation reaction., 108858=It will be recognized that NR-AN-01 is just one example of a vascular smooth muscle binding protein that specifically associates with the 400 kD CSPG target, and that other binding proteins associating with this target and other epitopes on this target (Bumol et al., PNAS USA, 79: 1245-1249 (1982)) are also useful in the therapeutic conjugates and methods of the invention., 94664=Preferred lactic acid/glycolic acid polymer containing matrix particles of the present invention are prepared by emulsion-based processes, that constitute modified solvent extraction processes, see, for example, processes described by Cowsar et al., \u201cPoly(Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microcapsules for Controlled Release of Steroids,\u201d Methods Enzymology, 112:101-116, 1985 (steroid entrapment in microparticles); Eldridge et al., \u201cBiodegradable and Biocompatible Poly(DL-Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microspheres as an Adjuvant for Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B Toxoid Which Enhances the Level of Toxin-Neutralizing Antibodies,\u201d Infection and Immunity, 59:2978-2986, 1991 (toxoid entrapment); Cohen et al., \u201cControlled Delivery Systems for Proteins Based on Poly(Lactic/Glycolic Acid) Microspheres,\u201d Pharmaceutical Research, 8(6):713-720, 1991 (enzyme entrapment); and Sanders et al., \u201cControlled Release of a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analogue from Poly(D,L-Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Microspheres,\u201d J. Pharmaceutical Science, 73(9):1294-1297, 1984 (peptide entrapment)., 463931=The arteries in the animals in Groups 10 and 11 were treated with 10 mg cytochalasin B loaded in 1 g of a silicone wrap (1% wt/wt) that was applied to the artery for 2 weeks, surgically removed, and histologically evaluated 2 or 4 weeks later, respectively. No significant difference was seen by qualitative evaluation between the test and control animals. Animals 1304 and 1305 had a cytochalasin B (1%) wrap for 2 weeks which was then removed. Two weeks after the removal the animal was sacrificed. The artery from animal 1304 showed moderate initmal proliferation in most areas of the wrap, in areas of marked tunica media cell necrosis and wall dystrophic mineralization the proliferation was mild. There was 100% re-endothelization and no heterophils were present in the intima or tunica media. The adventitia and perivascular clot area was well organized. The artery from animal 1305 was similar to the artery from animal 1304 morphologically. The artery from animal 1306 showed marked intimal proliferation, no infiltrating heterophils in the intima or tunica media and was 100% re-endothelized., 235403=Five weeks following the traumatization and treatment of the arteries, the animals were sedated with 0.6 ml Telazol\ufffd (tiletamine hydrochloride; A.H. Robins Co., Richmond, Va.) and 0.5 ml xylazine (Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, Iowa) per 30 lb body weight by intramuscular injection, heparinized (i.v. 2 ml sodium heparin, 1000 units/ml), and euthanized by i.v. pentobarbital. Both the right and left carotid and femoral arteries were removed with normal vessel included both proximal and distal to the treated segment. The arteries were measured and the location of ligatures and gross abnormalities noted. The arteries were transected at 2 mm intervals and arranged in order in cryomolds with O.C.T. (optimum cutting temperature) compound (Tissue Tek\ufffd, Miles Laboratories Inc., Elkhart, Ind.) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The blocks were sectioned at 5 microns and stained with H&E, Massons Trichrome and Movats Pentachrome for morphological studies. Sections were also used for immunohistological staining of vascular smooth muscle., 107395=In a preferred embodiment, e.g., a \u201ctarget\u201d is exemplified by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and a discrete portion (termed an epitope herein) of the CSPG molecule having an apparent molecular weight of about 250 kD is especially preferred as a target. The 250 kD target is an N-linked glycoprotein that is a component of a larger 400 kD proteoglycan complex (Bumol et al., PNAS USA, 79: 1245-1249 (1982)). In one presently preferred embodiment of the invention, a vascular smooth muscle binding protein is provided by the NR-AN-01 monoclonal antibody (a subculture of NR-ML-05) that binds to an epitope in a vascular smooth muscle CSPG target molecule. The monoclonal antibody designated NR-ML-05 reportedly binds a 250 kD CSPG synthesized by melanoma cells (Morgan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,255)., 455097=At three weeks, the arteries of animals 1248 and 1246 showed reminants of the collagen wrap; however, the wrap was less resolved in the cytochalasin B treated animal (1248) than in the control (1246). This retardation of wrap resorbsion may result from cytochalasin B inhibition of macrophage migration and function. Both the treated and control had a moderate amount of intimal hyperplasia at 3 weeks, so there was no significant amount of intimal inhibition by cytochalasin B when administered in the pluronic gel. Foci of dystrophic mineralization were seen in the cytochalasin B treated artery. Thus, no inhibitory effect on the intima was observed in these animals (Group 3) at 1, 2 or 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment., 458391=The arteries in the animals in Group 5a and b were treated with 50 mg taxol in 1 g of a silicone wrap (5% wt/wt). This treatment showed marked inhibition of intimal proliferation at all time points. The taxol wrap-treated artery (animal 1278 at 1 week) had no intimal or adventitial proliferation and the perivascular clot was fibrinous and unorganized. There was a marked loss of tunica media cells and no endothelial lining present. The control (1279) had mild intimal proliferation with very early fibrosis of the fibrinous perivascular clot. The lumen was approximately 85% re-endothelized. Both the treated and control arteries had mild heterophil infiltration into the tunica media and adventitia., 460235=In Group 6a and 6b, taxol-treated arteries also had a marked inhibition 2 weeks after the wrap was removed. Animal 1276 had a taxol wrap for 2 weeks, then the wrap was removed and the animal sacrificed 3 weeks later. Following the 3 week recovery period from the taxol wrap removal (1276) there was only minimal intimal proliferation, except in a few focal areas that appeared to be thickened due to SMC organization of mural thrombi, in this artery. The adventitia was well organized and there was a significant cell loss in the tunica media but the cells present were viable. The lumen was approximately 90% re-endothelized. The control (1277) artery had marked intimal proliferation, well organized perivascular and adventical tissue and was 100% re-endothelized., 215929=MTT assays were conducted at 48 hours following a 5-minute exposure of target and non-target cells to RA or RA-NR-AN-01 conjugates. Target cells in these studies included BO54 and A375, and non-target cells included HT29 cells. Sterile 96 well microtiter plates were seeded with 2500 cells/well, wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2/95% air for 16-18 hours. Serial two-fold dilutions of Roridin A (RA), 2\u2032RA-HS-NR-AN-01 and 13\u2032RA-HS-NR-AN-01 were prepared from 400 ng/ml to 780 pg/ml, and 100 ml aliquots of the dilutions were dispensed into duplicate wells. After 5 minutes exposure to the test samples, the cells were washed to remove the test samples, and fresh medium was added. The cells were allowed 48 hours of recovery prior to testing: i.e., plates were incubated for 48 hours, and then cellular metabolic activity was determined by adding 20 ml/well of a 5 mg/ml MTT solution. The plates were covered and incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 4 hours and then the reaction was developed as described above (see EXAMPLE 4, above). The dark blue solubilized formazan reaction product was developed at room temperature after a 16-18 hour incubation. The samples were quantified using an ELISA microtiter plate reader at an absorbance of 570 nm., 134843=An example of targeted local delivery by an implant is the use of a stent. Stents are designed to mechanically prevent the collapse and reocclusion of the coronary arteries or other vessels. Incorporation of a therapeutic agent into the stent can deliver the therapeutic agent directly to the lesion. Local delivery of agents by this technique is described in Koh, Pharmaceutical Technology (October, 1990)., 456747=The cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery of animal 1253 had minimal intimal proliferation at two weeks, compared to the control (1258) wrap-treated artery which had maximal intimal proliferation. The intimal proliferation in the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery was irregular and appeared to be the result of organizing mural thombi by infiltrating SMC. There was only loose thin layers of platelets in the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery, with margination of heterophils. There was no endothelization in the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery and <20% endothelization in the control artery. The perivascular clot was unorganized and remained fibinous in the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery and well organized in the control artery. The control artery had minimal cell loss from the tunica media while the cytochalasin B wrap-treated artery had marked cell loss., 224647=Intimal smooth muscle proliferation that follows balloon catheter-induced trauma is a good model to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of conjugates for inhibiting smooth muscle cell activity in vivo in response to vascular trauma, including restenosis following angioplasty. Domestic pigs were used to study the effects of NR-AN-01 (i.e., termed vascular smooth muscle binding protein or simply VSMBP in these studies; and therapeutic conjugates with Roridin A are termed VSMBP-RA). The events which normally follow balloon angioplasty in the porcine artery have been described previously (Steele et al., Circ. Res., 57: 105-112 (1985)). In these studies, dilation of the carotid artery using an oversized balloon (balloon: artery ratio approximately 1.5:1) resulted in complete endothelial denudation over an area of 1.5-2 cm in length. Although this length of traumatic injury was selected in an attempt to minimize thrombosis, there was still marked platelet deposition and thrombus formation. The procedure also resulted in dissection through the internal elastic lamina into the arterial media and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells. Intimal thickening due to smooth muscle proliferation was apparent 7 days after injury and reached a mean maximum thickness of 85 mm at 14 days. The histological appearance of this neointima is very similar to the proliferative neointimal tissue of human restenosis (Schwartz et al., Circ., 82: 2190 -2200 (1990))., 193117=Assessment of degree of antibody derivatization was performed by first hydrolyzing an aliquot of conjugate in 0.2 M carbonate, pH 10.3 for 4 hours (at room temperature for 2\u2032 conjugate or at 37\ufffd C. for the 13\u2032 conjugate) followed by filtration through a PM-30 membrane. The filtrate was then assayed for Roridin A on C-18 reverse phase HPLC using a mobile phase of 50:48:2 ratio CH3CN:H2O:HOAC, respectively. A 1.32 correction factor was used to correct for parallel macrocyclic ring decomposition that gives polar products during the hydrolysis of the 13\u2032 conjugate., 26796=Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is widely used as the primary treatment modality in many patients with coronary artery disease. PTCA can relieve myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease by reducing lumen obstruction and improving coronary flow. The use of this surgical procedure has grown rapidly, with 39,000 procedures performed in 1983, nearly 150,000 in 1987, 200,000 in 1988, 250,000 in 1989, and over 500,000 PTCAs per year are estimated by 1994 (Popma et al., Amer. J. Med., 88: 16N-24N (1990); Fanelli et al, Amer. Heart Jour., 119: 357-368 (1990); Johnson et al., Circulation, 78 (Suppl. II): 11-82 (1988)). Stenosis following PTCA remains a significant problem, with from 25% to 35% of the patients developing restenosis within 1 to 3 months. Restenosis results in significant morbidity and mortality and frequently necessitates further interventions such as repeat angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery. As of 1993, no surgical intervention or post-surgical treatment has proven effective in preventing restenosis., 453771=The vessels in the animals in Group 3a and 3b were treated with 8 mg cytochalasin B in 100 mg of a pluronic gel (F-127, BASF) that was supported by a 1 cm\ufffd1 cm bovine collagen mesh wrap. One week after treatment, the cytochalasin B treated artery of animal 1250 had mild intimal proliferation that was irregular in thickness. There was approximately 30% re-endothelization and the tunica media cells were viable with the most significant loss (mild) being in the inner zone of the tunica media. There was a marked pyogranulomatous reaction to the pluronic gel in the perivascular and adventitial region. Complete thrombosis of the control artery from animal 1261 prevented its evaluation., 28624=Compounds that reportedly suppress smooth muscle proliferation in vitro (Liu et al., Circulation, 79: 1374-1387 (1989); Goldman et al., Atherosclerosis, 65: 215-225 (1987); Wolinsky et al., JACC, 15 (2): 475-481 (1990)) may have undesirable pharmacological side effects when used in vivo. Heparin is an example of one such compound, which reportedly inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro but when used in vivo has the potential adverse side effect of inhibiting coagulation. Heparin peptides, while having reduced anti-coagulant activity, have the undesirable pharmacological property of having a short pharmacological half-life. Attempts have been made to solve such problems by using a double balloon catheter, i.e., for regional delivery of the therapeutic agent at the angioplasty site (e.g., Nabel et al., Science, 244: 1342-1344 (1989); U.S. Pat. No. 4,824,436), and by using biodegradable materials impregnated with a drug, i.e., to compensate for problems of short half-life (e.g., Middlebrook et al., Biochem. Pharm., 38 (18): 3101-3110 (1989); U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,602)., 74242=Thus, procedural vascular traumas within the scope of the present treatment method include (1) organ transplantation, such as heart, kidney, liver and the like, e.g., involving vessel anastomosis; (2) vascular surgery, e.g., coronary bypass surgery, biopsy, heart valve replacement, atheroectomy, thrombectomy, and the like; (3) transcatheter vascular therapies (TVT) including angioplasty, e.g., laser angioplasty and PTCA procedures, employing balloon catheters, and indwelling catheters; (4) vascular grafting using natural or synthetic materials, such as in saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts, dacron and venous grafts used for peripheral arterial reconstruction, etc.; (5) placement of a mechanical shunt, e.g., a PTFE hemodialysis shunt used for arteriovenous communications; and (6) placement of an intravascular stent, which may be metallic, plastic or a biodegradable polymer. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/389,712, filed Feb. 15, 1995, which is incorporated by reference herein. For a general discussion of implantable devices and biomaterials from which they can be formed, see H. Kambic et al., \u201cBiomaterials in Artificial Organs\u201d, Chem. Eng. News, 30 (Apr. 14, 1986), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 360489=9) Endogenous, cross-reactive sites on the sections were blocked with normal goat serum (1:25 in PBS) for 20 min;, 88870=microparticles (e.g., from about 0.5 micrometers to about 100 micrometers in diameter, with about 0.5 to about 2 micrometers more preferred; or from about 0.01 micrometers to about 200 micrometers in diameter, preferably from about 0.5 to about 50 micrometers, and more preferably from about 2 to about 15 micrometers) or nanoparticles (e.g., from about 1.0 nanometer to about 1000 nanometers in diameter, with about 50 to about 250 nanometers being more preferred; or from about 0.01 nanometer to about 1000 nanometers in diameter, preferably from about 50 to about 200 nanometers), free flowing powder structure;, 137325=Another example of targeted local delivery by an implant is the use of an adventitial wrap. The wrap comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier matrix, e.g., a Pluronic gel which is free, or contained by a collagen mesh, which gel has dispersed therein a therapeutic agent. One embodiment of the invention is a pluronic gel (F-127, BASF) which is soluble at 4\ufffd C. but solidifies at 37\ufffd C., e.g., on contact with fluid or tissue in a human. To prepare a pluronic gel containing wrap, 4 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (Circ. Res., vol. 76, April 1995), was added to 1 g of pluronic gel F-127, which was mixed overnight at 4\ufffd C. The therapeutic agent was added to the mixture prior to local administration. The mixture may be applied directly to a surgically exposed artery wall, or may be applied to the surface of a bovine collagen mat (BioCore, Inc., Topeka, Kans.), which is then wrapped around the artery and the edges joined by sutures., 462282=The arteries of Group 8a animals, which were treated with 10% cytochalasin B for 2 weeks, then the wrap was removed and vessels evaluated 2 weeks later, had variable intimal proliferation within and between animals. The artery of animal 1254 had variable intimal proliferation which ranged from none to mild, well developed adventitial fibrosis, marked cell loss in the tunic media and focal areas of dystrophic mineralization in the outer tunica media and adventitia. The mild intimal proliferation areas were at the ends of the wrap area, suggesting an infiltration from the adjacent untreated artery regions. The lumen was approximately 60% re-endothelized. The artery of animal 1255 had mild to moderate intimal proliferation, viable cells in the tunica media and well organized tissue in the adventitia. The lumen was 100% re-endothelized. The artery in animal 1256 was completely thrombosed. Proximal to the chronic thrombus in the area of the wrap was an acute thrombus and there was moderate intimal proliferation., 360895=13) Sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled (HRPO) goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, Pa.; diluted 1:20 in PBS) and 4% human AB serum for 30 min;, 141592=Yet another example of local delivery is by direct injection of vesicles or microparticles into the lesion or artery wall adjacent to the lesion. These microparticles may be composed of substances such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates or synthetic polymers. These microparticles have the therapeutic agent incorporated throughout the microparticle or onto the microparticle as a coating. Delivery systems incorporating microparticles are described in Lange, Science, 249, 1527 (1990) and Mathiowitz et al., J. App. Poly. Sci., 26, 809 (1981)., 499174=Cytochalasin B and taxol were administered periadventially. Three groups of seven adult male rats underwent balloon trauma of the left carotid artery immediately followed by periadventitial placement of either cytochalasin B crystals (7.8-11.8 mg/rat), taxol crystals (3.4-6.5 mg/rat), or no drug (control). The cytochalasin B and taxol crystals were placed in a uniform pattern which covered the surgically exposed surface of the carotid artery, followed by closure of surrounding subcutaneous skin and tissues by sutures. Fourteen days later rats were sacrificed and their carotid arteries processed for histologic and morphometric analysis., 97364=Release of the therapeutic agent from the particle dosage forms of the present invention can occur as a result of both diffusion and particle matrix erosion. The biodegradation rate directly effects the kinetics of therapeutic agent release. The biodegradation rate is regulable by alteration of the composition or structure of the sustained release dosage form. For example, alteration of the lactide/glycolide ratio in preferred dosage forms of the present invention can be conducted, as described by Tice et al., \u201cBiodegradable Controlled-Release Parenteral Systems,\u201d Pharmaceutical Technology, pp. 26-35, 1984; by inclusion of agents that alter the rate of polymer hydrolysis, such as citric acid and sodium carbonate, as described by Kent et al., \u201cMicroencapsulation of Water Soluble Active Polypeptides,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 4,675,189; by altering the loading of therapeutic agent in the lactide/glycolide polymer, the degradation rate being inversely proportional to the amount of therapeutic agent contained therein, by judicious selection of an appropriate analog of a common family of therapeutic agents that exhibit different potencies so as to alter said core loadings; and by variation of particle size, as described by Beck et al., \u201cPoly(DL-Lactide-Co-Glycolide)/Norethisterone Microcapsules: An Injectable Biodegradable Contraceptive,\u201d Biol. Reprod., 28:186-195, 1983, or the like. All of the aforementioned methods of regulating biodegradation rate influence the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer containing matrix, thereby altering the hydration rate thereof.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes All publications and patents are incorporated by reference herein, as though individually incorporated by reference, as long as they are not inconsistent with the disclosure. The invention is not limited to the exact details shown and described, for it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the claims. For animals treated with 0.1 and 0.01 mg taxol, a reduction in their neointimal area and neointimal/medial ratio was observed when compared to control animals, although this did not reach statistical significance given the small number of animals per group. Moreover, animals in the lower dose groups showed no (0.01 mg), minimal (0.1 mg) or limited (1.0 mg) toxicity, indicating that lower doses may be efficacious and exhibit fewer adverse side effects than doses greater than 1.0 mg. Periadventitial treatment of rat carotid arteries with 1 mg taxol crystals in 500 mg of a pluronic gel resulted in gross myonecrosis of the adjacent musculature. While the number of animals surviving in this group was too low to assess for statistical significance in the reduction of neointimal formation, neointimal area was 38% less than that of control animals. Five animals (3-1 mg and 2-0.01 mg) died post-surgically due to technical difficulties. Grossly, myonecrosis of the adjacent skeletal muscle (pale white regions of the musculature) was present in 3/3, 1/5, 0/4 and 0/5",
