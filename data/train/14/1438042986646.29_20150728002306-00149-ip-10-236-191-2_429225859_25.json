The system may include a module using a current-based algorithm to estimate flux and a module using a voltage-based algorithm to estimate flux. A weighting module operates over a transition range to transition between the flux estimate using the current-based algorithm to the flux estimate using the voltage-based algorithm based on a weighted combination of the flux estimates. Other embodiments are described and claimed. 20090256517 10-15-2009 VOLTAGE ESTIMATION FEEDBACK OF OVERMODULATED SIGNAL FOR AN ELECTRICAL VEHICLE - A voltage estimation system for motor control feedback is described. The system may include one or more control modules which may generate voltage commands. An overmodulation or \u201cclipping\u201d module receiving a voltage command can generate a clipped voltage. Rather than measuring directly, a voltage estimator may estimate the clipped voltage based on the duty cycle command to the inverter. This estimated voltage may then be used by a flux estimator to estimate a flux value. Other embodiments are described and claimed. 20090255740 Published Description Patent application number Heath Hofmann, State College, PA US //]]> BarDraw('2965441',['Patent applications by Gregory J.
