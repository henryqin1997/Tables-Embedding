But with Jarome Iginla digging in the crease, David Desharnais was on his knees to stop the puck with his stick just as it had almost crossed the goal line., 60423=\u00a9 2000-2014 Rogers Media. All rights reserved. Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service, 16914=Kevan Miller lost the puck off his stick behind the Boston net and then inadvertently tripped goalie Tuukka Rask as he tried to smother it, leaving Eller free to score unassisted 2:11 into the game., 13641=It is the same scenario as the previous time the teams met in the postseason in 2011, when the Canadiens won at home to force a Game 7. That year, they lost the decisive first-round game in overtime and Boston went on to win the Stanley Cup. It is the 34th time overall the teams have faced each other in the playoffs., 17130=Beaulieu flipped the puck up the center of the ice and saw it go off Loui Eriksson to Pacioretty, who won a race with Zdeno Chara and beat Rask between the pads at 15:24., 13119=Pacioretty, who had only one assist in the first five games, scored and set up Thomas Vanek's goal in the second period. Lars Eller scored in the first for Montreal and Vanek added his second of the game into an empty net with 3:56 left., 18912=Notes: Daniel Briere returned to the lineup for Travis Moen. ... Eller scored during Beaulieu's first career NHL playoff shift, making him plus-1 only 2:11 into the game. ... Boston made no changes. ... Shawn Thornton played his 100th career playoff game., 13977=The game turned in the second period after the Canadiens, leading 1-0, held off a fierce Boston attack through a 5:11 stretch without a whistle. It included killing a minor penalty to P.K. Subban and was highlighted by a Price stop at the doorstep on Milan Lucic., 16147=Montreal's big move was to bring 21-year-old Beaulieu in to replace Douglas Murray on the third defense pair. The team's 2011 first-round draft pick responded to his first career NHL playoff start with an assist and a plus-2 performance in only 9:36 of ice time., 17318=Pacioretty kept a puck alive with his feet in a crowd in front of Rask during a power play and saw the puck slide to Vanek for a shot into an open side at 17:39.}",
