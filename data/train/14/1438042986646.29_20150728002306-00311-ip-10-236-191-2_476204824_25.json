As is known in the art, PPP is used to encapsulate network layer datagrams over a serial communications link. For more information on PPP see Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d) Request for Comments (\u201cRFC\u201d), RFC-1661, RFC-1662 and RFC-1663 incorporated herein by reference., 83831=After receiving TCD 70 message and TSI message 76, cable modem 16 continues to establish access to data network 28 (and resources on the network) by first dialing into TRAC 24 and establishing a telephony PPP 50 session. Upon the completion of a successful PPP 50 connection, cable modem 16 performs PPP Link Control Protocol (\u201cLCP\u201d) negotiation with TRAC 24. Once LCP negotiation is complete, the cable modem 16 requests Internet Protocol Control Protocol (\u201cIPCP\u201d) address negotiation. For more information on IPCP see RFC-1332 incorporated herein by reference. During IPCP negotiation, cable modem 16 negotiates an IP address with TRAC 24 for sending IP data packet responses back to data network 28 via TRAC 24., 50794=Above the network layer are a Simple Network Management Protocol (\u201cSNMP\u201d) layer 62, Trivial File Protocol (\u201cTFTP\u201d) layer 64, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (\u201cDHCP\u201d) layer 66 and a UDP manager 68. SNMP layer 62 is used to support network management functions. For more information on SNMP layer 62 see RFC-1157 incorporated herein by reference. TFTP layer 64 is a file transfer protocol used to download files and configuration information. For more information on TFTP layer 64, see RFC-1350 incorporated herein by reference. DHCP layer 66 is a protocol for passing configuration information to hosts on an IP network. For more information on DHCP layer 66 see RFC-1541 and RFC-2131 incorporated herein by reference. UDP manager 68 distinguishes and routes packets to an appropriate service (e.g., a virtual tunnel). More or few protocol layers could also be used with data-over-cable system 10., 36393=The description that follows fully incorporates by reference the following co-pending patent applications: \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CABLE MODEM MANAGEMENT\u201d, U.S. patent Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been described in conjunction with presently preferred embodiments of the invention, persons of skill in the art will appreciate that variations may be made without departure from the scope and spirit of the invention. This true scope and spirit is defined by the appended claims, interpreted in light of the foregoing. At decision block 180, the cable modem is checked to determine if it is communicating. If it is communicating, the restart command waits at step 182 for the wait-time in the configuration file. In FIG. 8B, the cable modem checks at decision block 192 to determine if it has become inactive before the expiration of the wait time in step 182. If the wait-time had not expired when the cable modem became inactive, the cable modem is restarted at step 194. If the wait-time expired, an error is indicated at step 196. The method of FIG. 8A begins at step 170 by looking up the channels used by the cable modems in the cable modem system. A user at the network management station 120 may invoke a network management program to analyze the channel usage in the system. The channel usage is checked to determine if it is unbalanced at decision block 172. If the channel usage is not unbalanced, the method in FIG. 8A proceeds to the end. If the channel usage is unbalanced, the network administrator 110 decides",
