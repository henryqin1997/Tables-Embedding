            "Overall, the school is good, but the town isn't. It's a small school but is definitely known for being a good college. I plan on staying there four years just like lots of other students, so they are doing good things there.",
            "Campus activities mostly, the town of Albion is not very nice and isn't a place for people to be hanging out. But there is plenty to do on campus if you get involved.",
            "Food isn't very good.",
            "Nice places to live.",
            "Just like with anywhere, depending on your major, classes can be difficult or easy for some.",
            "The town sucks but campus is beautiful. The food is not good so far. The school is great and I love it. I am staying here all four years despite the negatives....which means that the school, campus, activities, and everything else is that good.",
            "Albion has a great community atmosphere. The faculty and professors are great and class sizes are small. The town/city of Albion is not so great, kind of shady and is not very nice looking, although campus is BEAUTIFUL."

The building will no longer be outdated, but they're still working on the food. Students tend to give bad reviews about the food being served recently. There's not many places to eat in the town of Albion, either. However, the Eat Shop, a school dining facility, has great snack food for study breaks., 2608=I'll be a sophomore for the 2009-2010 school year. The classes I took last year were mainly the basic classes for starting your science major and I felt like I was learning a lot and it was challenging but manageable.}",

I have meet people from all over the United States and it's amazing how close I have gotten to some people. I couldn't ask for more! Am learning a lot Albion isn't like any other school I have visited. Some of my friends go to big public schools and aren't getting attention from staff or anything else. At Albion I can talk to any and all of my teachers. Whether it's to discuss a grade or to gain more information my professors are always available to me and I couldn't have been learning more.
