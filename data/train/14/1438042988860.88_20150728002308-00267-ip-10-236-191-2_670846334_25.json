Nevertheless, crude though it may be, it does produce results - especially on the crucial question of differences in age at marriage - that have been, broadly speaking, borne out by other studies. Dyrvik, op. cit. p. 296, for instance, found that in the period 1755-94 the mean age at first marriage of bridegrooms in the farming class was 28.8 years as against 28.7 for those in the crofter class. The respective ages of their brides were 25.2 years and 29.9. See also Drake, Population and Society, pp. 124-32., 63972=What I had learned here I carried with me on other journeys through-out the country, and especially in 1853 through much of the dioceses of Christiansand and Bergen. My interpretation of the matter was further strengthened by such experiences as those I spoke of in the opening chapter., 122081=In the countryside in particular, where, for various reasons, this matter is a subject of much attention and debate, I have often heard worthy and knowledgeable men express themselves thus: \"It was bad before but it's become even worse since the new poor law of 1845. For that gives the poor the right to claim help whenever anything goes wrong. And now it's come to the point when the poorest boy who, perhaps, only a few years ago was entirely dependent upon the charity of his neighbours and who even now has not been long enough in service to get full wages, thinks there is no problem about getting married. So he goes to the priest and requests that the banns be published and the wedding solemnized, for he can always find a girl who thinks the same way as he does.\" Other people go further back in time and look at the matter more profoundly. One of the poor's best friends, a worthy man who, despite his grey hairs, occupies an official position of great trust and honour, told me that in his opinion: \"It is the spirit of the age. It is the ideas of the French Revolution - liberty, equality and so on, which are the decisive influence in this matter also. It is one of the evils which accompany the benefits of a free state. But we ought patiently to accept the bad with the good. Look about in town and countryside. The journeyman wants to be a master before his time; the shop-boy wants to be a shop-keeper at once; the farmer's sons all want to be farmers, and so they parcel out their father's farm into small patches; the servant-boy follows the trend, giving up his place in order to be his own master. And so they marry whether they have anything to marry on or not. If it goes wrong, they blame the hard times. People today won't readily examine themselves to see the cause of their disappointment and misfortune in their own conduct. It is not easy to see how it will change, but the matter has become so alarming, that if the country is to survive, it would seem necessary that it must. So we can but hope for the best.\", 46043=According to this view the marked increase in the number of marriages for the period 1841-45 (Table 2) must be explained by the good years and favourable conditions. And in much the same way is the matter also explained by the official (Department of the Interior) report for the five years 1846-50. Here it is said that \"the rising rate of population increase in the five years 1841-45, as against the previous five years, has decreased somewhat in the last quinquennium,6 a result easily explained when it is recalled that, whilst in the first five years (1841-45) times were very good, in the period in question (1846-50) several events occurred which militated against an increase in population. These were: dearth throughout the entire kingdom in 1847;7 crop failures in several years in the northern part of the country; and unfortunate market conditions for several industries in part of the period as a result of the events of 1848\" (the French Revolution)., 32173=* After this table was prepared and after the present essay, in which the figures from the table are frequently used, was all but written, I unexpectedly came across two papers, which contained the number of marriages and births for the latter part of the last century. From the aforegoing remarks, one will have noticed that I lacked details of births in the kingdom for the years 1793-95, as well as for the years 1796-1800, and that I was myself forced to fill the great gap, questionable as such a procedure is, by a kind of calculation, or to be more correct, by guesswork. I make haste therefore to add an explanation of the extent to which the lately discovered data agrees with my guesswork. The two particular papers are:, 17887=Some of the people who were married between 1815 and 1825 could quite easily be foreigners who moved here after the peace. But one has never heard that there were very many of them. The majority of marriages were fairly certainly those of the country's own children. When we remind ourselves of the fact that they were probably between 25 and 30 years of age when they married, then we discover that the majority of them were born in the last ten years of the previous century. Now the country suffered under a destructive war in the years just before 1815, and immediately afterwards there were comparatively good and prosperous times. But we could, for a moment, look away and imagine that times were good both before and after 1815. We may then say that if in the last ten years of the eighteenth century more children were born than usual, and if no special child sickness occurred that would diminish the total, then it would be expected that in the ten years immediately following 1815, there would be more marriageable persons and, from them, more newly married couples would emerge than usual., 9480=Table 13. Five yearly totals of live births in Norway, showing the peaks and troughs, 1735-1850, 55461=Professor Holst has written a painstaking essay Om Folketaellingen i Norge i Aaret 1825 (On the Census of Norway in the year 1825).1Here he speaks first of all about the period between the censuses of 180l and 1815, when the increase in population was almost nil. \"But the last half (1807-14) of this period\", he writes, \"was full of reasons that must not only have checked the increase of population but even brought about its decline. At the outbreak of war businesses stopped and unaccustomed obstacles were thrown in the way of the import of the necessary quantity of corn and other foodstuffs. And although the cultivation of corn and potatoes was, in these five years and in certain districts of the kingdom, increased considerably, the yield was not great enough to overcome an annual shortfall of several hundred thousands of bushels. Already this alone caused a considerable dearth which increased, in particular in the summer of 1812, throughout almost the entire country as a result of a general crop failure or a poor harvest of both corn and hay. As a result many farmers were compelled to limit considerably the stock on their farms. For want of sound and nutritious food, people were compelled to seize upon straw, Rumex crispus, Anagallis, Brassica oleracea and rapa, Lichen islandicus and rangiferinus, Poly podium filix mas, the bark of Betula alba, dry fish and fishbones made into flour etc. Eating these caused fatal diseases, in particular, dysentery and putrid fever, mostly in the years 1808, 1809, 1812 and 1813. Furthermore these sicknesses caused much greater ravages since the cause, namely want, could not be removed, nor could doctors and medicines be obtained everywhere. Besides all this a number were carried off by smallpox etc. in the years 1805, 1810 and 1811.\", 53550=1 In Budstikken, 1827, nos. 80-9., 149202=Partly because of illness, partly through an unwillingness to face the choice of a career (not unknown amongst students today), Sundt did not graduate until 1846. He might have chosen a straightforward career in the Church (he had pursued a theological line of study) or the university. In fact he did become, briefly, a fellow in ecclesiastical history. He was, however, \"thinking of something else than following the beaten road of routine living\".11 Taking a Sunday school class in Christiania prison, he noticed an inmate \"with hair, beard and burly eyebrows as black as a raven's and a skin... of a darker hue than one finds on a normal sunburned Norwegian face\".12 The man turned out to be a gypsy, confined to prison for not having voluntarily presented himself for instruction leading to confirmation in the State Church. From this chance meeting Sundt began his studies of the gypsies for which he later received financial assistance from the government. The authorities were so impressed by his work that not only did they publish it at public expense, but also, in the autumn of 1850, gave him a grant so that he might pursue his studies into the condition of the Norwegian lower classes. It was to last for one year and was the first of a series of annual grants which continued until 1868. Few governments have reaped such a rich return on their investment in social scientific research; none have got so much from the work of one man., 104415=Table 1. Annual totals of marriages in Norway, 1801-54, 154826=Enthusiasm for Sundt even within his native Norway, is of comparatively recent origin. Outside he remains virtually unknown. One wonders what his reputation would have been had the French translation of that first book (made shortly after its appearance in Norway) been printed.5 As it happened, from 1869, when the State stopped his funds, thus effectively bringing his research to an end, to the 1950s, there was only sporadic interest shown in his work. Somewhat ironically, as Nils Christie observed, there was much in the way of theory and technique that could have been taken direct from Sundt, but in fact came to Norway via American social science textbooks after the Second World War.6 Recently, however, there have been reprints in paperback of a number of his works7 and in 1978, in a major publishing venture, the last of 11 volumes covering most of his major output appeared.8, 97571=But the average total (or mean figure) of 41,666 7/10 is too complex for us, composed has it is of thousands, hundreds, tens, units and a fraction. It is both difficult to manipulate and to remember. When we are dealing with the relationship between the five-year periods it is more convenient if we calculate a simpler total. Instead of the actual average of 41,666 7/10 I will take it to be 1,000.The totals for the different five-year periods must be altered accordingly, so that the overall position remains unchanged. Thus, for example, for the five years 1846-50, I must substitute the figure 1,260 for the actual figure of 52,506., 132584=21 Seip, \"Forholdet mellom \"Capitalen og Arbeidet\" i gruvesamfunnet\", p. 389. 22 See M. J. Cullen, The Statistical Movement in Early Victorian Britain: The Foundations of Empirical Social Research, Hassocks, Harvester Press, 1975. 23 Seip, \"Sundt og vekstideologiens dillemma\", p. 320 also makes this point though she lays greater emphasis on Sundt's religious values., 43848=1826-30, 1831-35: A decreasing number of marriages in spite of the fact that economic conditions were, for the most part, better than in the previous years. But now the great gap was filled. That need for a more numerous population which came with the state of peace was to some extent satisfied., 156804=Eilert Sundt's work is as remarkable today as it was in his own lifetime. He tackled problems of great moment: poverty, delinquency, demographic change, minority groups, the role of women, working class education. He is recognized within Norway as a pioneer of sociology and social anthropology. For economic, demographic and social historians he produced a mass of data, both quantitative and qualitative, covering all aspects of life in what was still an essentially peasant society, overwhelmingly rural and just on the threshold of industrialization. His empirical studies can be likened to those of Henry Mayhew, Le Play or Charles Booth. More recently it has been argued that \"the time is now ripe to launch Sundt as a theoretician, as a contemporary of Marx and a forerunner of Durkheim\".1 (His work on suicide, for instance, with its insistence on the primary importance of social control, is a theme later taken up by the latter.)2 He is said to have been one of the first in any country to apply Darwin's theory of natural selection to social phenomena, though he was no crude Social Darwinist.3 Above all, for an age that is filled with doubt about the limitations of discipline-based research Sundt's \"enormous and infectious intellectual curiosity\",4 which knew no such blinkers, is a source of tremendous inspiration. He ranged far and wide from 1850, when his first book (An Account of the Gypsy People in Norway) appeared, to the publication of his last work (On Domestic Life in Norway) in 1873., 43135=27. Now I must present my own opinion. Naturally it is indisputable that the economic situation, wealth and business conditions, crop failures and good seasons etc. will have an influence on the number of marriages in a country. This can be seen quite easily from the totals for individual years. For example (see Table 1) the small number for 1814 and the large one for 1815 (the change-over from war to peace); low totals in 1838 and 1839 as compared with the immediately pre-ceding years (bad and better seasons); a large number for 1846 and a smaller one for 1847 (good times and bad times). What applies to a single year can also apply to a greater period of time. The total for the five years 1836-40 would certainly not have sunk as low as it did, had several bad years not occurred, and the totals for the five years 1841-45 would certainly not have risen so high, if there had not been such a series of good years. But not everything is explained in this way. Indeed not even the essentials. I am of the opinion that the rate of increase in the number of marriages and with it the increase in the population in the course of this half-century, is, to a great extent, independent of the favourable or unfavourable conditions prevailing at a particular time. I believe it likely that if there had been no war, nor any other adverse circumstances in the years 1807-14, there would nevertheless have occurred a considerable increase in the number of marriages in the years between 1815 and 1825. Even if there had been very good times from 1836 to 1840 and hard times from 1841 to 1845, it is probable that the totals would still have been pretty low in the former and quite high in the latter period. Indeed, I can state my opinion, a very happy one at that, in this way. It must be considered one of God's mysterious designs that the war ended in 1814, just when, from 1815 onwards, a much greater number of families was established than before, whose fathers and breadwinners, had they been established earlier, would have been still harder pressed by the hardships of wartime. I believe too, that in the same way, it was very fortunate that the unusually long series of bad years between 1835 and 1840 ended just at the time, from 1841 onwards, when again a much greater number of families was established than before. On the other hand, by way of contrast to these benefits, I must also mention those acts of God which produced the dearth of 1847 and the many perplexities brought about by wars and rumours of war in 1848. For these occurred just at the time when an unusually large number of new families were established, many of which must be feeling anxious and threatened at the present time., 142908=On Marriage in Norway produced Sundt's widely known theoretical insight - \"Sundt's Law\" as the Swedish statistician Axel Gustav Sundb\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a4rg dubbed it.15 How he came to discover this is described by Sundt in almost lyrical terms (p. 21). In essence he argued that the sharp increase in marriages in the 1840s (24 per cent up on the 1830s) was, to a great extent, independent of the economic circumstances of the time or of any change in moral conditions (an increased recklessness and improvidence on the part of the poor was often alleged); rather it was a product of a baby boom in the decade after 1815 which led to a massive increase of almost 40 per cent in the 20-30-year-old age group between 1835 and 1845. This baby boom of the post-Napoleonic period was, in its turn, not a product of the circumstances of that time, but of an earlier surge in the birth rate in the 1790s. Sundt traced this wave-like movement back as far as records permitted - to the 1740s. The discovery was both novel and important. Novel because however much Sundt combed the Norwegian and the foreign literature (pp. 24-9 and 66, 91-2 n. 7) he could find no support for it, important because it exposed the crassness of much of the conventional wisdom on the subject as articulated by the middle class. Relative to the size of the marriageable age groups, the numbers of marriages actually declined in the 1840s, whilst the age at marriage rose. All talk of recklessness on the part of the working class with regard to establishing a marriage should now be done away with, argued Sundt. \"It has nothing to do with reality: it is an unjustifiable exaggeration\" (p. 141). Sundt also showed that although the average age at first marriage of working-class Norwegian men (mostly crofters and day-labourers) was lower than that of the propertied class (i.e. the farmers) there was little in it (28.2 years as against 29.7) and, in any case, neither could be regarded as early.16 More importantly Sundt discovered that the brides of the working class were, on average, older than those of the propertied class, namely 26.8 years as against 25.9 years (p. 143). Sundt's discovery and explanation of these differences represent a signal contribution to our understanding of this important element of socio-demographic behaviour. Methodologically the demonstration of his law caused Sundt to break new ground in developing cohort analysis, despite having only crude data at his disposal (pp. 59-74)., 4039=We find, therefore, an extraordinary regularity when we compare the points of time at which the highest and lowest totals occur. The totals rise and fall regularly, so that the movement appears like a swell with the one wave, as it falls, pressing up another by its side, so that all go forward in a row. And however one tries to explain the situation, so must one remember that from the multitude of children born at the beginning of the period, which neither death took away nor emigration carried out of the country, came the parents and grandparents of those born at a later period or, conversely, the children born, for example, in the years 1841-50 were for the most part, the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those born in the earlier periods., 99082=This trend is as follows: the number of marriages falls from the first to the second five-year period. Then it rises until the period 1821-25, where the number of marriages reaches its first high point. The number then falls, again smoothly, for three five-year periods though it does not sink as low as it did on the other side of the high point. But in the years 1841-45 it rises again suddenly and sharply, even higher than it did at the previous high point, and in the ensuing period it rises even further. The characteristic of this last rise is its suddenness, as we can see from Table 1. Up to and including the year 1840 the totals remain low. Then suddenly in 1841, they rise higher than in any preceding year and remain so, or rise to an even greater height in each of the following years., 1129=9 In Table 12 we see that in the Christiania Diocese the maximum number of marriages occurred in the years 1821-25 and the maximum number of births in the period 1826-30. For the kingdom as a whole, the former occurred in 1821-25, the latter in 1831-35, that is, ten years later., 93629=Figure 1. Five-yearly totals of marriages, expressed as a percentage of the mean number of marriages 1801-50, in Norway., 47866=In later chapters it will be seen that in some matters I agree and in others disagree with Schweigaard's interpretation of the so-called population movements. But for now I shall give some views of writers concerned with the years from 1835 onwards, i.e. the period which most of my readers will have lived to see and ponder over., 143272=13 Anne-Lise Seip, \"Forholdet mellom \"Capitalen og Arbeidet\" i gruvesamfunnet R\u00f8ros 1851\", Historisk Tidsskrift, 53:4, 1975, pp. 392-3. 14 Anne-Lise Seip \"Eilert Sundt og vekstideologiens dillemma\", Historisk Tidsskrift, 54:4, 1975, pp. 36-46., 130059=24 Eilert Sundt, \"Om vort selskab\", Folkevennen, 11, 1862, pp. 568-80. 25 Eilert Sundt, \"Folkevennens f\u00f8rste ti Aar\", Folkevennen, 10, 1861, p. 646., 4921=If we begin with the first column, going from top to bottom, and count the years from the middle of the first to the middle of the second five years, then we find the first low total is in the years 1741-45, the next is thirty years afterwards in the years 1771-75, the next is 35 years after that in the years 1806-10 and finally another 30 years elapses to the years 1836-40. Four times, therefore, the wave sinks, and with an interval of at least 30 and at most 35 years between each movement., 100292=Table 2. Five yearly totals of marriages in Norway, 1801-50, 128386=1. It was a fine day in the autumn of 1853. I was walking in a wooded district, some forty kilometres from Christiania, amongst a group of crofters' cottages and small-holdings that belonged to some large farms. On one of these small-holdings the middle-aged wife of the crofter was engaged in carrying potatoes into the living-room and there tumbling them through the trap-door into the cellar. A couple of adolescent girls were helping her, but her husband was away working on his master's farm. I was tired and sat down until the woman finished her work and gave herself up to talk with me. We had not set eyes upon each other before, but were soon, so to speak, acquainted. She regaled me with some apples from a fine tree, between the leaves of which the sun shone through the living-room window. This tree had not been planted by the crofter but by his predecessor, a queer old bachelor. However it was quite apparent that the present family were happy to have beautiful and pleasant things around them. I took a real delight in looking around me. For the first time in a crofter's living-room I noticed a four-poster bed with russet curtains. The Swedish clock hung in the corner, and, against the one long wall, there was a large chest of drawers, which I could not help thinking was well filled with all kinds of good things, witness to the wise housewife's industry and prudence. It was evidently a fairly prosperous household, although they had had four or five children to rear, and everything that I learned about their domestic life taught me to respect them as worthy folk., 109048=Statistiske Tabeller for Kongeriget Norge 4de Raekke (Statistical Tables for the Kingdom of Norway 4th series), Christiania, 1839, is a most important collection of statistics for the present essay. It has therefore been all the more necessary to correct a mistake which occurs in it. The work contains details of marriages, births and deaths in the kingdom and dioceses year by year from 1801 to 1835. But in those for the year 1801, the totals for the Troms\u00f8 Diocese are counted twice, since firstly they are added to those for the Throndhjem Diocese, which by that means has got too large a total, and then in the next place are given for the Troms\u00f8 Diocese. The mistake is occasioned by the fact that, at that time, these two dioceses were joined together. It is corrected in this way: one subtracts the totals given for the Troms\u00f8 Diocese from those of the Throndhjem Diocese and the kingdom as a whole. I had long entertained a suspicion that this was the case, but I was first certain of it when, after the whole of this essay had been completed, I quite accidentally unearthed, in the Statistical Bureau's Archives, the original of the bishop's list. Since there was now no doubt about the matter, I was compelled to correct all the totals and calculations in which the details printed in the tables for 1801 had been used. [For further comments and revised totals see Drake, Population and Society - Ed.], 47994=4 This decline in the number of marriages after 1825 can be seen in my Table 2., 30923=In Thaarup I found a list of births and deaths for the whole of Norway for the years 1785-94. In Catteau I found a list of births and deaths for the years from 1785 to 1799 as well as a list of marriages for the years 1795-99. With a couple of minor exceptions the two writers agree as to the totals. Here I keep to Catteau's list, as it covers the longest series of years., 4251=On the whole, we find the same applies to the other column where the totals are arranged for the years 1738-42 etc. The largest deviation is in one instance where there is an interval of 40 years., 39043=1 Several foreign writers have asserted that one does not get reliable statistics on population conditions, so long as the work involved in collecting the material together is entrusted to the clergy. In various countries, therefore, the task has been entrusted to civil officers. But this objection against the reliability of the tables does not apply to our country, where nearly all the inhabitants belong to one and the same church, and where, according to both civil and ecclesiastical law, it is one's duty to report all births, deaths etc. to the priest concerned. 2 In Materialien zur Statistik d. danischen Staaten, 2nd pt, 1784-86, is to be found, for all the dioceses and for the entire kingdom, lists of births and deaths from 1735 to 1784 as well as of marriages and illegitimate births for the years 1770-84. Details of births for the whole kingdom, but not for the dioceses, are continued up to and including 1792 in Schlegel's Statist. Beskrivelse of de fornemste europ. stater, 2nd pt, p. 28. For the Christiania Diocese there is a defective series of bishops' and deans' lists of marriages etc. from 1733 onwards. This is the material I have found. First of all I have produced the table for the Christiania Diocese. The materials are wanting so far as marriages are concerned in the years 1744, 1749, 1750, 1757 and 1760, as well as for both births and marriages for the years 1786, 1787 and 1793. For these years I have used the average of the other years in the same five-year group. Next I have produced the table of births for the entire kingdom. The great gap for the years 1793-1800 I have filled up in this way. The number of births in the Christiania Diocese is a very large fraction (almost half) of the total for the entire kingdom. I knew what this fraction was for the years 1776-go and 1801-15, and assumed from this that it must be the same for the three years 1793-95 and for the five years 1796-1800. The total which was calculated according to this supposition agreed very well with the considerable rise in the number of births that had taken place in the last five years, of which I had details. This number rose evenly in 1787-92 from 23,070 to 28,246. (On this see the footnote to Table 12, which was appended later.) The details referred to on marriages in the kingdom as a whole for the period 1770-84 are used in the table as if they applied to the years 1771-75, 1776-80, 1781-85., 18372=34. But now one wonders: is it possible that the great increase in the number of marriages that occurred in the ten years immediately following 1815 can also be explained, at least in part, in the same way, namely as a result of a marked increase in the number of children born at a corresponding earlier period? And it is with this question in mind that I have in Table 12 continued the totals of marriages and births back as far as possible into the previous century., 55699=* The totals up to 1835 are taken from Schweigaard's Statistik. On the 1769 census, which can be more correctly put at 748,000, see sml. Norsk Tidsskr. f. Vid. og Litt. 1848, p. 398., 69775=Table 10. Five yearly totals of marriages in the parishes of Lom, Vaage and Lesje as a percentage of the mean number of marriages in each, 1801-50, 73153=When we look at the figures, particularly at those in Table 8, we do indeed find less regularity and uniformity than in the corresponding totals for the kingdom and for the Christiania Diocese (See Tables 3 and 5). But it is in the main still fairly easy to see a resemblance between them: small totals for the first two five-year periods, an increase to around the year 1825, a falling off towards 1840 and from there a rise, and a marked rise at that., 107558=9. The total number of marriages in our country in the fifty years from 1801 to 1850 was 416,667. A significant total! Almost all of us find in this figure the start of our own or our parents' marriage. It embraces the public official and the ordinary citizen, the farmer, the fisherman and the day labourer, the Lapp and the Norwegian, the highest and the lowest, the educated and the illiterate. This total comprises an even greater sum of Holy vows, of love and joy, of cold and selfish calculation, of base thoughtlessness and fatal passion; an immeasurable sum of heavenly promise, of the Lord's blessing as well as the Lord's judgement. The size of the total is well suited to remind us of the familiar expression that, in the blessings of married life, in the love and harmony, joy and peace of the family, lies the nation's fortune and strength. There must be many a man in Norway, for whom the word 'Fatherland' or 'Patriotism' is almost a foreign term, strange and long-winded. He has heard its sound, possibly tried to pronounce it himself, on occasion, but never, perhaps, apprehended its meaning or tasted its sweetness. But it is good that he has grown up in a happy home, that he has been born and reared by pious parents, in a house-hold where love has earned his gratitude, where industriousness and enterprise have planted in his soul a desire for order and for action, where harmony and a firm will have sown a feeling for morality in his breast, a respect for the good and an obedience to the right. So he is a good citizen, firstly in his home, in his neighbourhood, his parish; and then too in his Fatherland, even if the word itself is too great for his understanding to grasp. There is a particular reason why we should dwell with pleasure upon the fact that the Lord blessed domestic life as the foundation of a nation's fortune. For when we normally speak about a nation, we think about its past and its present, about its achievements and its honours. So that it is mostly about men that we think. It is therefore extremely rare that an individual woman stands out from the rest of her sex, to the extent that she is seen to exercise some particularly noteworthy influence upon the nation as a whole. Bu tif we look upon the nation as a collection of families we realize immediately that here it is the woman who embellishes life, who, in her husband nourishes, and in her sons awakens, that spirit of order and peace and mildness, in which the powers that be find their real strength., 44340=1801-05, 1806-10, 1811-15: A small number of marriages resulting from crop failures in the early years of the century and still more from the disruption caused by war in the period 1807-14., 137858=17 Richard M. Easterlin, Michael L. Wachter, and Susan M. Wachter, \"Demographic influences on economic stability: the United States experience\", Population and Development Review. IV:I, 1978, pp. 7, 9, 16., 109374=I have been forced to make some changes in the totals of marriages, births etc. for the kingdom as a whole and for the dioceses in the year 1838, as well as for the Christiania and Christiansand Dioceses in the six years 1845-50. On this I refer to the aforementioned essay (see footnote on p. 20 and app. 2)., 47520=25. With regard to the five years 1836-40, we have a statement of that well-known statistician, the late Judge Kraft. Kraft wrote the very interesting introduction to the official Beretning om Rigets \u00d8konomiske Tilstand (Report on the Kingdom's Economic Situation) for the aforementioned years. After pointing out that the population had grown less in this five-year period than in the preceding one, he states, \"this less fortunate situation in the last quinquennium is caused in part by greater mortality, but in part it must also be attributed to the smaller number of births, as the number of people getting married was also less in this period.5 The cause of this must be sought in the bad harvests of 1836, 1837 and 1838. The situation was particularly severe in districts of the Akershus Diocese together with a greater part of the Throndhjem Diocese and the northern areas. Bad seasons, together with business stoppages, brought about unemployment and migration. How important this was as regards the number of new marriages and the increase in population as a whole can be seen when we note that in the unhappy war years of 1813 and 1814 the number of people getting married was respectively: 6,453 and 5,801. In 1815 the number rose to 9,171 and in 1816 to 9,427. Similar results were produced by the war years 1808 and 1809.\", 63670=In 1854, I went again to Lom and Vaage, and at the same place where the idea, so to speak, was born, I repeated the entire exercise as far as that was possible, in order to reassure myself that I had made no mistakes in the matter. Here in Christiania where in part hand-written and in part printed tables have been compiled from the parish registers of the entire kingdom, I continued to examine the Gudbrandsdalen and Hedemarken deaneries, the Christiania Diocese and the kingdom as a whole. Everywhere I found that same rising and falling in the number of marriages that I had first discovered in the Lom and Vaage parishes. The more wide-ranging my investigation, the more I felt that the view formed in Lom was the answer. In this and the previous chapter, I have shown the links between the various pieces of evidence that strengthened me in my opinion. The opinion itself will be discussed in the following chapters.2, 40126=To begin with we must turn to the particulars which appear below in Table 12. Before, however, directing the reader's attention to the table, I must give some explanation of it. From 1801 onwards, the totals are taken from printed and reliable tables.1 Before that time the reliability is less as in the last century not so much attention was paid to these matters. The priests' and bishops' lists of births and marriages were not wholly accurate; not all the totals were preserved in printed books and the handwritten lists are now, for the most part, lost. So we lack details of marriages for most years of the last century except for the Christiania Diocese, and even there the totals of the children born are missing for individual years at the end of the century. These gaps I have been forced to make good by guesswork.2 In spite of this, I still believe that even for the last century the table is good enough to give us a reasonable insight into the essential character of the matter upon which we are engaged here., 84712=* As we have said, one should note in this Table 5, not whether the number of marriages in the one diocese is greater or smaller than in another, but whether the number rises or falls at anything like the same rate and at the same time in each. The large number of marriages in the Christiania Diocese rose from the years 1836-40 to the years 1841-45 to the extent that the number 931 rises to 1,210; the small number of marriages in the Troms\u00f8 Diocese rose in the same period to the extent that 999 rises to 1,217. In both dioceses therefore, the rise was marked, and it is this which we intend to show here., 67935=It was not by accident that I chose the parishes of Lom and Vaage for my examples. In 1851 I had travelled through a great deal of Smaalenene, Hedemarken, Gudbrandsdalen and \u00d8sterdalen, with the intention of acquiring information, principally about the way of life of the lower classes. On this long journey I had seen and heard a lot that was new to me but had not learned much very thoroughly. The following year I picked out a single parish so that I might devote greater attention to a smaller sphere and so get actual illustrations of the circumstances and customs of the people. My choice fell upon Lom. Since I was just then eager to learn of the much discussed topic of reckless marriages, something about which I was greatly concerned personally, I took great pains to find out what marriage conditions were like. I began in the following way. From the parish registers I made a list of the names of the couples who had married in the previous five years. I then went out into the parish in order to enquire into the earlier and present circumstances of these people; their economic state, their ways of thought, their customs. By preference, I sought out the families themselves in their own homes and conversed directly with the people concerned. I asked my questions in a straightforward manner and I must commend the people highly for the direct and trusting way in which, for the most part, I was answered. But I did not find all those directly concerned at home, or their houses lay so far off that I did not have the time to seek them out. So I asked about them at the houses of reliable people in the neighbourhood. In this way I got a great many illustrations of actual conditions in the parish and noted down many views on the matter. Within the parish I was, in so far as the short space of a couple of months and the pressure of other work would allow, initiated into the family circumstances and prevailing habits regarding this matter. The question was - did the talk of reckless marriages apply to this parish? Were reckless marriages here more frequent in recent times than formerly, or were they more frequent here than in other parishes in the country? These questions were as yet by no means answered, so I went back to the parsonage and made another search through the parish registers. I totalled the number of marriages year by year from 1736, that being as far back as the register went, until the present day. Then I went out once again and made a point of conversing with the old people, in order to ascertain if, over time, changes had taken place in employment, wealth, ways of thought and customs, which could have brought about the fact that the number of marriages was sometimes greater, sometimes smaller, but always rising and falling. On this occasion, as in other places, I was bound to note that although the Norwegian farmer is remarkably conversant with present conditions in his parish, indeed almost within each and every house, his knowledge is very imperfect and confused about the conditions and events of earlier times. However, I was lucky enough to gather a considerable amount of information, sometimes here, some-times there, relative to this matter. And after putting these pieces of information together, after comparing the old with the new, after examining them in the light of the totals taken from the registers, after drawing up many more lists from the registers (of legitimate and illegitimate births, as well as of deaths) after again and again gazing at the totals and meditating upon them, lo and behold it happened! Little by little there formed in my mind a view of the matter, and one that was by no means the same as that I had brought with me to the parish. During an admittedly much shorter stay in the neighbouring parish of Vaage, where I also sought out the people in their own homes and drew up long lists from the parish registers, this same view was confirmed., 90011=Table 4. Five yearly totals of marriages in the dioceses of Norway, 1801-50, 14027=So far as the Christiania Diocese is concerned (and it comprises half the kingdom) our conjecture works out rather well. More children were born in the years 1791-1800 than usual and not so many as usual died. As, 25-30 years later, there must have been many marriageable people, one would expect many marriages.8, 36535=Table 12. Five yearly totals of marriages and of live births in the diocese of Christiania and in the kingdom of Norway, 1736-1850, 128724=26 Eilert Sundt, \"Arbeidsvesen i Haandsagen\", Folkevennen,13, 1864, pp. 329-40. 27 Eilert Sundt, \"Bygde-skikke F\u00f8rste stykke\", Folkevennen, 7, 1857, pp. 17-56., 20705=5 This age is just about right so far as the bachelors are concerned. As against them, the number of widowers who remarry is quite small. But more on this later. 6 I have somewhere - I believe in Bernoulli's Populationistik - seen the remarkable observation made about one of the German states, that when the draft board came to the cohort whose year of birth is known to have been one of distress throughout the whole of Europe, namely 1816, the proportion of small and sickly men who presented themselves before the board was seen to be much greater than in the other cohorts. If the bad times in which this cohort was born could affect the stature and health of the adult population in this way, then it is likely that its effects brought many of the young people to the grave., 19850=33. From 1826 to 1840, for three five-year periods in a row, fewer and fewer people were married, the number falling from 42,500 to 40,500 couples. From 1841 onwards the number rose suddenly to 50,500 (1841-45) and 52,500 (1846-50). Furthermore it appears that in the five years 1851-55 it will remain at the same high level. Suddenly therefore, the number of newly established families rises by 10,000 in five years. This is a very remarkable event, no matter whether we look at it from the standpoint of the reasons or the results. For the moment we are dealing with the reasons. Other men have sought these in contemporary happenings, in the favourable or unfavourable circumstances that made it difficult or easy for people to find a livelihood, as for instance the crop failures in several of the years 1836-40 and the good seasons in 1841-45. I have not overlooked the influence of these circumstances, but have pointed out besides that the number of marriageable people, without whom there would not be any marriages, must have been less before and greater after 1841 and that the reason for this is to be sought 25-30 years earlier. This comment applies to the entire kingdom and from the table one can see that it applies also to the Christiania Diocese. It is only because I do not wish to tire the reader with too many totals that I have not shown that the same applies also to all the remaining dioceses, indeed for individual deaneries and parishes., 149868=9 These and other biographical details are taken from H.O. Christophersen, Eilert Sundt; en dikter i kjensgjerninger, Gyldendal Norsk Forlag,Oslo, 1962, passim;also Michael Drake, Population and Society in Norway 1735-1865, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1969, pp. 19-29. It is not altogether unlikely that Sundt's oft-repeated claim that women frequently played a dominant role in the running of many Norwegian households, especially those of the crofters, owes something to his own childhood experience. See below, pp. 160-1. 10 Refsum, \"Sundt\", p. 277., 109914=1 I should here explain that the manuscript and printed tables, together with the other writings from which I have derived material for this present essay, are the same as those used for the already-mentioned Om D\u00f8deligheden i Norge (On Mortality in Norway), Christiania, 1855. I have discussed these primary sources on pp. 14 and 195 of that essay., 98267=This rise and fall can be shown even more clearly. There are just ten five-year periods between 1801 and 1850. If the size of the population and all else had been absolutely identical in each of these five-year periods, then the overall number of marriages would have been the same. In each period, there would have been just 10 per cent of the grand total of 416,667; in other words 41,666 7/10. This latter total we can call the average. But in real life the situation has been otherwise. The actual totals rise and fall and therefore are sometimes over and sometimes under this average figure. This rise and fall, or these changes, we can regard as deviations from the average., 44120=1816-20, 1821-25: A marked increase in the number of marriages and, on the whole, an unusually large increase in population, caused by the mercurial rise in the people's vital power after the cessation of the suffering of the previous years., 87207=Table 5. Five yearly totals of marriages in the dioceses of Norway per 1,000 of the mean number of marriages in each, 1801-50*, 129800=Eilert Sundt became parish priest of Eidsvoll in 1870. Thus at the age of 53 he began the career for which he had been trained a quarter of a century earlier. Economically he was better off than he had ever been. Eidsvoll was a good living. But the ending of his research grant in 1869 deeply disappointed him. When he died in 1875 he left behind an enormous corpus of works ranging from major studies in demography, sociology, social anthropology and ethnography to masterly vignettes covering only a few pages, for example, his analysis of the position of some handsawyers facing the competition of the steam-driven saw26 or his examination of politeness amongst the farming population of Guldalen, a parish in the Throndhjem Diocese.27 These, and the non-political Worker's Association of Christiania were his legacy. Not until the 1960s did he get a physical monument commensurate with his stature, when the spanking new social science faculty building at the University of Oslo was named - Eilert Sundt's House., 30178=If we now assume that the total in the five years 1795-99 was somewhat similar to the total in 1796-1800, then we can compare the totals for these three five-year periods with the corresponding ones in the table prepared by me, and we will then find that the totals which I adduced by guesswork for 1791-95 and 1796-1800, great as they are by comparison with those that preceded and those that followed them, are not too great, but too small. The fact that the number of births in the last two five-year periods of the last century was very great, is of much interest for the following presentation. It is fortunate too that I have now been able to prove that I had not set the number too high., 96308=Table 3. Five yearly totals of marriages as a percentage of the mean number of marriages in Norway, 1801-50, 71572=Table 9. Five yearly totals of marriages in the parishes of Lom, Vaage and Lesje, 1801-50, 13676=8 In the footnote to Table 12, I remarked that I had found the totals of deaths for the entire kingdom at the end of the last century. I can now show, so far as the entire kingdom is concerned, just as above for the Christiania Diocese, that mortality in the years 1791-95 and 1796-99 was less than in the years immediately preceding and following. The average yearly total of deaths was:, 29336=29. If we now cast a glance at the totals, the first thing we notice is the naturally well-known circumstance that, when the number of marriages increases, so does the number of children that are born.3 Another feature deserves particular notice, namely that when the number of marriages has continued to rise over a somewhat longer period, then the corresponding increase in the number of births begins some years after that and continues some years longer. In the Christiania Diocese, for example, the number of marriages already began to rise in the period 1811-15 and was to continue to do so until 1825, when it reached its peak and began to fall. The number of births, on the other hand, first began to rise in the years 1816-20 and reached its peak in the years 1826-30. We find more or less the same thing happening in the figures for the kingdom as a whole. Here, too, the number of marriages reached its peak in the years 1821-25, but the births not until 1831-35, i.e. about ten years after., 57610=(The last column in the table is designed to show that if the population continued to increase at the same rate, as for example from 1825 to 1835, then it would have doubled in the course of 54 1/2 years.), 151042=Eilert Sundt was born on 8 August 1817 in Farsund, a small town on the south-west coast of Norway which, at that time, had a population of about 600. His father, a one-time ship's captain, but by then a small shopkeeper, had difficulty in rearing his large family; Eilert was the last of 13. Fortunately his mother belonged to the ranks of the indomitable, turning her hand to a wide range of activities, each bringing in a little money.9 It was not enough, however, to keep Eilert at school and from the age of 12-14 years he was self-taught.10 Nevertheless, backed by his doughty mother who was determined to see one of her sons join the Norwegian Lutheran clergy, Sundt entered the university in Christiania (now Oslo), having come top of the 132 candidates who sat the university entrance examination in 1835. Thus he entered a milieu swept by waves of national feeling, the first generation to reach university after independence from 400 years of Danish rule in 1814. He calls it the \"radical generation\" (see below, pp. 98, 108) committed to freedom, romantically attached to all things Norwegian., 43280=1846-50: Not such a marked rise in the number of marriages on account of dearth and other unfavourable conditions., 50022=\"In the years 1816-1825\", so the writer goes on, \"the population of the kingdom increased so fast that one cannot easily find the like of it in any other European country. That the size of the population in that period increased so markedly, despite the fact that, taken on the whole, the kingdom's economic circumstances were not so good,2 is only a repetition of that same phenomenon that shows itself everywhere in population movements. At the cessation of the suffering which has violently retarded it, the population doubles its efforts and so fills up the gap brought about during the previous period.\" This view the author supports by pointing out how the increase in 1815-25, for the most part, had been greatest in those districts of the kingdom where in the years 1801-15 the reduction had been the greatest. \"Among the new reasons for the growth of population, the spread in the cultivation of the potato stands uppermost. The cultivation of this plant has not only increased the population, but also made the peril of famine less threatening.\"3, 9843=The interpretation I venture to put forward is based essentially upon the totals of births in Table 12. These totals appear somewhat differently, however, when they are presented as five-yearly totals for the years 1735-40, 1741-45 etc. as against the years 1738-42, 1743-48 etc. These different methods of computation are to be found in Table 13., 30534=According to these lists, the number of marriages in the five years 1795-99, which almost corresponds to the five years 1796-1800 in the table, was 34,313. Furthermore, the number of births: in the five-year period 1786-90 was 121,413 in the five-year period 1791-95 was 137,972 in the five-year period 1795-99 was 138,797, 82391=Table 6. By how many per cent the number of marriages, in each five-year period, is above or below the mean, in each of the dioceses of Norway, 1801-50, 43420=1841-45: A marked rise in the number of marriages as a result of particularly favourable business conditions., 155172=1 Jon Elster, Dagbladet, 30 October 1978. 2 Nils Christie, Eilert Sundt som fanteforsker og sosialstatistiker, University of Oslo, Institutt for Sosiologi, Oslo, 1958, p. 15. 3 Elster, Dagbladet. 4 ibid., 23858=32. Generally speaking it is not really correct to put the marriages and births into fixed five-year periods as I have done for the five years 1801-05, 1806-10 etc. and then to carry out comparisons such as those above. This comparison can usually be carried out somewhat more exactly and will then show even more plainly why, for example, it was to be expected that in the years 1836-40 far fewer marriages would take place than in the years 1841-45. The fact is that most men do not marry at precisely 25 years of age. One will come closer to being correct if one takes the age mid-way between 25 and 30 years (27 1/2 years).5 From now on it will be understood that the men who married in the years 1836-40 must have been born, not in the years 1811-15, but at the earliest in the years 1808-12. But it was in just those years that a much smaller number of children were born (only 121,007) than in any other period of the same length since the beginning of this century. And this is not the only thing to be remembered at this point. In those years, the worst war years, mortality was greater than at any other period for several generations. Furthermore this high mortality occurred especially amongst the small children, the reason for which must probably be sought, not only in the poor nursing which in that pressing time could be rendered them, but also in the fact that in the suffering which affected everyone in the country, and therefore also those who became mothers, many children were undoubtedly born weak and with little chance of survival. Indeed there is reason to believe that the mortality experience of the cohort of those years, owing to these circumstances, continued to be somewhat greater than usual, even after the distress and hard times were over.6 However, as unusually few children were born in the years 1808-12 and as an unusually large number of them died at an early age, it is obvious that 28 years later, or in the years 1836-40, there would be an unusually small number of men in the 28-year-old age group, and consequently unusually few marriages. This supposition accords very well with the fact that it was actually in these same years that a lower number of marriages was established than in any other period of equal length since 1815. It must also be assumed that the number of marriages was likely to be somewhat smaller than it otherwise would have been because as noted earlier, the years 1836-40 saw some bad seasons. But from what has been said it seems clear that even if there had been an uninterrupted run of good times, both at that time as well as before and afterwards, the number of marriages must have been lower in 1836-40 than either before or since. Furthermore, with regard to the particularly sharp increase in the number of marriages from 1841 onwards, it ought to be recalled that, just at the corresponding time 25-30 years before, vaccination was no longer a recent introduction but was more generally spread and the result was that multitudes of children were kept alive who otherwise would have been hidden in an early grave., 75366=Table 8. Five yearly totals of marriages in the deaneries of Laurvik, Jarlsberg, Hedemarken and Gudbrandsdalen, per 1,000 of the mean number of marriages in each, 1801-50, 57389=Table 11. The growth of population in Norway, 1769-1845, 132094=How successful was Sundt in reaching the public he sought? Most of his work came out either within the pages of Folkevennen (The People's Friend) or as supplements to it. This journal was founded in 1852 as the organ of Selskabet for Folkeoplysningens Fremme (The Society for the Promotion of Popular Enlightenment) which began its work in the same year. Sundt was a member of the Society's committee in 1852 and became its chairman and editor of its journal in 1858. By 1862, the circulation of The People's Friend had risen to 4,277 (of which 11 copies went overseas); a remarkable total given that the population of the country was then only 1.6 millions. In that year Sundt carried out an analysis of the circulation list.24 Of the 4,266 Norwegian subscribers the largest single group was made up of farmers (634), the smallest of crofters or cottars (husmenn) who numbered 6. There were 425 senior civil servants and professional people, 310 priests, 156 officers, 396 school teachers, training college students and parish clerks. In addition to these individual members, 495 libraries also took the journal. Regionally The People's Friend was fairly evenly distributed with the exception of the Christiansand Diocese in the south-west of the country and the Troms\u00f8 Diocese in the far north which had approximately 6o per cent and 70 per cent of the national average respectively, calculated on a per head of the population basis. Despite the fact that Norway was overwhelmingly rural at this time (only 16 per cent lived in urban areas in 1865) half the subscribers lived in the towns. Neither the society, nor its journal, quite lived up to its name, as Sundt admitted.25 Those cottars and poor farmers who appear in the pages of On Marriage in Norway would rarely appear to have read about themselves in the pages of The People's Friend. Workers' education movements still, of course, share this same fate., 10907=Twice in this century has the number of marriages risen both sharply and over an appreciable length of time, namely in the ten years after 1815 and after 1840. I have expressed the opinion that this is something that was to be expected after a similar increase in the number of births at certain, corresponding, earlier periods of time. With that I have accomplished what I particularly wanted to do in this chapter. But when the opportunity offered, I also collected the data covering the movement of population in our country for a still earlier period and have put upon them an interpretation, by which the movements which have occurred in the present century can be explained as the continuation of movements which lie further back in time. I therefore devote another couple of pages to the presentation of this conjecture. If my words give rise to other and more successful enquiries which would carry these investigations further, then they would contribute to shedding considerable light upon the fortunes of past generations in our country., 153855=5 Helge Refsum, \"Sundt\", Norsk Biografisk Leksikon, p. 279. 6 Christie, Eilert Sundt, p. 13. 7 Om gifterm\u00e5l i Norge, Universitetsforlaget, Oslo, 1967; Harham.

In Sweden, where the conditions in this matter must be more or less the same as ours, one knows the ages of the women who become mothers. In the years 1836-40, the average yearly total of women who bore children was 95,876, and of these there were:, 50820=24. In the year 1840 Professor Schweigaard published his Norges Statistik (Norway's Statistics), in which the last chapter dealt with population. The Professor had at his disposal the figures from the censuses up to and including 1835 together with the yearly totals of births, marriages and deaths up to the same year., 110612=It was as early as the year 1735 that such annual counts were ordered and begun. During the last century, however, the matter was not discharged with the carefulness that was desired, nor were the returns regularly printed and so preserved from destruction. But from 1801 until 1850 reliable returns have been printed each year.1 The present time is a rather inviting one, from the point of view of making ourselves more closely acquainted with the matters with which these returns deal. We can, as it were, pause at that great milestone, the half-century, and cast a searching glance at the past fifty years with all its various changes of fortune., 80026=Earlier, in paragraph 13, it was shown that, as far as the total number of marriages was concerned, the 10 five-year periods could be broken up into three groups. These cover the years 1801-15, 1816-40 and 1841-50. It is fairly obvious that the same period grouping can be applied to each of the five dioceses. The most noticeable exception to this is to be found in the years 1811-15. During these years the Christiania Diocese appears to be the first to move into the second of the three periods, the Christiansand and Bergen Dioceses represent a transitional state between the first and second period, whilst the two northerly dioceses still remain within the first period., 147674=11 Cited in Martin S. Allwood, Eilert Sundt. A Pioneer in Sociology and Social Anthropology, Oslo, Olaf Norlis Forlag, 1957, p. 22. 12 Cited in Christophersen, Eilert Sundt, p. 68., 147410=Sundt began what turned out to be his life's work at a time of considerable social unrest. Norway had escaped serious disturbances in the revolutionary year 1848, but the authorities had been shaken by the growth of a radical socialist movement led by Marcus Thrane, a newspaper editor. Much of the inspiration for this came from the English Chartists. At its height it was to be the biggest socialist movement in the world, reckoned in relation to the country's population. Sundt was appalled by its revolutionary tenor and because it set Norwegians against one another. He joined the movement, however, with the intention of depoliticizing it.13 In this he failed. The government then used force, arresting Thrane in 1851 (he was to remain in prison until 1858) and other leaders. The movement's collapse was aided by improving economic conditions. On Marriage in Norway contains several references to what Sundt calls the Workers' Agitation (see below, pp. 94, 102). He undoubtedly sympathized with the plight of the lower classes (p. 99) but as a believer in the ability of a free society (p. 107) and of economic growth14 to solve their problems (p. 105 and n. 3, p. 102) he could not support their methods. For him revolution was not the answer, but progress was both possible and likely. Sundt was no Malthusian (p. 99). There is little in the Sundt of 1850 to distinguish him from most other members of his class. Like them he subscribed to a set of moral values which led him to condemn many of the actions of the working class. Some of these he discusses in On Marriage in Norway, including early marriage, illegitimate births and \"night courtship\" (bundling). But even as early as 1855, when that book appeared, Sundt is seen to have changed his views markedly. He says that much in our actions is socially determined: \"what is permissible and right, what is decent and becoming. These ideas and opinions embrace us tightly on all sides, like the water in which the fish swim, like the air in which the birds fly\" (p. 53). What appears right and proper to one group in society appears scandalous to another. He notes, for instance, that the urban middle class regarded night courtship as highly offensive (so much so that Sundt comments on his daring in having written about it more openly than anyone had ever done). And yet the offence this causes the urban population is no greater than that felt by country folk at the sight of a kiss between engaged or married couples (p. 162). He discusses the impact of work on the determination of ideas and values (p. 115) and sees much of the differences in the latter, between one part of the country and another, as a product of different work situations. He warns against \"judging a single feature of lower-class life when one does not know the whole\" (p. 158). Thus, for example, to condemn, as morally reprehensible, the crofter's son for marrying at a comparatively early age (the outcry against the supposed \"reckless marriages\" was the starting point of Sundt's study) was to ignore the economic and social context which, when understood, revealed the action as being the most rational (and morally justifiable) in the circumstances. The more Sundt studied, the more he understood and the more he came to justify the actions of working-class Norwegians. By putting oneself into the circumstances of the poor one is less inclined to condemn their actions, he writes at the close of On Marriage in Norway (p. 162). Between 1850 and 1869 Sundt moved from trying to get the working class to accept the values of the middle class to seeking to justify the former to the latter. At times he appeared to be defending the indefensible. To the liberal progressives whose platform he had once shared he appeared hopelessly reactionary. This in part explains the abrupt and ignominious end to his life's work when in 1869 the Norwegian parliament passed a motion to end his grant (by 51 votes to 47). In part too it explains why he had no immediate followers., 53459=On the other hand the increase in population between the censuses of 1815 and 1825, was so great (see Table 11) that, as the writer points out, not until that time could it be matched anywhere in Europe. \"As to the reasons for this marked increase\", so the Professor continues, \"it seems the following must be considered pre-eminent. Experience shows that organic activity, when it wakes to a new life after a period of rest, usually demonstrates an increased vigour. Consonant with this experience one can therefore perhaps declare that Norway's population, after stagnating for many unfortunate years at the beginning of this decade, began to rise and especially so in those parts of the kingdom which, in the previous period, had suffered most loss or which had increased least. Since 1814, the country has enjoyed a constant peace under which, not only have old businesses revived, but many new ones opened. The nation has become better educated, partly by the founding of the university and of many grammar schools and partly by the considerable improvement in the parish schools. In medicine there have also been various important improvements, with many medical posts established. Vaccination, though no doubt introduced and decreed in an earlier period, has been adopted more widely than formerly, particularly since the smallpox epidemics in Smaalenene, Akershus, Buskerud, Jarlsberg, Laurvik and Bratsberg in the years 1818 and 1820. In addition to this, although epidemics, both of smallpox and other diseases, have broken out almost annually here and there, for the most part they have been very mild and in all of them mortality has been very low. The earth's produce has been plentiful and good in most years and neither a general crop failure nor a bad harvest has occurred for some years. Thus the nation has been able to furnish itself with an adequate amount of good and wholesome food usually at very low prices.\" In conclusion the writer draws one's attention to the fact that the number of allodial disputes at law in this period has been especially small. Ordinarily these have contributed to the neglect of agriculture, or even vandalism and the destruction of woods, which again were bound to be detrimental to population growth., 72684=20. We can test this rule on some individual parishes, for example the three northernmost ones in the Gudbrandsdalen Deanery. The totals for these are to be found in Tables 9 and 10. Here the regularity is even less apparent than in the totals for the deaneries. A marked deviation from the usual rule is that in the years 1841-45, as well as in the years 1846-50, the totals for Lesje Parish are not as great as they were around 18251. Nevertheless, there is still an unmistakable accord between them and the Gudbrandsdalen Deanery, the Christiania Diocese and the kingdom as a whole. In each individual parish we find small totals in the first two or three five-year periods, then a considerable rise to 1825 or 1830, a fall to 1840, and then another rise., 137585=If Eilert Sundt's interests were wide-ranging, so too were the methods he used to explore them. On Marriage in Norway exemplifies this. So much so that it can be studied as a manual of research methods in the social sciences, with the added virtue of readability thrown in! Sundt set up hypotheses and tested them. For this he drew on the writings of other scholars, both native and foreign (pp. 24, 66). He used historical data derived from parish registers of births, marriages and deaths as well as earlier censuses. He even tried his hand at what today would be called oral history, though somewhat ruefully he writes that \"although the Norwegian farmer is remarkably conversant with present conditions in his parish, indeed almost within each and every house, his knowledge is very imperfect and confused about the conditions and events of earlier times\" (p. 21). He had a strong commitment to quantitative analysis, arguing, in the particular context of this book, that the \"purpose of giving statistical information about the condition of the people is so that this will guide our investigations into the life of the people\". To answer a question not with guesses and impressions based on chance examples, but with figures was always at the forefront of Sundt's methodology. That is not to say he did not believe in the value of qualitative evidence derived from first-hand contact, conversations and interviews. During the six and a half years from December 1850 to the summer of 1857, Sundt reckoned that his research caused him to be travelling for 754 days.18 He talked to farmers, crofters, labourers, teachers, civil servants, clergy, factory owners, indeed anyone who would help throw light on what interested him. In On Marriage in Norway, Sundt makes especial mention of one of his informants, a farmer, with whom he had a conversation that \"lasted from morning till night for an entire eight days!\" Sundt was also a great exponent of the use of the questionnaire. Several of his books depend very heavily on material acquired in this way; for example his three-volume Om saedeligheds-tilstanden i Norge (On morality in Norway) as well as his Om aedrueligheds-tilstanden i Norge (On temperance conditions in Norway). For the latter exercise Sundt sent out 2,431 questionnaires (one for each school district) requesting information on the level of sobriety in the area. He had 2,008 returned.19 His subsequent analysis of these for possible shortcomings has been described as still today \"a joy to read\".20 His questionnaire for On Marriage in Norway was a more modest affair, being sent only to the 197 parish priests of the Christiania and Christiansand dioceses. The questionnaire itself, however, was far from modest, containing as it did 109 items. It was completed by 158 priests (p. 134)., 50476=Schweigaard speaks firstly of the sudden halt in population growth between 180l and 1815. Essentially he explains it in the same way as Hoist, namely as a result of war conditions between 1807 and 1814. \"It is notable however\", he adds, \"that the increase in population was very slight also in the particularly profitable years 1801-07. The chief reason for this was the crop failures at the beginning of the century.\", 45008=6 But look at my Table 2, which shows a marked increase 1841-45, but a much weaker one in 1846-50. 7 My Table 1 also shows that the number of marriages was a great deal lower, especially in 1847, than in the immediately preceding years. Nevertheless, the number was still higher than in any single year before the five years 1841-45, when the great increase began., 77529=Table 7. Five yearly totals of marriages in the deaneries of Laurvik, Jarlsberg, Hedemarken and Gudbrands, 1801-50, 78502=Figure 2. Five-yearly totals of marriages, expressed as a percentage of the mean number of marriages 1801-50, in each of the dioceses of Norway., 25476=31. In the years 1815-25 an unusually large number of people, as is frequently remembered, established families. As one would expect, the number of children born increased very considerably, from 124,000 in the years 1811-15 to 154,000 in the years 1816-20, that is 30,000 more. It was then to be expected that in the years 1841-45 there would be a much greater number of people in the 25-year age group than in the period 1836-40, since these years were just 25 years after the ones in which the many children were born. But when there are many people in the aforementioned age groups, then it is both to be expected and hoped for that many, little by little and mostly in the ages between 25 and 30, will have both the inclination and the means to marry and establish families. It is quite natural that in hard times, when it is more difficult to make a living, some are induced to put it off for a year or two, but in normal times it is to be expected that more marriages will be established when the number of people in the marriageable age group is larger. And Table 12 shows that in the years 1836-40, when, as we have stated, the number of marriageable people was bound to be lower, so too was the number of marriages. But the number of marriages was greater, and much greater at that, in the years 1841-45 (and likewise in 1846-50) when the number of marriageable people was greater. Indeed when we look at Table 1, we see that the number of marriages rose very steeply just from 1841 onwards, in much the same way as the number of births rose very suddenly in the corresponding earlier period., 48475=\"In the period 1826-35, the condition of the common people was, taken on the whole, good, and better than in the previous decade. But the greater part of the deficiency in the population was already made good, which is why we find that the increase is not at the same rate as in the years 1816-25.4 The census, the next time it is held, will without doubt show a proportionately smaller increase than in the former years.\", 43521=1836-40: Another decline as a result of several years of crop failure.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{309078=So, how old were the bachelors and spinsters of the propertied and working class when they got married?5 How many were there under 20 years of age, between 20 and 25 years etc.? The answer is to be found in Table 29, which again is based on the data from the years 1851 and 1852., 78658=One will understand that those who in 1835 and 1845 were 30-40 years old, must have been mainly the survivors of those who ten years before, or in 1825 and 1835, were 20-30 years old. (It is assumed that immigration and emigration made no difference either way.) In the same way the 71,077 men who in 1825 were 30-40 years old must have been the survivors of those who in 1815 were between 20 and 30 years. This total should be 77,905, if the relationship between 1815 and 1825 was the same as between 1825 and 1835 on the one hand and 1835 and 1845 on the other. After further investigation, which would be too tedious to explain here, I have found it more correct to deduct a further 2 per cent, and so instead of 77,905 put 76,347. It is reasonable to suppose that this total comes very near the true one, and in any case is hardly likely to be too great. In the same way is found the number of women who were in the 20-30-year age group in 1815., 344023=But as recently as under the government of Christian IV, we can still see, in the provisions of the country's laws, that the girl's father and mother or, if they are not alive, her next paternal relatives, should arrange for her marriage and make an agreement about the size of her dowry and settlement. (If the girl married without their advice she forfeited her inheritance.) When the girl has become a wife, she should still keep a separate account of her property so that her husband would not be able to squander it.10 Not quite so many directions as regards marriage are given in the Law of 1687. Furthermore it is said here that it is not only the parents who should rule the girl since her consent shall mean something also. Nevertheless the law still pays great regard to the economic side of the matter and therefore assigns the guardian great power, as he can control the girl's property if she marries without his consent. In particular, regulations were made providing for the situation where the guardian, for the sake of his own profit, misuses his power and refuses to let the girl marry, even if she could make a good match.11, 17873=In each of the years 1845 and 1846 more couples were married than in any previous year - in all probability for as long as people have lived in Norway. In the second of the two years there was the highest total ever - 11,152. In the next year, 1847, when corn prices were so unusually high, the number of marriages was greater than in any year before 1841, though considerably lower than in the year 1846, namely only 9,890. If we make a separate list of the bachelors married we find that there were:, 305844=Table 28. Civil status of men and women of the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) at marriage in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand, 1851 and 1852, 198468=However, I put forward some new arguments against this opinion. First, it is certainly the case that the expectations of life have actually increased amongst the upper classes, in which I reckon the farmers as against their servants and crofters. As evidence of this I could mention the very general complaint of a growing luxury, a complaint I am still rather inclined to reject than to share. Rather I would refer to that which I confidently dare to call the general practice of daily life in the \"better\" houses, as we call them, where stress is laid on greater comfort and on providing children with a better education. I am of the opinion that it is as natural as it is fortunate that such signs should show themselves especially amongst the radical generation, as I have called it, which from 1815 onwards was drawn into life; the generation which, in its younger days, breathed in the ideas and feelings of freedom and independence and so from 1841 onwards, sought to create a home and a family life that would in some measure accord with its expectations. And secondly, those of our fellow citizens who stand on a somewhat lower level of well-being and breeding - the lower classes, as we call them - what reason can one give for the opinion that the same nobler spirit has not entered here also? There is indeed in our country no yawning abyss between the two classes. The man of property, the master, lives in the parlour; the worker, the servant, is in the room next door. Only a thin wall divides them, with a wide door in between that is continually opening and closing. The ideas, the opinions, the habits move easily from the one room to the other., 158769=In these same years, 1841-50, the number of marriages rose from not quite 83,000, which it was in 1831-40, to over 103,000; an increase so great that we do not find its equal in any other country; not in England, France, Prussia, Denmark or Sweden (para. 74)., 271702=120. From this table we learn, for example, that in Nordhordland (or Strile-land) the marriage frequency in 1831-40 was 77.2 and that in 1841-50 it was 88.1. Thus in each of the two periods it was considerably higher than in most other districts, so that Nordhordland was at both times no. 50 in this series. It can therefore be supposed that in this district there are particular factors operating all the time which give rise to unusually large numbers of people getting married. On the other hand we find that in Gudbrandsdalen the marriage frequency was very small in both periods, so that the district was no. 1 in the years 1831-40 and no. 8 in the years 1841-50. But since in each of the two periods business conditions were quite different (partial scarcity and distress in some of the years 1831-40 and good times in most of the years 1841-50) and yet still the number of newly marrieds in Gudbrandsdalen was fairly small in comparison with most other districts, it is reasonable to suppose that there must be certain circumstances here which were not just of a temporary nature, but year after year acted as a check on people's inclination to marry., 152500=7 In Nordland or Finmarken it would not be possible to travel a single day without noticing what the ebb and flow means. In the Christiania Fjord, on the other hand, one could spend a lifetime without thinking that there was such a thing. This example illustrates how it has come about that the statisticians of other countries have not noticed the condition we have discussed here, or, if they have come to think about it, have not given it any great weight. Earlier, in para. 63. I spoke about how in the works of foreign writers I had not found any hint of the opinion that an increase in the number of marriages at a certain date could be due to an increase in the number of marriageable people, in its turn, the result of an increase in the number of births at a certain earlier date. After this was written, and the whole of the preparatory work for this essay completed, I found a new and comprehensive work, which had in the meantime come into the University Library (Bevolkerungswissenschaftliche Studien aus Belgien by I. E. Horn, Leipzig, 1854). Here (vol. t, p. 223) the idea is presented, though it is argued that it is not correct. According to this writer if we find the \"marriage frequency\", i.e. whether marriages are many or few relative to the whole population (including even married people and small children), then we should find, as we did in Table 20, that it was greater in 1841-50 than in 1831-40. From this we should conclude that as times had been so much better in the period 1841-50, this alone had caused an increase in the number of marriages that was greater than that in several of Europe's most flourishing countries (para. 74). The increase had then nothing to do with the fact that the number of marriageable people in the 20-30-year age group had fallen in 1835 and risen so markedly in 1845 (Table 17), nor that of these marriageable people at least as many, relatively speaking, as before must remain unmarried (Table 21). The good times in 1841-50 (at any rate the truly very unusual times) should then have resulted in the fact that of those who were old enough to marry and yet still remained unmarried (for there is no point in talking about the others), there were more than before who did actually marry and at least as many as before who were compelled to put off marriage. Thus whereas before, of 100 marriageable persons, let us say 80 married and 20 remained unmarried, so now from l00 such persons we should have 90 marrying and still 20 remained unmarried! In the same way one could show, after observing the water in the Christiania Fjord, that there was no ebb and flow in the north of Norway, and that, therefore, there was nothing in the assertion that the moon influenced the movement of the sea., 146425=86. Many in number, but not relatively. Rather fewer. With this is linked something else: namely that in the most recent period there were fewer bridegrooms and brides in the young ages, under 25 years, than we reckoned there should be (see Table 16, para. 61 where the matter is presented as an exception to an otherwise general rule). When a boy of say 24 years of age, who at the new year has perhaps half-decided to get married, sometime later during the year is induced to put off his wedding until the next year, he becomes 25 years old. If he then puts it off another year he reaches 26 before becoming a bridegroom. With this small illustration we have made it easier to understand the matter to which I must now draw attention. When, as we have seen in this present chapter, the number of marriages in this country in recent years has become relatively fewer than before, then we can put it down to the fact that people have delayed marriage, some probably for only a year, others for several years. So when they have finally married they have been older by some years than was the case earlier. The observation that in the most recent period there were so few bridal couples of a very young age, has already called forth the surmise that something must be going on to cause young people to delay marriage. This surmise is confirmed by what we have just learned, namely that there have been relatively few marriages in the period 1841-50. The fact that the two observations agree with one another, lends support to them both., 100738=72. \"Quite so\", I hear an intelligent man say, \"Quite so, my dear fellow. At last I understand what you have explained in so much detail; namely that the increase in the number of marriages, which occurred from 1841 onwards, was, to a great extent, caused by the fact that from 1815 onwards, many more children were born than before, so that subsequently we have many more adults in the marriageable age groups. But I must admit that I don't quite see what ends this new way of looking at the thing really serves. I must also say that it seems to me that we don't get such an agreeable picture of human life from it either. I too, before today, have thought over the matter and I have the impression that I have found both a reasonable and acceptable explanation in the reflection that when God gives us good times, then it is easy for people to make a living, so more people can, with a good conscience, follow their heart's desire and establish a family. Besides, I have also thought that when, in one way or another, a certain improvidence of spirit comes to prevail in a country, then more people marry than otherwise would, including some who ought not to, at least not just then. According to your explanation, however, it appears that neither circumspection, nor improvidence has anything to do with it; that it is alone dependent upon whether many people or few come into the world. Human life does then actually come to be very much like a river that rises and falls according to the rain and the drought, which also happens to be the metaphor you yourself used.\", 139254=In 1835 there were, besides a couple of widowers, whom as we noted before were mostly old men and therefore ought not really to concern us, 12 bachelors (to be exact 12.2). It seems, therefore, that the obstacles in the way of people wanting to get married had increased, as the total of those who did marry was relatively less than in 1825., 105346=Table 19. Ten yearly totals of marriages (their rise and fall expressed in percentage terms) in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, England and Wales, France and Prussia, 1801-50*, 86668=Table 18. Cohorts of births (1796-1825), adults aged 20-29years (1825-45) and marriages (1821-50) in the dioceses of Norway, 188903=These more or less equal totals would fairly certainly have been close to the actual one if there had not been so much emigration at this time. However it is unlikely that emigration was so great that the number of males in the 20-30-year age group in 1855 would not have been much greater than in 1845. However, we shall fairly soon get to know the truth of this matter as a result of the census at the beginning of next year. By the same kind of calculation it may be assumed that the number will be somewhat less in the years 1861-65. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the want of workers, from which our industry for the time being suffers, will continue, except in so far as one can make do with boys of 15-20 years, whose number by that time will have increased (see para. 102). [In 1855 there were 123,164 men aged 20-30 years and in 1865, 123,068. The mean number of marriages per annum in the years 1856-60 was 11,663 and in the years 1861-65 it was 11,386. - Ed.], 96848=70. So we come to the most important question: why was there so small an increase or even a decrease in the number of new marriages in the years 1831-40, in the kingdom as a whole and in each of the five dioceses, whilst there was such an extraordinarily marked increase in the years 1841-50? Does this not suggest that times must have been depressing in the former years and flourishing in the latter? If this were so, then one must also say that a great part of the kingdom's youth, the marriageable part in the 20-30-year age group, must have emigrated from the country in the former years whilst a numerous body of young people, in the same ages, must have come here from other countries in the latter. For the census in 1835 found only a few people in that age group; the census of 1845, on the other hand, found many more. But such a migration to and fro has not taken place and so the answer to the question becomes this: in the years around 1835 there were not so many people in the marriageable age group between 20 and 30 years and therefore there could not have been so many marriages, even if times had been of the best. On the other hand, there was a particularly numerous body of young people aged between to and 20 years. For each year that passed they became a year older, so that, around the year 1845, they were between 20 and 30 years of age. They had then reached the age at which to marry, and even if times had been hard and prospects gloomy many no doubt would have married. Indeed, instead of being surprised at the large number of people who married in the years 1841-45 in the Throndhjem Diocese - an increase on the previous ten years of not less than 16 per cent - and instead of explaining this as evidence of particularly favourable circumstances in the diocese, one must now turn the question round and ask: what were the unfavourable circumstances that resulted in the increases being so small, as against the other dioceses, when the number of marriageable youth had increased so very considerably (by as much as 36 per cent)?, 166812=94. It was otherwise, however, in 1841-50. Now there were 90,000 who married and who we assume had found employment; 90,000 as against 71,000 in the previous decade, an increase which must be described as extraordinary. How did this come about? How could it have been possible? Whatever the reason, the fact itself is remarkable. But it would have been absolutely inconceivable had we not known that at the same time, from 1835-45, the number of young men in the 20-30-year age group had increased from 82,809 to 116,295. Of this latter number we can assume that 83,000 had the same access to employment as that same number had in 1831-40, mostly by inheritance from forebears or by only a slight expansion of earlier businesses involving no great difficulties. But, as we have seen, the number of jobs found in this way was not the same as the number actually procured, namely 90,000. Where, we ask, did the rest come from? The answer is, out of the energy, the hard work of those 116,000 young men; from the exertions of ship's carpenters and of sailors; of fishermen, farm labourers and foresters; of handworkers, shop assistants; of physicians, clerks, schoolteachers etc.; altogether an army of about 33,000 men all in their most energetic years. The farm or business of their parents fell not into their hands. But they themselves had hands to work with and what have they not been able to do? They had ambition and courage in their breasts, brains in their heads and what new things have they not been able to find?, 138717=At a normal wedding in this country in 1825 (and probably in each of the years 1821-30) we can imagine there were about 12 widowers and bachelors (12.2). Amongst them was one bridegroom. The remainder, the rest of that same 12, were probably, for the most part, people who certainly had the desire to raise a family, but what had happened to them was about the same as we heard from our friends at the wedding we described above: various circumstances came in the way so that they must delay marriage for at least a year., 130109=82. If we now, at one time in the period 1841-50, for example, in the course of the year from Midsummer day 1845 to Midsummer day 1846, could have gone round the entire country and been present at all the weddings and there found all the relatives and all the neighbours gathered together, then we would have been able to find and note down what the priests, during the course of the year, and the census at the New Year actually discovered and recorded., 108350=* The totals for Norway and Sweden are taken from the official tables. The totals for Denmark, up to 1845, are taken from a general table in the English Eighth Annual Report of the Registrar-General; the rest from Danish tables. The totals for Prussia are drawn from Schubert's Handbuch der allgem. Statskunde von Europa as well as from Dr Dieterici's Mittheilungen des statistischen Bureau's in Berlin. The English table, referred to above, contained all the totals for England and France up to 1845; for the following five years I have used: for France, the annual communications of Moreau de Jonnes in Annuaire de l'economie politique; and for England, the German writer Horn's work which covers the population statistics of several states. It should be understood that under the designation \"England\", Ireland and Scotland are not included. For Prussia and France and for most other states I deem it to be impossible to get lists of marriages right from the beginning of the century, and due to the fact that the many wars up to 1815 changed the frontiers of most states such totals from the earlier period would not be comparable with those from the later., 186913=(ii) The increase in the number of marriages which took place in 1851-54 is scarcely greater than what one would just about have expected in view of the increase that, in all probability, again took place in the number of people in the working and marriageable age groups. That this is reasonable, one will understand when one considers that the persons who in the current year, in 1855, are in the 20-30-year age group, are for the most part the survivors of the cohort born in the years 1826-35, a cohort that was considerably greater than that of 1816-25, from which came those who, in 1845, were in the 20-30-year age group (see lists of births in Table 12). After 1815, we see a new generation step forward. Its magnitude was apparent in the years 1816-25, but it grew somewhat more in the years 1826-35. From 1841 onwards, that same cohort stepped forth into the adult age groups, firstly with great force in the years 1841-50 and then in greater numbers still from 1851 onwards. Essentially for that reason, then, the number of marriages rose in the years 1841-50, and not unnaturally continued to do so up to 1855. If I should venture a prediction, it must be that the number of marriages will still rise somewhat further in the years 1856-60, but then the rise will stop and there may even be a fall in the years 1861-65.4, 345226=10 Christian IV's Norwegian Law Book of 1604, Inheritance, Chs. 1, 2 and 3. 11 Norwegian Laws, Bk 3, Ch. 18., 177183=If there is competition for bread, many find themselves disappointed of their expectations. It can happen quickly then that now one, now another, allows himself to be overcome by despair and, one step further, becoming indifferent to his own honour, violates the rights of others. Something like that, one is bound to believe, occurred in our land in just those years 1841-50, since the number of those whom one has been compelled to punish for theft and other crimes has risen so considerably., 84277=8 When, for a long period, there have been hard times in a country (war, hunger, pestilence) then necessarily the population is almost stationary. So when good times return, population growth again takes place that much more quickly, with an increased number of marriages and births just as if it was making up for past neglect and filling up the holes. This is an old idea and has been applied to our own country. In the period 1801-15 we had war, bad harvests, infectious diseases, and the population stood, so to speak, still. In the period 1815-25 there were better times and the population increased rapidly (see Table 11). The stagnation of the population in the former time and its increase in the latter, has been explained as the natural result of the contemporary happenings and of them alone (see Ch. 4). But now Table 17 shows that even in the hard times the number of marriageable persons in the 20-30-year age group increased, so that there were many more of them in 1815 than in 1801. The reason for this lies in the fact that there was a considerable increase in the number of births in the corresponding earlier period, and as a result of this there would, under normal circumstances, have been a greater number of marriages (and therefore of births) around 1815 than around 1801. The marked, indeed the unusually marked, increase in the Norwegian population immediately after 1815, is not, therefore, just the result of the then prevailing conditions (the changeover from war to peace etc.), but also of the events of earlier times which gave rise to the marked increase in the number of births in the years 1786-95 (Ch. 5)., 52337=Each of these are further divided into 8 age groups and that separately for each of the two sexes. For the years 1839-45 the totals are given in the census tables for 1845; for the years 1846-53 I have drawn them from the handwritten bishops' lists., 176705=If there is competition for bread, there are many who lack employment and for that reason dare not think about marriage. If they need only postpone it a year or two then the danger arises that they will fall into the temptation of living an immoral life and if they do then misfortune will occur more frequently. And it has occurred in our country in the years 1841-50: as a proof of this, witness the sharply increased total of illegitimate births at that time., 200157=104. Or will some people still assert that while the expectations of life have risen in the upper classes and resulted in a limitation in the number of marriages, the complete reverse has occurred amongst the lower classes, so that many people, instead of following the example of the former, have, in the period 1841-50, struck out into all kinds of recklessness? Now this can be answered not just by guesses and generalized assertions, but with figures. First, we have figures which force us to assume that whilst the number of people in the marriageable age groups rose very markedly in the years 1841-50 this increase took place more amongst the workers than amongst the propertied classes.6 Secondly, we have presented figures in this book which show that new marriages in the same period, many though they were in total, were still not many relatively, so that rather more people than before put off their marriage. Would anyone then still say that working-class people, in their recklessness, were prompted into marrying earlier and more frequently than before? If this were so then the number of marriages in the poorer classes should have increased to an extraordinary extent for two reasons: first, because there were so many people in this class and secondly because these same people were said to be so quick to marry as compared to the members of the propertied classes, who must, therefore, have balanced this increase by a more than doubled limitation on marriage. But, in this case, the limitation on marriage on the part of the propertied classes would have had to be much greater than our daily experience of the matter leads us to believe. Probably, then, the truth of the matter is this: the expectations of life have risen and have contributed to limiting the frequency of marriages in Norwegian society, both in the labouring and propertied classes, though most probably to a greater extent in the latter.7, 6529=11 Aschehoug, \"Om Folkemaengden i Norge 1664\", Tidssk. f.

Str\u00f8m reckons the beginning of the bad years from 1740, but speaks of several in a row., 139611=In 1845, finally, or in each of the years 1841-50, there were to the nearest whole number 13 (12.8) bachelors. That is more than in 1835., 104834=For every 100 couples who were joined together in marriage in the years 1801-10 in this country, there were 121 in the years 1811-21; that is, 21 per cent more. For every 100 couples married in the latter period, there were 110 in 1821-30; that is, 10 per cent more. For every 100 couples married in the years 1821-30 there were 96 in the years 1831-40; that is, 4 per cent fewer. For every 100 couples married in the years 1831-40, there were 124 in the years 1841-50; that is, 24 per cent more., 14125=41. In Table 1 I gave the number of marriages year by year from 1801 to 1850, and I noted that the number was never the same two years running. In fact the difference from one year to the next was at times quite considerable. However, this diversity does not surprise us. We are, on the whole, accustomed to so many changes in life, that we have even come to accept the statement that the only constant factor to be found in human affairs is that there is no constant factor. In the path of the heavenly bodies, in the change of the year's seasons, in the uniform roar of the waterfall, we find a natural constancy and regularity: in human life, in mankind's decisions and actions and fortunes, one does not expect to find such. And this reflection makes it seem to many people a vain task to begin such countings and calculations, as appear in this book, about matters relating to such a variable phenomenon as human life. But everything has two sides, as we shall see., 176056=If there is competition for bread there will be many who are worsted in the contest. They will either never see themselves in a permanent position with an adequate income, or at any rate will not do so as quickly as they reasonably could have wished. Such people are obliged to postpone the establishment of a family either for a time or for ever. In 1841-50 this was the situation for many people. For the marriages, though many in total, were yet few relative to the number of those who were of the right age and who no doubt wanted to marry. This is something which our investigations in previous chapters have brought home to us., 259243=119. Yet the fact that young people move away from one district and marry in another is only one of the many circumstances which could cause marriages to be less frequent in the one district or more frequent in the other. First and foremost one should have the most reliable information possible as to which were the districts where marriages were more frequent or less so, without regard to what the reasons for this are. And so I use the data I spoke about in paragraph 116 (namely population totals and the number of marriages) so as to calculate the marriage frequency separately for the period 1831-40 and 1841-50. The result of the calculation I give in Table 24, the columns of which contain:, 277165=This small and easily grasped table is extremely instructive. What I shall point out first is that it very clearly confirms the earlier presented proposition (para. 85) for the kingdom as a whole, namely that the marriage frequency has become less in recent times (that marriages have become few relatively despite the fact they have become many in total). This shows itself to have been the case in every single one of the five dioceses. When, for example, in the Christiania Diocese in 1841-50, there were 68 marriages per 1,000 marriagable men, so is this a smaller number than in 1821-30, when there were 85. Next I must point out the fact that is as interesting as it is indisputable, that the marriage frequency in the Throndhjem Diocese is less than in any of the others, not only in a single short period, but in each of the 5 periods into which the 30 years from 1821 to 1850 are divided. How interesting this is and how important for a closer study of social conditions, one will understand if I but name a single circumstance which is most closely connected to marriage conditions, namely that through the whole of this century, that is, for as long as we have any knowledge of it, the misfortune of high illegitimacy rates has been much greater in Throndhjem than in any of the other dioceses., 135697=83. This is about the same total as we found in Table 20. Now, however, we have learned that if we would properly investigate whether or not marriages are relatively few or relatively numerous, so that afterwards we can determine if the benefits of good times encourage people to marry or the pressures of hard times put off people from marrying, then we must only pay attention to those who belong to Class 2, namely the bachelors and spinsters in the adult age groups (over 20 years) as well as the widowers and widows. For all the rest must be left out of the reckoning. In 1845, or generally speaking in one of the years 1841-50, we must therefore think of the matter as follows. For every 2 widowers and 13 adult bachelors, one was a bridegroom. For every 5 widows and 13 adult spinsters, one was a bride. The others, 14 men and 17 women, were unmarried but were of marriageable age, so for that matter they were in a position to marry. But there were circumstances which caused them, either with or against their heart's desire, to put off marriage for the time being, or perhaps for ever. For the moment they must just sit and look at the one couple whose celebration they attended., 131092=There were, it follows, an equal number of bridegrooms and brides. Of the people appearing in the census of 1845 there were:, 185584=1821-25: 8,816 1826-30: 8,512 a decrease of 3.5% 1831-35: 8,447 a decrease of 0.8 % 1836-40: 8,136 a decrease of 3.7% 1841-45: 10,118 an increase of 24.4% 1846-50: 10,501 an increase of 3.8% 1851-54: 11,122 an increase of 5.9%, 143484=We must then believe that such obstacles, which in 1835 led so many to go unmarried, still continued to operate and to a somewhat greater extent., 1863=38. If we believe, therefore, that these assumptions about the usual ages at which people marry and become parents are valid, and if we suppose for a moment that there have been, right from 1735 to the present day, unexceptionable times, so that neither crop failures nor war have checked, nor commercial prosperity and other unusual good fortune have advanced, the growth of population, then we could explain the curious rise and fall in the number of children born, as Table 13 shows, fairly accurately, by applying the rule that many parents must, in aggregate, beget more and that few parents must, in aggregate, beget fewer children and grandchildren. In this way one sees how demographic changes in our country are linked from 1735 to the present day., 205830=106. Favourable conditions, by aiding the efforts of those engaged in winning a livelihood, always contribute to increasing the number of new marriages. But favourable circumstances also usually have the effect that mortality in a country becomes less. This was the case in Norway in 1841-50 in comparison with 1831-40. But if mortality falls, then it is less likely that older tradesmen die; less likely, therefore, that younger men can take over their occupations. Here then those same favourable circumstances make it somewhat more difficult for people to establish a family. Good times mean an increase in prosperity, which leads to the development of ideas about what belongs to a happy family life and to an increase in what one expects of life. And this development limits the frequency of new marriages. Here too then is an effect and a counter-effect. In good times the expectations of life are commonly increased and this would, as we have said, limit the frequency of marriages and their number; but it happens in good times too that a greater amount of the prosperity is collected into single hands, so that a greater crowd of workers collect together about the single man of property and the business manager. In other words the working class grows greatly in numbers by comparison with the propertied class. But if greater and greater demands are made on life by the working class also (and marriages are always more frequent within this class) then we can understand why one and the same circumstance can work both towards an increase and a decrease in the number of marriages., 96293=Why did the number of marriages in the Christiania and Troms\u00f8 Dioceses rise so much more in the years 1841-50 than they did in the Christiansand and Bergen Dioceses? Was it solely because trade was flourishing in the former and not so in the latter? I do not know if there was such a difference, but regardless of this it is reasonable to suppose that the number of marriages would be greater in the aforenamed dioceses, on the grounds that the number in the marriageable age groups, according to Table 18, had grown the most there., 73744=3 Eighth Annual Report of the Registrar-General, London, 1848. 4 In the English work it is said, for example, that: \"The number of marriages can possibly rise and fall independently of external reasons; but from the foregoing we must conclude that the lists of marriages in England indicate those periods in which times were good as precisely as the stock-exchange dealings measure the hopes and fears on the part of the men of finance. If the stock-exchange dealings are the barometer of credit, so are these marriage lists the barometer of current well-being, and to an even greater extent that which is expected and is being enjoyed beforehand. Therefore the marked rise and fall in the number of marriages in England is the result of peace after war, rich harvests after dearth, high wages after unemployment, active business after flatness in trade, hope after despair, national triumphs after national catastrophes.\", 204178=105. If we cast an eye back upon the hills and valleys through which our investigation has wandered, there lies before us a series of observations. The number of marriages rose suddenly and sharply in the period 1841-50 both in the kingdom and each of the five dioceses (Chapters 2 and 3). The reason for this lies in the marked increase in the number of children born after 1815 and the resulting increase in the number of young people in the marriageable age groups from 1841 onwards (Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7). Though in turn this led to a greater total of new marriages, relatively speaking there were not so many (Chapter 8). It was probably the case that this great number of young people led to increased economic activity from which many found employment and so were in a position to raise a family. But this same multitude also entailed distress within the country, under which many who were less lucky were obliged to put off marriage, and besides put up with a number of other great hardships that followed. These were at their worst in the early years, but by the period 1851-55 it seems the initial difficulties were overcome. The primary reason for the more notable changes in marriage which we have witnessed in recent years lies therefore in the internal composition of the population, itself a product of the earlier population change. By the side of this such circumstances as are otherwise looked upon as being the essential reasons - changes in the external conditions at the time and in the moral position - must be considered to have exercised only a subordinate influence. So far has the present chapter brought us., 55660=57. Now we shall take as an example those belonging to the third of the age groups, namely those who have reached their 25th but not their 30th year. In 1839-43, their total was 12,779. Here we ask: when was the bride born who was married on 1 January 1839, and on that date had just attained her 30th year? Answer: 1 January 1809. Further: when was the bride born who was married on 31 December 1843 and had then just reached her 25th year? Answer: 31 December 1818. From this it appears that the brides aged 25-30 years who were married between 1 January 1839 and 31 December 1843, must be assumed to belong to the cohort of female children born during the ten years 1809-18. And from the yearly lists of births, it is possible to get the size of this cohort. It was 127,367., 165178=In the years 1821-30 there were 86,639 marriages. That then, was the number of men who married. But of these I would guess there were only 86 bachelors in every 100,2 that is, 74,509. In 1831-40 there were 82,914 men married and the number of bachelors amongst these was by the same calculation, 71,306. Finally, in the years 1841-50 the number of men getting married was 103,096 and the number of bachelors amongst them was, by an actual count, 90,131., 4474=but in most of the years 1741-45, or more correctly from 1740 onwards, the number increased dramatically to:, 143645=Relative to the number of bridegrooms, the number who failed to marry rose without interruption from 1825 to 1845.6, 228423=Whether, therefore, we look either at Norway as a whole or at the individual dioceses, we cannot but be surprised at such a marked increase in the number of marriages in the years 1841-50 in our country by comparison with that in other countries., 98923=71. It is - to repeat myself once again - by no means my view that the favourable or unfavourable circumstances of the time have no influence upon people's decision to marry. Only one must not use this alone to explain the greater or lesser number of marriages that occur in any particular period. The totals that have been given probably now show with sufficient clarity that the number of marriages also depends upon the number of people in the marriageable age groups, which number again is for the most part dependent upon the greater or lesser size of the cohort that was born at an earlier time. This view is confirmed again and again, first if one considers the changing number of married persons in the 15-20, 20-25, 25-30-year age groups etc. in the years 1839-53 (Table 16), then if one considers the correlation between the number of marriages as a whole and the population in the 20-30-year age group in the entire kingdom from 1801-45 (Table 17) and finally if one looks at the situation in the individual dioceses from 1825 till 1845 (Table 18)., 32861=The answer to this question we find by looking at the table in paragraph 42, which shows, on the one hand, that in the dearth year of 1847, about 1,000 fewer bachelors married than in the good year 1846 and yet, on the other hand, there was almost the same proportion of old and young bridegrooms in the year of the death as in the good year. We must then believe that this circumstance arises as follows. At the beginning of each year, there are, in each age group, a certain number of persons who think they will marry in the course of that particular year. But there are also a certain number, for example 10 per cent in each age group, who have not definitely decided to marry and whether they do so or not will depend upon how fortunate they are during the course of the year in their job or business. Now when a bad year occurs and deprives people of part of their anticipated income, it is that to per cent of would-be bridegrooms who are prompted to delay their marriages until better times and this happens in all age groups, both in the older and the younger., 160130=90. The idea behind this phrase must be developed further, so I put up this new thought. That which caused the marriages in the period 1841-50 to be so many in number also caused them to be so few relatively speaking., 145540=As for the women who married, there were more in 1825, fewer in 1835, and still fewer in 1845 relative to those who did not. Now some might say that the difference between 1835 and 1845 was not very great. That is probably true. But even so the extremely small difference here is enough to show the truth of the supposition, \"Many - but not relatively speaking\". For those who married in the period 1841-50 were at any rate not more, relatively speaking, than before, but rather fewer. So, therefore, the supposition I set up stands and the contrary supposition, \"Many in number and still more relatively\", is not correct. But if this supposition is not correct, then the view that the unusually large increase in the number of marriages in 1841-50 was evidence of the benefits of prosperity or of an increase in recklessness, is not correct either., 112477=From the data in the tables, about which there is no dispute, we learn that in the years 1831-40 not quite 83,000 couples were married in Norway, but that in the years 1841-50, there were over 103,000. \"Look\", say some, \"look what an increase, what a happy increase. This total tells us so clearly what good times there have been in the country: a good and golden time for the agriculturalist and the fisherman - with flourishing trade and shipping - in short, with solid good fortune in all kinds of business, with rising living standards and encouraging prospects; a good and golden time, which caused even the most circumspect and careful to cease to be anxious of the perils involved in obtaining a livelihood, so that they ventured to establish families and by doing so increased the strength of the country.\" I will not contradict the fact that the years 1841-50, with regard to these external circumstances, could be described as a happy time for Norway, though in the last half of the period considerable disturbances certainly occurred, about which we have already seen fit to talk (para. 25). I will not, as I said, set myself against the many well-informed men who are content to believe that in those years, taken as a whole, times were good. But what I will say is that the unusual rise in the number of new marriages must not be taken as proof of this., 158221=The emigration to America, which in 1841-45 scarcely amounted to 5,000 persons: see Femaars Beretningen om Rigets \u00d8konomiske Tilstand 1841-45 (Five Year Account of Economic Conditions in the Kingdom 1841-45), p. xxxi, and which it is fairly certain earlier had been even less, rose in 1846-50 to 10,779. On mortality in the years 1821-30, 1831-40 and 1841-50 see my essay Om D\u00f8deligheden i Norge (On Mortality in Norway), Ch. 9. On internal migration see the same essay, p. 126., 189924=(iii) The change for the better that has occurred with the disappearance of unemployment and other setbacks in recent years (1851-55) ought not to be attributed purely to the good conditions then prevailing. One recalls that it is now fifteen years since 1841, when, according to my view, the pressure, and with it the resulting difficulties, began. Even with average conditions, it could well be expected that the situation would become better after such a long period of time. This year rich crops grow in many fields that were first cleared and cultivated after 1841. Today many hands find employment in factories whose owners first got the capital to build after 1841. Indeed many seamen this year have work on ships which were built last year with the money that an old ship had brought its owners in the previous year. In short, the unusual activity, indeed strain, which thousands of new men were called upon to face during the years 1841-50 has now begun to bear the expected fruit. The early difficulties of that new and numerous generation have now been overcome. That generation whose conduct and fortune at that particular time we have now looked at, the men of 1841, have harvested the fruit of their labours and still need helpers and helpers' helpers in order to manage the harvest properly. So now only good can come from the fact that the number of young people in the 20-30-year age group is a little larger today than in 1845., 37461=Now when we look at the totals in the table, for example, for the first years in the series, 1839 and 1840, we find an almost complete agreement in the totals for the different age groups. The same is also true if we look at the last two years, 1852 and 1853. If on the other hand, we compare the totals for the first and last years, i.e. 1839 and 1853, we do not find such an agreement. But this must not be thought to have destroyed the impression we obtained earlier of a harmony and conformity to law. For, though the totals in the later years are different from those in the earlier ones, the passage between them is an even one, so even in fact that one could not possibly believe that it had come about by chance. The change is as follows. In 1839 somewhat more than 1 out of each 100 bridegrooms (i.e. 1 per cent) were in the youngest age group, that is under the age of 20; but little by little and fairly regularly this percentage of young bridegrooms declined, though of course this could not have been by very much. In 1839 some 28 per cent of the bridegrooms were between the ages of 20 and 25 years, this percentage rose little by little to 29 per cent and finally declined to 24 per cent. The number of bridegrooms between the ages of 25 and 30 years rose from 40 per cent in 1839 to 44 per cent in 1853. Taken on the whole, therefore, the number, or more correctly the percentage of young people, was greatest in the early period, least in the later., 292948=128. What we should first of all seek to discover, with the help of this information, is how the marriages were shared between the two classes. In this respect we have evidence on 8,933 couples and, therefore, for the same number of men as women married in the years 1851 and 1852. We now ask: to what extent did they belong to Class 1 or to Class 2? I have reckoned the relationship in percentages for both dioceses under one, for each of the two dioceses and for each of the seven groups. The result appears in Table 26., 309699=Table 29. Age at marriage of bachelors and spinsters of the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand, 1851 and 1852, 155404=88. When we compare the total of those who went into regular marriages with the total of those who became the fathers and mothers of illegitimate children, we find that the latter rose even more markedly in the years 1841-50 than did the former. At the same time (1841-50), the number of criminal offences increased in like manner to an alarming extent. It was in about these years too that the great emigration to America aroused both astonishment and sorrow. It was also the case that at that time more and more people, especially those in poor circumstances, moved from district to district within the kingdom, in search of a livelihood. If one looks away from the past three or four years and recalls the situation then, one has to admit that it was more often the case that the worker had to look for work than that the employer had to look for men, and that it was not so seldom that unemployment prevailed. In 1845, a new poor law was introduced. During the next five years the complaint was heard, perhaps more than ever before in this generation, of rising poor rates. That mortality in the period 1841-50, though rather less than in the period 1831-40, was nevertheless greater than in the period 1821-30, is in itself a somewhat dubious indication of the health and vigour of the people. For after the long period of peace and progress one would have expected it to have been lower. The men or the authorities who have to find people to fill, not only the major public offices, but all sorts of minor and quite poorly paid posts, have probably never seen so many candidates as just at that particular time. Up till then we had indulged in an almost unalloyed pleasure at \"Norway's splendour\". Came there reports of strife and unrest in other countries, we sang with confidence:, 11746=It will, therefore, scarcely do to explain the remarkably high total of births shown by Table 13 for the period 1791 (or more correctly from 1787) to 1800, by merely referring to those prosperous conditions, to contemporary circumstances, or external conditions, as we have called them. There seems, on the contrary, grounds for taking into account the previous circumstances, or internal conditions, which could be thought to have contributed here. And when we, with this before our eyes, now cast a glance at the table, then we find the following. In the 30 years, which we supposed to be a generation, or the usual period between a cohort of parents and children, or of children and grandchildren, before 1791-95 and 1796-1800 (i.e. in the years 1761-65 and 1766-70) a numerous cohort came into the world. And 30 years before 1801-05, i.e. in the years 1771-75, only a small cohort appeared. After the former large cohort one would expect a similarly large cohort of successors in the years 1791-95 and 1796-1800, and this we find to be the case. After the latter small cohort a small cohort of successors was to be expected in the years 1801-05, and in actual fact this too is what we find., 272877=We could classify the whole series of the 53 districts into two classes, namely the first 28 where the marriage frequency in the entire period 1831-50 was least and the last 25 where it was greatest. Of the first 28 it seems the majority (namely those marked *) belonged, in both individual periods (i.e. in 1831-40 and 1841-50), to that half of the districts where the marriage frequency was the lowest. Of the other 25 districts, it is seen that the majority (those marked **) belonged, in both individual periods, to the other half of the districts where the marriage frequency was the highest. With individual exceptions, it has, then, in all probability, been the case that it is not merely temporary, more or less favourable circumstances, that have caused differences in the marriage frequency, but permanent ones., 165680=2 That was the position in the years 1841-45, and in this there is usually no great change from one time to another., 3740=In the years 1741-45, we see in Table 13, the number of births was at its lowest. Naturally there was a reason for this and it probably lay in the events that were known to have occurred just then. These years must have been a time of unusual suffering in Norway. This can be understood by the fact that mortality was unusually high at that time., 6899=In such a time of terror as there must have been in the years 1741-45, it is likely that the number of children born must have been less than usual, a fact which the table shows. We must also assume that death took away many of this small cohort, so that only a few people from this period grew to adulthood., 179085=If there is competition for bread, the crush lasts for a long time and the pain is felt acutely. Then can the masses become impatient, the mood of the less-happy part of the population become bitter, the tension between the different parties and interests in society threaten to burst. Think of the crofter yonder on the land that he has newly reclaimed suddenly pushing the crowbar into the ground, as if to bid defiance to the landlord and the tradesman. He turns grudgingly towards them when they come to demand their due. But it was in this way that the Workers' Agitation was ignited towards the end of our period - from 1848 onwards. Great numbers, feeling their need and trusting to their strength, almost forgot right and duty, law and order - in which society's, and we would hope, not least, the sufferer's comfort and strength lies.3, 238130=It is reasonable to assume that the misfortunes of war did not strike each individual district to the same extent. It is, therefore, also reasonable to assume that the result just described (the changeover from a smaller number of marriages in 1831-40 to a greater one in 1841-50) would not show itself to be equally great in each individual district. But the similarity is still so strong in the 53 districts that, with one exception, there is in all of them a rise in the number of marriages and in 41 districts that same rise is so strong that, by comparison with other countries, it can be described as exceptional. The general explanation I have given previously for the entire kingdom and for the five dioceses very probably, therefore, applies to the smaller districts too. It is thus difficult to deny that here again we have solid support for that explanation., 294151=Table 26. Number of brides and bridegrooms belonging to the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) as a percentage of all brides and bridegrooms in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand and their constituent parts, 1851 and 1852, 203246=I have also, as one has seen, a strong suspicion that, after 1841, there have been somewhat more frequent examples of newly married people of the working class being compelled to accept poor relief within a short time of their marriage. Yet this occurred together with other events testifying to the straitened circumstances in the country. So that it is at any rate as correct to blame it upon the times of scarcity as upon the moral conditions prevailing.8, 157429=But the Workers' Agitation of 1848 was not the work of \"cheerful souls\". It was \"the world's tumult\" which rather violently brought home to us the fact that our \"free city\" could also be threatened.1, 8724=It seems we must follow the totals in Table 13 still further! After the last-mentioned low, the number of births increases and maintains itself at about the same level for three five-year periods. It is known that Norway enjoyed a time of good business during the American War of Independence. It was, however, of short duration and does not seem to have exercised any great influence on the growth of population by an accession of new births. On the other hand, we see that in the five years 1791-95 and likewise in 1796-1800, a considerable increase in the number of births occurred, so considerable in fact, that we must at once seek out the most likely reason. It is to be noted that whilst the total (see para. 28, n. 2) appears to begin to rise as early as 1787 or 1788, it falls immediately at the beginning of the present century in the years 1801-05. What can the reason be, therefore, for that temporary increase?, 15554=Some marry under 20, others between 20 and 25, others between 25 and 30 etc. From 1839 onwards we have data on the age at marriage of everyone. In that year there were 6,691 bachelors who married, mostly with spinsters, others with widows; and of them, 1,848 were between 20 and 25 years old. From this one can calculate that for each 100 of these 6,691, there were 28 in that age group. How many were in that age group in the next year, in the year 1840? There were also 28 for every hundred. In the year 1845 there were likewise 28 and in the year 1846 also 28 for every 100., 37193=In Table 14 I set out year for year, from 1839 to 1853, the number of bachelors in every 100 who married, and who were under 20 years of age, between 20 and 25 and between 25 and 30 years. In working out the totals for the first group I used fractions., 178614=If there is competition for bread, one finds oneself cramped. The prospects seem gloomy both for the present generation and for the growing one. So it is reasonable that people should think about going to another country where conditions are said to be more roomy and where there is a better living to be had: to emigrate - the young people for their own sake and the parents for their children's. The period 1841-50 was the time of emigration to America., 130926=The number of weddings in that particular year was just 10 per cent of the 103,096 weddings that took place in the ten years 1841-50, that is, 10,309., 177995=If there is competition for bread, then the amount of employment will fall short of what is required; and naturally, if many find themselves in this situation, they will eventually come to regard their underemployment as liberal enough, will rest content with it and will, quite probably, still establish a family even in their straitened circumstances. But such families run the risk, when a crowd of children appears or some misfortune occurs, of sinking into poverty and helplessness: and in the period 1841-50 there has been a strong complaint of increased poor rates, especially for young families., 252743=117. When we compare the first and the last districts - Gudbrandsdalen no. 1 and Vest Finmarken no. 53 - we see that there is, by no means a small difference in the marriage frequencies. Amongst a population of 10,000 people in the period 1831-50 62 couples, on average, were married each year in Gudbrandsdalen, whereas in Vest Finmarken, on the other hand, there were 107., 257115=It is natural for human beings, when they reach adulthood, to think of marriage. It is natural too that they would fain stay at home. So exceptional circumstances must occur before the young will do violence to themselves and leave their native hearth. Now there are every year, on average, several thousand couples who marry here in the country, and if it could be proved that in recent years there were more stay-at-homes who had not tried their luck outside their own districts, more that is than in earlier times, then I would call this a serious state of affairs, well tuned to sustain the opinion, maintained by many people, that recklessness predominates; a recklessness whereby people only follow their natural inclinations and marry without exerting themselves further for employment etc. But our table now shows us how, in the years 1836-45, there was much migration in the country; out-migration from some districts, in-migration into others. We must necessarily assume that, for the most part, this migration was of young, unmarried people, who struck out to seek their livelihood. We find it reasonable to suppose that eventually they settled down where they found the best prospects. We presume that it was just people like this who contributed to the fact that marriages were so frequent in the districts to which they moved. And this confirms, what in another place I have demonstrated, or at least shown to be likely,5 namely, that this migration was considerably more frequent in the years 1836-45 than in the earlier period, 1826-35. All this leads us to the conclusion that the young people of this country seem to have shown, in recent times, a heightened eagerness to get to a position that could justify them establishing families. This conclusion is in agreement with all the evidence which earlier in this book I have presented against the dismal view that youth's recklessness in this matter has been growing worse and worse., 279563=In the five years 1836-40 there occurred a series of bad years in several districts of Opland and not least in Gudbrandsdalen; bad years so serious that \"love gifts\" had to be collected in the surrounding districts in order to help the needy. To this fortunately temporary circumstance must probably be attributed the fact that the marriage frequency showed itself to be so exceedingly small in the years 1831-40 and 1836-45. Nevertheless it is remarkable to see how small the average frequency is, both in the period 1826-35 and in the good times 1841-50, something one will find by comparing these figures with those in Table 25. This confirms the impression we already have that in recent years the frequency of marriage in Gudbrandsdalen has been very low., 231466=115. How then do I explain it? I have already done so. In the previous chapters I have pointed out that one must take regard, not only of the circumstances of the present, but also of those of earlier times. In the years preceding 1815, the country was at war. Many people must have delayed their marriages and the number of children born was smaller than usual. But the year 1815 brought peace and good times. Now unusually many new families were established and the flock of children increased markedly. From 1841 onwards these children reached the age of 25 years and, as a result, the number of people in the marriageable ages increased considerably, after which it was to be expected that the number of marriages would rise. What was expected, happened. That we have seen, so far as the entire kingdom is concerned (para. 65, Table 17) and we have seen it too in each of the dioceses (para. 67, Table 18). Now we learn that it is true also for the smaller deanery districts., 329797=8 In the Norwegian Law of 1687, 3-18-5, where it is said that people under age must not be betrothed, the coming-of-age for a boy is set at his 20th birthday, and for a girl at her 16th. So the difference in age was four years. This age difference is very close to that which we have found between bridegroom and bride in Class 1 (3.8 years)., 147975=87. Many marriages in total, but not many relatively! The reason for the markedly increased number of marriages in the period 1841-50, is not, therefore, the confidence inspired by prosperous times, nor is it recklessness (for that must first of all have shown itself in there being many relatively)., 227807=113. In paragraph 74 I showed how the number of marriages had increased from the 10 years 1831-40 to the 10 years 1841-50, namely:, 253133=But why have I also given the details of in-migration and out-migration? I beg to point out that in Gudbrandsdalen, where the marriage frequency was at its lowest in the period 1831-50, it so happened that more people moved away from the district than from anywhere else. That is to say, in the years that I know about, namely 1836-45, not less than 7 per cent of the population moved away, so that Gudbrandsdalen, in that respect also, was no. 1 of the entire 53 districts. In Vest Finmarken, on the other hand, the reverse was the case. There, people were moving in, and in such great numbers (13 per cent) that the district in this respect became one of the last in the series (no. 50), for there were only some few districts where in-migration was yet greater. It appears, therefore, that in the districts from which out-migration took place, fewer people married, and the reverse, that in the districts into which people moved, more married and established families., 292429=4 Apart from the fact that no information was received from some parishes, I have also been compelled to omit some, when the answers disclosed a misunderstanding of the questions. What degree of completeness the facts used in the following tables represent is best seen by comparing the sum total of marriages in the years 1851 and 1852, in the two dioceses (excepting both diocesan deaneries) with the number I have used. The former figure was 11,310, the latter 8,933., 139764=Table 21. The number of marriages relative to the number of marriageable men and women in Norway, 1825, 1835 and 1845, 170244=95. Certainly the period 1841-50 is a very remarkable one in our business annals. All the old branches of industry pushed forth vigorous shoots and new branches emerged by their side. The rich crown of this tree of industry soon arched over the happy roof of many a new family and its lively growth promised golden fruit., 165845=We assume that more or less all of these people had got a job before they married though there must have been great differences in the manner in which they got it. In the period 1831-40 the number of marriages was small, as against that of the previous decade. This accords with the remarkable fact that in 1835 there were few people in the 20-30-year age group, that is, the age at which most people both look for a livelihood and think about establishing a family. But with the number so small, it is reasonable to suppose that the majority obtained employment and a fixed position by a kind of inheritance from an earlier generation, so that only the minority were obliged to open up new opportunities. The ability and industry of the rising generation of energetic young men was, for the most part, occupied in keeping in operation the activities of the existing population. There was neither the need nor the numbers for any particular expansion., 242668=Table 23. The deaneries and dioceses of Norway ranked according to the number of marriages per 10,000 population in the years 1831-50 and the extent of in-migration and out-migration between the years 1845 and 1855, 226870=I think of the country as being divided into 53 districts which, for the most part, coincide with the deanery districts and which, therefore, can be indicated by the names of these.2 From the lists drawn up each year by the priests, deans and bishops, I have taken the total of marriages for each district for the 20 years 1831-50. The information derived from these totals should be the starting point for further enquiries regarding individual parishes. But they also serve to support some of the views presented in the previous chapter and, therefore, an account of them has its rightful place in this present essay., 168350=Many a stretch of wasteland that had waited since primeval times now got to know the mattock and the spade. Many a stream that till then had seen its power go to waste now got its mill to drive. Many a full-grown pine that before must have stood in fear of languishing away in its lonely wood was driven out and laid down in the keel of a new ship. The countless shoals of herring and cod which come so faithfully to our shores, now found a livelier reception from a greater number of hands. Even special laws and a special police force were needed to prevent friction amongst the host of fishermen on the sea. During the whole time that I have travelled through the countryside, farmers have told me about the considerable expansion of agriculture that has taken place in recent times and when I have then asked at about what time this expansion can be said to have begun, it seems it goes back to about the period we are dealing with here, the time when that radical generation, brought into the world from 1815 onwards, began to take control of agriculture and everything else. These more enterprising farmers have set more people to work. Besides, many a young, strong labourer has been forced to do road work (and, with a will quite different from anything known in earlier days, has worked himself up in the world) so as to make the roads more passable for this bustling generation. Who, indeed, can reckon how people knew how to open fresh ways? Look at the student of 1841. First he diligently acquired the knowledge that a graduate must have. Then if, for example, he was a theologian or a medical man, he sought out his work place and, as energetically as ever, cleared the dead wood until the people round about understood that it was worth money to put their children into the school of such a capable teacher or pay for medical assistance from such a clever doctor., 260302=Table 24. The deaneries and dioceses of Norway ranked according to the number of marriages per 10,000 population in the years 1831-40 and 1841-50, 239015=116. What we have given here can also be expressed like this. The movement of population in the majority of the districts is fairly similar, so that, for example, there have been few persons in the 20-30-year age group in the years 1831-40, many on the other hand in 1841-50. Had the movement of population been absolutely uniform in all districts then we would not need such an elaborate calculation as that which is used for the kingdom as a whole in paragraph 84 in order to find out whether people married more or less frequently. Then it would be enough to know the number of marriages and the size of the total population. Since the movement of population, as we have said, is not exactly the same everywhere, this simple method of calculating the frequency of marriage will not give an altogether accurate result. But still the similarity is, as we have seen, quite considerable in the majority of the districts, so we can assume that such an easy manner of calculation will bring us close to the truth. In the whole of Norway we find:, 121251=Relatively more marriages in 1841-50 than in the preceding ten years? Has that opinion been proved correct, which said that the increase was brought about by the prosperity that made some people more hopeful, others more reckless?, 183794=The chief reason lies in the remarkable, in other countries probably unheard of circumstance, that the crowd of young men and women in the 20-30-year age group increased so markedly from 1841 onwards, that while the total of men in 1835 was 82,809 and of women 89,539, in 1845 they were respectively 116,295 and 122,971, an increase therefore of 40 per cent (33,486) in the case of men and of 37 per cent (33,432) in that of women., 285174=125. Up to now in this book, the returns made annually by the priests which we have used have contained nothing as to the social position of the people getting married. But on 25 April 1853, I wrote to all the priests in the Christiania and Christiansand Dioceses (except for the priests in the Christiania Diocesan Deanery, i.e. Christiania Town and Akers Parish),2 requesting that they would send me details from their parish registers relating to married people and to the parents of illegitimate children, in such a way that they took cognizance of a person's social class. I ventured to apply with this request to 197 priests and I had the satisfaction of getting the desired information from 158 of them. This information is a trust reposed in me. I stand in debt to them, a debt which I must repay by carefully working through the data and then publishing them, so that the men who have kindly assisted me in my enquiries are able to see the complete picture. That part of the data which concerns illegitimate children I must reserve for another essay. Here I shall present what I got regarding marriage in the different ranks of society., 230297=There is one thing to which I must draw attention. The country outside Norway where we found the greatest increase in the number of marriages in 1841-50 was England (14 per cent). Yet in Norway's 53 deanery districts there are 41 in which the increase was greater than this., 39222=Table 15. The percentage of bachelor-bridegrooms and spinster-brides, in the various age groups in Norway, 1839-43, 1844-48, 1849-53, 305118=131. The majority of people marry only once. That one who has become a widower or a widow marries a second time is indeed rarer. But in this matter too there does appear a certain regularity. Earlier (p. 118) I said that in certain districts it happens year after year, quite regularly, that several widowers and widows remarry. I pointed out how this was based in a variety of ways upon the customs and circumstances of the people. Now one asks: do there appear to be any constant differences in this matter between the two classes, bearing in mind that their circumstances and conditions are in many ways so very different? The data from 1851 and 1852 contain the answer to this. It is presented in Table 28., 43851=Such could be the reasons for the changes which from year to year show themselves in the totals in Table 15. How was it in reality? This is a question that deserves an answer. But it so happens that the investigations which should serve to resolve this question also help bear out the view put forward in the previous chapter, namely, that the sharp rise, so often spoken about, in the number of marriages from 1841 onwards, is essentially the result of events that happened generations before - the connection between the present and the past, as I have called it. It is for this reason that I have dealt provisionally here with this matter of age at marriage., 287510=\"To Class 1 are reckoned (see the census tables for 1845, p. 26): public officials, public employees, university students, office workers, farmers (freeholders and lease holders), businessmen, factory owners, manufacturers, handworkers with a licence or actual handicraft masters, masters of vessels, and whichever other group is in a social position that is understood to stand nearest to those enumerated here.\", 50551=When the snow masses melt on the mountain we predict that the water level in the river will rise, and we are able to assure ourselves on this point by measuring the height of the water in feet and inches and fractions of an inch. When, at an earlier time, an increase takes place in the number of children born, then we conclude that an increase will occur in the number of people in the marriageable age groups (20-25, 25-30, 30-35, etc.) and finally an increase in the number of people who actually marry at these same ages. Here too we are able to ascertain the correctness of the theory by measurement. The exercise is carried out by taking the total of married couples who are in the different age groups on their wedding day. From the year 1839 onwards this calculation was in fact carried out by the priests who married them., 38943=50. After surveying the totals for each single year, and seeing that what change occurred was regular and even, we get an overall view of the situation with the help of Table 15. This sets together in five-yearly intervals the totals for the whole period 1839-53., 71116=In Chapter 5, I put forward the view that the remarkably large increase in newly established marriages taking place from 1841 onwards was essentially to be explained by the considerable increase in the number of births 25 to 30 years earlier. And at the close of Chapter 6, where I called attention to certain changes in the relationship between the marriages in the different age groups (see Table 15), I indicated that a more detailed examination would establish that view. I now venture to believe that the reader who has had the patience to follow me and who has got a correct grasp of the somewhat complicated detail, will admit that this view seems probable., 290040=127. Before I can turn to the matter itself may I quickly explain how I have made use of the mass of information. The data consisted of absolute totals and covered the two years 1851 and 1852. First of all I put together the totals for all the parishes belonging to the same deanery. Even so the data collected for a single deanery were not sufficient for statistical manipulation. I therefore continued summing the data, so forming larger groups by joining together several neighbouring deaneries. In this way I divided the two dioceses into seven groups, each of which comprised certain deanery districts, namely:, 179978=3 There was distress in the land in 1841-50; that was one thing. Another was that, amongst a by no means small part of the working class, a way of thought that was, in itself, good and to be wished for, came to be articulated. It was felt that as the sons of a free people they were not getting their share of the blessings of society. More was wanted of education, freedom and well-being. That at any rate is my opinion of the Workers' Agitation. But, on the other hand, one should not devote so much time to this matter without also remembering briefly what in all probability it was that caused the movement to die down so quickly, that turned dissatisfaction into peace and quiet. It was the new, good, free social order. The majority of the members of the Workers' Agitation belonged to that cohort of children, those new citizens of the world, who were the first to be greeted with the promise of freedom by the Constitution of 1814. In 1841-50 they were grown men, demanding the fulfilment of that promise. And it was fulfilled to an extent that is seldom seen in this world. Every intelligent man must admit that in our country we were free, that the spirit of freedom and the principal of equality prevailed here to a degree that in general is rarely to be seen. Every man was free to use his talents to serve both himself and society. He was free to move from place to place, to choose his own livelihood, to utilize every favourable opportunity that providence offered him. He had great freedom to present his views (either by himself or together with others), to publish his complaints, to demand his rights. His energies were not restrained, his aspirations were not clipped back. And it was in just this that society's best defence lay, against all the dangers of that undoubtedly perilous time. Freedom stood its test then., 181865=99. So the years 1841-50 were a time of progress and a time of distress. Society and the State made great advances in strength and prosperity, greater than ever before; but many individuals experienced distress and need, worse than had ever occurred. We have looked at the light and the dark features on the face of the country. Everything fits into this explanation of the situation as a whole: from 1841 onwards there suddenly appeared an extraordinarily numerous cohort aged 20-30 years. This injection of extra energy increased business activity to a considerable extent, as we were made aware by the fact that a much greater number of people than ever procured employment and saw themselves in a position to establish a family. But it also produced distress. Many saw their hopes dashed. We are made aware of this by the fact that many people, though they were of the right age, were nevertheless obliged to refrain from establishing a family (the marriages, rightly enough, were, therefore, many in number but not many relatively) and with that several other moral and civil misfortunes resulted on a scale worse than before., 9663=I have already recalled the golden period during the last part of Christian VIIs reign, a time whose unusual prosperity was very likely to be seen in the rapid rise in the population. I now go a little deeper into the matter. The year 1789 produced the French Revolution. This revolution gave rise to war in Europe. More and more states became involved in the war. The Danish-Norwegian state for a long time remained neutral. Norwegian shippers were picking up a highly profit-able carrying trade, and those Norwegians producing for export were paid high prices. More ships were set on the stocks and activity in the country districts producing timber for export also increased. The heightened trading activity and prosperity prompted a number of men to follow their inclinations earlier than they would normally have done and so raise families. The number of marriages, therefore, increased and quite naturally the number of children born also increased. But this last-named result of the events of 1789 could not have occurred immediately in that same year. And yet we find that a considerable in-crease in the number of births actually took place in the year 1789. Moreover that favourable state of business and trade lasted up to the year 1807, when it was suddenly broken off by the fact that our country finally became involved in the general war. Probably the farmer's hopes were sometimes disappointed when crop failures occurred in a couple of years at the beginning of the century, but the suffering caused by this was not so great. For all are unanimous in declaring that the years 1801-07 witnessed an unusually prosperous era, indeed even better than at the end of the previous century. As a result, one would expect that a great number of new births would cause a vigorous increase in the population at the beginning of this century, an increase that had begun at the end of the previous one. But, according to the tables, this was not the case, since we have noted the number of new births was already down considerably by the five-year period 1801-05., 242398=3 I have explained in my essay Om D\u00f8deligheden i Norge (On Mortality in Norway) how I calculated the extent of in-migration and out-migration in the various districts in the years 1836-45, p. 126., 68979=61. But no rule is without exception and neither is this one. I have marked with an asterisk in the table those instances where we do not find the expected correlation. There are four instances in the two youngest age groups (two for each sex) and three instances in the two oldest age groups: in all, then, seven instances out of 32. The last three instances could with good reason be excluded from the reckoning, simply because they happen to be in the oldest age groups. Of the children who were born at the end of the previous century and the beginning of this one, there are naturally few who are still unmarried in the years 1839-53, and it is dependent upon all manner of accidents as to how many of these few will finally marry or not. Not much regularity was to be expected here. Statistical calculations can cope with hundreds and thousands, but not very easily with ones and twos. The important exceptions are formed then by the four first-named instances. Among the bachelors and among the spinsters, the number of marriages fell in the years 1849-53 in both the two youngest age groups, that of 15-20 and 20-25 years. This is contrary to expectations since the corresponding birth cohorts had increased, if not by very much., 118798=We shall do this as far as Norway is concerned. We know the census returns for the years 1801, 1815, 1825, 1835 and 1845 (Table 11). We also know the number of marriages for each period (Table 17). After this, it is a simple calculation to find out what the relationship was between them. This is presented in Table 20., 34857=Table 14. The percentage of bachelor-bridegrooms aged under 20 years, 20 and under 25 years, 25 and under 30 years in Norway, 1839-53, 229016=114. The only district in the entire country where the total of marriages in 1841-50 was less than in 1831-40 was in the Lister Deanery. It is not difficult to guess the prime reason for this. In the period 1831-40 or in the majority of these years, the sild fisheries were unusually rich here. Living standards rose rapidly and expectations of life even more. Therefore many people were enticed from other parishes and here, as was shown everywhere, the benefits of prosperity caused unusual numbers to establish families. But at the changeover to the ten years 1841-50, the profitable sild fishing suddenly ceased. Instead of well-being and liveliness of spirit, there was great anxiety and alarm. As it became more difficult for people to find employment, so marriages occurred less frequently. But now, to a greater extent than before, the deanery districts of Stavanger and Karmsund came to benefit from the profitable fisheries and we find from Table 22 that, in these districts, the number of marriages rose to an unusual extent. So I dare to suggest that an accurate knowledge of business conditions in the entire country in the period 1831-40, as well as in the period 1841-50, would explain much of the differences between the districts shown in Table 22., 63033=Table 16. Cohorts of births (1784-1838) and marriages (1839-53) in Norway, 115203=77. Many circumstances in the years 1841-50 have acted as an invitation to people in this country to be happy, to set great store by the future and to arrange their domestic life after their heart's desire in a way which best serves the country's interest. But this same period has also seen its difficulties, which have been an invitation to people to exercise a cautious prudence. The spirit of recklessness which always, as it were, lies in wait for the opportunity to penetrate into a man's soul, and into the lives of the people, has probably prevailed in the years 1841-50. Certain circumstances, however, have served as a beneficial counterbalance to it. Thus there have occurred many occasions for the humanity in human life to appear and to show its strength. The good nature in man has had its encouragement and its trials - his evil nature, its temptations and obstacles. My view is just that the reason for the marked increase in the number of marriages in the period 1841-50 is to be found neither in the higher living standard engendering optimism, nor in an increasing immorality or rudeness amongst the poor., 317230=Table 30. Mean age at marriage of bridegrooms and brides of the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand, 1851 and 1852, 323845=Table 32. Mean number of years by which bridegrooms were older than their brides in the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand, 1851 and 1852, 57700=If the flow of water in the river is greater in May than in April, owing to the thawing of snow in the mountains, and even greater in June than in May, then one will learn, from the markers placed along the river's length, that the water level rises first in one month and still more so in the next. The same applies to our populations. We see three cohorts of female children: the second greater than the first and the third even greater than the second. After a certain period of time these three cohorts appear as brides in the 25-30-year age group. And the number of brides is greater in the second period than in the first and still greater in the third than in the second. Indeed, if we look still more closely, we see that just as the increase in the children born was particularly marked between the first cohort and the second, so too was the increase in the total married., 230587=These 41 districts lie partly on the coast, partly inland; partly in the south and partly in the north. These 41 districts vary enormously in their economic activities, the fortunes of which, for many reasons, could be so very different. When the Hedemarken farmers get their barns, their bins and cribs well filled, Indherred perhaps has a year when the crops do not ripen. It can happen that when the timber trade goes well and brings life into \u00d8sterdalen's woods and Sarpsborg's sawmills, the fishermen in Nordland get a poor price for their fish. It would indeed, therefore, be very remarkable if the economies of all 41 of Norway's 53 districts should have been so very much more prosperous in 1841-50 than in 1831-40 to the extent that one, on this ground alone, could explain the fact that the total of marriages rose more than in a booming England., 120580=80. What does this new table teach us? In the year 1835 - to stick to the later period which most concerns us - or, on average, in each of the ten years 1831-40, one must walk around the country until one has counted 144 people before one comes across one couple married in the course of the last twelve months. In the years 1841-50, on the other hand, one need not walk so far, for there occurred so many weddings in those years that one found a newly married couple for every 129 people. Therefore it is said that marriage has been more frequent, or relatively more frequent, in 1841-50 (1 couple for every 129 people) than in 1831-40 (1 for every 144)., 171029=Certain writers in political economy continually assert and stress the proposition that in old states, in countries where people have lived and worked for a long time, nearly all the fertile spots and all other fruitful places of work are fully occupied. It is therefore difficult for the growth of the economy to keep in step with the continued increase in the size of the population. Thus there always arises the danger of over-population. Now this proposition is combated by another, which I myself prefer to believe, namely that with morality and industry it will be man's fortune, under normal conditions, to see business extended to the extent of the needs of the expanding population. But I think I may say here, without expecting to be contradicted, that there are always great difficulties in the realization of this expectation when that population growth occurs unevenly, as it were, by fits and starts. But this is just what happened with that part of the population of Norway we are dealing with here, namely that young, energetic group seeking a livelihood, seeking a subsistence; that group of 20-30-year-old men, newly come to adulthood; such an important age, fit for so much good, disposed to so much evil. Here we no longer have those steady \"normal conditions\". The marked increase in this group of the population in the years 1841-50 was anything but normal. Rightly the question is raised: does what applies under normal conditions apply here, namely that the adult population knows how to acquire adequate employment?, 240736=If I now compare these totals I discover that in the 20 years 1831-50, for each 10,000 people, about 74 couples were married (to be precise 73.7). This total is a measure of the marriage frequency in the period., 5072=Mortality on anything like that scale has not prevailed in any years from that day to this. The worst years in this respect were the famine year 1773, about which, even now, here and there, one hears appalling reports (35,362 died); the war year 1809, when dysentery was at its worst (32,486 died); the famine year 1813, after the crop failure of 1812 (26,598 died); the hard year 1839, after some poor seasons (26,652 died); and 1848 after the dearth of the previous year (27,916 died). To fully comprehend how the mortality in 1742 must have been so much greater than in any of these following years, it must be remembered that the population in 1742 was very much lower than later and at the highest estimate could scarcely have been more than 650,000.11 So that in actual fact a fifteenth part of the population was carried off in that single horrible year. This misery was the result of a series of crop failures that hit the whole of Northern Europe. Furthermore, it can be seen from the burial registers that this excessive mortality occurred in every Norwegian diocese. The least affected was the Bergen Diocese, the reason perhaps being that just at this time, at any rate in Sondmor, the fishing was unusually good, both of cod and of herring, \"so that God apparently opened a larder in the sea, whilst he closed another on land, a blessing that ought never to be forgotten\".12, 60630=59. Table 16 deserves to be examined with some care. First, let us again find the example presented earlier, the example of the girls who were married in the 25-30-year age group. In the lowest portion of the table, in the column for the 25-30-year age group, the total of those girls is given for the years 1839-43. It was a low total. Then a much greater one appeared in 1844-48 and finally, in the years 1849-53, an even larger one still. And above in the uppermost part of the table we find the corresponding cohorts of newly born girls. The first is the smallest, the second considerably greater, and the third even greater than the second., 7223=40. After these unfortunate years the number of children born grew at an even rate for several five-year periods in a row (see the totals in Table 13). There were perhaps consistently good times for the people then. But after 1761-65 the total falls again, being very much lower in the 1771-75 period. The difference is so great that involuntarily we ask: what can the reason be? Now one thing was that the people, just at this time, were oppressed by their own government to an unusual extent, namely by the so-called Extra Tax, which was ordered in 1762 and lasted until 1772. This was a preposterous tax of not less than eight Danish shillings a month for everyone over 12 years of age: not exactly an incentive for poor people to establish families, nor for farmers, for example, to admit new crofters onto their property, seeing that in many cases they must be prepared to furnish the tax for them. Another unfortunate event was the dearth which occurred in 1773, or, to be more precise, reached its peak in that year. Here then are two contemporary events, which certainly could be expected to have contributed to the decrease in the number of births in the years 1771-75. But there is also that earlier event. For just 30 years before (1741-45) an unusually small number of children entered the world, of which an unusually large number died at an early age: a small cohort from which, therefore, in the years 1771-75 or thereabouts, must be expected a small offspring., 80189=7 The census taken at the beginning of 1801 I regard as correct for the last day of 1800, and likewise each of the following censuses as correct for the last days of 1815, 1825, 1835 and 1845. They, who on those days were 20-30 years old, are believed then to have been born that number of years before, i.e. in 1771-8o, 1786-95 etc. For the last century I have used the recently discovered totals referred to in the footnote to Table 12. Also, so far as the same periods are concerned, I have assumed that 105 boys were born for every too girls. The number of adults is set against the number of marriages immediately before and after each census, i.e. the marriages of the period 1796-1805 and the census of 1801, etc. (See Table 12.), 81736=Table 17. Cohorts of births (1771-1825), adults aged 20-29 years (1801-45) and marriages (1796-r85o) in Norway, 158140=1836-40: 6,993 1841-45: 8,782 1846-50: 11,616, 71796=63. I cannot, however, support my view by those of other investigators. As I pointed out in Chapter 4, that view is at variance with the explanations given by well-known writers in our own country. Furthermore, in spite of much research, I have not found in the works of foreign writers who have dealt with similar matters any sign of such an opinion as the one I have dared to suggest. Probably one of the most learned essays on the frequency of marriage in any country is a section in some English statistical tables of 1848 concerned solely with marriages in England in the century 1746 to 1845.3 During this long series of years, the number of marriages had naturally sometimes increased and sometimes decreased and this is explained as a result of the continual changes of war and peace, good and bad business conditions and other sources of livelihood, of activities in the colonies and conquests in other parts of the world, of changes in laws and ministries; in short, of the different circumstances which in any way could be supposed to have any influence upon the welfare of the people and of their prospects. The presentation of all this is so much more interesting because it concerns a nation that has connections with almost all countries in the world and which is therefore influenced by events and changes in even the furthermost part of the globe. As a result, this single essay is not only a contribution to the history of England, but also to the history of mankind in the same period. However, not even in this essay have I found the opinion expressed that an unusual rise or fall in the number of marriages at one period of time is to be explained as a result of an unusual rise or fall in the number of births in an earlier period; nor, that the marked changes in the number of marriages, as I have said before, could be dependent upon both past and present events.4, 259958=1and 2. The number and name of the deanery districts in the same order as in Table 23 3 and 4. The marriage frequency in the years 1831-40 and 1841-50 as well as 5 and 6. The deanery districts ordered separately for 1831-40 and 1841-50, so that one begins with the district where the marriage frequency was smallest., 12956=The cohorts for the years 1806-10 and 1811-15 could by the same method be shown to have been destined to be small or only moderately large. The war came and brought about a further - externally determined - reduction. Thus can one explain the connection between the generations up to the present time, which I have already referred to above., 138255=But what we are concerned about here is to discover if the rate in 1845 was great or not, compared to that in 1825 and 1835. This we can ascertain from Table 21. It has been worked out in just the same way as has been explained above, except that I have been compelled to go into more detail and use not only whole numbers but also fractions., 51399=56. This work has, in itself, been remarkable enough. For it covered, in the fifteen years 1839-53, no less than 153,561 married couples; or twice that number of individuals, namely 307,122. These were divided into 64 categories.1 The thought of the difficulty of the work that has already been accomplished - the counting for each single year in each parish and the totalling for the country as a whole and for the entire series of years - will help us overcome the trivial inconvenience that results when we begin to make use of the information that has been won., 148291=The result of the investigation presented in this chapter is this. The marked increase in the number of people in the marriageable age groups, the result of the great number of births from 1815 onwards which showed itself suddenly from 1841 onwards, I previously regarded as something that was to contribute to the rising number of marriages. It was one of several concurrent causes. It was something which must have played a certain role in producing the great number of marriages and therefore it was something that really ought not to be overlooked. It is now more correct to consider this circumstance (the great number of people in the marriageable age groups) as not one of the reasons but as the chief, the essential, the overriding reason. By the side of it the other things, which generally speaking elsewhere (e.g. in England) are regarded as the essential reasons (favourable contemporary conditions, good prospects etc.), sink to being subordinate circumstances, which have had some influence, but have not made much difference either way., 137832=If there were married each year, for 10 years, 1 person in 10, that would be the greatest imaginable rate. For then everyone would be married in the course of 10 years. But this situation can never actually occur. Some die during the 10 years, and overall there are usually one or two who prefer to remain permanently unmarried. The situation in the year 1845 must then be described as remarkable in itself., 191385=102. The storm has abated in the land. It was to be expected that this would occur. Heaven's blessings in recent years have caused it to happen somewhat faster and more completely than would otherwise have been the case. But anyone with a short memory can peruse the poor lists; count the number of those sentenced to hard labour on the fortresses in order to support their illegitimate children; visit the prisons and the workhouses for vagrants; look around the hovels in the suburbs or on the outskirts of country parishes; and he will find many living witnesses still from the time when there was competition for bread, when economically and morally it went ill with many people. On that account one should be forbearing in one's judgements, mild in one's usage and ready to help. And there is one thing still that we should consider. Now, in 1855, the country is governed by a greatly increased stock of men between the ages of 30 and 40 years - that numerous crowd in fact whom we met in 1845 in the 20-30-year age group. Governed, I said, for while it is the barely adult men of 20-30 years who with their youthful vigour work themselves and society forward, it is the 30-40-year-olds, seated on the councils and in parliament, and in the chair of honour in the growing family circle, who make the law of the land and raise families with principles. These men now watch a numerous flock of children grow up, a flock greater than at any time before. One knows that from 1841 onwards, when the number of marriages increased so suddenly and so markedly, the number of births also increased, just as suddenly and on the same scale (see Table 12). Here again, as it were, is a new generation. The eldest of them, in 1855, are fifteen years old; and many priests this year have certainly noticed that they have had an unusual number of children to confirm. We could count the years to when they will be adults. So if nothing quite out of the ordinary occurs in the meantime to bring about an extraordinary mortality or an extraordinary emigration, then in the years 1866-75 once more a considerably increased number of people will appear in the 20-30 age group. Like their fathers in the period 1841-50 they will look about for employment and think about getting married. But what will happen if there should be many who find their natural desires disappointed; if many fall into despondency and immorality, into lewdness and drunkenness and theft; if many are obliged to marry in straitened circumstances, so exposing themselves to the risk of impoverishment and to being a charge on the poor rate; if many should find it too confined here at home and be glad to turn their back on their fatherland? What indeed if the mood of the people is bitter and society becomes exposed to the misfortune of civil strife? That will depend not only upon the year's temperature (i.e. a good or bad harvest) or upon stock exchange dealings (lively or flat business) or upon such other things as human sagacity can affect only slightly. Essentially it will be founded upon the morality and ability that young people take with them from their childhood days and upon the freedom that is allowed, the encouragement that is given to young men, to use their great energy in opening up new fields for themselves. But this in turn will be founded upon the wisdom and care with which the fathers of the country and the fathers of its families today and tomorrow watch over the education and the upbringing of the rising generation; on the breadth of vision with which they evolve the institutions of a free state; in their patriotism, so that they put up with want and sacrifice in order to encourage the growth of industry so as to accommodate the needs of the future. Here is not the place to talk about what shall be done. Only I feel that on occasion it helps to clarify what is needed, if we set clearly before our eyes the fact that in a certain, not too distant, future - a future, indeed, in which most of us hope to share - a markedly increased need will arise, a need that demands something of moment to be done now.5 Indeed there is reason to expect that the need will grow. For it is a characteristic of life in a free and civilized society that one enlarges one's ideas as to what one needs in order to live a happy life and subsequently one's desires accord with this. One wants more and more of the things that can embellish one's surroundings and improve one's existence. One's expectations of life, as we say, increase day by day, just as fast as the means to satisfy them increases. In the continual change of ideas and customs lies the excitement of life in a civilized society and its great danger. In the future that we spoke of, much that now appears good or bad will be seen in a different light. Many opinions that are now approved of will probably by then have become old-fashioned. Things we do not now understand will then command men's thoughts. But one change can be expected, indeed to a certain extent must be desired and hoped for, namely that one's expectations of life will be greater then than now., 94734=69. These series of figures contain the answer to the vital question which, without them, would remain an enigma. I said \"vital question\", for according to the prevailing opinion it is just that rising or falling number of marriages in the country that is the surest pointer to whether a people have or have not a high standard of living and enjoy good prospects, just as the stock exchange index is the best indicator of business prosperity. In Chapter 3, I showed, by means of Tables 4, 5 and 6, how, to a great extent, there is a remarkable parallel between the rise and fall of marriages in the five dioceses. But I also showed that, whilst the number fell slightly in the Christiania, Throndhjem and Troms\u00f8 Dioceses in the years 1831-40, it rose somewhat in the Christiansand Diocese and remained about the same in Bergen. Now we must ask: is this to be regarded as proof that the Christiansand and Bergen Dioceses enjoyed better times in those years than the remaining parts of the kingdom, or that the latter experienced one or other forms of distress peculiar to themselves? The answer to this must be no. It appears that, in the course of the years 1831-40, there was in the Christiansand Diocese a more numerous, and in the Bergen Diocese an equally numerous, body of young people as in the years 1821-30, whilst the situation in the other dioceses was the reverse. The reason for this difference must essentially be sought in earlier times, where the same dichotomy had occurred with regard to the number of births., 80974=66. A fleeting glance at this table shows us the following. Of the five cohorts of births, and this applies to both males and females, the second is considerably greater than the first, the third a little greater than the second, the fourth less than the third and the fifth very much greater than the fourth. In the same way we find that the number of adults increased considerably from 1801 to 1815, and from that date until 1825. It declined until 1835 and finally increased very sharply to 1845. And likewise the number of married people increased greatly in the second of the five periods - in 1811-20 or around 1815 - increased still around 1825, sank, on the other hand, around 1835 and then increased very considerably indeed around 1845., 184425=101. \"Forgive me,\" says a well-affected man, \"this is still a new way of looking at the matter and I confess that I do not quite understand it. At any rate there is something that does not seem to fit. Up to now you have spoken about the years 1841-50. But what about 1851-55? The former are looked upon as good years and even more so the latter. For some time now one has not heard so many complaints about the poor rates; the desire to emigrate seems also for the most part to have ended; the Workers' Agitation too is quiet and there is a somewhat greater need for workers than for work. In this same period too the number of marriages has increased. Have we not here, then, proof that good times, more than all the other reasons put together, can increase the number of marriages and that this increase can rightly be regarded as testimony to good conditions in the country?\", 157853=1816-20: 12,136 1821-25: 12,670 1826-30: 12,614 1831-35: 12,111 1836-40: 12,017 1841-45: 15,731 1846-59: 17,479, 77658=5 For the year 1801 the totals are found in Schweigaard's Statistik; for the years 1825, 1835 and 1845 they are to be found collected together in my essay, Om D\u00f8deligheden i Norge (On Mortality in Norway) app. 1, Table 1. 6 In order to show the method I have used, I give some data for males from the last three censuses. Of these there were:, 185862=The years 1841-45 were more favourable, much more favourable, than the five preceding ones and many people have said that the particularly sharp increase in the number of marriages (over 24 per cent) was the result of this. By comparison 1846-50 was an unfavourable period (dearth in 1847); the potato blight; in no year any really good corn harvest; standstill in business after the February Revolution); and for all that there was a great number of marriages, and not so small an increase over the previous period of about 4 per cent. The years 1851-54 are acknowledged by all as being ones of unusually good fortune (fine, in part excellent corn harvests; a rapid sale of Norway's products abroad; fabulously high freight rates); and still the increase did not reach 6 per cent. Had the opinion been correct that the influence of good times was overriding, then one would have expected a decrease in the number of marriages in the period 1846-50 and a very sharp increase in 1851-54, as in the years 1841-45. But that didn't happen., 110746=75. Yet one more circumstance gives this enquiry a special interest for us. In Table 19 we see that over the last half-century the experience, in this matter, of the three northernmost countries has been similar in that the number of marriages has risen sharply and fallen sharply. From the period 1801-10 to the period 1811-20, the number of marriages rose very markedly in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. From the period 1811-20 to the period 1821-30, the increase continued in all three countries, but it was a much weaker one. From the period 1821-30 to the period 1831-40, the number fell somewhat in Norway and Sweden and rose only a little in Denmark. From the period 1831-40 to the period 1841-50, the number of marriages again rose strongly in all three countries. The parallel is so marked that immediately one thinks that perhaps there has been a common cause and, should this supposition be confirmed, then a clear understanding of the matter as far as Norway is concerned would at the same time spread some light on the situation in the neighbouring nations., 76901=65. Censuses were held in this country at the beginning of the year 1801, in the spring of 1815 and at the end of the years 1825, 1835 and 1845 (see Table II). In the first, and the last three of these censuses, children under ten years of age were listed separately, as were young people between 10 and 20 years, adults between 20 and 30 years and so on. For these years, therefore, I know the number of persons, both male and female in, for example, the 20-3o-year age group5 and with the aid of data from these last censuses, I can also, with tolerable exact\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00adness, calculate how many there must have been in that age group in 1815, when the census was not done in this way.6, 137116=5 It would have been yet more accurate if we could have set out of reckoning all the widowers and widows who were already of that age (e.g. over 60 years) in which they seldom or never marry. In 1845 about three-quarters of them were over 50 years of age, and it was probably the same in 1835 and 1825. For these last-named census years, however, we lack evidence on this. Here, therefore, I limit myself to the remark that, when working with the earlier census years, we stick to the totals of bachelors and spinsters as the most numerous and most important class. See the following footnote., 188293=4 From the Norwegian Life-Table for 1821-50: see Om D\u00f8deligheden i Norge (On Mortality in Norway), p. 34, I am able to reckon about how many of the children born in the years 1826-35 can be assumed to have reached the age of 20-30 years, and so be alive in the year 1855. I can also arrive at the same figure, through knowing how many were 10-20 years old in 1845, by using a method, which is the reverse of the one given above in the footnote to paragraph 65. The number of males was:, 232461=Table 22. Percentage rise or fall in the number of marriages in the deaneries of Norway from 1831-40 to 1841-50, 61715=The same applies also to the bachelors who were married in the 25-30-year age group. In 1839-43 there were 15,859; in 1844-48, on the other hand, there were considerably more - 19,646; finally in 1849-53 even more - 20,282. Accordingly when we look at the totals of male children born (see the top half of the table) we find that the first-named and smallest total of married persons came from the smallest cohort, the second and larger total from the next largest cohort and the third and greatest total from the most numerous cohort of all., 89069=* In order to fill in the gaps for the four last dioceses I need details of births for the years 1796-1800. It is possible these could be found in the bishops' archives or in Christiansand's, Bergen's, and Throndhjem's old Adresse-Aviser. Communications to me on this subject would be very welcome. [According to my calculations the missing totals of births are, for the Christiansand Diocese 42,420, for Bergen 44,081 and for the Throndhjem and Troms\u00f8 Dioceses combined 60,839. See Michael Drake, Population and Society in Norway 1735-1865, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1969, p. 171 - Ed.], 197084=103. The expectations of life! Here I mention something that I had in mind already at an earlier stage when I spoke about employment. Employment is an economic matter, but human life is not regulated by economic matters alone, but also by moral considerations, by inner feelings, and by inclinations. To these belong one's expectations of life and, because these are sometimes greater, sometimes less, it is, as was indicated, not quite accurate to say: so many jobs - so many marriages. If the expectations of life in one period are greater than in an earlier one, then there will be many who delay marriage because they believe they still do not command enough. If our expectations of life were formerly less, then fairly certainly there were more who, contented with very little, married in frugal, indeed even in miserable circumstances. Now I have already frequently referred to the opinion that a primary reason for the great increase in the number of marriages in the years 1841-50 should be sought in a growing recklessness on the part of a great section of the nation regarding the amount of thought given to domestic needs. Thus poor people married without means, indeed, without even a reasonable prospect of providing for a family. What this opinion really amounts to is that the expectations of life within that particular circle of people had diminished., 183012=100. Do I now then deny entirely that the good conditions, which indeed on the whole are admitted to have prevailed in the period 1841-50, had any share in causing the number of marriages to be so great? Not at all. But I must explain myself as follows: the good conditions helped to reduce the distress of the period and the number of people who were forced to delay their marriage., 121831=We must satisfy ourselves on the matter. And it won't cause us to rack our brains too much. Fundamentally the whole of this book deals not with complex numbers but with real human affairs, with well-known everyday events - with weddings. Mentally let us put ourselves in the middle of a wedding parlour. In some of our country districts there is still an old-fashioned custom. According to this each farm belongs toa Bedelag [literally an invitation group - Ed.],a certain part of the parish or specific group of farms, whose entire occupants, great and small, rich and poor, must be invited to weddings, christenings and funerals. Naturally, relatives and friends who live further away are invited along with the members of the Bedelag. Now probably in each of the years 1841-50 there were held, on average, 10,309 weddings, and we can conceive of the whole nation as related to these bridal couples - the whole country as members of a Bedelag, as neighbours of the wedding home. If no one was forgotten and no one failed to turn up, then a Norwegian wedding in these years would have consisted of 129 people; the bride and bridegroom being two and the guests 127. I venture to take the reader to such a wedding where in actual fact there were even more guests. Everybody is having a good time here. We cannot fail to enjoy seeing the gaiety of the young or be entertained when we share in the conversations of the old. Now and then during the course of the several days the wedding lasts, an attempt is made to give the company a more solemn character and we really feel ourselves to be part of the spirit of the occasion. Nevertheless, we do not forget what really brought us here. We would enquire whether weddings are frequent or not in the parish, whether the number of those that marry is greater or smaller, relatively speaking. With regard to this we must attend to what sort of people make up those 129. Now and then we let the eye wander slowly around the circle, and unobserved we are able to note down what we see and hear., 116977=That is why I say: there were many marriages in total in the years 1841-50, but not many relatively speaking., 320801=Table 31. Differences between the mean ages of bridegrooms and of brides in the propertied class (Class 1) and the working class (Class 2) in the dioceses of Christiania and Christiansand, 1851 and 1852, 62789=In the series for the 40-45-year age group, we find the decrease carried on from 1839-43 to 1849-53 and likewise we see that there has been a decrease in the corresponding cohort of children, from the years 1794-1803 to 1804-13., 119133=Table 20. Number of marriages in Norway relative to the size of the population in the years around the census, 1801-45, 56453=In the same way, I can discover that the brides in the 25-30-year age group, who were married in the next five years, 1844-48, belonged to the cohort born in the years 1814-23; in which years 149,244 female children were born., 326784=136. Putting together the information contained in Tables 31 and 32 it would appear that bachelors of the propertied class marry somewhat later than do the bachelors of the working class. The former, however, chose younger brides than do the latter. Thus the age difference between bride and bridegroom is greater in the propertied class than it is in the working class. This is the situation we found in both the Christiania and the Christiansand Dioceses in the years 1851 and 1852. We do not know if the situation was the same in earlier periods or if it is the same in other dioceses and in other countries. But when the matter is shown to be so extraordinarily similar in each of the two dioceses, indeed even in each of the seven smaller districts into which we have divided the dioceses, then we know for certain that it is not some chance occurrence that has produced it, rather that there must be certain definite, general reasons, the effects of which we have before us., 275612=Table 25. Annual number of marriages per woo men aged 20 years and over (i.e. bachelors and widowers) in the kingdom and dioceses of Norway, by decade 1821-50, 144259=With these statistics one would then be able to calculate the marriage frequency in the different categories and at the different ages. Up to now there are very few countries in which such calculations are made, though in the Danish statistical tables of 1850 we do have a very fine example. We have the details named under (2) above in annual returns made by the priests, but only from 1839 onwards (see Table 16 where those for the bachelors and spinsters are used). In the main we also have the details named under (1) for the census years 1835 and 1845. For these years we have, first, all the people in the different age groups, secondly the married men and women as well as the widowers and widows in the different age groups. From this we can work out the number of bachelors and spinsters in the different age groups. But I have not been able to make any use of this information on the married and widowed, as the parish totals for 1835 are not aggregated at all, whilst those for 1845 are only done in part (see census tables for 1845, Introduction, p. x). As the original parish lists are still available this neglect can be made good, and certainly should be, at least for 1845, if we are to get the most out of the census.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The total in the last year was therefore over 1,000 less than in the previous year. Had not the dearth occurred it is reasonable to assume that the total would not have been so very much lower. We must then suppose that about a thousand bachelors failed to marry in that year because of the conditions prevailing in the country. There was then a great difference between the years in this regard. But now we will see just how many out of each 100 there were in the different age groups. We find: 1847 ... 8,779 1846 ... 9,848 in the year 1845 ... 9,315 In each of the years 1845 and 1846 more couples were married than in any previous year - in all probability for as long as people have lived in Norway. In the second of the two years there was the highest total ever - 11,152. In the next year, 1847, when corn prices were so unusually high, the number of marriages was greater than in any year before 1841, though considerably lower than in the year 1846, namely only 9,890. If we make a separate list of the bachelors married we find that there were: Was this also a coincidence? 1853 ... 5 1852 ... 5 1851 ... 5 1850 ... 5 1849 ... 5 1848 ... 5",
    "textAfterTable": "43 43 30-35 18 19 19 35-40 6 6 6 40-45 3 2 2 45-50 1 1 1 Over 50 0 0 1 Total 100 100 100 43. Certainly we must be surprised by this startling similarity. There is some disparity in individual instances, but this is so inconsiderable that one could call it an accident. As we shall see later the coincidence is not quite so great as this, but for the time being we should ignore the differences and focus our attention on the overriding similarity in the totals, on the striking evidence we have here of regularity and constancy in human affairs. How are we to understand this? Why is it that from one year to another there are almost equal numbers of older and younger persons amongst the otherwise variable number of bridegrooms? If a king gave orders that each year new troops should be raised, the actual number depending upon the circumstances of the time, but according to the rule that in each company of 100 men, there should be exactly so many young boys and so many fully grown men from each of the different age groups, then we could understand the regularity of such totals as are given above. Is it in this way that the ranks of the marriage army are filled? Is it some war commissar who puts in an appearance at the farms and cottages",
