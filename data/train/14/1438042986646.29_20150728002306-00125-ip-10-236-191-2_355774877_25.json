Neighborhood Appreciation Day is a tradition that has been going on for ten years. The 2001 installment began with an eggs, steak, french toast, casserole, hot dogs and peanuts brunch, followed by the Cubs/Brewers game at Wrigley. Afterwards, Will the Moose, \"Balloon Picasso,\" the Charlie Rex Polka Band, and Hundo all performed in front of a throng enjoying free food and beer. Whew, what a party!, 22097=$4 Soco Lime shots $4 Cuervo 1800 shots $5 Kilo Kai Rum cocktails $10 Miller buckets (5), 31579=Having a Wisconsin theme, Illinoisans (a.k.a., FIBs) will have to put up with all the Cheeseheads in the area converging for Packers or University of Wisconsin Badger games where cheese curds, bratwurst, \"craisens\" (dried cranberries), gl\u00f6gg, and other fattening, artery-hardening delicacies are consumed faster than an Ethiopian chicken. In fact, they even get Jake Leinenkugel himself to appear for their Musky Fest in early October. The people here are very friendly and even arrange canoe trips in the Summer, team trivia on Tuesdays and euchre on Wednesdays. If that wasn't enough, you'll also find three cork dartboards and a pool table in the side room.}",

In addition to their annual Musky Fest in mid-September, Will's also serves up free popcorn and their kitchen (opened in 2010) serves up burgers and brats. Will's is located in the middle of nowhere on Racine just north of that ever-popular street, Nelson, and shines like a beacon in the night with its soft lighting emanating out onto the street from behind the fish tank in the window with \"Will's Northwoods Inn\" stenciled in gold lettering. The bar is wedged in amongst trees, apartments and wood frame houses. A warm glow permeates Will's as you walk in the corner door framed by glass blocks on either side. Have a seat at the long wooden bar on your right, with its ample seating in high-backed chairs. A variety of Wisconsin beers are available, including just about every flavor of Leinenkugel on tap (18 in total). \"Elegant, if battered\" wood paneling reaches almost to the ceiling, and an impressive variety of taxidermy covers whatever space on the blue-painted walls isn't covered",
