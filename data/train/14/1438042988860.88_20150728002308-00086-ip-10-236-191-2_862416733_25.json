Oracle recommends that the hardware load balancer have the following features: Ability to load balance traffic to a pool of real servers through a virtual host name: Clients access services using the virtual host name (instead of using actual host names). The load balancer can then load balance requests to the servers in the pool. Port translation configuration. Monitoring of ports (HTTP and HTTPS). Virtual servers and port configuration: Ability to configure virtual server names and ports on your external load balancer. The virtual server names and ports must meet the following requirements: The load balancer should allow configuration of multiple virtual servers. For each virtual server, the load balancer should allow configuration of traffic management on more than one port. For example, for Oracle Internet Directory clusters, the load balancer must be configured with a virtual server and ports for LDAP and LDAPS traffic. The virtual server names must be associated with IP addresses and be part of your DNS. Clients must be able to access the load balancer through the virtual server names.",
