Note that this number is skewed by the multiple products picked over the years. For example, the Chrysler minivans were picked three times, totalling 8 \"points\" for Chrysler from three wins. The Diamond-Star cars were a similar problem, double-dipping \"points\" for both Mitsubishi, Plymouth, and Eagle. These situations were not \"fixed\"; rather, they are left as-is, skewing the totals.
