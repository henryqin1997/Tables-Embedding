Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. If you configure or modify the adjustment threshold while the automatic bandwidth is already running, the next band-aids application is impacted for that tunnel. The new adjustment threshold determines if an actual bandwidth takes place. Examples The following example configures the tunnel bandwidth change threshold to trigger an adjustment:  RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router# configure RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(config)# interface tunnel-te 1 RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(config-if)# auto-bw RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(config-if-tunte-autobw)# adjustment-threshold 20 min 500 Related Commands Command Description application (MPLS-TE) Configures the application frequency, in minutes, for the",
