            "I would definitely recommend talking with a counselor to get started especially if your planning on attending a specified program. This will help eliminate taking unnecessary classes for your degree. And one of the most important tasks, is getting all of your FAFSA paperwork filled out in a timely manner.",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot This is my 4th quarter at SPSCC and I think the majority of the classes I have taken are really interesting and informative. The professors are very intelligent and know a lot about their subject. The only down-side is when you get a professor who just writes notes on the board which you copy and study for later. This is not teaching! Luckily, this has only happened to me once! Overall, I feel much more informed on the touch subjects the professors are teaching.

Whether you're a junior in high school, just graduated from high school, or continuing your education after 30 years out of the education system, SPSCC is great at plugging you in and making you fit. They have wonderful resources to help you study",
