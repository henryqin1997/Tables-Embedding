There were 115 loggerhead nests (Caretta caretta) and 1503 green (Chelonia mydas) turtle nests registered. Based on the statistical survey done, each nest had an average of 115 eggs and there were 87 hatches per 100 eggs deposited (87%). Based on this, by the end of the season there will have been about 186,000 turtle eggs deposited on the east coast beaches. And then when all nests have hatched, approximately 161,880 baby turtles will have been born and liberated from the shores of Cozumel. In comparison, last year saw 113,000 baby turtles born and liberated from the shores., 39655=Turtle Season of 2006 The governing Committee for the Turtle Salvation Program began meeting in February 2006 to discuss the results of the 2005 Season and begin preparing for the 2006 Season. The Volunteer Brigades were formed and actual turtle activity monitoring officially began May 15, 2006 with an inauguration ceremony given by Presidente Gustavo Ortega Joaquin. Further updates will be posted as the season progresses., 40212=After 6 months of effort, late nights, sand, rain and clouds of mosquitoes, the 2006 Season has come to a close this past week for the 100 volunteer brigadistas of Cozumel's Marine Turtle Salvation Program. The 2006 Season was filled with many successes for the Program. Early in the season, all brigades were asked to participate in the modification of the logo for the Program which now appears on all documents and public display items. Then later in the Season the Committee Chairman was invited to national and regional conservation conferences to present an analysis of Cozumel's 2005 Season statistics. The data from the 2005 Season has become important throughout the conservation community because Cozumel is the only known location to have 2 category 5 hurricanes within a 90 day period during a turtle nesting season where data was collected in a systematic manner. The data collected last year by the brigades following the storms shows the impact on marine life that such natural disasters can have., 42648=As the 2006 Season closed, the brigades gathered toether to pass out t-shirts and hold a public turtle release event for some of Cozumel's children. Stories and pictures were shared as everyone realized all of the new things learned this season and all of the new friends made as well., 43026=A big thanks to all of the 100+ volunteer brigadistas who worked tirelessly all night long, each night of the week during the past 6 months of nesting season to help protect and promote Cozumel's marine turtle population. None of the successes achieved this season would be possible without the volunteer brigades: Grupo IslaMar, Club Shalom, Park Natcional Arrecifes of Cozumel, Foundation of Parks and Museums of Cozumel, Department of Ecology and Ayuntamiento of Cozumel. All of the brigades worked together and joined forces for the 2006 Season to take advantage of over 20 years of conservation efforts lead by the City., 41330=For the first time in the history of the program, guided visits to the turtle camp area were provided to different sectors of the Cozumel community in order to increase awareness and promote conservation. Almost 1200 local persons visited the camp area to observe the process of nesting and liberating the baby turtles.}",

Within days of being appointed, Sr. Navarro called the Managing Committee into session to get ready for the upcoming nesting season. Unfortunately, Sr. Navarro's first task was to inform the Committee that as a result of the global financial crisis as well as the economic impact from the Swine Flu shutdown of Mexico that the budget for the Turtle Protection program had been cut by 60%. As a result, the program",
    "textAfterTable": "2011 Turtle Nesting Season The 2011 Cozumel marine turtle nesting season got off to a fast start with over 45 loggerhead nests registered during the month of May. The Municipal Committee that manages the activities of the Turtle Salvation Program began meeting in April under the leadership of a new Director of Ecology H\u00e9ctor Gonz\u00e1lez Cort\u00e9s. H\u00e9ctor Gonz\u00e1lez Cort\u00e9s previously worked for Fundacion de Parques y Museos and has served on Cozumel's Turtle Program Committee for over 12 years. City funds were low as the nesting season begins this year so the Committee decided to once again allow tourists and volunteers to participate in the program for a nominal donation which goes toward funding gas, supplies and a lead biologist. For the 2011 Season there were 2 ways for visitors or islanders to participate for an evening ~ Tourists visiting Cozumel or those living here who would like to work for an entire night (or morning) side by side with a turtle brigade did so during the sea turtle nesting season for a nominal donation per person from June 1 through November 15 annually. Tourists visiting Cozumel or those living here who would like to observe, learn and release baby turtles one night for a few hours with a turtle",
