In case of doubt, please use the apt-get and apt-cache commands over the aptitude command., 79204=The use of \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" is recommended for it. See Bug #411280., 54874=For about few months after a new stable release, most desktop users should use the stable archive with its security updates even if they usually use unstable or testing archives. For this transition period, both unstable and testing archives are not good for most people. Your system is difficult to keep in good working condition with the unstable archive since it suffers surges of major upgrades for core packages. The testing archive is not useful either since it contains mostly the same content as the stable archive without its security support (Debian testing-security-announce 2008-12). After a month or so, the unstable archive may be usable if you are careful.}",
