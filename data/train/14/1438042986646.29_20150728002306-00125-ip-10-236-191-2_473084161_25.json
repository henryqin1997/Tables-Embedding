No. 10/892,550, filed Jul. 15, 2004 and a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/153,054, filed Jun. 15, 2005, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/579,985, filed Jun. 15, 2004, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/599,362, filed on Aug. 6, 2004. The entire teachings of the above-referenced Applications are incorporated herein by reference., 79857=CpG oligonucleotides (immunostimulatory oligonucleotides/immunomers) were synthesized on a 1 to 2 \u03bcmole scale using \u03b2-cyanoethylphosphoramidites on a PerSeptive Biosystem's 8909 Expedite DNA synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystem, Boston, Mass.). The phosphoramidites of dA, dG, dC, and T were obtained from PE Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). As described by Iyer R. P., et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112: 1253-1254 (1990)), an iodine oxidizing agent was used to obtain the phosphorothioate backbone modification. All oligos were deprotected using standard protocols, purified by HPLC, and dialyzed against USP quality sterile water for irrigation. The oligos were lyophilized and dissolved again in distilled water and the concentrations were determined from UV absorbance at 260 nm. All oligos were characterized by CGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystem's Voyager-DETM STR Biospectrometry\u2122 Workstation) for purity and molecular mass, respectively. The purity of full-length oligos ranged from 90-96% with the rest being shorter by one or two nucleotides (n-1 and n-2) as determined by CGE and/or denaturing PAGE. All oligos contained less than <0.1 EU/mL of endotoxin as determined by the Limulus assay (Bio-Whittaker now known as Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, Md.)., 84459=Female BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks, 19-21 gm) were divided into groups of three mice. Immunomer compounds were dissolved in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered subcutaneously (SC) to mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The mice were sacrificed after 48 hr and the spleens were harvested and weighed as described by Zhao, Q., et al. (Biochem Pharmacol. 51: 173-182 (1996)) and Branda, R. F., et al. (Biochem. Pharmacol. 45: 2037-2043 (1993))., 17311=Krieg et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 20 (2002) 709-760; Dalpke et al., Biol. Chem. 383 (2002) 1491-1500 and Kandimalla et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 4 (2002) 122-129 teach that CpG DNAs induce innate immune cells to produce ThI cytokines that promote cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and production of immunoglobulins by B cells. The immunostimulatory properties of CpG DNAs have allowed their use as therapeutic agents for a broad spectrum of disease indications including cancers, viral and bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders and as adjuvant in immunotherapy., 82206=Spleen cells from 4-8 week old BALB/c, C57BL/6 or C3H/HeJ mice were cultured in RPMI complete medium as described by Zhao, Q., el al. (Biochem Pharmacol. 51: 173-182 (1996)) and Branda, R. F., et al. (Biochem. Pharmacol. 45: 2037-2043 (1993)). Murine J774 macrophages (American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 IU/mL of penicillin G/streptomycin). All other culture reagents were purchased from Mediatech (Gaithersburg, Md.)., 188055=Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Briefly, heparinized blood was layered onto the Histopaque-1077 (equal volume) in a conical centrifuge and centrifuged at 400\ufffdg for 30 minutes at room temperature. The buffy coat, containing the mononuclear cells, was removed carefully and washed twice with isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 250\ufffdg for 10 minutes. The resulting cell pellet was then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing L-glutamine (MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) and supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (100U/ml). Cells were cultured in 24 well plates for different time periods at 1\ufffd106 cells/ml/well in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were harvested and stored frozen at \u221270\ufffd C. until assayed for various cytokines including IFN-\u03b1 (BioSource International) by sandwich ELISA. The results are shown in Table 3A-3D below., 55949=As used herein, the term \u201ccarrier\u201d encompasses any excipient, diluent, filler, salt, buffer, stabilizer, solubilizer, lipid, or other material well known in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations. It will be understood that the characteristics of the carrier, excipient, or diluent will depend on the route of administration for a particular application. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable formulations containing these materials is described in, e.g., Remington\u2032s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, ISBN: 0-912734-04-3., 85108=Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has been shown to recognize unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides in bacterial, plasmid and synthetic DNAs (Hemmi H., et al. Nature 408: 740-745 (2000)) and activate stress kinase (Yi A. K., et al. J. Immunol. 161: 4493-4497 (1998)) and NF-\u03baB pathways (Stacey K. J., et al. J. Immunol. 157: 2116-2122 (1996)). NF-\u03baB activation in J774 cells treated with immunomer compounds was carried out and analyzed by EMSA as described Yu D., et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 297: 83-90 (2002)) and Bhagat L., et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 300: 853-861 (2003))., 85950=PBMCs from freshly drawn healthy volunteer blood (CBR Laboratories, Boston, Mass.) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation method (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) and B cells were isolated from PBMCs by positive selection using the CD19 cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Table 1 shows the immunostimulatory activity of immunomer compounds of the invention in C57BL/6 Splenocyte Assay.}",
