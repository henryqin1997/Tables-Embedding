            "locals or students that are just starting their degrees. take general education courses for a lot less money than you would spend at universities or private institutions--just make sure they transfer!",
            "opportunity village is right across the parking lot of building k! there's also a day care center across the street of building c on community college drive.",
            "with the recent budget cuts and increased tuition bill -- csn is still cheaper than unlv/unr by far. a 12 credit semester is only around $1,100 for the credits themselves. books, obviously, depend on the courses selected.",
            "it's las vegas--there's plenty to do for fun. on campus there are clubs you can join, events that happen every so often. it's not all that much like normal university life, but keep in mind this place is considered a community college.",
            "vast amounts of places to dine at the charleston and cheyenne campus. since the cheyenne campus has the culinary program, there is a restaurant there in which culinary students participate in making the food. it's pretty good! charleston has a lot more food vendors, though, from building b, d, i, h (at night), and k.",
            "no dorms.",

            "go for basic degrees here and then transfer to a university. there are plenty of reasons to come to csn--the affordability, and the vast amount of locations (three main buildings plus smaller campuses all around town), just to name a few. always go on ratemyprofessor.com to check out the different professors you may be getting.",
            "csn is a very affordable college. it is meant to only jumpstart your career choices, and is a gateway to other universities."

The lows at night during these months are on average 80 to 85 degrees, so that means in the daytime expect temps to be around 105 and 115. If you survive the first summer, your a champ, the second summer you sweat through, you are acclimated. Meaning, if temps fall below say, 75 degrees, like in the spring or early winter, you will be freezing and wearing your hoodie. After the 3rd summer you are a professional., 225878=The college is affordable my costs are about 1500 a semester., 619372=I will give this school a 5 out of 5. There are 5 locations plus online courses that can be taken at College of Southern Nevada. I have taken weekend classes, online, and as late as 10:30 pm classes. The instructor's and professors are very thorough and hands on. They usually will go far and beyond to make certain that the information is being received clearly., 466581=Hey I live in Las Vegas, what can I say......there is ALWAYS something to do! The strip is about 20 minutes away from the CHY and CHRL campus. But again, that's not the only place to have fun! Las Vegas is like any other city in the US. Beware of the months between June and October ..... the is the desert. Temps range from 90 to 120 degrees. Some weeks are above 105 daily. The evenings are fantastic though!, 26893=I met some of my best friends for life at CSN! Not to mention the opportunities there are in the school. I was able to intern with Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign through the school as well as find my first ever job., 236570=Try to arrange your schedule in the best way possible; so many new students decide to enroll in a class at 10:00 am and not have another class until noon, the time in between is wasted (unless you do your homework from your first class). Also, there are more than one CSN campus so pay close attention when signing up for classes (you don't want the stress of driving back and forth, campus to campus.) Also, always make extra copies of documents when going to meet with an advisor (they have a habit of losing papers)., 49880=I began attending CSN in Fall 2008 and so far it has been a great school to attend too. Especially a far as community colleges go. I have learned so much with just the few classes I have taken to this point and I'm truly excited to continue on. Teaching methods to differ between teachers, so if you can, talk to the professor and fellow students about the class., 624881=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
