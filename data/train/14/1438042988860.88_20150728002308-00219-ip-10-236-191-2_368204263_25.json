Usage Guidelines You can configure different values with the hello command on the router at each end of a Layer 2 control channel. Examples The following example sets an interval of 120 seconds between sendings of hello keepalive messages in pseudowires that have been configured using the L2TP class configuration named \u201cl2tp class1\u201d:  Router(config) # l2tp-class l2tp-class1 Router(config-l2tp-class) # hello 120",
