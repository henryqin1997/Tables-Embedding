The plate has a substantially arcuate wall with an inner surface and an outer surface. A plurality of vacuum holes extends between the inner and outer surfaces and are configured to be in fluid communication with a vacuum source. A vacuum region is adapted to contact the first region of the web and a reduced-vacuum region is adapted to receive the second region of the web. The plurality of vacuum holes are configured such that, when attached to the vacuum source, a vacuum pressure at the vacuum region is greater than a pressure at the reduced-vacuum region so that the first region of the web is held against the plate with a greater force than the second region. 20150068372 Published Description Patent application number Kevin Dolan, Neenah, WI US 04-04-2013 Stretch Floss Band - A dental cleaning",

Dolan, East Lansing, MI US Patent application number Description Published 20140107965 TESTING SYSTEM FOR ESTIMATING THERMAL PROPERTIES OF A MATERIAL - A testing system for use in measuring thermal properties of material is described herein. The testing system includes a testing apparatus and monitoring system coupled to the testing apparatus. The testing apparatus includes a housing assembly that is configured to receive a material. A heating assembly is coupled to the housing assembly to supply a heat to at least a portion of the material to increase the temperature of the material. A sensing assembly is coupled to the housing assembly and is configured to sense a temperature of the material. The monitoring system comprises a controller having a processor comprising computer-readable instructions for operating the heating assembly to apply a heat to the material volume, receiving signals from the sensing assembly indicative of a temperature of the material, and estimating at least one thermal property of the material utilizing the sensed temperature of the material volume. 04-17-2014",
