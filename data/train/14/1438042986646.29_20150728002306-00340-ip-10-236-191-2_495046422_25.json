    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The above-described systems and methods convert electronic documents, present problems in converting electronic documents, and enable alteration to schemas of electronic documents. These systems and methods may enable significantly improved conversion of electronic documents using non-visual information about the electronic documents. In so doing, these systems and methods may convert documents with fewer errors and generate converted electronic documents having greater functionality. Although the system and method has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the system and method defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as exemplary forms of implementing the claimed system and method. CONCLUSION Block 910 presents instructions indicating one or more actions selectable by a user and capable of eliminating a conversion problem. also illustrates this correlation. Here a user selects (here by mousing over) indicia 1006. In response, block 908 highlights the visual construct for that indicia's conversion problem (highlight shown with graphic 1012).
