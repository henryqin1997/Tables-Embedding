Under a contract of affreightment, Quintana Logistics would agree to ship a specified amount of cargo at a specified rate per ton between designated ports over a particular period of time. Contracts of affreightment generally do not specify particular vessels, so Quintana Logistics would be permitted either to use a free vessel that it owned or to charter in a third-party vessel. Quintana Logistics engaged in limited activities during the first quarter of 2006 and no activities during the first quarter of 2007., 367092=We are an international provider of dry bulk marine transportation services that was incorporated in the Marshall Islands on January\u00a013, 2005 and began operations in April 2005. As of March\u00a031, 2007, we owned and operated a total fleet of 27 vessels, consisting of 11 Panamax vessels, 13 Kamsarmax vessels and 3 Capesize vessels. Of these 27 vessels, we acquired 10 in 2005, 13 in 2006, and 4 in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, Iron Manolis, a Kamsarmax vessel, and Lowlands Beilun, a Capesize vessel, were delivered in April 2007. We have also entered into a contract to purchase a Capesize vessel with delivery in late 2008. We are currently party to joint ventures that have contracted to purchase a total of 7 additional Capesize vessels, which are expected to be delivered in 2010., 296761=Before the amendment discussed below, the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were scheduled to be reduced over time according to the following schedule of thirty-two consecutive quarterly permanent commitment reductions with the first such reduction having occurred on December\u00a031, 2006., 238891=In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, \u0093Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\u0097An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109\u0094 (\u0093FIN 48\u0094). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, \u0093Accounting for Income Taxes.\u0094 FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 was effective beginning in fiscal year 2007. Based on our expectation that we will continue not to be liable for income taxes either in the country of our organization or in the United States, the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial condition and results of operations., 534849=\u0097 Quintana Maritime Limited 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, 540184=\u0097 Consultancy Agreement between Quintana Maritime Limited and Shipmanagement Consultants Inc. (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.27 to the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2006), 537784=\u0097 Services Agreement between Quintana Maritime Limited and Quintana Minerals Corporation, dated as of October 31, 2005 (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 3, 2005), 330901=the option to enter into an additional swap with the Company effective December\u00a031, 2010 to June\u00a030, 2014. Under the terms of the optional swap, the Company will make quarterly fixed-rate payments of 5.00% to Fortis based on a notional amount of $504 million, and Fortis will make quarterly floating-rate payments at LIBOR + 1.10%\u00a0per annum to the Company based on the same notional amount. During the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, Fortis paid the Company approximately $0.3 million, net of amounts paid by the Company to Fortis., 256124=On January\u00a022, 2007, the Company agreed to purchase a 1999-built, 171,000 dwt Capesize bulk carrier named Lowlands Beilun. The Company initially advanced $7.3 million on that date and paid the remaining balance of $65.7 million upon the delivery of the vessel on April\u00a010, 2007., 299132=Reductions 18 to 32 (March 30, 2011 through September\u00a030, 2014), 242695=Shipping income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is considered to be 100% from sources within the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2006 the Company did not engage in transportation that produced income considered to be 100% from sources within the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States is not subject to U.S. federal income tax., 328299=In the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, the Company received $33.6 million in net proceeds from the exercise of 4,320,475 warrants. In addition, the Company issued 46,162 shares in connection with the cashless exercise of 108,041 warrants. As of March\u00a031, 2007, 2,503,237 warrants remained outstanding., 368032=Our dry bulk carriers transport a variety of cargoes including coal, iron ore and grain. Seventeen of our vessels are under charter to a subsidiary of Bunge, a major agribusiness, until 2010. Sixteen of these seventeen vessels are subject to a master time charter with annually determined charterhire between floor and ceiling rates. As of April\u00a030, 2007, we had set the prices through 2009., 235953=In December 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Quintana Logistics LLC, to engage in chartering operations, including entry into contracts of affreightment. Under a contract of affreightment, the Company would agree to transport a specified amount of cargo at a specified rate per ton between designated ports over a particular period of time. The contracts of affreightment generally do not specify particular vessels, so the Company would be permitted either to use its own vessel or to charter in a third-party vessel., 522760=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on the 9th day of May 2007., 385682=In the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, we incurred $2.2 million in unrealized swap loss attributable to our interest-rate swap. There was no corresponding loss in the 2006 period because we did not have any swaps in place at that time. The loss on the swap is due to the decrease in LIBOR, to which the variable-rate portion of the swap is tied, under forward rate curves in mid-2006 and early 2007., 312494=On April\u00a027, 2007, the Company received an additional waiver under the facility with respect to the formation of six additional shipowning companies and to clarify that only the Company\u0092s interest in the relevant shipowning companies will be used in calculating compliance with the financial covenants under the facility., 397890=\u0095\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reduction 1 (December 31, 2006), 202574=The Company is a holding company incorporated on January\u00a013, 2005, under the Laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Through its subsidiaries, the Company is engaged in the marine transportation of dry bulk cargoes through the ownership and operation of dry bulk vessels., 407115=Amendments and Waivers. Under the facility, we were required to raise an additional $33 million through the issuance of equity before we drew down on the facility to finance any of the last six vessels to be delivered in connection with the Metrobulk acquisition. On December\u00a015, 2006, we obtained a waiver of that requirement for a period of three months, until March\u00a015, 2007. As of February\u00a028, 2007, the Company had received sufficient proceeds from the exercise of warrants to satisfy this requirement., 396027=Interest. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 0.85%\u00a0per annum (until December\u00a031, 2010) and LIBOR plus 1.10%\u00a0per annum thereafter. The full amount borrowed under the revolving credit facility will mature on September\u00a030, 2014. Effective July\u00a01, 2006, we entered into an interest-rate swap with Fortis, which effectively converts our expected floating-rate interest obligation under its new revolving credit facility to a fixed rate of 5.985%, inclusive of margin due to our lenders., 541796=\u0097 Certification pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by Chief Executive Officer, 537043=\u0097 Revolving Credit Facility (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 6, 2005), 346492=October\u00a06, 2006, 512492=\u0097 Form of Director Restricted Stock Award Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 13, 2006), 278270=Net income for three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, 399846=\u0095\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reductions 18 to 32 (March 30, 2011 through September\u00a030, 2014), 379460=For the first quarter of 2007, we incurred $3.6 million of general and administrative expenses, compared to $2.0 million for the 2006 period, an increase of approximately 80.0%. Our general and administrative expenses include the salaries and other related costs of the executive officers and other employees, our office rents, legal and auditing costs, regulatory compliance costs, other miscellaneous office expenses, long-term compensation costs, and corporate overhead. Our general and administrative expenses for the 2007 period were comparatively higher than those in the corresponding period in 2006 because of higher restricted-stock compensation and higher payroll, in part due to the increased staff hired to manage the larger fleet. In the first quarter of 2007, general and administrative expenses represented 7.5% of our net revenues for the period, as compared to 9.2% for the corresponding period in 2006. The percentage reduction is principally due to operating efficiencies achieved by adding vessels to the fleet., 80337=The number of shares of the Company\u0092s common stock, $0.01 par value, outstanding at May\u00a01, 2007 was 56,005,695., 372445=Vessel operating expenses per ship per day were $3,383 for the fleet in the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, compared to $4,190 in the 2006 period. Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. To arrive at a per ship per day amount, we divide our total vessel operating expenses by the ownership days in the period., 274452=2010, 392519=Net cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, compared to $12.4 million for the first quarter of 2006. Substantially all our cash from operating activities is generated under our time charters., 469695=Effective July\u00a01, 2006, we entered into a swap transaction with respect to our revolving credit facility. Because the revolving credit facility provided for variable-rate interest, management determined that an interest-rate swap would best protect the Company from interest-rate risk on amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. This swap effectively insulates us from interest-rate risk relating to the floating rates payable under the facility until December\u00a031, 2010, as we are required to pay a fixed rate of 5.135%, exclusive of spread due our lenders. On December\u00a031, 2010, the counterparty to the swap may exercise an option to lock our fixed rate at 5.00% through June\u00a030, 2014. If the counterparty does not exercise this option, we will be exposed to market rates at that time., 416597=The following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of March\u00a031, 2007., 405230=maintenance of minimum liquidity (cash or time deposits plus available credit line) of $550,000 per ship increasing to $741,000 per ship in 8 quarterly adjustments starting April\u00a01, 2009., 389533=We satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. In the first quarter of 2007, we financed our capital requirements with cash from operations, cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants, and drawdowns under our revolving credit facility (including an increase in the capacity under that facility). In the corresponding period in 2006, we financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our old revolving credit facility. As of March\u00a031, 2007, our cash balance was approximately $25.3 million, compared to a balance of $3.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2006. We have incurred a substantial amount of debt in connection with vessel acquisitions, resulting in a ratio of net debt to total capitalization of 62.8% as of March\u00a031, 2007, compared to 44.2\u00a0% as of March\u00a031, 2006. We believe that cash flow from operations, drawdowns under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from the ongoing exercise of outstanding warrants will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for the next twelve months., 368551=As of March\u00a031, 2007, our fleet had a combined carrying capacity of approximately 2,391,581 deadweight tons (dwt) and a dwt-weighted-average age of approximately 4.0 years. Upon delivery of the eight vessels on order, we expect our fleet to have a combined carrying capacity of 4,086,043 dwt., 328736=The balance sheet line item \u0093common stock to be issued for warrants exercised\u0094 represents cash received for 188,400 warrants that were exercised prior to December\u00a031, 2006 but for which the related shares were issued on January\u00a05, 2007. These shares are not included in the number of shares outstanding in the Company\u0092s balance sheet as of December\u00a031, 2006., 397014=Repayment. Before we entered into the amendment discussed below, the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were scheduled to reduce over time according to the following schedule of thirty-two consecutive quarterly permanent commitment reductions. The first reduction occurred on December\u00a031, 2006., 360473=Of the seven vessels to be acquired by the joint ventures as described above, Christine, Hope, Lillie, and two of the KSC vessels will be chartered to EDF Trading, a wholly owned subsidiary of EDF, a major European utility, upon their delivery in 2010. The five-year charters will provide for charterhire to be paid at a floor rate, which averages $27,000, net, per vessel per day for each of the five vessels, with 50% profit sharing based on the monthly AV4 BCI time-charter rate as published by the Baltic Exchange. The remaining two vessels have not yet been chartered., 318217=Trade payables as of March\u00a031, 2007 and December\u00a031, 2006 shown in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include $250,328 and $94,838, respectively, related to expenses, including salaries of Company management, office rent, and related expenses, paid for by Quintana Minerals Corporation, on behalf of the Company. On October\u00a031, 2005, the Company and Quintana Minerals Corporation entered into a service agreement, whereby Quintana Minerals agreed to provide certain administrative services to the Company at cost, and the Company agreed to reimburse Quintana Minerals for the expenses incurred by Quintana Minerals in providing those services. Quintana Minerals Corporation is controlled by Corbin J. Robertson, the Chairman of the board of directors of the Company (the \u0093Board\u0094) and significant shareholder in the Company. Total amounts reimbursed to Quintana Minerals Corporation were $514,255 and $438,797 for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 and March\u00a031, 2006, respectively., 384853=We incurred $10.3 million of interest expense in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $2.8 million in the corresponding 2006 period. The 268% increase is primarily attributable to larger principal amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as a result of the Metrobulk acquisition and additional acquisitions that occurred after the first quarter of 2006 compared to amounts outstanding under our debt facilities in the first quarter of 2006., 259281=Advances paid in 2006 for vessels delivered in the first quarter of 2007, 336749=No awards were made during the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, and 204,200 shares vested during that period. As of March\u00a031, 2007 there were 1,228,600 shares of restricted stock outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan and 1,449,750 shares remaining available for issuance under the plan., 541008=\u0097 Limited Liability Company Agreement of Christine Shipco LLC (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 9, 2007), 514868=\u0097 Loan Agreement ($735 million revolving credit facility) (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\u00a010.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 24, 2006), 514023=\u0097 Services Agreement between Quintana Maritime Limited and Quintana Minerals Corporation, dated as of October 31, 2005 (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 3, 2005), 407767=In addition, the facility prevented us from drawing down on the facility to finance the acquisition of additional vessels prior to the delivery of the 17 Metrobulk vessels. Because we took delivery of Iron Miner prior to the delivery of the final vessels from the Metrobulk fleet, we received a waiver effective March\u00a01, 2007 waiving this requirement and permitting us to draw down on the facility to finance the acquisition of Iron Miner., 542497=\u0097 Certification pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by Chief Financial Officer, 273540=2008, 413533=As of March\u00a031, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants under the facility, and $799.3 million was outstanding under the facility with a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%., 256541=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Company took delivery of four vessels in the first quarter (Iron Knight, Iron Lindrew, Iron Miner, and Iron Brooke), paying an aggregate of $220 million upon delivery, and awaited delivery of Iron Manolis and Lowlands Beilun. As of March\u00a031, 2007, the unpaid balance of the purchase price for those two vessels was $68.9 million, net of $47.2 million already advanced to the sellers. As of April\u00a030, 2007, the Company had taken delivery of Iron Manolis and Lowlands Beilun and had paid the balance of the purchase price for those vessels., 517295=\u0097 Limited Liability Company Agreement of Christine Shipco LLC (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 9, 2007), 377779=We incurred no voyage expenses for the first quarter of 2007 because we did not charter in any vessels in connection with the operations of Quintana Logistics. In the 2006 period, we incurred voyage expenses of $1.5 million attributable to our Quintana Logistics operations., 473311=September\u00a026, 2006, 78337=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No\u00a0\u00a0\u00a8, 413843=On April\u00a027, 2007, we received an additional waiver under the facility with respect to the formation of additional shipowning companies and to clarify that only our interests in the relevant shipowning companies will be used in calculating compliance with the financial covenants under the facility., 374555=Net revenues for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 were $47.8 million after brokerage commissions of $2.4 million, compared to $21.6 million after brokerage commissions of $1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2006, an increase of 121%. In the first quarter of 2007 all of our revenues were earned from time charters. One vessel, Barbara, is fixed on a variable-rate time charter, in which the charter hire is tied to prevailing spot rates. In the 2006 period, $ 20.9\u00a0million of our revenues were earned from time charters, and $1.6 million was earned from our Quintana Logistics operations. The increase in revenues during the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 over the corresponding period in 2006 is primarily due to our operation of an average of 25 vessels during the 2007 compared to operations during the corresponding 2006 period of an average of 10 ships. Our net daily revenues per ship per day for the total fleet for the first quarter of 2007 were $21,879, compared to $22,792 in the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in the 2007 period was primarily due to lower charter rates realized on some vessels that were fixed on charters during early 2006, when charter rates were comparatively lower than rates later in the period., 415483=On June\u00a019, 2006 we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC, registering 2,045,558 units, 2,045,558 shares of 12% Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, and 8,182,232 Class\u00a0A Warrants. Subsequent to the conversion of the preferred stock and the Company\u0092s eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S-3, this registration was amended to be filed on Form S-3 and cover only the warrants and the common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock and issuable upon exercise of the warrants. This registration statement registers securities on behalf of third parties, and we will not receive any proceeds from the sales of these securities. On September\u00a020, 2006, this registration statement was declared effective by the SEC., 337175=The CNG Committee determines the vesting schedule at the time of the grant. Varying percentages of the two awards granted in 2005 vest between February 2006 and February 2009. The shares awarded on May\u00a015, 2006 vest on February\u00a015, 2010 with respect to all grantees other than Mr.\u00a0Costalas, for whom the awards vest in varying percentages between February 2007 and February 2010. Varying percentages of the shares awarded on December\u00a018, 2006 vest between February 2007 and February 2011., 307121=On March\u00a014, 2007, the Company executed an amendment (the \u0093Amendment\u0094) to the facility. The material terms of the Amendment were:, 351829=Imabari Vessel. On April\u00a03, 2007, the Company entered into limited liability company agreement, effective March\u00a030, 2007, with Robertson Maritime Investors LLC (\u0093RMI\u0094), an affiliate of Corbin J. Robertson, Jr. and AMCIC Cape Holdings, 277673=Common stock dividends paid March 2007, 539410=\u0097 Supplemental Agreement to Loan Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 19, 2007), 314725=April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009, 538617=\u0097 Loan Agreement ($735 million revolving credit facility) (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\u00a010.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 24, 2006), 377251=For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, our commissions totaled $2.4 million, compared to $1.0 million during the corresponding period in 2006, an increase of 140%. Commissions were higher for the first quarter of 2007 than for the corresponding period in 2006 principally because we operated an average of 25 vessels in the 2007 period, compared to an average of 10 vessels during the 2006 period., 73110=For the quarterly period ended March\u00a031, 2007, 294952=On July\u00a019, 2006, the Company entered into an 8.25 year, $735 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The Company\u0092s obligations under the credit facility are secured by: (i)\u00a0first priority cross-collateralized mortgages over the vessels securing the facility, which include the entire fleet other than those purchased in connection with joint ventures; (ii)\u00a0first priority assignment of all insurances, operational accounts and earnings of the vessels financed with borrowings under the facility; (iii)\u00a0first priority pledges over the operating accounts of the shipowning subsidiaries held with the agent, (iv)\u00a0assignments of existing and future charters for the vessels, and (v)\u00a0assignments of interest rate swaps. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 0.85%\u00a0per annum (until December\u00a031, 2010) and LIBOR plus 1.10%\u00a0per annum thereafter. Effective July\u00a01, 2006, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap with Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. (\u0093Fortis\u0094) that effectively fixed the interest payable on the borrowings under the facility at 5.985%, inclusive of margin due to the Company\u0092s lenders. The full amount borrowed under the revolving credit facility will mature on September\u00a030, 2014., 297623=Reduction 1 (December 31, 2006), 399188=\u0095\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reductions 6 to 17 (March 30, 2008 through December\u00a031, 2010), 371877=Our net daily revenues per ship per day for the total fleet for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 were $21,879 compared to $22,792 in the corresponding period in 2006. Net daily revenue consists of our voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during the period, net of commissions, including time charter amortization, which is consistent with industry standards., 316885=The Company\u0092s previous revolving credit facility, dated October\u00a04, 2005, was a secured, 8-year, $250 million revolving credit facility. Indebtedness under the old revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR + 0.975%. As of December\u00a031, 2005, $210 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 5.28%. On July\u00a021, 2006, the Company repaid the outstanding principal amount of $90.0 million and terminated the facility. In connection with the termination of the facility, the Company wrote off approximately $1.8 million of deferred finance fees and related legal fees, which was a non-cash item., 513270=\u0097 Revolving Credit Facility (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 6, 2005), 262189=The changes in deferred charges shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at March\u00a031, 2007 are as follows:, 202979=The Company was formed by companies controlled by each of Corbin J. Robertson Jr., First Reserve Corporation (\u0093FRC\u0094) and American Metals\u00a0& Coal International, Inc. (\u0093AMCI\u0094). On July\u00a020, 2005, the Company completed its initial public offering., 347233=October\u00a010, 2006, 391506=Our existing and expected debt obligations discourage us from incurring significant capital expenditures that do not immediately generate cash, such as entry into shipbuilding contracts for the purchase of newbuildings. Consequently, if we wish to incur such obligations, we may be required to arrange alternative financing arrangements, such as the joint ventures we entered into with our sponsors subsequent to the end of the first quarter. The issuance of equity to consummate such transactions may dilute our earnings; for example, in connection with the acquisition of the 17 Metrobulk vessels in 2006, our lenders required us to issue a significant amount of equity, but we will not realize the full benefit of the cash flows generated by the additional ships until the third quarter of 2007. Consequently, the Metrobulk acquisition was dilutive to our earnings in 2006 and early 2007., 350775=Also in April 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with Cosmos World Maritime S.A., an affiliate of Itochu Corporation, for the purchase of a 180,000 dwt Capesize carrier to be constructed at Imabari Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., a major Japanese yard, and delivered in 2008 for a purchase price of approximately $92 million. On May\u00a04, 2007, the Company advanced the sellers $9.2 million under the contract with cash on hand. The remaining installments are due under the memorandum of agreement in early 2008 and upon delivery of the vessel. The Company expects to fund the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility., 240002=In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1, \u0093Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities.\u0094 FSP AUG AIR-1 addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities. Specifically, the FSP prohibits the practice of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP AUG AIR-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Because the Company does not use the accrue-in-advance method, the adoption of FSP AUG AIR-1 did not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position., 371171=In the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, our fleet had a utilization of 99.6%, compared to 99.5% in the 2006 period. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our ownership days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company\u0092s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning., 413020=On March\u00a028, 2007, we received a waiver permitting us to form the shipowning company to purchase a Capesize vessel through a joint venture and to exclude that shipowning company from coverage under the facility until its delivery., 315217=April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010, 327985=In connection with the Company\u0092s private placement in May 2006, the Company issued 8,182,232 Class\u00a0A Warrants, exercisable at a price of $8.00 per share and expiring on May\u00a011, 2009., 273098=2007, 515673=\u0097 Supplemental Agreement to Loan Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 19, 2007), 305867=Under the facility, the Company was required to raise an additional $33 million through the issuance of equity before drawing down on the facility to finance any of the last six vessels to be delivered in connection with the Metrobulk acquisition. On December\u00a015, 2006, the Company obtained a waiver of that requirement for a period of three months, until March\u00a015, 2007. As of February\u00a028, 2007, the Company had received sufficient proceeds from the exercise of warrants to satisfy this requirement., 361854=On May\u00a04, 2007, the Company held its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in Athens. At that meeting, all eight of the Company\u0092s existing directors were elected to serve as directors until the Company\u0092s 2008 Annual Meeting. In addition, the stockholders of the Company ratified the selection of Deloitte. Hadjipavlou, Sofianos\u00a0& Cambanis, S.A. as the Company\u0092s independent auditors for the year ending December\u00a031, 2007., 319374=Affiliates of Mr.\u00a0Robertson, the Chairman of the Board, and First Reserve Corporation (\u0093FRC\u0094), whose affiliate owned approximately 6.9% of our common stock as of March\u00a031, 2007, have the right in certain circumstances to require us to register their shares of common stock in connection with a public offering and sale. In addition, in connection with other registered offerings by us, affiliates of Mr.\u00a0Robertson, FRC, and certain other stockholders will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights with respect to their shares., 338197=Restricted stock outstanding as of March\u00a031, 2007 and December\u00a031, 2006 includes the following:, 357126=KSC Vessels. On April\u00a027, 2007, the Company executed agreements with Korea Shipyard Co., Ltd., a Korean shipyard, for the construction of four 180,000 dwt newbuilding Capesize carriers for delivery in mid-2010 at a purchase price of approximately $77.7 million per vessel, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $310.8 million. The Company expects to nominate four shipowning companies to purchase the respective vessels. The Company will own 50% of each of those companies, and AMCIC will own the other 50%., 476456=We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094), is recorded, summarized and processed within time periods specified in the SEC\u0092s rules and forms. As of the end of the period covered by this report (the \u0093Evaluation Date\u0094), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective., 309305=Two reductions of $14.5 million each, beginning on July\u00a01, 2007, followed by, 528428=\u0097 Articles of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 17, 2006), 312176=As of March\u00a031, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility, and $799.3 million was outstanding under the facility with a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%, 306505=In addition, the facility prevents the Company from drawing down on the facility to finance the acquisition of additional vessels prior to the delivery of the 17 Metrobulk vessels. Because the Company took delivery of Iron Miner prior to the delivery of the final vessels from the Metrobulk fleet, the Company received a waiver effective March\u00a01, 2007 waiving this requirement and permitting the Company to draw down on the facility to finance the acquisition of Iron Miner., 316730=2005 Revolving Credit Facility, 392897=Net cash used in investing activities was $240.5 million for the first three months of 2007, compared to $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2006. Of the cash used in investing activities for the 2007 period, $197.6 million was attributable to the acquisition of vessels during the period. Net cash from financing activities was $207 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared to $13 million for the first quarter of 2006. In the 2007 period, the bulk of the net cash used in investing activities was attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the purchase of vessels delivered in the first quarter of 2007., 363108=The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section\u00a027A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section\u00a021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided for under these sections. These statements may include words such as \u0093believe,\u0094 \u0093estimate,\u0094 \u0093project,\u0094 \u0093intend,\u0094 \u0093expect,\u0094 \u0093plan,\u0094 \u0093anticipate,\u0094 and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Forward looking statements reflect management\u0092s current expectations and observations with respect to future events and financial performance. Where we express an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected, or implied by those forward-looking statements. The principal factors that affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows include, charter market rates, which have recently increased to historic highs, and periods of charter hire, vessel operating expenses and voyage costs, which are incurred primarily in U.S. dollars, depreciation expenses, which are a function of the cost of our vessels, significant vessel improvement costs and our vessels\u0092 estimated useful lives, and financing costs related to our indebtedness. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors which could include the following: (1)\u00a0changes in demand in the dry-bulk market, including changes in production of, or demand for, commodities and bulk cargoes, generally or in particular regions; (2)\u00a0greater than anticipated levels of dry-bulk-vessel newbuilding orders or lower than anticipated rates of dry-bulk-vessel scrapping; (3)\u00a0changes in rules and regulations applicable to the dry-bulk industry, including legislation adopted by international bodies or organizations such as the International Maritime Organization and the European Union or by individual countries; (4)\u00a0actions taken by regulatory authorities; (5)\u00a0changes in trading patterns significantly affecting overall dry-bulk tonnage requirements; (6)\u00a0changes in the typical seasonal variations in dry-bulk charter rates; (7)\u00a0changes in the cost of other modes of bulk commodity transportation; (8)\u00a0changes in general domestic and international political conditions; (9)\u00a0changes in the condition of the Company\u0092s vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards (which may affect, among other things, our anticipated drydocking costs); (10)\u00a0and other factors listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2006 and our Registration Statement on Form S-1/S-3 originally filed with the Securities SEC on June\u00a019, 2006. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws., 388027=Our stated goals have been to rapidly grow the Company and to provide consistent dividends to our shareholders. In late 2006, we began to pursue the acquisition of Capesize vessels as a result of steadily rising Asian demand for those vessels. As our revenues began to reflect the full effect of the chartering to Bunge of the 17 vessels we purchased from Metrobulk, we were able to take advantage of the rising Capesize market, purchasing Iron Miner in late 2006, Lowlands Beilun in early 2007, and agreeing to purchase a newbuilding Capesize for delivery in 2008. We decided to purchase these vessels because the gap between purchase and delivery was comparatively short, thereby minimizing the dilutive effect of the acquisitions. Since we agreed to purchase these vessels, asset values in the Capesize sector have continued to rise. In order to take advantage of the rising demand for Capesize vessels, we have embarked on a newbuilding program to purchase additional vessels for delivery in 2010. Because these acquisitions would be dilutive, we have entered into joint ventures with our sponsors to minimize this dilutive effect., 354978=STX Vessels. On April\u00a016, 2007, the Company entered into agreements with STX Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. for the construction of two 181,000 dwt newbuilding Capesize carriers for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $159 million. The Company has nominated Hope Shipco LLC and Lillie Shipco LLC to purchase the respective vessels. The Company owns 50% of each of Hope Shipco LLC and Lillie Shipco LLC, and AMCIC, as described above, owns the other 50%. The sole purpose of each of Hope Shipco LLC and Lillie Shipco LLC is to purchase, own and operate the relevant Capesize vessel. It is currently contemplated that each of Hope Shipco LLC and Lillie Shipco LLC will enter into a credit facility to finance up to 70% of the purchase price of its respective Capesize vessel., 257458=The changes to the net book value of vessels (in thousands) shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 is as follows:, 378407=For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, our vessel operating expenses were $7.5 million, or an average of $3,383 per ship per day, compared to operating expenses of $3.8 million during the corresponding period in 2006, or an average of $4,190 per ship per day. The 97.3% increase in total operating expenses for the 2007 period was primarily due to the enlargement of our fleet: we operated an average of 25 vessels during the 2007 period, compared to an average of 10 vessels during the 2006 period. Per ship per day operating expenses decreased, however, by 19.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to efficiencies gained associated with the enlargement of the fleet., 331562=The Company marks to market the fair market value of the interest-rate swap at the end of every period and reflects the resulting gain or loss as \u0093Unrealized interest-rate swap loss\u0094 on its consolidated income statements as well as reflects the fair value on its balance sheet. At March\u00a031, 2007, the fair value amounted to a loss of $12.1 million, which resulted from the comparatively lower LIBOR, to which the floating-rate portion of the swap is tied, under forward rate curves in 2006 and early 2007., 343642=Total compensation cost charged against income was $1.1 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 and $0.4 million for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2006. Total unrecognized compensation cost relating to the restricted stock at March\u00a031, 2007 was $12.2 million. The total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately four years as of March\u00a031, 2007., 433703=Information regarding the Company\u0092s Critical Accounting Policies is included in Item\u00a07 of the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2006., 235508=The operations of all the Company\u0092s vessels are managed by a wholly owned subsidiary, Quintana Management LLC, which initially subcontracted the technical management of five vessels to a third-party technical management company. By November\u00a01, 2005, the Company had taken over technical management of all its vessels., 214388=Kirmar Shipco LLC, 296380=The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.45%\u00a0per annum on the undrawn amount of commitments under the revolving credit facility. This fee, which totaled approximately $90,000 for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, is payable quarterly in arrears., 323866=As of March\u00a031, 2007, the Company had 54,785,770 shares of common stock outstanding, which does not include 1,228,600 shares of unvested restricted stock that have been issued but are subject to forfeiture, and 2,503,237 Class\u00a0A Warrants outstanding., 382517=One of our vessels, Iron Beauty, was acquired in October 2005 with an existing time charter at an above-the-market rate. We deduct the fair value of above-market time charters from the purchase price of the vessel and allocate it to a deferred asset which is amortized over the remaining period of the time charter as a reduction to hire revenue. With respect to Iron Beauty, this results in a daily rate of approximately $30,600 as recognized revenue. For cash flow purposes the Company will continue to receive $36,500 per day less commissions until the charter expires. In the first quarter of 2007, we recorded $0.5 million of time charter amortization charges, compared to $0.5 million in the 2006 period. If we acquire additional vessels in the future that have above-market time charters attached to them, our amortization of time charter value is likely to increase., 74457=Commission file number: 000-51412, 369302=We generate revenues by charging customers for the transportation of dry bulk cargo using our vessels. All our vessels are currently employed under time charters to well-established and reputable charterers. One vessel, Barbara, is on a variable-rate time charter, in which the charter hire is tied to prevailing spot rates. A time charter is a contract for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time during which the charterer pays substantially all of the voyage expenses, including port and canal charges and the cost of bunkers, but the vessel owner pays the vessel operating expenses. As of March\u00a031, 2007,, 371003=Three Months Ended March\u00a031, 2007, 276464=Accumulated deficit (in thousands) shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March\u00a031, 2007 is calculated as follows:, 479828=A private individual has filed a complaint with the public prosecutor of the Athens Magistrates Court against Mr.\u00a0Molaris and four others relating to allegations that, while Mr.\u00a0Molaris was employed by Stelmar Shipping Ltd., they conspired to defraud the individual of a brokerage fee of \u00801.2\u00a0million purportedly owed by a shipyard in connection with the repair of a Stelmar vessel. Mr.\u00a0Molaris believes the complaint is without merit and is vigorously contesting these allegations. The prosecutor has referred the matter to a Greek judge for further investigation. The judge will determine whether the claim has sufficient merit to forward the matter on to a court for adjudication. We have been advised that an independent committee of the board of directors of Stelmar conducted an inquiry into these allegations and found no evidence to support them., 274005=2009, 386412=Net income for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007 was $12.5 million, compared to $5.4 million for the corresponding period in 2006, an increase of 131.5%. The increase in net income during the first quarter of 2007 over the corresponding period in 2006 is primarily due to increased revenues in the 2007 period, resulting from our operation of an average of 25 vessels during 2007 compared to an average of 10 vessels in the corresponding 2006 period., 380818=We depreciate our vessels based on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel, which is 25 years from the date of their initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value, which is estimated at $220 per lightweight ton, at the date of the vessel\u0092s acquisition, which we believe is common in the dry bulk shipping industry. Secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, its useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective. In the first quarter of 2007, we recorded $12 million of vessel depreciation charges, compared to approximately $5.9 million in the 2006 period, an increase of 103.4%. We incurred significantly higher depreciation charges in the 2007 period than in the corresponding period in 2006 because of the increase in the average number of vessels we operated in the 2007 period. As a result of the delivery of 2 more vessels since March\u00a031, 2007 and our agreement to purchase interests in an additional 8 vessels, we expect our depreciation charges to increase on a period-by-period basis as those vessels are delivered., 408334=On March\u00a014, 2007, we executed an amendment (the \u0093Amendment\u0094) to the credit facility. The material terms of the Amendment were:, 383728=We capitalize the total costs associated with a drydocking and amortize these costs on a straightline basis through the expected date of the next drydocking, which is typically 30 to 60 months. Regulations or incidents may change the estimated dates of the next drydocking for our vessels. For the three months ended March\u00a031, 2007, amortization expense related to drydocking totaled $0.4\u00a0million, compared to $0.1 million for the corresponding period in 2006, an increase of 300%. This increase was primarily due to the fact that we were amortizing drydocking expense for six vessels in 2007, compared to two vessels in 2006., 535506=\u0097 Form of Employee Restricted Stock Award Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\u00a010.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 13, 2006), 398513=\u0095\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reductions 2 to 5 (March 30, 2007 through December\u00a031, 2007), 271247=Iron Beauty was acquired in October 2005 with a time charter attached that was at an above-market rate. As described in Note 2 to the Company\u0092s Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended December\u00a031, 2006, the Company allocates a portion of the amount paid in these circumstances to the fair value of the above-market charter (which is shown as a deferred asset). When Iron Beauty was purchased, the present value of the time charter was determined to be $9.5 million, and this amount was allocated to the appropriate deferred asset account. This results in a daily rate of approximately $30,600 as recognized revenue. For cash flow purposes, the Company will continue to receive $36,500 per day less commissions. The amortization schedule of the time charter premium is as follows:, 533559=\u0097 Master Time Charter Party and Block Agreement dated November 21, 2005, 237145=Please see Note 2 of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2006 for additional information regarding the Company\u0092s significant accounting policies., 248519=Restricted stock outstanding under the Company\u0092s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan; and, 393864=Our policy is to declare and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders. Each year, our Board estimates a minimum annualized dividend, to be declared and paid quarterly, which is subject to reduction or elimination under certain circumstances, including restrictions under Marshall Islands law, covenants under our debt instruments, and changing market conditions. For 2007, our Board fixed a minimum annualized dividend of $0.96 per share. We paid an aggregate of $13.4 million and $5.0 million in dividends on our common stock the first quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively., 394947=General. On July\u00a019, 2006, we, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into an 8.25 year, $735 million senior secured revolving credit facility, with Fortis Bank N.V./S.A. as arranger. This credit facility replaced our previous $250-million revolving credit facility, which is described below., 311582=To waive compliance with the minimum-liquidity covenant through December\u00a031, 2007., 200920=The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u0093U.S. GAAP\u0094) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the management of Quintana Maritime Limited (the \u0093Company\u0094), all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, operating results and cash flows have been included in the statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ended December\u00a031, 2007. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Quintana Maritime Limited\u0092s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094), including those included in the Quintana Maritime Limited\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2006., 516459=\u0097 Consultancy Agreement between Quintana Maritime Limited and Shipmanagement Consultants Inc. (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.27 to the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2006), 349303=On April\u00a03, 2007, the Company took delivery of Iron Manolis from an affiliate of Metrobulk and paid the $38.8 million balance of the purchase price with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Iron Manolis was the last of the Metrobulk vessels that the Company had agreed to purchase in May 2006., 298623=Reductions 6 to 17 (March 30, 2008 through December\u00a031, 2010), 316183=April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012, 204050=The Company is the sole owner of all of the outstanding shares of the following subsidiaries as of March\u00a031, 2007, each of which was formed in the Marshall Islands for the purpose of owning a vessel in the Company\u0092s fleet:, 333530=Prior to the Company\u0092s initial public offering, the Quintana Maritime Limited 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u0093Stock Incentive Plan\u0094) was adopted by the Company and approved by its shareholders. The purpose of the Stock Incentive Plan is to provide the directors, employees, and consultants of the Company and its affiliates additional incentive and reward opportunities designed to enhance the profitable growth of the Company and its affiliates. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and phantom stock awards. To date, the Company has only issued restricted stock and phantom stock under the Stock Incentive Plan. In December 2005, the Company cancelled all outstanding phantom stock awards and issued restricted stock awards in their place. Only restricted stock awards are outstanding as of March\u00a031, 2007., 315691=April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011, 322276=A private individual has filed a complaint with the public prosecutor of the Athens Magistrates Court against Mr.\u00a0Molaris and four others relating to allegations that, while Mr.\u00a0Molaris was employed by Stelmar Shipping Ltd., they conspired to defraud the individual of a brokerage fee of \u00801.2\u00a0million purportedly owed by a shipyard in connection with the repair of a Stelmar vessel.

We have been advised that an independent committee of the board of directors of Stelmar conducted an inquiry into these allegations and found no evidence to support them., 511709=\u0097 Form of Employee Restricted Stock Award Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\u00a010.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 13, 2006), 329752=Effective July\u00a01, 2006, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap with Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. (\u0093Fortis\u0094) on variable notional amounts ranging from $295 million to approximately $702 million, based on expected principal outstanding under the Company\u0092s revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, the Company makes quarterly payments to Fortis based on the relevant notional amount at a fixed rate of 5.135%, and Fortis makes quarterly floating-rate payments at LIBOR + 0.85%\u00a0per annum to the Company based on the same notional amount. The swap transaction effectively converts the Company\u0092s contractual floating-rate interest obligation under its new revolving credit facility to a fixed rate of 5.985%, inclusive of margin due to its lenders. The swap is effective from July\u00a01, 2006 to December\u00a031, 2010. In addition, Fortis has, 349765=On April\u00a010, 2007, the Company took delivery of Lowlands Beilun, a 1999-built Capesize bulk carrier with the carrying capacity of 170,162 deadweight tons (dwt) from Cobelfret Bulk Carriers N.V., a Belgian shipping company. As Lowlands Beilun was delivered later than the contracted delivery date, the sellers paid approximately $1.35 million to the Company under the terms of the memorandum of agreement, thus reducing the aggregate purchase price of the vessel to approximately $71.65 million from $73 million. The purchase price was funded with borrowings under the Company\u0092s revolving credit facility and cash on hand. The vessel is currently operating on a five-year charter entered into in 2005 at a net daily rate of $36,000 per day with Cobelfret S.A., and the Company will earn the same rate of $36,000 net per day for the remaining three years of the charter., 298097=Reductions 2 to 5 (March 30, 2007 through December\u00a031, 2007), 237716=In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (\u0093 FAS 155\u0094), which amends FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Statement 140, and improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for these instruments. Specifically, FASB Statement No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. FAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity\u0092s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not intend to issue or acquire the hybrid instruments included in the scope of FAS 155, and the adoption of FAS 155 did not have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial position or results of operations., 325854=Each outstanding warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company\u0092s common stock and will expire on May\u00a011, 2009, the Warrant Expiration Date. The holders of the warrants are entitled to exercise all or a portion of their warrants at any time on or prior to the Warrant Expiration Date at which time all unexercised warrants will expire. Holders of warrants may exercise in one of two ways: First, they may surrender their warrants, together with the relevant cash exercise price, in order to receive the number of shares paid for. Second, they have a cashless exercise option, in which they may surrender warrants to receive common stock with an aggregate market value equal to the difference between the then-current market price per share of the common stock and the exercise price of the warrants multiplied by the number of such shares., 414493=Our terminated revolving credit facility, dated October\u00a04, 2005, was a secured, 8-year, $250 million revolving credit facility. Indebtedness under the old revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR + 0.975%. As of December\u00a031, 2005, $210 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility at an average interest rate of 5.28%. On July\u00a021, 2006, we repaid the outstanding principal amount of $90.0 million and terminated the facility. In connection with the termination of the facility, we wrote off approximately $1.8 million of deferred finance fees and related legal fees, which was a non-cash item., 314251=April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, 243413=In the absence of exemption from tax under Section\u00a0883 of the Code (the \u0093883 Exemption\u0094), the Company\u0092s U.S.-source shipping income would generally be subject to a 4% gross basis tax (i.e., a tax imposed without allowance for deductions). The Company believes that it qualified for the 883 Exemption for its year ended December\u00a031, 2006 and the Company will take this position for U.S. federal income tax return reporting purposes. However, there are circumstances, including some that are beyond the Company\u0092s control, which could cause the Company to lose the benefit of the 883 Exemption and thereby become subject to U.S. federal income tax on its U.S.-source shipping income. For example, 5% shareholders could acquire and own 50% or more of the Company\u0092s outstanding common stock. This would preclude the Company from being eligible for the 883 Exemption unless it can establish that among those 5% shareholders there are sufficient 5% shareholders that are qualified shareholders for purposes of Section\u00a0883 to preclude non-qualified 5% shareholders from owning 50% or more of such shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. Therefore, the Company can give no assurances regarding our qualification for this tax exemption., 374144=Three Months Ended March\u00a031, 2007 Compared to Three Months Ended March\u00a031, 2006, 311809=On March\u00a028, 2007, the Company received a waiver permitting it to form the shipowning company to purchase a Capesize vessel through a joint venture and to exclude that shipowning company from coverage under the facility until its delivery., 536277=\u0097 Form of Director Restricted Stock Award Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 13, 2006), 332710=On March\u00a016, 2007, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.24 per common share to common shareholders of record on March\u00a02, 2007, for a total payment of $13.4 million., 504035=\u0097 Articles of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to the Company\u0092s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 17, 2006), 304316=maintenance of minimum liquidity (cash or time deposits plus available credit line) of $550,000 per vessel increasing to $741,000 per vessel in 8 quarterly adjustments starting April\u00a01, 2009., 352358=LLC (\u0093AMCIC\u0094), an affiliate of Hans J. Mende, for the formation of Christine Shipco LLC, a joint venture to purchase a newbuilding capesize drybulk carrier. Messrs. Robertson, Mende and Molaris will, in addition to serving as members of our Board, serve as members of the board of directors of Christine Shipco LLC. Members of Mr.\u00a0Robertson\u0092s family, including Corbin J. Robertson, III (who is also a member of the Board), will also participate in the joint venture through Mr.\u00a0Robertson. In addition, FRC owns an interest in AMCI Capital, LLC, which indirectly owns AMCIC. Mr.\u00a0Edwards, a member of our Board and of the CNG Committee, is a Director of FRC. In connection with Mr.\u00a0Edwards\u0092 indirect participation in the Christine Shipco LLC joint venture as well as his indirect participation in the other six proposed joint ventures described below, Mr.\u00a0Edwards has requested that he be relieved of his position and responsibilities as a member of the CNG Committee of the Board. As such, the Company expects that Mr.\u00a0Edwards will resign from his position on the CNG Committee in the near term. Christine Shipco LLC executed an agreement with an affiliate of Itochu Corporation for the purchase of Christine, a 180,000 dwt Capesize carrier to be constructed at Imabari Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and delivered in 2010 for a purchase price of $72.4 million. Christine Shipco LLC entered into a term loan agreement relating to the pre-delivery financing of Christine and paid an instalment of approximately $10.9 million. Under the terms of the LLC agreement governing Christine Shipco LLC, the Company has no financial obligations in connection with the acquisition of the vessel until its delivery in 2010, when the Company must fund 50% of the acquisition price of the vessel, or approximately $36.2 million. Subsequent to the delivery of the vessel, the Company will be obliged to pay its pro rata portion of the capital obligations of the joint venture (other than amounts due under the management agreement with the Company) under most circumstances. As a result, the Company owns a 42.8% interest in the joint venture, and each of RMI and AMCIC own a 28.6% interest in the joint venture., 361372=On May\u00a04, 2007, the Company declared a dividend of $0.24 per share payable on May\u00a031, 2007 to shareholders of record as of May\u00a018, 2007.}",
