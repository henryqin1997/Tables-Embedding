As in the previous survey, respondents to the December survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to insurance companies had changed little over the past three months, as had the provision of differential terms to most-favored clients. The use of financial leverage by insurance companies also remained unchanged. A few respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by insurance companies to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms., 15505=Mark and collateral disputes. As in previous surveys, a large majority of respondents in December indicated that the volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type included in the survey were little changed over the past three months. A few respondents reported that the volume of disputes with dealers and other financial intermediaries had decreased somewhat over the same period., 5050=The December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included two sets of special questions. The first one asked about transaction volumes and interest in collateral transformation trades, which entail the lending of securities collateralized with other securities. The second concerned prospects for changes in cash management strategies upon the expiration at the end of this year of the provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that extended unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. The 22 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was conducted during the period from November 13, 2012, to November 26, 2012. The core questions ask about changes between September 2012 and November 2012.1, 15117=Nonfinancial corporations. Respondents to the December survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to nonfinancial corporations had remained essentially unchanged over the past three months. A few respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms., 10175=Dealers and other financial intermediaries. In the December survey, about one-fourth of respondents indicated that they had increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries over the past three months. (See the exhibit \"Management of Concentrated Credit Exposures and Indicators of Supply of Credit.\") The fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries has declined gradually since the June survey., 14515=Separately managed accounts established with investment advisers. As in the previous survey, nearly all of the dealers reported in the December survey that price and nonprice terms negotiated by investment advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically unchanged over the past three months. Provision of differential terms to most-favored clients and the intensity of effort by clients to negotiate more-favorable terms were also reported to be little changed. Finally, the use of financial leverage by investment advisers remained basically unchanged., 13452=Mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, pension plans, and endowments. Respondents to the December survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments had remained essentially unchanged over the past three months. Provision of differential terms to most-favored clients and the intensity of effort by clients to negotiate more-favorable terms were also reported to be little changed, as was the use of financial leverage., 22534=The FDIC's unlimited guarantee on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts is scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.6 Its expiration raises the prospect that some market participants will adjust their cash management strategies. A second set of special questions asked about the likely changes in strategies by the respondent's institution as well as the likely response of the respondent's clients. In particular, respondents were queried about the likelihood of reductions in the amount of deposits held at commercial banking institutions and, conditional on such reductions, about the likelihood of increased use of alternative cash management strategies., 20369=Relative to the beginning of 2012, dealers indicated that the volume of collateral transformation transactions through which clients source and provide pristine collateral had remained basically unchanged on net., 12536=Trading real estate investment trusts. Most respondents to the December survey reported that price and nonprice terms offered to trading real estate investment trusts (REITs) had remained broadly unchanged over the past three months.2 A few dealers indicated that price terms had tightened somewhat, for which diminished availability of dealer balance sheet or capital was the most cited reason. More than four fifths of respondents reported that the use of financial leverage by trading REITs had remained broadly unchanged, while the remainder reported that the use of leverage had increased somewhat. Respondents indicated that both the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms and the provision of differential terms to most-favored clients were broadly unchanged., 6316=Responses to the December survey generally suggested little change in the credit terms applicable to important classes of counterparties covered by the survey over the past three months. The use of financial leverage by important classes of counterparties was reported to have remained basically unchanged as well. As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged, on balance, during the past three months. Dealers also reported that initial margin requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed. However, the results of the survey offered several insights regarding recent developments and current areas of focus in dealer-intermediated markets:, 18638=Nearly one-third of respondents indicated that the liquidity and functioning of the underlying markets for non-agency RMBS and CMBS had improved somewhat during the previous three months.5 For other collateral types covered in the survey, liquidity and functioning of the underlying markets were generally characterized as little changed on net. All of the respondents indicated that the volume, duration, and persistence of market and collateral disputes were basically unchanged for all of the collateral types. These results are similar to those in the September survey., 525527=6. On January 1, 2013, the insurance limit on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts is scheduled to revert to $250,000. In market commentary, the unlimited guarantee is often referred to as the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program, and the wording of the special questions in this survey followed that convention. However, the TAG program properly refers to an earlier FDIC program that expired at the end of 2010. Return to text, 19594=Market commentary suggests that investors are increasingly interested in collateral transformation trades, which entail the lending of securities collateralized with other securities. Such transactions may be used by certain market participants to obtain higher-quality collateral--for example, to post pursuant to OTC derivatives transactions with dealers and central counterparties. For their part, lenders of the high-quality collateral may seek returns associated with effectively providing financing for higher-risk securities. A set of special questions queried dealers about the change in the volume of such transactions relative to the beginning of 2012 as well as the current level of interest in collateral transformation across various client types., 11498=Hedge funds. As in the September survey, respondents to the December survey indicated that both price terms (such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to hedge funds for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had remained basically unchanged over the past three months. Almost one-fifth of dealers noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the same period, a slight decline relative to previous surveys. Respondents indicated that the current use of leverage had changed little, on net, over the past three months. (See the exhibit \"Use of Financial Leverage.\") Respondents also indicated that the availability of additional leverage under agreements currently in place had remained basically unchanged, although a few dealers pointed to an increase.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Over the past three months, how has the amount of resources and attention your firm devotes to management of concentrated credit exposure to dealers and other financial intermediaries (such as large banking institutions) changed? Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries Questions 1 through 40 ask about credit terms applicable to, and mark and collateral disputes with, different counterparty types, considering the entire range of securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions. Question 1 focuses on dealers and other financial intermediaries as counterparties; questions 2 and 3 on central counterparties and other financial utilities; questions 4 through 10 focus on hedge funds; questions 11 through 16 on trading real estate investment trusts (REITs); questions 17 through 22 on mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments; questions 23 through 28 on insurance companies; questions 29 through 34 on separately managed accounts established with investment advisers; and questions 35 through 38 on nonfinancial corporations. Questions 39 and 40 ask about mark and collateral disputes for each of the aforementioned counterparty types. In some questions, the survey differentiates between the compensation demanded for bearing credit risk (price terms) and the contractual provisions used to mitigate exposures (nonprice terms). If your institution's terms have tightened or eased over the past three months, please so report them regardless of how they stand relative to longer\u2011term norms.
