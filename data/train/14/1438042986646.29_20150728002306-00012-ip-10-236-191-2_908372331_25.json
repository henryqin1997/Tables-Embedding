I do not need several different menus. I need just ONE menu, that properly restricts its items' visibility according to the user's permissions. Currently, the only way to overcome this bug is to split the Administer menu into several menus (one for each role needed), and use the BLOCK permissions for each menu block individually. In my case, for instance, I ended up having to split the menu into \"RegisteredUser\", \"SiteEditor\" and \"SiteAdmin\" menus. This is not a proper solution, it is a time-consuming, inelegant hack. I end up with 3 or 4 separate menus, containing totally related functions that had to be split in order for me to be able to control role access to them - when they really should be under just a single menu. This *is* a serious problem to me, as one of the main tasks I have when setting up a Drupal site is to 'dumb down' the admin",
