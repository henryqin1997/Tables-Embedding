    "textBeforeTable": "Procedure Configuring the Fault Collection Policy If the condition reoccurs during the retention interval, the fault returns to the active state. If the condition does not reoccur, the fault is deleted. The cleared fault enters the retention interval. This interval ensures that the fault reaches the attention of an administrator even if the condition that caused the fault has been alleviated and the fault has not been deleted prematurely. The retention interval retains the cleared fault for the length of time specified in the global fault policy. If the condition reoccurs during the flapping interval, the fault returns to the active state. If the condition does not reoccur during the flapping interval, the fault is cleared. When the fault is alleviated, it enters a flapping or soaking interval that is designed to prevent flapping. Flapping occurs when a fault is raised and cleared several times in rapid succession. During the flapping interval, the fault retains its severity for the length of time specified in the global fault policy. A condition occurs in the system and Cisco UCS Manager raises a fault. This is the active state. A fault in Cisco UCS",
    "textAfterTable": "Fault suppression allows you to suppress SNMP trap and Call Home notifications during a planned maintenance time. You can create a fault suppression task to prevent notifications from being sent whenever a transient fault is raised or cleared. Faults remain suppressed until the time duration has expired, or the fault suppression tasks have been manually stopped by the user. After the fault suppression has ended, Cisco UCS Manager will send notifications for any outstanding suppressed faults that have not been cleared. Fault suppression uses the following: Fixed Time Intervals or Schedules You can use the following to specify the maintenance window during which you want to suppress faults. Fixed time intervals allow you to create a start time and a duration when fault suppression is active. Fixed time intervals cannot be reused. Schedules are used for one time occurrences or recurring time periods and can be saved and reused. Suppression PoliciesThese policies define which causes and types of faults you want to suppress. Only one policy can be assigned to a task. The following policies are defined by Cisco UCS Manager: default-chassis-all-maint\u2014Suppresses faults for the chassis and all components installed into the chassis, including all blade servers, power supplies, fan modules, and IOMs.",
