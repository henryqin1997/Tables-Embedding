In most schools there is the terrible receptionist who just doesn't know how to treat people. Have you ever come across one? Well I must say, if you haven't wait until you come to this school. I don't want to generalize, but I must say adulthood is one of the biggest experiences I have had in FDU. The first day January 18Th Orientation was canceled because of the bad weather. I was not notified until later. Later meaning until I was in the school. My Financial Aid Package was not the best looking one, talking about bad days. I don't want to forget the outstanding balance I must cover that Financial Aid won't cover. It's a lot! Finally Am I enjoying being here? NO, Why not just leave? Because I'm a fool., 211251=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The school is great and there will be no regret attending Fairleigh Dickinson University! Bang for the buck The price students are paying is definitely worth the education. We have the best professors who care about their students. The students feel comfortable to have a close relationship with professors. The education is extraordinary! Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being here. The atmosphere is different. Everyone is so welcoming and comforting. The professors are great for mentoring. Everyone here is extremely friendly. It feels like home! Am learning a lot Wow the education provided to students by the professors is amazing. The things I've learned cannot be compared to any other school. Fairleigh Dickinson is one of the best schools. Definitely worth the price the education received. Login to rate or flag the reviews Audenzia from Mastic, NY",
