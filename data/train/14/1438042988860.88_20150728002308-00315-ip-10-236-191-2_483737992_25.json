No. 08/656,936 filed Jun. 3, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,361., 41778=Authorization refers to the process of determining whether a given user is allowed to do something. For example, may he post a message? May he use a surcharged service? It is important to realize that authentication and authorization are distinct processes\u2014one related to proving an identity and the other related to the properties of an identity. The present invention is not related to authorization, but it is designed to co-exist with authorization mechanisms.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Increasingly, businesses and other private and commercial entities wish to make their services and resources available to computer users throughout the world. In many instances, these entities would like to make their services and resources available through the WWW/Internet or other existing world-wide network so that they may be located easily and once located, may be accessed easily. However, users and services will be reluctant to communicate with one another unless each knows who or what is at the end of the connection. Remote Passphrase Authentication provides users and services with confidence regarding each other's identity that is needed to engage in on-line business and related transactions. The mechanism of the present invention may be used in the traditional case where the service knows the user's pass-phrase. There is no need to use a different mechanism in that case. The mechanism of the present invention works even if the service does not know the user's pass-phrase. In a distributed environment with many services that wish to authenticate the same set of users, it may be difficult, and undesirable, to make users' pass-phrases available to all services. Therefore, the service does not know the user's pass-phrase and it does not learn the user's pass-phrase during the authentication process. The mechanism provides the ability to accept an identity in any of a set of realms in which the user and service are members. Users may be authenticated in",
