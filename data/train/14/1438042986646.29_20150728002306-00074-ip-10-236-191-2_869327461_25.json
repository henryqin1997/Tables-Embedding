This was due to the fact that the save was not used during the Top 5 so the Top 4 remained intact for another week. That week's votes were added to the votes for the week of May 2., 107036=Each contestant will perform a hit song of 2013 and a song from the Great American Songbook standards.[35], 16455=Producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated on January 9, 2013, that during the Hollywood rounds, the girls and boys would perform on separate weeks. The separation of the sexes would continue in the Vegas round right up until the Top 10.[11] There would not be a Top 12 or wild cards, but he publicly stated he was contemplating the idea of ranking the singers by their vote totals as well as the possibility of breaking out voting data by geographic region.[12] This is the first season to introduce the \"Sudden death\"-round in which the top 40 already has to perform in front of a live audience. The judges pick five out of the ten contestants per show to proceed to the top 20. The amount of finalists was limited to ten which happened last in the inaugural season., 78420=The contestants performed a song that a previous American Idol winner performed while on the show, including their coronation songs, or a song they recorded in their post-Idol career.[33] Two more acts were presented on the Top 10 results show, for one last spot in the Idol tour 2013. They were Aubrey Cleland and Charlie Askew, who were the sixth place finishers for each respective gender group. The results were announced the next episode., 67987=Amber Holcomb (born March 17, 1994) is from Houston, Texas. She originally auditioned in the eleventh season, but was cut in the Las Vegas round, where she grouped with Curtis along with the eleventh season finalists Shannon Magrane and Joshua Ledet. She performed \"My Funny Valentine\" in Vegas sudden death rounds which received standing ovation from the judges. Holcomb performed \"I Believe in You and Me\" at the semi-final voting round receiving standing ovation from all of the judges. Prior to Idol, she graduated from Dekaney High School in 2012. Her musical influences are Celine Dion, Karen Carpenter and Whitney Houston. Holcomb was eliminated on May 2, 2013 and came in fourth place., 4041=The twelfth season of American Idol premiered on January 16, 2013, as part of the mid-season of the 2012\u201313 network television season.[1] Ryan Seacrest returned to host. Randy Jackson returned for his twelfth season as judge and was joined by new judges Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban, who replaced Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler., 75821=Curtis Finch, Jr. (born August 19, 1988) is from St. Louis, Missouri. He has previously auditioned in the fourth and eleventh seasons, where he made it to the Las Vegas round, where he grouped with Amber along with eleventh season finalists Shannon Magrane and Joshua Ledet. He had performed \"Jar of Hearts\" as his final solo in the Hollywood rounds. Finch sang \"Superstar\" at the sudden death rounds. He performed \"I Believe I Can Fly\" at the semi-final round. His personal musical style is his gospel background. He was the first finalist eliminated on March 14, 2013, and came in tenth place., 146993=In April 2013, Carey noted during an episode of American Idol that Minaj had not had a number one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. The following day, Minaj took to Twitter to post what have been described as \"extremely harsh\" insults against Carey. She labelled the singer as \"insecure\" and \"bitter\", while also referencing a widely spread rumor that the producers of American Idol wanted to bring Jennifer Lopez back to the panel after a significant decline in ratings this season; \"All dem #1s but JLo phone ringin? Lol.
