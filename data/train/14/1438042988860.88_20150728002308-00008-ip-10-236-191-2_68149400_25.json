            "Instructions in the README.txt file in the /se directory need to be revised for clarity. The README.txt currently reads as follows: Installing on Solaris as root user 1) Copy SUNWaspx from the RootInstall directory on the CD to directory on your machine. 2) Change the directory to where SUNWaspx was copied. $ cd /ProxyPlugin Solution: The instructions in README.txt must read as follows: 1) Copy SUNWaspx from the RootInstall directory on the CD to a directory on your machine. $ cp -R /se/WebPlugins/RootInstall/SUNWaspx /var/tmp 2) Change the directory to where SUNWaspx was copied. $ cd /var/tmp",
            "Information regarding KeepAliveFlushes in the Sun Java System Application Server Performance Tuning guide is incorrect. The Performance Tuning guide currently has the following information: The number of times the server had to close a connection because the KeepAliveCount exceeded the MaxKeepAliveConnections. This setting is not tunable. Solution The statement must read as follows: Application Server does not close existing connections when the KeepAliveCount exceeds the MaxKeepAliveConnections. Instead, new keep-alive connections are refused and the KeepAliveRefusals count is incremented.",
            "The section on Dynamic Deployment in Chapter 13 - Application Deployment of the Sun Java System Application Server Standard and Enterprise Edition 7 2004Q2 Update 3 Administration Guide (English) or the Sun ONE Application Server 7 Administration Guide (Japanese) does not warn users about errors that could occur if they attempt dynamic deployment when a client is accessing the server. Solution It is recommended that you execute the online dynamic deployment only when a client is not accessing the server. An error could occur in the data processing for memory and files if a client accesses the server during the application deployment process.",
            "The following statement in the Configuring the File Cache section of the Application Server 7 Performance Tuning Guide is incorrect: By default, Transmit File is enabled on NT, and not enabled on Unix. On Unix, enable Transmit File for platforms that have native OS support for PR_TransmitFile, which currently includes HP-UX and AIX. It is not recommended for other Unix/Linux platforms. Solution The statement must read as follows: By default, Transmit File is enabled on NT, and not enabled on Unix. On Unix, Transmit File is enabled for platforms that have native OS support for PR_TransmitFile, which currently includes Solaris, HP-UX and AIX. It is not recommended for other Unix/Linux platforms.",
            "Change in behavior of sessionFilename for memory persistence in Application Server 7 2004Q2 as compared to Application Server 7.0 series not documented. The sessionFileName property in the manager-properties table from Developer\u2019s Guide to Web Applications should read: Specifies the absolute or relative pathname of the file in which the session state is preserved between application restarts, if preserving the state is possible. A relative pathname is relative to the temporary directory for this web module. The actual name of the file gets prepended with the context information. For example, if you specify fileName to be /tmp/Session and the web app context name is MemoryPersistenceApp, the session state is preserved in /tmp/MemoryPersistenceAppSession. This is applicable only if the persistence-type attribute of the session-manager element is memory.",

In the Developer\u2019s Guide to Web Services chapter, Developing JAX-RPC Web Services, the sample config.xml incorrectly capitalizes the S in targetNamespace and typeNamespace. Solution targetNameSpace should be targetNamespace. typeNameSpace should be typeNamespace.",
            "Incorrect button label specified in Application Server 7 2004Q2 Getting Started Guide. In Chapter 1, under Session Persistence Types, the guide incorrectly states to use the Save button to complete the procedure. There is no Save button. Use the OK button.",
            "Instructions for configuring Borland OptimizeIt are incorrect. Sun Java System Application Server Developer\u2019s Guide contains a typo in instructions for configuring Borland OptimizeIt Profiler. Solution Use the following parameters for JVM options in the Profiler tab: -DOPTITHOME=Optimizeit_dir-Xbootclasspath/p:/Optimizit_dir/lib/oibcp.jar-Xrunpri:startAudit=t",

The -restype must be specified to disambiguate when a Datasource class implements both interfaces. An error is produced when this option has a legal value and the indicated interface is not implemented by the datasource class. This option has no default value. Solution --restype must be specified to disambiguate when a datasource class implements more than one of the JDBC interfaces javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource or javax.sql.XADataSource. An error is produced when this option has a legal value and the indicated interface is not implemented by the datasource class.",

In Application server Administration console, under Appserver instances>Server1>Security>Realms, the help file lists the different realms as: file, ldap, certificate, solaris. This is incorrect. The actual realms are: file, ldap, certificate, agentRealm. The Application Server installer sets the security realm to agentRealm by default.",
