SEO Most Likely to Succeed Report: SEO Superlatives Summary \u2013 Compiled 07/04/08 As you\u2019ll see, the committe only chose one or two winners over the unfiltered voting results. And sorry Michael, but it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re more feared than Matt Cutts in the SEO world. Below are the unfiltered results of the vote. Despite attempts at altering the vote, much like Google we also had manual review. And much like Google, the popular vote still overpowered the spam for the most part, so the committee\u2019s job was pretty darn easy in that regard. There were more polls that only voted for one single person than completed surveys. IN all, half the votes were spam. HALF. Numerous nominees, especially in the categories for unknown or up and coming SEOs had bots voting themselves up in an almost embarrasingly traceable way. Same IP from nominee\u2019s city votes for self 100 times in an hour? yep. Lots of that. Rushes of voters from India, Russia, Malaysia, and Poland overnight? Some of that too. The winners were chosen almost 100% from the unfiltered voting results, allowing SEOs to game the voting system to the best of their abilities. And game they did. The Results Jason Gambert",
