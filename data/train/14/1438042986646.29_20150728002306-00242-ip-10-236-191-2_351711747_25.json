The 4-year weights should be used if these 2001\u20132002 data are combined with 1999\u20132000 data. The 1999\u20132000 data files have been updated to include the subsample 4-year weights. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively), which are included in the demographic data file for each data release. For further information, see the NHANES Analytic Guidelines, June 2004 version at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.pdf., 4148=Mono-ethyl phthalate (URXMEP), Mono-benzyl phthalate (URXMZP), Mono-n-octyl phthalate (URXMOP), Mono-isononyl phthalate (URXMNP), and Mono-cyclohexyl phthalate (URXMCP): NHANES recently learned that analytical standards used since 1999 and used for several metabolites were of insufficient purity. As a result of further investigation, a correction factor was applied to each value for the 5 metabolites., 3678=For all analytes in this data set, the detection limit was constant. In cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two. The analysis of NHANES 2001\u20132002 laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001\u20132002 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews. The Household Questionnaire and other data files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN., 15905=Title: Urinary Phthalates, Phytoestrogens and PAHs (PHPYPA_B ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2001 - 2002 First Published: May, 2005 Revised: January, 2012 Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Urinary Phthalates, Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Urinary Phytoestrogens Record Source: NHANES 2001 - 2002 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2001 - 2002 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 6664=Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES 1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs) and analytical laboratories, data for the laboratory component is recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form. The system is centrally integrated and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. While the complete blood count and pregnancy analyses are performed in the MEC laboratory, most analyses are conducted elsewhere by approximately 21 laboratories across the United States.}",
