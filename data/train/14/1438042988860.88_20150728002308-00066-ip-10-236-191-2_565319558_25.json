    "textBeforeTable": "June 13, 2015 Show Shows Each week, Ask For Wild Bob pays attention to a specific far-flung location and time, examining a (potentially unpopular) musical trend and its context in local and world history. What was South Africa's hair-metal scene like? Could East Europeans rap in the late 90's? Does India produce smooth modern R&B? What were Russians doing with synthesizers at the end of the Cold War? Influential or not, a musician's work carries the historically significant role of representing their respective culture. Trot the globe and stay unstuck in time with DJ Swanky, who encourages you to keep asking around for Wild Bob even though Cody, Wyoming, is nowhere on the show's horizon. Next show: August 1, 2015 Tuesdays at 10:16 AM Ask For Wild Bob DJ Swanky Host // ]]> --> OA_show('OpenX - Button B2'); OA_show('OpenX - Button B1');",
