            "I suggest to all students that college is not the time to party but the time to study. All courses can easily be passed with outstanding achievements if only the student does the required work. Remember being at a university is a time to study.",
            "Northern keeps up with current technology. A notebook computer is available for all full time students, and there is great internet access in surrounding areas via WiMax. As well printing, it is eco-friendly and user friendly. The computers and great internet access give students more resources for studying."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone who LOVES the outdoors.. and snow. Snow is a huge part of the school year up at NMU. I can't say anything to generalize the residence halls/dorms, because each one is different! I consider myself to be an open-minded and adventurous person, and NMU has DEFINITELY brought out the best in my character. NMU has several different choices for activities, including a fully-loaded Physical Education center, complete with a ROCK WALL. There are a lot of resources available for students that need help with school, family, friends, and just adjusting to college in general. Anyone who loves the outdoors, hanging out with new people, delicious varieties of foods, and life in general will most likely thrive at NMU. Tips for prospective students Be sure to pack an open mind with your ski boots and notebooks! Moving up to NMU was a life-changing experience for me and I learned a lot about myself and college life in general. Be aware that you are not only going to school to have fun and make connections, but essentially to LEARN and PREPARE yourself for life AFTER college. Don't let yourself get too distracted or you might fall behind. Other than that.. Have fun and take FULL advantage of the campus life and facilities. I know I did :) Bang for the buck",
