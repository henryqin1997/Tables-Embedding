            "The university police are always available, not only do they have a station on campus but they patrol the building as well. You can see them in the dining halls and classrooms as well.",
            "The Greek Life is great. The sororities and fraternities are always giving back to the campus and local community",
            "Students going into technology majors will enjoy it here. There is plenty of hands on experience. Whether you are in the electrical technology major wiring things together or in the turf management major learning how to lay down turf, you gain great knowledge by performing skills hands on.",
            "Go to the gym on campus. It has a huge view of the valley. The indoor sports center is enjoyable too. You can play basketball, tennis, soccer etc.",
            "The food delicious and the dining is convenient. Because there is a culinary program on campus, the culinary students make the food and know what their peers enjoy.",
            "Dorm life is great. All your living needs are pretty much provided for you. The resident assistants and directors are very nice and wont bother you if you behave appropriately. Dorms allow you to meet many people.",
            "The academics are difficult enough to challenge each student.",
            "If you are coming to Delhi and are in a technology program, it is very important to pay attention in your hands on lab classes. This is where you'll learn the most.",
            "SUNY Delhi contains a beautiful campus located in the valley of the Catskill Mountains. The staff and faculty are always there to help. The facilities are being updated every few months to be more environmentally friendly."

I will be taking my tour in May., 55980=I have no idea how the campus was in the previous years, but as I right this review it is 2011. When coming to SUNY Delhi you need to have your wits in tack. There are many great, friendly students at this college,but be on the look out for those students who only want to have a good time. They will surely led you astray. Even though it may seem dull, the campus has a lot of fun activities weekly and it keeps the college life fresh and fun. Dorms are good, while others are just decent. Applying early gives your first picks on the good dorms.}",

Gerry and Dubois Halls have the best location for residence halls on campus since they're close to the food halls and academic halls. Bang for the buck Being a SUNY school, it's very affordable, but just like with other colleges, the food isn't always worth what they charge",
