            "Campus safety is decent at SJU but it could be better. The campus safety comes when a student calls them or needs them for something. It was taxing on me and my family when I would return from break and need someone to escort me back to school, the campus safety did a decent job at helping me back to campus.",
            "I am not personally aware of the Greek life but I know that it is not popular at SJU. There are professional Greek-life organizations but other than that, there aren't houses for Greek members to live in.",
            "There are a lot of clubs to choose from and wherever you fit, you can find something. Personally, I was a member of youth ministry and attended mass every Sunday at 7pm. An activity I thoroughly enjoyed was participating on the Women's Collegiate Crew team. I will never forget the friendships I made and the fun I experienced as a result of this program.",
            "Great for students who want a small campus and in the heart of a city. Most students are from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virgina, so it was a shock to many of my peers that I was from North Carolina.",
            "A newly popular location on campus would be the recently renovated, Francis Drexel Library. This library is beautifully constructed; it seems as if the student is studying in a modern piece of architecture when one looks out of the mosaic windows. The entire campus is known as Hawk Hill because the SJU mascot is the maroon and gray hawk. A great Hawk tradition is that basketball is the most popular entity of the school-life. When basketball season rolls around, pep rallies are held in the Hagan gymnasium which is also the place to attend spring and fall concerts.",
            "The school is a great location and the professors were great, but I do not believe that I used my money to it's fullest. I wished there were more rigorous classes and a less homologous student body.",
            "Being at Saint Joe's, you are at the helm of the second largest city in the United States, so explore for fun. I'd recommend riding the train and walking around Philly to see what the city has to offer. Make sure you bring a buddy because it is a bit dangerous. Other than that, go to eat and see the historic landmarks.",
            "There is only one cafeteria and the food is mediocre. The facility itself is very pleasant and clean. I enjoyed meeting friends in Campion Cafeteria to eat and talk about classes. The food was not that great, but the friendly cooks made up for it.",
            "The dorm-life is excellent and safe on campus. There are check-ins that requires students to swipe in order to enter. At the main desk of each dorm, there are security personnel watching you swipe and will check-in your guests. One vexing thing about the check-in stations is that there is only a certain amount of people who can be in your dorm at a given time. It is time-consuming to give your information and card, simply to visit a friend.",
            "It is not very rigorous, but depending on what you take it can be. As a freshman, I took junior and senior courses just to be challenged. The english courses are a joke and seem as if one is still sitting in his or her high school classroom.",
            "I would check your financial aid and make certain that you have enough to fully pay your tuition. Saint Joe's is not a cheap institution so it is wise to secure finances before attending. Also, many students, such as myself, have transferred due to financial burdens or not fully researching their financial aid package...the scholarship the school rewards in the admittance letter may appear to be a great amount, but it might not be as much it appears",
            "This college is located in the beautiful city of Philadelphia, which makes exploring a great past-time for students. Saint Joe's is a smaller-sized, Catholic institution with many good professors and exquisite facilities. The students that populate the campus are friendly and its small enough to recognize faces and make friend, but also big enough to meet new people."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The professors on campus are very knowledgeable in their subject matter. They are very helpful and want to assist students as much as they can, even if it does not pertain to the class's subject matter but life in general. Professor make class interesting by integrating hands-on activities and the use of technology to better their lectures. Also, the books they choose for the class are often excellent and up-to-date; although like many schools...expensive. The core major/minor classes are well taught and thorough...and the GER classes are not a waste of time. Attending St. Joe's will earn you a well-rounded education!
