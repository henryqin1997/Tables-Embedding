Lubard, Woodland Hills, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20100002222 LIDAR WITH STREAK-TUBE IMAGING, INCLUDING HAZARD DETECTION IN MARINE APPLICATIONS; RELATED OPTICS - The system and method relate to detection of objects that are submerged, or partially submerged (e.g. floating), relative to a water surface. One aspect of the invention emits LIDAR fan-beam pulses and analyzes return-pulse portions to determine water-surface orientations and derive submerged-object images corrected for refractive distortion. Another defines simulated images of submerged objects as seen through waves in a water surface, prepares an algorithm for applying a three-dimensional image of the water surface in refractive correction of LIDAR imaging through waves\u2014and also models application of the algorithm to the images, and finally specifies the LIDAR-system optics. Yet another emits nearly horizontal pulses to illuminate small exposed objects at tens of kilometers, detects reflected portions and images successive such portions with a streak-tube subsystem. Still others make special provisions for airborne objects. 01-07-2010 20130125806 Long-range UUVs - In one aspect, the invention is a vehicle working in ambient-pressure liquid or gas medium; in a second, it is a fuel tank for",
