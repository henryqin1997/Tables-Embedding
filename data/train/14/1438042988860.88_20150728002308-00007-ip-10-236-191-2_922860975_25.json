There is a new Walter Cronkite memorial in the history department, the School of Fine Arts has had some remodeling done to accommodate theatrical productions, and in 2015 the football stadium will also be remodeled to allow for more fans and VIPs., 169876=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3159=When I started college in the fall of 2008 I was really unsure of what my major was going to be and what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Taking the general studies classes at Missouri Western has really helps students figure out what they enjoy and want to pursue. At Missouri Western everyone learns so much due to the great professors. Granted, not all the professors are wonderful but the majority of them are and they truly care about teaching and making sure every student in the class receives all of the materials and resources needed in order for them to succeed., 31111=i have never personally lived in dorm since i have an exemption i mentioned above. however, i have several good friends that live in dorm and they all enjoy it. the university has several greek sororities and fraternities with members from all backgrounds that you can chose to get involved in. two new buildings were completed in 2011 that accepted students for housing this semester spring 2012. another building was completed in 2010 for student housing., 95202=Arriving at Missouri Western located in St. Joseph, Mo in Fall 2011 I didn't know what to expect. I had never been on a tour and I missed registration. I didn't even know what the town looked like. I was moving four and a half hours away from home and I was sure I would hate it, but to my surprise I am actually enjoying Missouri Western. The quiet and small town is a great environment and a perfect place to put a school. The small town helps you focus on why you are there to begin with and everyone needs a little reminder from time to time.}",
