If you get one of the ones with the meals and only some dining dollars you will regret it. You can only use those meals at the Underground and the majority of the time, that food sucks. When you get the University Meal Plan you get 1500 dollars that you can spend on anything at the university so its much more worth it., 67638=TWU is pretty cheap, even for out of state students. If you receive a scholarship of $1000, they give you in state tuition., 815225=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 774053=Overall, I am impressed with TWU. They have several programs that would fit for anybody. Currently, I am a senior graduating in May and my past fours years at TWU have been great. They have great staff in all departments, very friendly and always willing to help., 694006=There are a few activities to join like right now I am in boot camp it 6:30 a.m.-7:30a.m. they have sports for boys and girls and wild out doors activity., 35790=Tuition does go up every year, but what college doesn't? Right now for Fall 2011, tuition and fees for undergrad resident students taking about 12 hours (full time) is $2,714.32. That is not including housing.

Students who are serious about their education. Students who do not find homecoming and football games important Commuter students: TWU is a great school for commuters who live in the area. Students with a family or Nontraditional students: This school is no stranger to nontraditional students. I had a woman in my class who was 55 and we are great friends today! We also have a daycare and a playground for children. However, I would not recommend the daycare because I have heard that they cost too much money and only watch your children for a small amount of time. I still say this school is great for students who have a family because our classes teach so much about family structure, and child development. Tips for prospective students Find friends that have your same goals in mind. Watch who your friends are because you do not want",
