    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{244268=To a 1000 mL glass bottle having a screw cap having about 300 mL of methanol was added 1.93 g of sodium hydroxide pellets. The solution was stirred until such pellets dissolved, and omeprazole API was added until a heavy suspension was formed. The solution was capped and allowed to sit, at ambient temperature, for four days, then filtered using vacuum filtration and a paper filter. The resulting solid was washed with three, 50 mL portions of methanol, then placed in a vacuum oven to dry at ambient temperature. The title compound was removed after drying for 24 hours, and the purity confirmed by FT-Raman spectroscopy., 304128=These examples were carried out with solid complexed material at an 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratio of 1:6. Three prototype cores were prepared at approximately 10 mg strengths of 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole from both sprayed onto lactose and lyophilization complex material (complex without TEA). This material was milled with a Quadro Comil (0.024 inch round screen) and combined with either Lactose 316 or Avicel PH 102, Acesulfame-K, (all prescreened through a #20 screen) and blended in a 4-quart v-blender for 9 minutes (3 without intensifier, 3 with intensifier, and 3 without intensifier). Magnesium stearate was screened through a #20 screen, added to the blend and blended for 2 minutes. The blends were transferred to a Korsch PH100 or Key DB-16 tablet press and compressed to a target weight of 160 mg with a target hardness of approximately 8 to 10 kP, using 9/32 inch round plain/plain concave tooling. Each of the care tablets was coated in a MP-1 Multi Processor made commercially available by Niro-Aeromatic of Columbia, Md. with a Wurster column insert. Tablets were undercoated with Opadry Clear (Colorcon YS-1-7472). After drying, a pardon of each core prototype was coated with a solution containing Eudragit L-30 D-55 or Aquacoat CPD-30. Prototype formulas and coating solutions are set forth in the foregoing tables. The prototypes were prepared at 20 mg strengths from a sprayed on lactose complex using Lactose 316 as the bulking agent. Tablets were manufactured as described above and undercoated with Opadry White\ufffd (Colorcon YS-1-7003). After drying, core prototypes were coated with a solution containing Eudragit L-30 D-55., 258313=To a stirring suspension of 5 g (14.48 mmol) of (5)6-methoxy-2[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a 100 mL beaker was slowly added at ambient temperature 580 mg (14.48 mmol) of 60% sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil. Once all the sodium hydride was added, the mixture was allowed to stir for an additional 20 minutes. The solids were isolated by vacuum filtration through filter paper on a ceramic Buchner funnel and rinsed with a small amount of THF. The solids were dried 18 hours at ambient temperature in vacuo to yield 4.8 g (90%) of the desired product as an off-white, crystalline powder. The powder was recrystallized from 1:1 methanol:ethyl acetate by placing a filtered, saturated solution into the 5\ufffd C. refrigerator for several days, until crystals were present., 298913=A lyophilization procedure was carried out using 200 mL of a solution of combined HP\u03b2CD/5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole of 17.5 percent (w/v) and a 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratio of 1:6., 205580=As used in this context, the term \u201cessentially the same\u201d means that the API to active ingredient in drug product ratio of 6- to 5-methoxy isomers of compounds represented by formulae (Ia) and (Ib), respectively, does not vary by more than +/\u2212five percentage points (w/w). For example, for an API having a 6- to 5-methoxy isomer ratio of about 95:5 (w/w), the active ingredient ratio in the corresponding drug product is from about 100:0 to about 90:10 (w/w), respectively., 116736=Applicants have confirmed that solution NMR reveals the tautomerization of the compounds of formulae (Ia) and (Ib). Solution NMR suggests that the tautomerization reaches an equilibrium at approximately a 2:1 ratio of compounds represented by formula (Ia) to compounds represented by formula (Ib). Upon crystallization and isolation, the compounds of formula (Ia) appear to be the more energetically favorable isomer and crystallizes first. This equilibration/crystallization process allows for the predominant isolation of the solid (e.g., crystalline) isomer of compounds of formula (Ia). Through solution NMR experiments, it is believed that the exchange rate of the amine proton during tautomerization may be pH dependent. For example, with the addition of a small amount of base, the proton exchange rate in the NMR was shown to slow, and two distinct proton NMR peaks were observed for each of the benzimidazole aromatic protons., 232614=The formulation may comprise various amounts of cyclodextrin and active ingredient. Preferably, the complex comprises these components in a molar ratio of active ingredient to cyclodextrin ranging from about 1:4 to about 1:28, more preferably from about 1:4 to about 1:10., 301282=2000 to 6000 mL of a complexed solution of 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole and HP\u03b2CD was prepared according to Example 41 with a combined HP\u03b2CD/5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (w/v) ranging from 17.5 to 35.0 percent and a 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratio of 1:6. The complexed solution was top sprayed onto lactose 316 in a MP-1 Multi Processor made commercially available by Niro-Aeromatic located in Columbia, Md. at product temperature of 40\ufffd C. and an initial spray rate of 11 g/min, with a total spray time of 8 hours., 371325=The procedure according to Examples 107-109 was repeated except that these studies was conducted in 47 subjects. 15 or 16 subjects per study received one of three 20 mg tablets containing active ingredient to HP\u03b2CD mass ratios of 1:4, 1:15 1:20, denoted as formulations D, E, and F respectively. All tablets were coated with Eudragit L3OD. All 47 subjects received Prilosec. Blood collections were not made at the 10 and 12 hour marks., 366780=Dissolutions of various prototypes set forth in Examples 81-85 were determined and compared against a Prilosec\ufffd formulation in the form of a capsule containing enteric coated granules. The Prilosec formulation contained no cyclodextrins. The dissolution was conducted for 60 minutes in acid followed by 60 minutes in pH 7.4 buffer. The prototypes of the invention having 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:6 displayed dissolution behavior comparable to the Prilosec\ufffd formulation., 33529=This application is a continuation of and claims priority from U.S. application Ser. No. 10/189,659, pending, filed Jul. 3, 2002, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 10/057,659 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,444,689, filed Jan. 25, 2002, which is a continuation of Ser.

No. 6,262,085, filed Mar. 7, 2000, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/150,878, filed Aug. 26, 1999, the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 299539=A lyophilization procedure was carried out using 1345 mL of a solution of combined HP\u03b2CD/5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole of 3 percent (w/v) and a 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratio of 1:6.8. The solution was prepared by dissolving 5.1 g of 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole in 19 mL of a 40 percent solution of tetraethanolamine (TEA) and thereafter adding 1361 mL of a 2.3% (w/v) solution of HP\u03b2CD., 172938=For each of the selected standards, other than the \u201cpure\u201d 6-methoxy isomer, a deconvolution algorithm (self-Fourier deconvolution software; such as, for example, TQ Analyst\u2122 from Nicolet Instruments Corporation) is used to deconvolute the peak areas of the peaks at about 1365 cm\u22121 (the 5-methoxy isomer) and 1354 cm\u22121 (the 6-methoxy isomer). The pure 6-methoxy isomer (Example 1a) only shows a simple peak at 1354 cm\u22121 and as such the percent 6-methoxy isomer is set at a concentration of 100%. Using such an algorithm, the area percent of the 6-methoxy isomer of each standard having both the 5- and 6-methoxy isomer is determined. The standard deviation for each set of replicates is less than about 0.7% and the average standard deviation for the average of all runs and replicates of a given standard is less than about 0.7% or the resulting data should be investigated., 186157=Furthermore, an additional method for establishing the ratio of the 5- and 6-methoxy isomers of omeprazole API, albeit less precise than the quantitative FT-Raman method previously described herein, as well as ratio of the 5- and 6-methoxy isomers in omeprazole drug product was developed. This method also used an FT-Raman spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 670 with an FT-Raman accessory, 1064 nm laser, and a step and repeat sampling device). This method, too, is conducted in three stages: preparation of standards, establishing a standard curve, and analysis of samples., 171363=To establish and quantitate the ratio of the 5- and 6-methoxy isomers of omeprazole API, including the novel ratios of such isomers of the present invention (the \u201cmodified omeprazole compounds\u201d), a Raman spectrographic method was developed using a FT-Raman spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 670 with an FT-Raman accessory, 1064 nm laser, and a step and repeat sampling device; Nicolet Instruments Corp., Madison, Wis.). The present method is conducted in three steps: preparation of standards, establishing a standard curve, and analysis of samples., 336532=Clinical prototypes were manufactured by complexing 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (\u201cactive ingredient\u201d) with HP\u03b2CD in solution and spraying the solution onto lactose. The spray on lactose material was then blended with excipients listed in the below table and compressed into core tablets. The mass ratios of 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl) methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD ranged from 1:4 to 1:20 with core tablet weights of 170 mg to 550 mg, respectively as set forth in the table below., 153472=The ratio of metal cation to compound in a complex of the invention typically depends on the specific structure of the compound and the valence of the metal cation. In embodiments employing a solvent residue, the amount of such residue that is employed will typically depend on the above factors as well as the type of residue used. In preferred embodiments, the ratio of: (1) compounds of formulae (Ia) and/or (Ib) as defined by any of compounds (Iai), (Iaii), (Iaiii), (Iaiv), (Ibi), (Ibii), (Ibili), and (Ibiv), respectively, or combinations thereof; to (2) one or more metal cation; to (3) solvent residue will typically be 2:1:4 or 2:2:2 for magnesium or sodium, respectively, and can otherwise vary depending upon the metal cation and compound used, and the crystalline packing forces respective thereto. Other ratios may be required depending on the charge of the cation and the type of complex embodiment., 282100=To a 50 mL beaker was added about 1 g of (5)6-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to 30 mL of a 75:25 mixture of ethanol:toluene. Additional (5)6-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole was added to the resulting solution until a suspension of the material was formed. The solution was stirred for approximately 10 minutes, and then filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) or Nylon filter. The resulting saturated solution was placed in a shallow petri dish, covered and stored under refrigerated conditions (approximately 5\ufffd C.) and a humidity range of approximately 50 to 90 percent until crystals formed (between 4-12 days). The identity of the title compound is confirmed by single crystal x-ray diffraction and/or Raman spectroscopy. The resulting material was shown to contain between about 82 and 90 percent (w/w) of the 6-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole and between about 10 and 18 percent (w/w) of 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole., 127531=The above techniques can also be used to co-crystallize a metal ion analogue of the compounds represented by formulae (Ia) and (Ib) in the amounts set forth above. Redissolving such compound(s) is believed to initiate the bipyramidal inversion which generates the diastereomer components Sxa-R4q, Sxa-R4z, Sxb-R4q, and Sxb-R4z in amounts which are believed to depend upon, but not potentially limited to, the bipyridimal inversion equilibrium rate, the time it takes to create the metal analog, and the time it takes to crystallize the analog. It should be appreciated that these variables may be manipulated by one skilled in the art. Preferably, the range of each of the four diastereomers can range from about a 60:40 ratio to about a 100:0 ratio of enantiomeric Sxa-R4z and Sxb-R4z analogs to Sxa-R4q and Sxb-R4z analogs., 187350=Rather than a partial least squares analysis, however, a software program capable of analyzing Raman spectra in a corrected classical least squares format, for example, Nicolet's TQ Analyst\u2122, is used to generate a standard curve using the average determine percent 6-methoxy isomer values and the peak height ratio of a given pair of peaks in a standard. In general, the method is performed by a ratio of a peak related to the 6-methoxy isomer (about 1627 cm\u22121) to a suitable internal omeprazole band (about 1587 cm\u22121). In the event the presence and magnitude of matrices from pharmaceutical excipients in drug product interfere with the resolution of the peak related to the 6-methoxy isomer and/or the preferred internal omeprazole band, other sets of bands at such as, for example, about 1587 cm\u22121 and 1201 cm\u22121, respectively, and 1185 cm \u22121 and 1512 cm\u22121, respectively, are used. Correlation coefficients of the standard curve are at or above about 0.95 among all standards., 195956=For the sole omeprazole drug product registered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and sold in the United States (Prilosec\ufffd), the ratio of the 6- and 5-methoxy isomers in API typically shifts from a ratio of about 93:7 (+/\u2212about 2%), respectively, to a ratio in drug product of about 86:14 (+/\u2212about 3%), respectively. Factors such as mechanical manipulation (e.g., grinding or, potentially, aggressive sieving) and, particularly the use of commonly used wet granulation processes during drug product preparation have likely contributed to this significant and unexpected shift. Accordingly, shifts from the more thermodynamically stable compounds of the present invention having a higher percentage of the 6-methoxy isomer (with the pure 6-methoxy isomer being preferred) to the less stable compounds of the present invention having increasing concentrations of the 5-methoxy isomer in the same composition can affect the stability and dissolution profiles of drug product. Compounds and pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention having such higher percentage of such 6-methoxy isomer provide greater stability whereas those having such increasing percentage of such 5-methoxy isomer provide more rapid dissolution., 226266=In another aspect, the invention provides a complex comprising any of the active ingredients as defined hereinabove and at least one cyclodextrin. Most preferably, the complex is in the form of an inclusion complex. As used herein, the term \u201cactive ingredient\u201d refers to any of the embodiments set forth herein referring to the compound(s) of formulae (Ia) and/or (Ib), diastereomers thereof, any combinations of diastereomers thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, along with complexes, hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of any of the above, as well as any compositions thereof, and combinations of any of the above. For the purposes of the invention, the term \u201ccyclodextrin\u201d is to be broadly construed and include, without limitation, alpha-cyclodextrins, beta-cyclodextrins, and gamma-cyclodextrins. An example of a description of cyclodextrins is provided in The Merck Index, 12th Ed., (p. 458) 1996. As known in the art cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides typically consisting of 6, 7, or 8 glucose units. The glucose units are linked by alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds. As a consequence of the chair formation of the sugar units, all secondary hydroxyl groups (e.g., at C2 and C3) are located on one side of the ring, while all the primary hydroxyl groups at C6 are situated on the other side. As a result, the external faces are hydrophilic, marking the cyclodextrins water-soluble. In contrast, the cavities of the cyclodextrins are hydrophobic, since they are lined by the hydrogen of atoms C3, C5, and by ether-like oxygens. Also encompassed under the definition of cyclodextrin are derivatives of cyclodextrins. In various embodiments, the 18 to 24 hydroxyl groups of the respective cyclodextrin molecules are the starting points for the synthesis of such derivatives. Using known techniques, methyl-, ethyl-, hydroxyethyl-, hydroxymethyl, and hydroxypropyl substituted cyclodextrins may be utilized., 36558=PCT Publication No. WO 96/02535 proposes a process for the enantioselective synthesis of single enantiomers of omeprazole or its alkaline salts. The process employs an oxidizing agent and a chiral titanium complex which may include a titanium(IV) compound., 300423=2000 mL of a complexed solution of 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole and HP\u03b2CD was prepared according to Example 45 with a combined HP\u03b2CD/5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (w/v) of 17.5 percent and a 5(6)-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole to HP\u03b2CD mass ratio of 1:6. This solution was spray dried using a Spray Drier, Model GB-21 made commercially available by Yamato located in Tokyo, Japan., 367592=Fasted-state bioavailability studies were conducted in normal healthy subjects (six subjects per study) comparing three formulations of the present invention to Prilosec\ufffd in a 2-way crossover design. All formulations were administered as a single 20 mg dose immediately following an overnight fast. Blood was collected at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 hours in the study, with additional collections being made at hours 10 and 12. The studies were conducted comparing three 20 mg tablets to Prilosec. The comparison consisted of 6 different subjects, with three formulations containing active ingredient to HP\u03b2CD mass ratios of 1:6, 1:6, 1:10, and coatings of Eudragit FS3OD, L3OD, and L3OD, respectively (denoted respectively as formulations A, B, and C). The formulations of the invention generally displayed improved bioavailability relative to the innovator formulation (i.e., Prilosec) as set forth in the following table.}",
