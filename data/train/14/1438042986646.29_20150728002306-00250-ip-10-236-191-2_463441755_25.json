They differ in internal diameter and optimal position on the instrument. The air sensors can be attached to the instrument using the rails and holders. No dummy modules need to be removed. In addition to be used for preventing air from entering the system, the external air sensors can be used together with System pump A to load the entire sample volume. Air sensor L9-1.5 L9-1.5 has a 1.5 mm inner diameter and is designed for i.d. 1.6 mm FEP tubing at the low pressure side before pumps. It is installed in",
