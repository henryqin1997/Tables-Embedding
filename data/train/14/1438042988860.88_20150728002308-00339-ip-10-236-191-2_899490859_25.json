I was supposed to attend back in 2011 and I will say this is my dream school. Everything about JWU was breath taking. The small classes, the campus itself was beautiful, the amount of activities you could do while on campus was perfect. I wish i could have attended but i did not have enough money to attend. Although the school tuition is expensive i would say it would be worth it. Nothing about this school was bad on my weekend visit to see the school I fell in love with it. In two days JWU showed me what a dream school school would be like.}",
