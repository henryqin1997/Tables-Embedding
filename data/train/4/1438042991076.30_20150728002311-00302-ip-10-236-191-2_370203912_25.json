ELPs and EFPs both use the VSAN WWN by default during link initialization. However, the ELP usage changes based on the peer switch\u2019s usage: If the peer switch ELP uses the switch WWN, then the local switch also uses the switch WWN. If the peer switch ELP uses the VSAN WWN, then the local switch also uses the VSAN WWN. Configuring a Secondary MAC Address You can allocate secondary MAC addresses.
