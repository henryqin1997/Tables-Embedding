            "Keep an open mind while meeting new people and when choosing a major. Your first couple years of college you learn a lot about yourself and your passions that you may not have previously been aware of.",
            "The price for ISU is very reasonable as it is a public university.",
            "I really enjoy going to ISU! The people are friendly, and there are always opportunities to make new friends. Whatever your major, there are lots of activities you can be involved in, from major oriented clubs, like Sports Marketing Club or WZND radio, to sports, such as football, cheerleading, or hockey. ISU also is known for the Fell Arboretum, which covers a large part of the campus and quad. It looks absolutely beautiful throughout the year, especially fall. The quad makes getting from class to class very easy. ISU also provides a transportation system allowing students to get from one part of campus to the other, and the Bloomington-Normal busses also drive around campus to parts of town, such as the Eastland Mall, which is great for students. ISU's dorms are nice and ISU's housing offers many themed floors which allows students to get to know other people in their major. Many of the dorms have dinning centers which serve a variety of good food in an all you can eat style.",
            "ISU has offered me several opportunities for learning a vast amount of information over the past few years. I have learned a lot from my classes and about myself."

I just love it , I work really hard and enjoy going there!, 273931=In the Fall of 2012, one of the dining centers was shut down, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we have some of the best food on a college campus of course the typical burgers, fries, chicken patties, and such are always available, but our trayless dining centers provide full course meals. From the Mongolian grill, to the Chinese Wok, to the Fresh Bites, the grill, and the Italian station, it is a buffet which widely opens the eyes of every incoming freshman. Also, we have ,any restaurants on campus that accept our Redbird card flex dollars to pay for our food. But even staying for 4 years, you will never try everything in Bloomington-Normal. This twin city set has the more restaurants within its area than any other US city. I found this out my freshman year. It is truly an awesome provider of dining experiences., 439674=its not my thing but march madness is fun to attend. -->a dance off between the sororities and fraternities., 275049=The dorms here are always lively. People keep their doors open for nosy students (like how I was in my freshman year) to pop in and check out their room or just to say hey. There's cable, free wired and wireless connections, and there's even a phone hook-up. The dorms provide singles, double, quads, and suites. I absolutely love living in the dorms but there are also student apartments that the school provides including the new ones, Cardinal Courts, which were built for the Fall of 2012., 409230=Club Milner--during finals week they hand out a bunch of free stuff in the library and at 10:00 pm on the Sunday before finals week they have a 10 minute dance party where students get wild!, 47108=Fill out your application early if you want to be accepted into a competitive degree program. Most scholarships must be applied for and are not just awarded when you apply to the college. Most scholarships have a April deadline., 310249=As of 2012 all of the Residence halls at Illinois State are remodeled. There most populated building Watterson towers offers suite living, and has marble bathrooms and showers. Dorm life would have earned five stars had the elevators not been such a pain., 510752=I cant actually rate the school academically because I have not taken a class there yet but I will be attending in the fall of 2013., 710043=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Illinois State has a great nursing, teaching, and business program. If one of the programs I just listed fits you, when you tour hear check out those colleges. Finding the right specific college fit is just as important as finding the right university. Tips for prospective students As I stated above, Illinois State although a great value, is not cheap. Look into scholarships still, and find every bit of help you can. Also, when you come to visit Illinois State look at all the residents halls. We have four distinctly different halls. Someone might love Watterson Towers for example, but another might hate it. Find the residence hall that is that right fit for you, and you will enjoy Illinois State much more.",
