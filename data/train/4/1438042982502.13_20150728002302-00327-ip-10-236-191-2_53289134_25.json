New York held the ball for over nine minutes in the game's opening drive, which featured four third-down conversions from Bradshaw, the last of which a three-yard plunge to cap the 16-play, 80-yard march., 51107=After Washington's third three-and-out in as many possessions, Manning hit Hakeem Nicks for a 45-yard gain on 3rd-and-5 near midfield. On the next play, Smith was left open in the back left corner of the end zone for a six-yard reception with 4:36 to go in the half., 52303=But, in keeping with Washington's woes, the extra point failed and New York responded with a touchdown a little later, as Manning connected with Hagan for a 23-yard score at the 6:21 mark of the third.}",
