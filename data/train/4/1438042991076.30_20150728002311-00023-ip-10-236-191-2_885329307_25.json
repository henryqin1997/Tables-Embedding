    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Undecided on 4 year major. Looking to save considerable amount of money. A great beginning to college-life experience in every aspect. Tips for prospective students Residing in a dorm for your first year is highly recommended; apply early for a single room which is more costly but well worth it. No need for a car. Campus is extremely secure. Bang for the buck Excellent professors who help you succeed while encouraging independent responsibility. My experience has been outstanding and I recommend all graduating seniors to consider attending OCC. Am enjoying being here Many activities to participate in: clubs, fraternities and sporting events. Access to Syracuse University and LeMoyne is easy and free by bus. Class size allows for much interaction between students and professors. Faculty knows you by name! I am a member of the lacrosse team and have had an exceptional experience. Coaches are great and extremely supportive of academic learning requirements. Am learning a lot Studying engineering science has been challenging and rewarding. A great place to start prior to transfering to a 4 year college.",
