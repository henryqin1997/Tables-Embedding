Non-Hispanic Asian participants are grouped with other non-Hispanic races in code \u201c5\u201d (other non-Hispanic race including non-Hispanic multiracial) in RIDRETH1. Codes \u201c6\u201d and \u201c7\u201d were not used in RIDRETH1. Coding procedure for other categories in RIDRETH1 was compatible to RIDRETH3., 21580=There are several variables with new categories in the 2011-2012 demographics file. The variables with updated categories are: the survey participant\u2019s country of birth (DMDHRBR4) and the language used for the audio-computer-assisted self-interview., 11594=DMQADFC: This is another new variable in the 2011-2012 dataset to provide veteran related information. It describes whether the participant has ever served in a foreign country during a time of armed conflict or on a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission. This would include National Guard or reserve or active duty monitoring or conducting peace keeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, in the Sinai between Egypt and Israel, or in response to the 2004 tsunami or Haiti in 2010., 25017=The sample design for NHANES 2011-14 includes an oversample of Asian Americans (Table 1). Therefore a new variable (RIDRETH3) is included to describe the participant\u2019s race and Hispanic origin., 3774=DMDMARTL: Marital status is only released for persons 20 years of age and older because of potential disclosure risks. Prior to 2007, marital status was released for participants aged 14 and older. In NHANES 2011-2012, the number of married persons aged 14-19 is less than 1%., 12038=DMQMILIZ: This is a new variable included in the 2011-2012 dataset to provide information on whether the participant has ever served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, military Reserves, or National Guard. Active duty does not include training for the Reserves or National Guard, but does include activation, for service in the U.S. or in a foreign country, in support of military or humanitarian operations., 2225=Sample Weights: The 2-year sample weights (WTINT2YR, WTMEC2YR) should be used for all NHANES 2011\u20132012 analyses. There are no 4-year weights in this file. The 4-year weights were only provided with the NHANES 2001\u20132002 release file. Detailed instructions for combining datasets from previous NHANES cycles are provided in the NHANES Analytic Guidelines., 23068=Similar to previous release cycles, the 2011-2012 demographics file includes a variable for age in years at screening (RIDAGEYR) for all participants. A new variable has been added to denote the age in years at examination (RIDEXAGY) for participants aged 2 to 19 years. Age in months at screening (RIDAGEMN)\u00a0is reported for participants aged 0 to 24 months. Age in months at examination (RIDEXAGM) is reported for participants aged 0 to 19 years. Due to increasing concerns about potential disclosure risks, information on age in months at screening and at examination for participants in other age groups are no longer included in the public release file but are available through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)., 23162=1Non-Hispanic Asians were included in the \u201cOther\u201d category in 2009-10., 3469=RIDEXPRG: Because of possible disclosure risks, pregnancy status is only released for women aged 20-44 years. The percentage of pregnant women/girls aged 8-19 is less than 1%. None of the women aged 45-59 in the 2011-2012 dataset were identified as pregnant., 22293=Starting in 2011, more detailed information on veterans in the U.S. is collected in NHANES. Two new variables were released in the 2011-2012 demographic file to denote whether the participant has served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces (DMQMILIZ), and for those who have, whether the participant has ever served in a foreign country during a time of armed conflict or on a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission (DMQADFC). DMQMLIZ replaces the veteran status question (DMQMILIT) collected in previous NHANES that asked if the participant had served in the Armed Forces of the US. Additional information for these veterans is available through the NCHS RDC., 3182=Masked Variance Units (MVUs): Fourteen masked variance strata and 31 masked primary sampling units (PSUs) are included in the 2011-2012 NHANES demographics file. Eleven strata have 2 PSUs and three strata have 3 PSUs. These MVUs are a collection of secondary sampling units that are aggregated into groups for the purpose of variance estimation. The variance estimates that are produced, using the MVUs, closely approximate the variances that would have been estimated using the \u201ctrue\u201d sample design variance units that are based on the actual survey sample strata and primary sampling units. MVUs are used to protect the confidentiality of information provided by survey participants and to reduce disclosure risks. The use of MVUs is described in the NHANES Analytic Guidelines. Analysts should review the Guidelines carefully prior to analyzing the survey data., 9392=AIALANGZ: This variable indicates the language used for the audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) portion of the MEC interview. In 2011-2012, the ACASI portion was translated into Chinese (traditional/Mandarin, simplified/Mandarin, and traditional/Cantonese), Korean, and Vietnamese to accommodate the Asian oversampling. The three categories reported are: 1) English, 2) Spanish, and 3) Asian languages., 16407=RIDRETH3: This is the new race-ethnicity variable in 2011-2012. It was derived from responses to the survey questions on race and Hispanic origin. Respondents who self-identified as \u201cMexican American\u201d were coded as such (i.e., RIDRETH3=1) regardless of their other race-ethnicity identities. Otherwise, self-identified \u201cHispanic\u201d ethnicity would result in code \u201c2, Other Hispanic\u201d in the RIDRETH3 variable. All other non-Hispanic participants would then be categorized based on their self-reported races: non-Hispanic white (RIDRETH3=3), non-Hispanic black (RIDRETH3=4), non-Hispanic Asian (RIDRETH3=6), and other non-Hispanic race including non-Hispanic multiracial (RIDRETH3=7). Code \u201c5\u201d was not used in RIDRETH3., 16645=RIDEXMON: This variable indicates the six-month time period when the examination was performed. A value of \u201c1\u201d indicates November 1st through April 30th; a value of \u201c2\u201d indicates May 1st through October 31st., 25071=What is New in 2011-2012, 4864=As noted in What is New in 2011-2012, in the \u201cComponent Description\u201d section\u00a0above, the sample design for NHANES 2011-14 includes an oversample of Asian Americans. For more details on sample design and related analytic issues, please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines, 2011-2012\u00a0available on the website at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm., 18383=SDDSRVYR: This variable represents the two-year data release cycle number. A value of \u201c7\u201d denotes NHANES 2011\u20132012., 15224=DMDBORN4: Due to the concerns of disclosure risk, starting in 2011, country of birth was recoded into two categories: 1) Born in 50 U.S. states or Washington, DC; and 2) Born in other countries, including U.S. territories.}",
