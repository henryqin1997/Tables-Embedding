What you pay is small compared to what you get out of it. Am enjoying being here College life is great here. Fraternities/Sororities, Student clubs and groups, great athletic opprotunities, there really is something for everyone! Am learning a lot I am a Music Education Major at ASU-Jonesboro. I've been studying music for years, being in band in High School and Jr. High, as well as playing various instruments since elementary, but I am amazed by how much I learn every day from my music classes.
