Using DNA recombinant technology, STELARA\u00ae is produced in a well characterized recombinant cell line and is purified using standard bio-processing technology. The manufacturing process contains steps for the clearance of viruses. STELARA\u00ae is comprised of 1326 amino acids and has an estimated molecular mass that ranges from 148,079 to 149,690 Daltons., 22067=Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the studies., 26228=A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old., 83541=To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch., 21586=Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The studies had the same design through Week 28. In both studies, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of STELARA\u00ae. Subjects randomized to STELARA\u00ae received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive STELARA\u00ae (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16.}",
