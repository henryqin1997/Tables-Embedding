Has been shown to act as tumor suppressor in other types of cancer. Expressed and present as activated kinase in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients; promotes survival of leukemia cells (PubMed:20111072). Expression is absent in K562 leukemia cells; ectopic expression of FSP/FES restores myeloid differentiation (PubMed:2656706). May function as tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer; expression is reduced or absent in samples from some colon cancer patients (PubMed:16455651). Ectopic expression of FSP/FES suppresses anchorage-independent growth in colon cancer cell lines (PubMed:16455651). Up-regulated in prostate cancer, and might be a predictor of recurrence after radical surgery (PubMed:21563194). May promote growth of renal carcinoma cells (PubMed:19082481).}",
