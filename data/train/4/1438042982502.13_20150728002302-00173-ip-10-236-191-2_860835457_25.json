            "Bentley has it's own Bentley Campus Police. So, any issues are handled right on campus and I've had no issues- other than parking my car in the wrong place once( and I got a ticket for $25). But, as far as safety, they are patrolling 24/7 and it's a really safe Campus.",
            "Yes- is is an important part of life at Bentley. I am an initiated member of Kappa Sigma and it's given me a chance to connect at a very deep level with a relatively small group of guys with whom you develop a bond for life. We have a social almost every week with the sororities and it's a great way to meet girls!",
            "Bentley has an incredible array of clubs to choose from and there are events for signing up to most clubs on campus. I'm a member of the Marketing Club, Honor Society and Bentley Finance Club.",
            "1. Business focused 2. Organized 3. Like small classes 4. Lots of one on one interaction 5. Want to be part of Greek life 6. Interested in volunteering 7. Like to socialize at networking events 8. Outgoing, lots of expectation inclasses to contribute",
            "There is a May Day celebration where you go around from dorm to dorm and share food and drink- it's incredible fun and I did it as a freshman last year for the first time and it was fantastic!",
            "This is an amazing school. The coursework and choices are vast and the classes are generally small. Most professors I've had are incredibly accessible and actually care what's happening with us on a one to one basis. The reputation od this school is getting better and better and I have absolutely no regrets with my choice and in was accepted to Columbia, NYU and Wharton.",
            "Boston is incredibly close, so I go there on the shuttle bus once a week to see concerts, go to the Prudential or out to dinner. On campus, there are events at my Fraternity, Kappa Sigma every week and opportunities to network often.",
            "There is a cafeteria and other options on campus. However, since I am an Italian chef, it's difficult for me to find options that are satisfying and healthy. My roommates, however, like the Seasons Dining Hall and you can get fresh fruit there all day long.",
            "Right now as a Sophomore, I still have to reside in the dorms which have no kitchen. I hope to switch over to those dorms as a Junior as I am a chef ( at my family restaurant in the summers) and I want to be able to cook. Otherwise, dorm life is comfortable and reasonable and I feel totally safe at Bentley.",
            "I am a member of the Honor Society at Bentley and you must maintain a 3.3 GPA to enable attendance in a rigorous academic program of classes. I highly recommend inquiring about this if you want the most rigourous coursework available.",
            "Although Bentley is focused on business or accounting majors, there is an extraordinary core curriculum of options which makes the education there broad based and comprehensive. Visit the campus which is exceptional and only 20 minutes from Boston.",
            "1. Bentley's professors are accessible and professional. 2. The number of opportunities to join pertinent business clubs is outstanding, as is the number of networking opportunities. 3. As a member of Kappa Sigma, Greek life is highly respected on campus and this fraternity of brothers offers immeasurable opportunities for volunteerism, networking and personal growth."

The work load can be heavy but it's worth it in the long run. Tips for prospective students Tour the campus beforehand to get a feel for the school. Definitely eat in the cafeteria to see how you like the food. I would also talk to students who attend the school and ask them questions you would want answered. If you do go here, ask for help if you need it. There are many resources on campus (including internship opportunities). Bang for the buck The tuition is a bit pricy but I think it's worth it. Plus the school offers a lot of financial help for those who need it.",
