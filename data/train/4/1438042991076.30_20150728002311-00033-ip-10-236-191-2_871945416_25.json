Alternatively, Trey Research can build custom connectivity components to integrate with the transport partners' systems. There are also some limitations imposed on topics; for example, a topic can currently have a maximum of 2000 subscriptions and can support up to 100 concurrent connections (the limit of 100 concurrent connections also applies to queues). However, Trey Research considered that the Orders system was unlikely to hit either of these two limits., 182078=Last built: June 4, 2012, 178213=All links in this book are accessible from the book's online bibliography available at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh871440.aspx.}",

Figure 1 illustrates the original application, with the components that handle the order processing highlighted. Figure 1 The order processing components in the on-premises application In the on-premises solution, when a customer places an order the application stores the order details in the Orders table in the on-premises database. The Audit Log table in the on-premises database holds a range of information including runtime and diagnostic information, together with details of unusual orders such as those over a specific total value. The Orders application then sends a message to the appropriate transport partner. This message indicates the anticipated delivery date and packaging information for the order (such as the weight and number of packages). The transport partner sends a message back to the Orders application after the delivery is completed so that the Orders database table can be updated. Due to the nature of the products Trey Research manufactures, it must also ensure that it meets legal requirements for the distribution of certain items, particularly for export to other countries and regions. These requirements include keeping detailed records of the sales of certain electronic components that may be",
