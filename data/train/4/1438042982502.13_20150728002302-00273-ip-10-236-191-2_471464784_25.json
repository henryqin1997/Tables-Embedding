    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6099=Foam generated from an experimental standard foam generation nozzle used for testing aqueous film forming foam fire extinguishing compositions (as per national certification) was used to fill a foam collection tank (volume V: 1400 ml, weight W1 g) as prescribed in the Ministry of Home Affairs Ordinance No. 26, and the total weight (W2 g) of the foam filled collection tank was measured. The foam magnification was then calculated using the formula below. Expansion \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e ratio = V W2 - W1}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{94305=In those cases where a surfactant with an anionic hydrophilic group (B) and a polybasic acid compound (C) are included in the fire extinguishing composition of the present invention, the mixing proportions of the cationic polyamine based high molecular weight compound (A) with the surfactant with an anionic hydrophilic group (B) and the polybasic acid compound (C) will vary depending on the combination of the constituents, although typically weight ratios (B):[(A)+(C)] within a range from 2:1 to 1:50 are preferable, with ratios within a range from 1:1 to 1:10 being even more desirable. By maintaining the mixing ratio of the other constituents relative to the surfactant with an anionic hydrophilic group (B) within the above range, a water insoluble complex does not form with the surfactant with an anionic hydrophilic group (B), and so the foaming properties can be maintained. Even if the mixing ratio is greater than the above range, no marked deterioration is observed in foaming ability, flame resistance, heat resistance or fuel resistance, but by maintaining the mixing ratio within the above range, large increases in the viscosity of the fire extinguishing composition concentrate can be avoided, and corresponding reductions in the commercial value of the composition can be prevented., 24111=Furthermore, these fire extinguishing compositions incorporate large amounts of water soluble high molecular weight material, and so the composition concentrate is extremely viscous (at least 1200 mm2/s), and moreover the viscosity value varies considerably with temperature. Consequently, considerable care needs to be taken with the fire extinguishing equipment (such as mixers and piping), and there are handling concerns associated with the practical application of these types of compositions to existing equipment. Furthermore, conventionally these type of fire extinguishing compositions have been prone to forming a thin membrane (skin) on the surface of the liquid and on the walls of the tank during storage, and moreover producing sedimentation on the bottom of the tank, and problems have also arisen over the life of the product with concerns that they do not cope with extended storage. In addition, these types of fire extinguishing compositions also have a relatively high freezing point of approximately 0\ufffd C., and because they are not reversible in terms of freezing and remelting, use or storage of such compositions in cold regions requires special considerations., 90041=In those cases where a surfactant (B) is included in the fire extinguishing composition of the present invention, the mixing proportions of the cationic polyamine based high molecular weight compound (A) and the surfactant (B) should preferably be within a weight ratio range from 5:1 to 1:3, with ratios within a range from 3:1 to 1:1 being even more desirable., 108560=In a stainless steel flask equipped with a thermometer, a nitrogen gas inlet tube, a stirrer, and a reflux condenser fitted with a dehydration tube, was placed 60 g of acetic acid, and 473 g of polyethyleneimine with a weight ratio between the primary amine, secondary amine, and tertiary amine groups of 55:33:12, and a dehydration reaction was then permitted to proceed under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 10 hours at a temperature of 180 to 240\ufffd C. Following completion of the reaction, ion exchange water was added to the reaction products to yield solid matter which was 50% by weight N-acylated polyethyleneimine (A-II-2). Analysis of the N-acylated polyethyleneimine (A-II-2) revealed that 10% of the total cationic groups had been acylated., 107717=In a stainless steel flask equipped with a thermometer, a nitrogen gas inlet tube, a stirrer, and a reflux condenser fitted with a dehydration tube, was placed 60 g of acetic acid, and 473 g of polyethyleneimine with a weight ratio between the primary amine, secondary amine, and tertiary amine groups of 39:45:16, and a dehydration reaction was then permitted to proceed under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 10 hours at a temperature of 180 to 240\ufffd C. Following completion of the reaction, ion exchange water was added to the reaction products to yield solid matter which was 50% by weight N-acylated polyethyleneimine (A-II-1) Analysis of the N-acylated polyethyleneimine (A-II-1) revealed that 10% of the total cationic groups had been acylated., 31882=A fire extinguishing composition of the present invention must not only display the type of performance required of a foam type fire extinguishing composition with rapid fire extinguishing performance, flame resistance, and an ability to retain a layer of foam on the liquid surface of both non-water soluble hazardous materials and water soluble hazardous materials, namely fuel resistance, but must also satisfy certain basic properties of specific gravity, pour point, viscosity, hydrogen ion concentration, sedimentation, and corrosiveness and the like as stipulated in the national certification regulations, which are based on a ministerial ordinance (Ministry of Home Affairs Ordinance No. 26) brought into effect on Dec. 9, 1975 and defining the technical specifications relating to foam type fire extinguishing compositions. Consequently, in order to reach compatibility between fire extinguishing performance and basic performance, it is necessary to mix the main constituent of the fire extinguishing composition with a variety of other additives such as additional foam stabilizers, freezing point depressants, rust prevention agents, and pH regulators and the like., 93897=In those cases where a polybasic acid compound (C) is included in the fire extinguishing composition of the present invention, the mixing proportions of the cationic polyamine based high molecular weight compound (A) and the polybasic acid compound (C) should preferably be within a weight ratio range from 5:1 to 1:3, with ratios within a range from 4:1 to 1:1 being even more desirable.}",
