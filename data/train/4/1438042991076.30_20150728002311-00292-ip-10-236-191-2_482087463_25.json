    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{106429=Wax and Arlacel\ufffd were combined and heated to 65.6\ufffd C. 50 w/w % Vitamin C slurry was prepared by partially dissolving Vitamin C in water, followed by the addition of Silwett\ufffd L77 to help wet the Vitamin C undissolved particles. Since the premix was a slurry, constant agitation was required. When wax and Arlacel\ufffd reached 71.1\ufffd C., Vitamin C slurry was slowly added and agitated for 5 minutes. Neodol\ufffd 25-3 then was added and mixed for another 10 minutes, followed by adding petrolatum. Agitation was continued for additional 20 minutes. Once the system had reached 65.6\ufffd C., spraying commenced. Because these capsules were lighter than water, they floated to the top. Thus, the curing solution was filled up to the rim of collection beaker. As capsules were formed, the bath overflowed and carried the formed capsules to the second collection beaker. The overflow allowed for a new surface for collecting capsules. A make-up curing solution was constantly added to the bath to assist the overflow. The height between nozzle tip and curing bath was set in the range of 5 to 15 cm and the flow rate ranged from 0.95 to 1.5 liter/minute. The average capsule size was about 2500 \u03bcm., 34166=The preferred polymer is a triblock polymer of the Kraton\ufffd G type, in particular Kraton\ufffd G-1650. Kraton\ufffd G-1650 is an SEBS triblock copolymer which has a specific gravity of about 0.91, and is said to have a tensile strength of about 3.45 newton/m2 as measured by ASTM method D-412-tensile jaw tester separation speed 25.4 cm/min. The styrene to rubber content of Kraton\ufffd G-1650 is said by the manufacturer to be about 29:71, and the Brookfield viscosity is about 8 kg/(m)(sec)(toluene solution, at 25\ufffd C., 25% w). The Shore A hardness is about 75., 34734=For making the transparent capsules, preferably a mixture of Kraton\ufffd 1650 with Kraton\ufffd 1702 is employed, even though Kraton\ufffd 1650 is sufficient on its own. The mixture may be preferred in some cases, in order to increase the friability of the capsules, while preserving transparency., 50572=In one preferred embodiment, the emulsion/dispersion of the shell material and encapsulated ingredient is caused to flow (preferably, under pressure) to form a stream which is directed into the curing solution. The stream breaks up into capsules within the curing solution. The stream can be defined by temperature, velocity, width and distance from the upper surface of the curing solution. The size of the orifice through which the stream is directed and the pressure with which it is ejected will also affect the nature of the stream. In a preferred embodiment, the following operating parameters were found to produce encapsulated particles in the range of 200 \u03bcm to 2500 \u03bcm: emulsion temperature: 54-85\ufffd C.; vessel pressure: 0-1.05 kg/cm2, most preferably 0.3-0.6 kg/cm2; nozzle distance from curing solution: 2.5-20 cm, most preferably 17.5 cm; nozzle orifice diameter: 0.0125-0.25 cm; curing solution temperature: 0-50\ufffd C., 84855=The emulsion was first prepared in a beaker. Petrolatum was added and heated to 65.6\ufffd C., followed by the addition of cationic and allowed to fully melt. Sorbitol was then added slowly so as not to reduce bath temperature. The emulsion was subjected to constant mixing and heating. The curing solution was prepared and added to the crystallizing dish and kept at slow agitation. The dispenser's pipette tips were adjusted to approximately 5.1 cm from the surface of curing bath. After the dispenser was preheated, the emulsion was poured into it. Droplets were formed at a near constant rate from the pipette tips. Capsules sank to the bottom and remained spherical. With the naked eye, the capsules appeared to be within a very tight size distribution. The average capsule size was about 2800 to 3000 \u03bcm and the yield was about 110 capsules per tip per minute., 116712=The result was discrete, stable, round-shaped capsules, with an average size of about 1500 \u03bcm, which did not stick together when they came in contact with one another., 35037=In a second embodiment of the invention, the diblock co-polymer may be employed (having rigid-flexible blocks), even in the absence of a triblock or radial co-polymer. Kraton\ufffd 1702 is a diblock co-polymer (styrene-ethylene/propylene). The properties of Kraton\ufffd 1702 make it more suitable for use as a viscosity modifier in making the emulsion. According to the second embodiment of the invention, when using Kraton\ufffd 1702, in the absence of other copolymers, a hydrophobic solid is added, in order to form capsules. Kraton\ufffd 1650, on the other hand, forms a gel, when mixed with oil. When using the mixture of two Kraton polymers, the weight ratio of Kraton\ufffd 1650 to Kraton\ufffd 1702 is generally from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably from 3:1 to 7:1, most preferably from 2:1 to 5:1, and optimally from 1:1 to 4:1., 111153=Petrolatum, Arlacel\ufffd and Neodol\ufffd were mixed and heated to 65.6\ufffd C.; followed by a slow addition of sodium bicarbonate particles. The resulting mixture was allowed to mix for 1 hour. The pH value was measured before the production of capsules. The process described in Example 5 was used for this example. The capsules' size was between 1000 to 2000 \u03bcm. After 16 hours, only minor pH increase in the bath was observed and no further change in pH for the next 8 hours. The stable pH was the proof that the capsules were stable., 71579=2% Kraton\ufffd 1702 liquid gel was prepared by mixing 2 parts of Kraton\ufffd 1702 a 98 parts of mineral oil and heated to 76.7\ufffd C. until the mixture became isotropic. 35 parts of this prepared 2% Kraton\ufffd 1702 gel was mixed with 20 parts of Bowax\ufffd 800 at 60\ufffd C. and followed by mixing in 45 parts of 70% sorbitol aqueous solution to form an emulsion. This emulsion was used to form capsules in two different curing solutions: one (outside the scope of the invention) contained only water; the other (within the scope of the invention) contained 1% Silwet\ufffd L77 aqueous solution., 97451=The preparation was similar to Example 5. Petrolatum, wax and Arlacel\ufffd P135 were added together and heated to 68.3\ufffd C., followed by a slow addition of sorbitol/dye solution, while maintaining temperature at 68.3\ufffd C. After all the sorbitol had been added and well mixed, Neodol\ufffd 25-3 was added and allowed to mix for 45 minutes to ensure that it traveled to the emulsion interface. The temperature was then lowered to 62.8\ufffd C. The emulsion was then poured into the dispenser and capsules formed in the curing bath. The average capsule size was about 2500 \u03bcm. After 48 hours, the color of curing solution remained the same, indicating that the capsules were stable (no leakage of dye).}",
