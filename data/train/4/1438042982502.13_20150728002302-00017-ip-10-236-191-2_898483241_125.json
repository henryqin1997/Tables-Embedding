Am enjoying being here I love the atmosphere of this college all the teachers are very laid back and are there to teach the students who are willing to learn. I also really liked the fact that it is really easy to meet people there because the class are relatively small in size so it is very easy to talk and make friends with each other. Am learning a lot Although Tarrant County College is just a community college it offers classes that have a more rigorous course load like that of one in a major university. I am glad I came to this school before transferring out to a larger university because I feel more prepared and am ready for anything.
