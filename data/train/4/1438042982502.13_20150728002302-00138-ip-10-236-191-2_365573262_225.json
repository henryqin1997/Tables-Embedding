Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. The accept-register command prevents unauthorized sources from registering with the rendezvous point. If an unauthorized source sends a register message to the rendezvous point, the rendezvous point immediately sends back a register-stop message. Task ID Task ID Operations multicast read, write Examples The following example shows how to restrict the rendezvous point.
