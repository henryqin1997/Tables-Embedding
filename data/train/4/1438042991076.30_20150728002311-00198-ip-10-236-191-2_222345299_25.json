In 2011, he was signed by Pune where he played more games than he did for Bangalore. Owing to some impressive performances in the domestic circuit, Bhuvneshwar was handed a national call-up when he was included in India's T20I squad against Pakistan. It was a fruitful debut, as he picked 3 wickets in his maiden international outing. His career graph took a snake-head climb from there on, turning into a consistent wicket-taker in ODIs. In his first Test series, against Australia, Kumar's new ball exploits helped India to their first clean sweep in a four-match Test series., 29478=Mar 02 2013,, 63785=\u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2015.

Bhuvneshwar has been a consistent performer at the state level and also did well for his state's U19 side for two seasons, where he was preferred with the new ball ahead of either RP Singh or Praveen Kumar. Soon, he became a part of the UP senior side. He also came in handy with the bat, shedding himself off the \"tail-ender\" tag., 28585=Mar 14 2013,}",
