            "OVERSPEED PROTECTION APPARATUS FOR GAS TURBINE ENGINE - In an overspeed protection apparatus for a gas turbine engine having a turbine rotated by combustion gas injected from a combustion chamber to drive a compressor, a fuel shutoff valve to shut off fuel to be supplied to the engine and a controller controlling operation of the fuel shutoff valve based on a turbine rotational speed to protect the turbine from overspeed, an outlet pressure of the compressor is detected and compared with a threshold value when a shutoff command is outputted, and the fuel shutoff valve is determined to be failed when the detected pressure is not less than the threshold value, thereby enabling to promptly detect the fuel shutoff valve failure without additional installing sensor, thereby enhancing the reliability",
            "CONTROL APPARATUS FOR AEROPLANE GAS TURBINE ENGINE - An apparatus for controlling an aeroplane gas turbine engine has various sensors and devices for operating the engine, and two control channels each calculating a command value for controlling operation of the engine based on signals outputted from the sensors. In each of the control channels, it is determined whether any of the sensors and devices is abnormal based on the signals to determine a failure level of the control channel concerned with a numerical value. The failure level is compared with that of the other control channel and based thereon, the command value calculated by the control channel of smaller failure level is sent to the devices. With this, even when both control channels are failed, the engine control can be continued with taking the failure level into account."
