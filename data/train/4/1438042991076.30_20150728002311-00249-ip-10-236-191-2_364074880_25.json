If a preshared key is not configured for a configured TACACS+ server, a warning message is issued if a global key is not configured. If a TACACS+ server key is not configured, the global key (if configured) is used for that server. Before you configure TACACS+ server hosts, you should do the following: Enable TACACS+.
