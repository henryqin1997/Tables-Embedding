            "We have security round the clock all over campus. They get to know you and are very friendly. They are there as soon as you call because they are all around campus on bikes and carts.",
            "Greek life is big here. There are always greek events and greek unity going on here. The greek townhouses are all together so we can live amongst each other. Each greek organization supports the other.",
            "I am in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. Greek life is pretty big on campus. We also have the office of community service, getting involved with the community is big as well. Our student activities office has every organization you could ever think of and also has all the resources you would need to be a engaged student. Our international office connects students to countries over seas. It is amazing and sports is a big here VWC",
            "Great for students coming from small towns because it is a small environment. It is great to get away because it is near Virginia beach. Great for adventurous and outdoor students whom like to do interactive things.",
            "We have a lake on campus in the woods which is nice to visit. A tradition would be our reading/spa day. I do not know too many schools that give massages during finals weeks. It is nice and relaxing and during mid-terms and finals they bring a beat up car on campus and you can hit it to let out some frustration.",
            "I love VWC, I love being involved and the people are so warm and welcoming. My professors are great and I get a good education here. I love my living arrangements and the people here are fun. The basketball games are the highlight of the year, we have a really good team",
            "Get involved with student activities they are always throwing events and getting really good guests to attend the college. It is never a dull moment and the events on campus are always interactive, creative and entertaining. You get a lot of free shirts and goodies as well. RecX helps you stay active and healthy",
            "Food is good and the staff is great. They are very friendly and remind you of home. Lots of options and healthy ones. It is open three times a day.",
            "Dorm Life is co-ed. Boys on one floor, and girls on the other. It is safe because all dorm doors are locked by 12:00 AM so only the person living on that floor can enter. It is pretty laid back and equipped with all necessities. Apartments and houses are available on campus which is cool. Laundry is included.",
            "It is tedious work but one of the best Liberal Arts educations you will ever receive. You get a lot of one on one attention and the campus promotes high scholastic so it is easy to stay focused especially with the resources available.",
            "Register as soon as possible. Apply for scholarships. Look into afford.com payment plan as soon as possible. Stay in constant communication with the business office and student activities as well as career services. Create good and professional relationships with all of your professors, they are more than willing to be of assistance",
            "Virginia Wesleyan College is known for being the best School in the South East and it holds it's word in being just that. The school provides excellence one on one service with all students and associates of the college. The school encourages students to get involved on campus and in the community."

This year they won the conference championship and went the the NCAA tournament and made it to the sweet sixteen. Women's basketball made it to the ODAC championship. Softball, men's and women's lacrosse all made it very far in the conference tournament. Soccer made it to the NCAA tournament as well this year. It is always fun to watch the sports teams.

Rec-X is always hosting crazy fun events for students., 156779=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 94864=The school has a scenic campus, 13:1 Student-teacher ratio, and many resources to help students succeed here on campus. The professors are more than willing to help the students achieve academic success. You will love the campus and the positive atmosphere., 131767=I have been attending college since 2008, after my graduation from high school. I chose Virginia Wesleyan because of its education program and the ability to work full time as a Kindergarten teacher while attending classes. Unfortunately, at every step I have hit a road block, in the forms of unavailable classes, conflicting times, and astronomical prices., 100661=Dorm Life is co-ed.

Reviewer has been to campus. 10 out of 10 people found this review useful. 4 of 37 Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you want to be in the city without actually living in the city this is a great college for you. Tips for prospective students The teachers seemed nice and concerned about the students. If you have any questions anyone is willing to help find what you are looking for. Bang for the buck The scholarships from the school and financial aid alone covered most of the cost for the education. Will enjoy being here This is a small community in a big city with the beach only 5 minutes away!!! Will learn a lot",
