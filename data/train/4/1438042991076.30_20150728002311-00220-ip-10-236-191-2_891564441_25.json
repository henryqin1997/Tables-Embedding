    "textBeforeTable": "His prowess not only on the field but in the classroom, where he maintains a 4.2 GPA, has garnered early interest from the likes of Stanford, Duke, Oregon, Clemson, LSU, Virginia and several others. As Sharp's official numbers from the Nike Combine begin to circulate the college coaching ranks, it shouldn't be long before his first offer comes in. Sharp made his share of plays on the field this past fall for the Mountain Lions of Sierra Vista, toting the rock 247 times for 1,255 yards and eight touchdowns while playing through hamstring and knee injuries. The Sierra Vista standout's 40 time dropped from 4.87 a year ago to 4.55; his vertical increased from a respectable 30.6 inches last spring to a combine-best 41.2. While he slipped in the shuttle and \"only\" clocked a 4.44, it was apparent in watching the back that he has the explosiveness and speed to be a big-time playmaker at the next level. Sharp came to Phoenix no stranger to a Nike Combine, as he attended the same event the year before as a rising junior. It was evident however that he'd put in some work in the past year to improve his athleticism. The 5-9.5, 191 pound back left Phoenix with the top SPARQ Rating honor at 103.0, and showed the attributes that could make him a very coveted player. Mission accomplished.",
    "textAfterTable": "Note: The 40-yard dash and 20-yard shuttle at the Nike Combine in Phoenix were timed on outdoors on grass. The 40-yard dash was timed digitally with SPARQ Timing. Not all players chose to test and some had their marks scratched in individual events. For more information on the SPARQ Rating 2.0, checkout SPARQTraining.com!
