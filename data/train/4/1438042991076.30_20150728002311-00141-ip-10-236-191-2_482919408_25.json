In performing the burning treatment, the lithographic printing plate before the burning is preferably treated with a surface-conditioning solution described in JP-B-61-2518, JP-B-55-28062, JP-A-1-31859 and JP-A-61-159655., 172743=Since the anodizing treatment conditions vary depending on the electrolyte used, they cannot be indiscriminately specified. Ordinarily, however, the conditions are suitably such that the concentration of electrolyte is from 1 to 80% by mass, the liquid temperature is from 5 to 70\ufffd C., the current density is from 5 to 60 A/dm2, the voltage is from 1 to 100 V, and the electrolysis time is from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. The amount of the anodic oxide film formed is preferably 1.0 g/m2 or more in view of press life. After the anodizing treatment, the aluminum surface is subjected to a hydrophilization treatment, if desired. The hydrophilization treatment includes an alkali metal silicate (for example, aqueous sodium silicate solution) method described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,714,066, 3,181,461, 3,280,734 and 3,902,734. According to the method, the support is dipped or electrolyzed in an aqueous sodium silicate solution. Other examples include a method of treating the support with potassium fluorozirconate described in JP-B-36-22063 or with polyvinylphosphonic acid described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,276,868, 4,153,461 and 4,689,272., 30554=On the other hand, JP-A-9-96910 and JP-A-2004-219452, which is an improvement in JP-A-9-96910, each propose an automatic developing machine which measures the time interval of replenishment, determines the time lapse replenishment rate required within the time interval, regards the value obtained by subtracting the time lapse replenishment rate from the replenishment rate per one processing as processing replenishment rate to determine processing replenishment rate and time lapse replenishment rate and uses the electric conductivity calculated from the ratio of processing replenishment rate to time lapse replenishment rate thus determined to control the electric conductivity of developer. In accordance with this method, even with the change of the area and kind of the lithographic printing plate precursor to be processed and which the lithographic printing plate precursor is photosensitive only on one side thereof or on both sides thereof, the adequate electric conductivity of developer can be determined by estimating the ratio of processing replenishment rate to time lapse replenishment rate. In this method, however, the difference of required time lapse replenishment rate caused by the difference of developer fatigue with carbon dioxide gas (e.g., difference of developer temperature, presence or absence of liquid circulation) between during the operation of the automatic developing machine and during the suspension of the operation of the automatic developing machine cannot be detected, making it impossible to determine accurate ratio of processing replenishment rate to time lapse replenishment rate from time interval of replenishment across the suspension of the operation of the automatic developing machine. It is thus likely that some erroneous value of electric conductivity can be a reference value., 86443=In the polymerizable layer, the infrared light rays which have been absorbed by the infrared absorber are converted to heat by which the radical polymerization initiator such as onium is decomposed to generate radical. The radical-polymerizable compound is selected from the group consisting of compounds having terminal ethylenically unsaturated bond. The radical-polymerizable compound starts to undergo chain polymerization reaction with the radical generated so that it is cured. Examples of the infrared absorber (A) include the aforementioned photo-heat converting material to be incorporated in the aforementioned thermal positive-working heat-sensitive layer. In particular, specific examples of the cyanine dye include those disclosed in JP-A-2001-133969, [0017]-[0019]. Specific examples of the radical generator (B) include onium salts. Specific preferred examples of the onium salts employable herein include those disclosed in JP-A-2001-133969, [0030]-[0033]. The radical-polymerizable compound (C) can be selected from the group consisting of compounds having at least one, preferably two or more terminal ethylenically unsaturated bonds. As the binder polymer (D) there is preferably used a linear organic polymer. As such a linear organic polymer there is selected a linear organic polymer which can be dissolved in or swells with water or weak aqueous alkali. Particularly preferred among these linear organic polymers are (meth)acrylic resins having benzyl group or allyl group and carboxyl group in its side chain because they provide well-balanced film strength, sensitivity and developing properties. For the details of the radical-polymerizable compound (C) and the binder polymer (D), reference can be made to the above cited JP-A-2001-133969, [0036]-[0060]. As other additives, those (e.g., surface active agent for improving spreadability) disclosed in the above cited JP-A-2001-133969, [0061]-[0068], are preferably added., 161450=A representative example of the printing out agent is a combination of a compound (photo acid releaser) capable of releasing an acid with heating upon exposure with an organic dye capable of forming a salt.

The electrolytic solution used was an aqueous solution containing 10.5 g/liter of nitric acid (containing 5 g/liter of aluminum ion and 0.007% by mass of ammonium ion) and having solution temperature of 50\ufffd C. The electrochemical surface-roughening treatment was conducted using an alternating current source, which provides a trapezoidal rectangular wave alternating current where time (TP) for reaching the current to its peak from zero was 0.8 msec and duty ratio was 1:1, and using a carbon electrode as a counter electrode.

The photoinitiating system as disclosed in JP-A-2001-22079, [0021]-[0023], is preferred. Since the polymer binder to be incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition needs to not only act as a film-forming agent for photopolymerizable composition but also cause the photosensitive layer to be dissolved in the alkaline developer, an organic polymer that can be dissolved in or swell with an alkaline aqueous solution is used as the polymer binder. As such a polymer there can be used one disclosed in the above cited patent, [0036]-[0063].

During the development of a large number of sheets of exposed photosensitive lithographic printing plate precursor with a developer comprising an aqueous solution containing an electrolyte, a measured value of electric conductivity of the developer is used to determine the amounts of the time lapse replenisher/processing replenisher optimum for ambient conditions/processing conditions of each occasion. Replenishment is effected according to the time lapse replenishment rate/processing replenishment rate thus determined to keep the sensitivity of the developer stable. In this manner, despite the simple and inexpensive device configuration, the change of reference electric conductivity with the fluctuation of frequency of processing (ratio of processing replenishment rate to time lapse replenishment rate) can be corrected. Further, even when the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide gas varies or when different kinds of photosensitive materials are processed, the time lapse replenishment rate/processing replenishment rate can be automatically set close to values optimum for these conditions, making it possible to realize an automatic developing machine having a high sensitivity stability. Moreover, even when the electric conductivity sensor is out of order, the replenishment system can be switched to a substitute replenishment system, making it possible to continue the processing of",
