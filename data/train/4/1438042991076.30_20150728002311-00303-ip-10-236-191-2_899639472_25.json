So even if you aren't interested in attending this school after you graduate, using the courses offered here during high school really helps you look good to other colleges! Also, you get 50% off the normal price for classes you register for as high school dual enrollment (but no financial aid). This college is definitely good for students who want to stay close to home or commute. Also, admissions to this place is pretty easy- just get a 1000 (CR&M) and have a good GPA and you are pretty much guaranteed acceptance., 153289=Tuition is about 14,866 a year for in-state students as of 2015. There are some scholarships available on campus but not generally for first year students. Definitely apply to some external funding if you can find it. In recurring years you can fill out a scholarship application that the financial aid office emails out to see if you qualify for institutional scholarships., 149046=Penn State Berks offers a lot of opportunities on campus as far as clubs and organizations that students can join. This campus is very diverse and even if you feel that you are not diverse but you have interest in another culture or religion there are activities that those clubs offer and can attend. The class sizes are the best part because it is a 24:1 ratio and if you are struggling in a class you can go up to your professor and they can give you one on one help.}",

There are not that many distractions here as there will be at the main campus but you will still have fun. Instead of having about 50 or 60 people in you class, the classes are like a regular high school class with about 25 to 30 people in it. The teachers here are very determined to make their students succeed. If you like the one on one student teacher you will like this campus! Tips for prospective students WE ARE...Penn State! That is always are chant. Though we are not the main campus, we are still a Penn State Campus. It's a small fun campus that I think anyone would would enjoy. Though its small it makes up for it with all the different activities that they do. The campus is very beautiful and easy to get around.",
