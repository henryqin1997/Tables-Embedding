However, the Falcons had to settle for a 36-yard Bryant field goal with 7:49 to play., 71079=Dallas tacked on three more points when Bailey made a 32-yard field goal with 3:42 left. Ogletree's 65-yard catch on 3rd-and-20 made Bailey's field goal possible., 71786=Following a punt from each team, Atlanta took over at its own 12 with 1:03 to go. After White caught a 20-yard pass on third down, Tony Gonzalez hauled in passes of 12 and 15 yards. Bryant made a 46-yard field goal as time expired to make it 6-6 at the half.}",
