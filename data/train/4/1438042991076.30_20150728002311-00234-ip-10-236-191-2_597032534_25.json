            "1. Resolved kinematic corrections for aircraft position data using kinematic aircraft GPS and static ground GPS data. Software: Waypoint GPS v.8.10, Trimble Business Center v.2.6 2. Developed a smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) file that blends post-processed aircraft position with attitude data. Sensor head position and attitude were calculated throughout the survey. The SBET data were used extensively for laser point processing. Software: IPAS TC v.3.1 3. Calculated laser point position by associating SBET position to each laser point return time, scan angle, intensity, etc. Created raw laser point cloud data for the entire survey in *.las (ASPRS v. 1.2) format. Data were then converted to orthometric elevations (NAVD88) by applying a Geoid03 correction. Software: ALS Post Processing Software v.2.74 4. Imported raw laser points into manageable blocks (less than 500 MB) to perform manual relative accuracy calibration and filter for pits/birds. Ground points were then classified for individual flight lines (to be used for relative accuracy testing and calibration). Software: TerraScan v.12.004 5. Using ground classified points per each flight line, the relative accuracy was tested. Automated line-to-line calibrations were then performed for system attitude parameters (pitch, roll, heading), mirror flex (scale) and GPS/IMU drift. Calibrations were performed on ground classified points from paired flight lines. Every flight line was used for relative accuracy calibration. Software: TerraMatch v.12.001 6. Resulting data were classified as ground and non-ground points. Statistical absolute accuracy was assessed via direct comparisons of ground classified points to ground RTK survey data. Software: TerraScan v.12.004, TerraModeler v.12.002 7. Final version of data was checked for duplicate points using TerraScan software. No duplicate points were found. Software: TerraScan v.12.004, TerraModeler v.12.002 8. Bare Earth models were created as a triangulated surface and exported as ArcInfo ASCII grids at a 3?foot pixel resolution. Highest Hit models were created for any class at 3-foot grid spacing and exported as ArcInfo ASCII grids. Hydroflattened Bare Earth models were created as a triangulated surface with breaklines enforced and exported as ArcInfo ASCII grids at a 3?foot pixel resolution. Software: TerraScan v.12.004, ArcMap v. 10.0, TerraModeler v.12.002",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) downloaded topographic files in .LAZ format from PSLC's website. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in Washington State Plane South Zone 4602, NAD83 coordinates and were vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid03 model. The vertical units of the data were feet. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The topographic laz files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid03. 2. The topographic laz files were converted from a Projected Coordinate System (WA SP South) to a Geographic Coordinate system (NAD83). 3. The topographic laz files' vertical units were converted from feet to meters. 4. The topographic laz files' horizontal units were converted from feet to decimal degrees.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
