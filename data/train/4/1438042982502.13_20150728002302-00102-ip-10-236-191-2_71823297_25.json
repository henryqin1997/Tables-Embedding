Items before the -- are used by the command and removed from the stack. These items must be present on the stack before the command can properly execute. Items after the -- are left on the stack after the command completes execution, and are available for use by subsequent commands. The command .s non-destructively shows the entire stack contents. The command \".\" removes and displays the top stack value. A numeric stack is used for all numeric parameters. Typing any integer puts that value on top of the stack. (Previous values are pushed down.) The right-hand item in a set always indicates the topmost stack item. Use 10 .d to see which base is currently active. Switch to decimal with decimal, switch to hexadecimal with hex. Numeric I/O defaults to hexadecimal. Numeric Usage and Stack Comments Enter commands at the ok prompt.
