Most modern tri-band and quad-band mobile phones will be able to operate on these frequencies but please check your mobile phone specifications before travelling to ensure that you'll be able to use your phone in the Americas., 32141=This spectacular\u00a0valley is famed for it's natural beauty, abundant wildlife and rich, varied flora. This is the reason why Chong Kemin Natrional Park was founded in 1977., 216676=These trip notes were printed on 04/08/2015, 176468=United States. http://travel.state.gov/travel/travel_1744.html, 73150=The small historic town of Khiva in Uzbekistan was once the capital of Khwarezmia and the Khanate of Khiva, a central asian state that existed from the 1500's right through until 1924, when it was fully incorporated into the Soviet Union. The city's long history is fascinating and fortunately much of the magnificent architecture has been incredibly well preserved. The ancient walls that used to provide sanctuary for the travellers on the Silk Route are intact, as is the old town that the walls were built to protect. Many of the buildings are beautifully decorated in classic turquoise tiles. As well as exploring the streets of the old city, you should make sure you visit the Kukhna Ark & Juma Mosque, Pakhlovan Mahmus Mausoleum and Islam Hodja Madrassa., 138639=Please note that this trip spends time above 2800 metres/9200 feet where it is possible for travellers to experience some adverse effects on your health due to the altitude, potentially including Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) and High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)., 99281=Border information: exit Azerbaijan at\u00a0Balakan, enter Georgia at Ladodekhi.\u00a0, 139965=Please note that as of 2014 all medications containing\u00a0tramadol, codeine, temazepam, morphine, opiates or any containing similar constituent components\u00a0have been made illegal in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This includes many over-the-counter medicines that are commonly available elsewhere, such as Nurofen!, 79593=Ashgabat is a unique modern city that has been extensively rebuilt over the last ten years since the country gained independence. Little is left of the original Russian Imperial city as most of it was destroyed in a massive earthquake in 1948, today the centre is a unique mix of futuristic and outrageous public buildings that are an extraordinary sight. The earthquake affected every family in Ashgabat and is ingrained in the psyche of the local people. The Earthquake monument and museum are well worth a visit, as are the Carpet and the National Museums. If you are into carpets, Turkmenistan is the country to visit, and if you are in Turkmenistan, Ashgabat's Sunday Market is the place to buy them. This wonderful market stretches for hundreds of acres into the desert. Carpets, camels, clothes, pigs, jewellery, goats, cars, chickens, hats and ex soviet military paraphernalia are readily available., 132032=Istanbul is the only city in the world to straddle two continents, so it will come as no surpise that this vast metropolis has is home to a beguiling mix of different cultures and traditions, blending the influences of both east and west. The city has a rich and intriguing history, originally founded by Greek settlers over 2000 years ago, Istanbul originally went by the name of Byzantium, later renamed Constantinople by the Romans who made it the captial of their eastern empire. Today the city is the largest in Turkey, a bustling mega-city with a population of over 12 million people in total., 2159=Azerbaijan has an incredibly rich history as the country has suffered a multitude of invasions from north, south, east and west. It was a melting pot of different peoples and religions but became dominated by successive waves of Turkish (who came form Central Asia, not Turkey), Arabic and Persian invaders. The Islamic heritage is obvious and today it has a strong Muslim culture., 156286=Citizens of the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada and all EU countries will need a visa to enter Azerbaijan as a tourist for up to 90 days., 93576=Please note that we have built in significant time in the above itinerary to allow for delays with the Caspian ferry. If the ferry comes in earlier than this, we may choose to move on from Baku earlier than listed to allow more time exploring the rest of Azerbaijan and Georgia., 35152=Issyk-Kul Lake is one of the biggest natural water reservoirs in the world at 170kms long and 70km wide. Issyk-Kul means \"warm lake\" in the local language; a combination of extreme depth, thermal activity and mild salinity means the lake never freezes. On the shores of the lake is the small town of Cholpon Ata, a favourite holiday spot with the locals. The area has a number of health resorts and spas and there are also some interesting rock inscriptions dating back to 500BC close nearby - however most people come here for the beaches. These may not be the virgin, palm fringed beaches of other destinations, but they are unique in their own right and a great place for a spot of rest and relaxation in this land-locked mountain kingdom.}",
