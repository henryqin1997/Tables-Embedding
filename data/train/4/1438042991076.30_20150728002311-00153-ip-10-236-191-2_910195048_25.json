    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Any student who wants to save money and transfer to a four year College. Tips for prospective students Apply early, register for classes as soon as you can, and try to get good teachers. Bang for the buck Way cheaper then four year colleges by far and you find the exact same classes you would get at a four year school. Totally worth spending your first few years of college here. Am enjoying being here I am not too involved with extra stuff going on at the school. There is a wide array of people here though, so your bound to find people you will get along with which will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot There are some really good teachers here if you get the right one. If you go onto ratemyprofessor.com and look up the teachers it is really helpful in choosing a good one. Also, try to talk to the people around campus about which one's they like. I've learned a lot from some of the teachers here and barely anything from others,",
