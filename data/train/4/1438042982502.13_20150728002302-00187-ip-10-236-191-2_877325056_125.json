            "There's a huge mall near the downcity campus, they have awesome waterfire displays that are extremely beautiful. In campus there's alot to do as well like casino nights, movie nights, circus, sixflags trips, comedy nights, fireworks and much more. You won't regret your decision to come to Johnson and Wales!",
            "We have a couple of diners and eating places like harborview, snowden, city burger, red sauce, liberty market and starbucks. I personally can't get over the coffe in starbucks, i drink it everyday. The soups at red sauce are soooo good and snowden is my ultimate favorite place to go for breakfast. They omlettes and pancakes buffet style. Harborview has a make your own salad bar and stir fry with a burger station. It has really good food and the fries at city burger are to die for.",
            "It's really just awesome to live some what on your own, meet new people and take a small step into the real world where you have to do your own thing. I enjoy it alot sometimes it has its downfall when people make noise in the halls and you have to wake up early for class but its totally worth it. I get along with my room mates great and its definietly a one life changing experience, you should total go for.",
            "It's not a huge load of homework, only thing is that you must have good time management and not wait until the last minute to do your homework. If you ever need help with a class, project and or homework you can always go to the learning center where there's alot of tutors eager to help.",
            "Be confident and makes friends, do not wait until the last minute to study and do your homework because you will stress out. Be involved and on top of your stuff. Sign up for classes on time and don't forget to introduce yourself to professors on your first day of class.",
            "Johnson and Wales is an amazing school and I so happy I chose it. Im currently double majoring in culinary and baking pastry. Labs are extremely fun and working at the dining center on campus is such a great experience because I'm able to learn so much. People on campus are extremely nice and professors will go out of their way to help you as much as possible. There are absolutly so many opportunities to shine."

On my first lab seven girls lost items from their tool kits first day and during my 9th lab I forgot my binder one night and it was never found. I lost my expensive livescribe pen and all my notes including one my very expensive text books. I never got them back and was out a little over $1000 in items., 194082=Apply here if you want to go into Culinary arts (also Baking and Pastry) or Hospitality, any other major here is a waste of time. If you are going to Baking apply really early like September., 255742=Campus safety is a priority for Johnson and Wales and taken very seriously. The school being located directly in the city places emphases on the campus safety crew. Also placed around both the culinary and business campuses there are emergency buttons. These buttons light up neon blue during the night time, and have a speaker phone which activates when pressed to speak to an emergency representative. Another campus safety plus is that there is a JWU safety ride available week days and weekends. These rides are very helpfully when a student are stranded or need medical assistance, and the rides run all day to 4:00 am in the morning, 300264=Because we do not have a football team, we are passionate about our basketball team. Every year during October we celebrate something called Midnight Madness. This is where all the JWU sports teams can come out and show us what they are all about, with a central focus on the basketball team. We have dance competitions and wild prizes. It's sure to be a good time., 156466=This school is really beautiful. I visited the school twice and I can not wait to go there in september. I will surely enjoy attending here., 546096=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 112498=i went to visit this school in november 2011 and i really enjoyed the school and all the people that were there. they were very helpful in answering questions that i had., 362707=classes are 1:55 minutes 2 times a week and we never have class on fridays unless u choose to., 23200=enjoy it while it last, and APPLY TO BE A RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT. i couldn't tell anyone enough, also a big prepare tool that most people don't realize till its to late, WORRY ABOUT YOUR LOANS BEFORE THE LAST FEW MONTHS meaning if you start school in Sept. start to work on your loans in June, 439624=Johnson & Wales is a good school for everyone no matter what major you choose. Since I started attending here in 2012 I have grown to it, the schools makes you feel welcomed and accepted. The campus is also near everything so its great., 390520=It honestly is a hit or miss situation. People will steal things here, come into your room when you are sleeping at like 2:00 am, and will not care whether they are bothering you or not. The dorms are pretty small as well, and can get kind of dirty., 33912=go to the providence place mall, there is a ton of shopping there! there's also waterfire, which is fun to see in september with your new friends! also, i love going to thayer st. near brown university to go out to eat!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Dorm life is rather convenient with the majority of the freshman in one place as well as being very close to the class rooms, kitchens, one of the dinning halls and the recreation center. Last year all freshman we're allowed to have a car on campus too, for $50. But between the JWU bus system and free RI Public Transportation that may not be necessary. Fraternities and Sororities are mostly students from the downcity campus, being the business and hospitality majors, but you can still easily join if that interests you. Bang for the buck All depends on how much financial aid you're receiving, and there is a lot offered. There are three academic scholarships available, and their qualifications can be found on the JWU website. $2,500, $5,000, and $7,500 per year. The last one does require you to become a member of the Collegiate Honors Society, which costs about $50 per year and has volunteer service attached to it. There are also multiple scholarships based on club memberships and involvement, such is FBLA, DECA, and FCCLA. These do require you to join the National Student Organization, but will renew annually from there. There are no athletic scholarships, because it is a Division III school. There are a number of jobs you can get as a freshman, on and off campus. One example employer being Brown University,",
