    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39273=The total amount of the compound of the formula (I) used in the composition of the invention is preferably in the range 50-1500 mg per unit dose. In still a further preferred embodiment, the amount of the compound of the formula (I) used in the composition is 125-500 mg per unit dose., 48586=For the filling procedure it is required that the composition is in liquid form at the temperature of filling. Semisolid thermosoftening compositions are therefore filled above the liquifying, temperature. Soft gelatine capsules are manufactured and filled in one operation, and may be filled at temperatures of up to 40\ufffd C., whereas hard gelatine capsules may be filled at temperatures of up to 70\ufffd C. Hard gelatin capsules filled with compositions that remain liquid at storage temperature require sealing, e.g. by gelatin banding, to prevent leakage. The process of liquid filling of hard gelatin capsules and product requirements are e.g. described in W. J. Bowtle. Pharmaceutical Technology Europe, October 1998: V. M. Young, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Packaging Sourcer, March 1999: and E. T Coole. Pharmaceutical Technology International. September/October 1989. Using two piece capsules permits filling of more than one phase into a single capsule, which may be desired for bi- or multiphase drug release (W. J Bowtle et al., Int. J. Pharm. 141 (1996), pp 9-16). Several phases of solidifying material can be filled in single steps. The final phase may be liquid if required. The number of phases is only restricted by the capsule size, and volume of the single phases. This special feature may also allow controlled release or separation of different drug substances formulated in the same capsule. Additionally, capsules may be processed further. e.g. by enteric coating., 27192=The present application represents U.S. national stage of international application PCT/SE01/00466, which had an international filing date of Mar. 6, 2001, and which was published in English under PCT Article 21(2) on Sep. 13, 2001. The international application claims priority to Swedish application 0000774-0, filed on Mar. 8, 2000., 28399=Nitrogen oxide releasing NSAID compounds (in the following NO-releasing NSAIDs), have recently been found to have an improved side-effect profile, see e.g. WO 94/04484. WO 94/12463, WO 95/09831 and WO 95/30641., 40102=Examples of suitable poloxamers are Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F127\ufffd); Poloxamer 401 (Pluronic L121\ufffd); Poloxamer 237 (Pluronic F87\ufffd); Poloxamer 338 (Pluronic F138\ufffd); Poloxamer 331 (Pluronic L101\ufffd); Poloxamer 231 (Pluronic L81\ufffd); tetrafunctional polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer of ethylene diamine, known as Poloxamine 908 (Tetronic 908\ufffd); Poloxamine 1307 (Tetronic 1307\ufffd); Poloxamine 1107 polyoxyethylene polyoxybutylene block copolymer, known as Polyglycol BM45\ufffd. This list is only intended to serve as exemplification of surfactants that may be used in accordance with the present invention, and should not in any way be considered as exhaustive or as limiting the invention., 40964=The total amount of surfactant(s) in accordance with the invention may be within the range of from 12.5-6000 mg, preferably of from 100-500 mg. The ratio NO-releasing NSAID:surfactant may vary from 1:0.1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:0.3 to 1:3., 47666=In order to fill a two-piece capsule or a softgel capsule with a liquid, the formulation must be within a certain viscosity range, as determined by the manufacturer, at the filling temperature suitable for the process. For a two-piece capsule the maximum filling temperature is roughly 70\ufffd C. The viscosity of the formulation should normally be in the range 50-1000 cPoise (=0.05-1 Pas) at the temperature chosen for the filling process. For the filling of the formulation into softgel capsules, process temperature is not allowed to exceed 30-40\ufffd C. (the exact temperature depending on the manufacturer). The formulation must be liquid and have a viscosity that allows it to be pumpable at the filling temperature. In order to make the formulation liquid with an acceptable viscosity, several additives may be used, for example Cremophor EL\ufffd.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Blood samples (5 ml) were taken from the jugular vein into Vacutainer tubes containing heparin. Blood samples were taken before treatment (0) and at 15, 30 and 45 minutes; 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 7 and 24 hours after treatment. All visible signs of ill health and any behavioural changes were recorded daily. Any deviation from normal was recorded with respect to time of onset, duration and severity. Included in the daily health check were observations of the consistency of faeces. All animals were weighed on arrival and of the first day of of each treatment. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention, filled in a suitable unit dosage form according to the invention, was administered to each animal. The dose levels were approximately 15 \u03bcmol/kg body weight. 10 ml of tap water was given to facilitate the swallowing of the capsule or corresponding unit dosage. 6 male G\ufffdttingen SPF minipigs were used in the study. At the start of the acclimatization period, the animals were 4 months old and had a weight of from 7.7 to 10.1. kg. The animals were fasted for 12 hours before treatment and until the blood sample at 4 hours post treatment had been taken. A supply of autoclaved hay was given daily as well. Twice daily, the animals were offered domestic quality drinking water. A bioavailability study of formulations according to the present invention was performed",
