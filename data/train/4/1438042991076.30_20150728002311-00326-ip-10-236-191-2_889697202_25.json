            "Like every public school it is very safe. Iowa City is a good place, low crime, danger, etc.",
            "Has a lot of clubs and activities but that is normal for a large state school.",
            "Great for those looking into medecine or statistics; if considering engineering you should consider the other state school in Iowa, Iowa State University.",
            "I heard this is a party school which might appeal to some, but definitely puts me off.",
            "A joke in my high school calc class is that we have all the smart kids on the right side of the room going to ISU and all the struggling kids on the left going to University of Iowa. So from what I've heard looking at academics this school isn't that impressive."

From football games to Kinnick stadium to theater performances at Hancher auditorium, there is always something for students to do in their free time. The university sponsors many events every week that students may attend free of charge, which is wonderful because everyone knows that college students are not swimming in cash. For example, during Homecoming 2008, the University of Iowa brought in the band Rooney and Chuck Berry to play after the pep rally. Being able to see the old and the new of music for free before a major football game was an amazing experience, and I expect the University of Iowa to continue exciting events such as this in the future., 775443=The flood of 2008 did some damage to the Iowa Memorial Union, but it will be fully restored in 2015 with even more dining options and study spaces for students! Other dining options are available in the dorm halls. It's a little spendy (to be expected with on-campus dining), but the food is good and there are lots of options., 488904=I opted not to go to the dorms because I've heard there's a lot of drama/partying and also being packed like sardines doesn't really sound that appealing to me. Also, the Mayflower dorm floods everytime we have high water - so 1994, 2008 and 2013. Would not recommend living in that dorm - ever.}",

Outgoing, extroverted students will appreciate the large size of the school while more introverted students would love the attentiveness of the faculty. Jocks will love the fact that Iowa is a Big Ten university and theater buffs will adore the productions put on by the University of Iowa and the opportunity to participate in these productions. Tips for prospective students I would recommend future students to participate in extracurricular activities provided by the University of Iowa. They are a great way to get away from the books and allow you to take a break from all of the studying that is required at college. Bang for the buck The in-state tuition is one of the lowest",
