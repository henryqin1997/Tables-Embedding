Henry was born and raised in an orphanage in Charlton Street, Somers Town, London, NW1. At the age of 13 he had to leave the orphanage and make his own way in life. His first job was as a Municipal Road Sweeper in the market of Somers Town. Henry worked hard in the market and soon made many friends, he was particularly drawn to the Costermongers who were a tough breed of market traders. He got to know more about their way of life, their generosity and their fashion of smoke pearl buttons sewn on the piped seams of their trousers, jackets, waistcoats and caps. This showed their status as they worked the market stalls from day to day. The Costermongers were caring and looked after each other if they were sick or in need., 118451=Following Aethelred's death in 1016, his son Edmund Ironside was declared king. The Vikings however returned and again placed London under siege. Initially the city's defenders were able to hold back the invaders. However, Edmund was eventually forced to share power with Canute. When Edmund died Canute became the sole King of England. After two short lived Danish kings, (Harold Harefoot and Harthacanute) the Anglo-Saxon line was restored when Canute's stepson Edward the Confessor took up the throne in 1042., 171730=It is estimated that when he died in 1930 (aged 68), he had collected over \u00a35000. The equivalent in today's values would be approximately \u00a3200,000., 180560=Staying in London university accommodation\u00a0is a convenient and affordable way to stay in London.\u00a0 With\u00a0brand-new\u00a0rooms (completed in\u00a02008)\u00a0from \u00a340, it is a comfortable and cost effective alternative to staying in a hostel or a hotel. We currently\u00a0have\u00a0self-catered accommodation in\u00a0Victoria:\u00a0an extremely central location\u00a0and a perfect starting point from which to explore the city, being walking distance from both Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.Availability is mainly in the summer\u00a0vacation period (June, July, August, September), when students clear their rooms.\u00a0 Rooms typically become available two to three\u00a0months in advance, so please revisit the website within that period if nothing is available now., 119120=Following Edward's death, no clear heir was apparent, and his cousin, Duke William of Normandy, claimed the throne. The Royal Council, however, met in the city and elected the dead King's brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson (The Earl of Wessex) as King. He was crowned in Westminster Abbey. William, outraged by this, then sent an army to invade England. on 11th of October 1066 Harold marched his army out of London.At Hastings, on 15 October 1066, the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom ended and Norman England began. The Kingdoms were demolished and replaced by counties., 171936=His funeral was a spectacular affair, and was filmed by Pathe News. All of the Pearlies attended (roughly 400) and they followed the coffin to where Henry was buried. The charities that he had helped over the year all pulled together to help pay for a statue of Henry for his grave. Unfortunately in 1995 the statue was vandalised and no longer stands in the cemetery. It has been replaced with a headstone, inlaid with Henry's photograph, so it can be easily found by visitors., 366746=1951 & All That, 117331=It was during the reign of Aethelred that Viking raids began again, led by King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. London was attacked unsuccessfully in 994, but numerous raids followed. By 1013 London underwent a long siege and Aethelred fled abroad. King Sven died but his son Canute continued the attacks, and the following year overran the city.}",
