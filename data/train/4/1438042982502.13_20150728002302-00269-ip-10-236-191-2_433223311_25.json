    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7892=Studying home production in the context of labor supply has a long tradition that can be traced back to Becker (1965). In this seminal contribution, Becker established the notion that households can spend time in home production as an alternative to formal market labor supply, and therefore leisure is inaccurately measured by the time spent away from market work. Taking into account home production activities, Aguiar and Hurst (2007), drawing evidence from various time-use surveys, conclude that there has been a substantial increase in leisure time and rather stable market work hours between 1965 and 2003. In a related spirit, House, Laitner and Stolyarov (2008) document that the value of forgone home production can account for about 25 percent of women's market labor earnings., 10808=Using 1968 to 1986 data from a nationally representative longitudinal survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find significant but asymmetric responses of home production and leisure time to market hours constraints. The response varies with the type of constraint and worker marital status. Our results suggest that married household heads that cannot work as many hours as desired on average spend 25 more hours, or 10 percent, a year in general housework. These households also spend more time cooking at home, reducing the eating-out share of their total food expenditure by 0.5 percentage points, or 3 percent. They also tend to reduce vacation time by about 5 percent. On the other hand, we find that the married heads of household that cannot work as few hours as desired do not significantly adjust housework time, but they take slightly more vacation time than comparable unconstrained households. The responses are typically much more pronounced among unmarried workers. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which has more recent sample coverage, to redo the cooking time analysis, we obtain somewhat stronger results. Our findings are little changed with respect to a sequence of sensitivity and robustness tests. We argue that the asymmetry and heterogeneity we find are difficult to reconcile with standard household preference and home production technology. We subsequently posit several potential factors and directions that future research can pursue to address the asymmetry and heterogeneity documented here.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25376=The main data source for our analysis is the PSID. We also make some use of the HRS data to extend our analysis to more recent years. Both the PSID and the HRS are nationwide longitudinal household surveys conducted by the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan. In addition to employment, income and demographic variables, both surveys collect information about market hours constraints and home production. The PSID (for the relevant questions) and HRS cover different periods of time and focus on different cohorts of the population. The PSID data we use in this paper were collected annually from 1968 - 1986 and were not designed to follow a specific cohort. In contrast, the HRS data were collected every other year starting in 1992 for a sample of people mostly born in the 1930s., 28030=We use two metrics of time spent on home production. The direct measure is the household reported annual hours of housework, which the PSID collected for head and wife separately from 1969 to 1986.7 The indirect measure is the ratio between expenditures on eating out and total food expenditure, henceforth food-out ratio.8 The food-out ratio can be constructed for both the PSID and the HRS sample and for almost all waves.9 Therefore, we can use the HRS sample to corroborate the PSID results that were estimated using a sample that covered a somewhat earlier period. We can infer the changes of leisure time by netting out the changes of market and housework hours. Furthermore, for all waves the PSID asked household head and wife how many weeks of vacation they took in the previous year, which we shall use as an alternative measure of leisure consumption., 33739=As introduced earlier, the PSID has upside market hours constraints information for both head and wife between 1970 and 1975. It is interesting to observe that head and wife upside constraints are positively correlated, with the correlation coefficient equal to 0.1 and statistically significant (not shown in the table). We interpret this positive correlation as evidence suggesting that part of the upside constraints are driven by changes in household preferences, which affect both head and wife. The changes occurred on the employer's side typically affect only one member of the household unless both head and wife work for the same employer., 59176=Looking at the coefficients of the control variables, we notice that most of them can be rather tightly estimated with signs consistent with our prior beliefs. Specifically, we find white and better-educated households eat out more often, while families with more kids and adults eat out less. In addition, female single heads tend to eat out less than male. Finally, food-out ratio increases with income deciles and there was a very pronounced upward trend in this ratio during 1969-1986 (not shown in the table)., 26195=Table 1 summarizes relevant information collected by the PSID and the HRS. From 1968 to 1987 the PSID asked the following four questions regarding household heads:5, 62458=Redoing the above analysis using the HRS data from 1992 to 2006, we find even more pronounced effects of the upside constraints and no significant effects of the downside constraints (if any, they are in the direction inconsistent with model predictions). The HRS results, reported in table 7, are qualitatively very similar to the PSID results in the following aspects. First, the asymmetry between the effects of upside and downside constraints is preserved. Second, similar differentials between the married and unmarried households are preserved. Third, the variations between linear and Tobit regression results and between cross-section and longitudinal regression results are similar to those demonstrated in the PSID analysis. The only substantial distinction between the PSID and the HRS analysis is that the coefficient estimated using the HRS sample is larger than that estimated using the PSID sample, more so for the cross-section analysis and for the married households.20 Being able to largely reach the same conclusion using two independent nationwide household surveys that were collected from different cohorts of population and in different time strongly reassure the accuracy and robustness of the food-out ratio results. It also suggests that other empirical results acquired using the PSID sample enjoy strong applicability with respect to the more recent and contemporaneous time period., 31120=Table 2 presents summary statistics of the relevant variables in the two pooled cross-section samples. All income and expenditure variables are deflated using the 1982-1984 Consumer Price Index. We notice that in the PSID sample, upside constraints are binding much more frequently than the downside constraints. Nearly 20 percent of our sample observations reported that they were not able to increase work hours when they wanted to. However, fewer than 6 percent of the sample were not able to decrease hours when they wanted to. In contrast, the two constraints bind with about the same likelihood (10 percent) in the HRS data. We suspect that several factors contributed to this difference. First, older households on average have more assets that can be used to smooth consumption in an income disruption, weakening their demand for more work hours. Second, it is possible that older workers are more likely to be under a downside constraint because of health-related reasons. Indeed, after restricting the PSID sample to those older than 50, we have a lower percentage for upside constrained households, but a higher percentage for downside constrained households.13 Second, part of the remaining difference may be attributed to the structural and institutional changes in the labor markets because some of the HRS data were collected twenty years after the PSID data. Moreover, we also compute the share of households that had ever been constrained. For the PSID sample, 46 percent of sample households had been upside constrained, more than doubling the share of ever-downside-constrained households. About half of the sample households were never constrained during the period between 1967 and 1986. For the HRS sample, the corresponding fractions of ever-upside- and ever-downside-constrained household heads were 19.4 and 15.2, respectively. Of the heads in the HRS sample, 67.5 percent were never constrained from 1992 to 2006.14 All said, our data suggest that there had been a significant fraction of workers bound by market work hours constraints, calling for more research on household behavior and labor markets under binding constraints. In particular, it is possible that such widespread binding constraints can have considerable general equilibrium effects in labor markets., 26958=We count the head as being upside (downside) constrained if the head reported that he/she wanted to, but was not able to, work more (fewer) hours. Similar upside constraints questions were asked for wives between 1971 and 1976. The HRS asked essentially the same set of questions in all waves from 1992 to 2006. The distinction between the two surveys is that the PSID questions refer to the year prior to the survey, whereas the HRS questions refer to the time of the survey.6 One advantage of the HRS data is that in addition to this qualitative questions, this survey also asked the constrained households what their desired number of market work hours was, a question not asked by the PSID. Because the hours constraints questions in the PSID were discontinued after 1987, our analysis using the PSID data is confined to the episode before 1987 even though the housework information is at large available after that.}",
