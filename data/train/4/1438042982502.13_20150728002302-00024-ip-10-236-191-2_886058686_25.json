Bang for the buck The education here is great and you can really tell the teachers care for you. It is a little bit more expensive to attend here but the small classes are really worth it. The teachers learn your name really quickly and it creates an atmosphere that encourages participation in the class. Am enjoying being here There is always something to do at Aquinas; either going downtown or hanging our around the cafe. The clubs that are offered here are great and cover so many bases. I run cross country and track, and the teammates have become my family, and it was thanks to joining the club. It has a very relaxing atmosphere and I can't think of a better place to go to. Am learning a lot The teachers here are really focused on helping students learn and are always open to discuss any problems you have. Also, the classes are stimulating and very interesting. Classes are small and everyone knows each other in the class and this helps people be able to talk during class",
