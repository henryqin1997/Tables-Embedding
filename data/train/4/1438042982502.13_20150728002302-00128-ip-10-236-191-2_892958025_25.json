Faculty, staff, administration, and students don't know what day flunk day will be. All we know is that it happens in Spring term. It's super fun. We basically have a carnival on campus. Last year we had zip lining and laser tag. Really, it's just a day we get to run around campus, enjoying beautiful weather, and being a community. It's one of our oldest traditions, with the first official flunk day being on May 11, 1922. It's just super awesome., 164001=Knox College is a small, close-knit community that includes the most diverse group of 1400 people you will ever come across. Students are diverse not only in where they come from, but also diverse in their opinions, beliefs, and experiences. Knox does a wonderful job at celebrating and supporting these differences., 159327=Where to even begin! Flunk Day happens every spring term- it is an all school carnival where classes are cancelled all day long. The catch is that it is a total surprise- nobody knows when Flunk Day will happen, not even the professors! We also have Pumphandle every fall term, where all students, staff, and faculty line up outside and go down the line shaking everybody's hand. We also have a building, Old Main, that is the last standing site of the Lincoln-Douglas debates that took place in 1858., 180738=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who dislike busy work, prefer closeknit discussions over large classes and lectures, get along well in the slightly crazy crowd, like to have close relationships with their professors, enjoy a personalized course schedule with minimal classes required outside your major, and like not having to declare a major right away will feel right at home at Knox. Tips for prospective students Keep an open mind and try new things! I met all kinds of new and interesting people just by being social during my orientation week. When you decide which classes you're going to take in your first year, be open to new suggestions. Never taken an art class before? Try Drawing I. Want to try your hand at a short story you've always wanted to try? The Beginning Fiction Writing professors are top notch. I personally had never been a very physical person, but with the amazing gym available on campus, I've started working out more than ever. Also, if you do choose to attend, try to fill out the roommate application as thoroughly and completely as you can. I did so, and my roommate and I are best friends now. Your roommate can make or break your experience at Knox, and being fortunate like me can make all the difference. Don't forget to study in between all the fun, though. The class schedule gives a",
