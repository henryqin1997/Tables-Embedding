Comes with a new custom-made morocco backed solander box from top bookbinder Maltbys of Oxford. Supplied with Certificate of Authenticity. A highly sought after copy with the ultra-rare original first issue dustjacket with the original 6 shillings price to the front cover. The jacket is a remarkable survivor and this one is in exceptional, original and unrestored condition (although it has a removeable cellophane sleeve for protection and a solander box). The jacket is a little browned at the spine and has some slight loss to the corners and the ends of the spine, but is nevertheless in very good order. Some superficial slight splits developing along the joints of the jacket. The book underneath is, as you would expect, in superb and bright condition, with only minor shelfwear. Some mild foxing to edges and towards the front and back. (8), 302, (2) pages with tissueguard to frontispiece. An exceptional rarity and a must-have for the serious children's book collector. We can send images of this book on request.}",
