We already discussed how much an effect BABIP can have on a batting average, so maybe we should start there. For what it\u2019s worth, the MLB leader in BABIP in 2013 was Chris Johnson at .394, and the worst BABIP belonged to Darwin Barney at .222., 302030=The baseball pitcher is one of the few positions in all of team sports where a supreme talent can pretty much individually win a team a game.\u00a0 A great hitter can be pitched around or not pitched to at all.\u00a0 A quarterback is only as successful as his offensive line and defense allow him to be.\u00a0 A great scorer in basketball can be double-, triple-, or quadruple-teamed (e.g. the Stephen Curry defense in the 2009 NCAA Tournament) as necessary.\u00a0 Pitching is the only team sports endeavor where someone can complete a perfect game.\u00a0 The term doesn\u2019t even exist in other team sports.\u00a0 You can roll a perfect game at the bowling alley.\u00a0 You can play a Golden Set in tennis, but you can\u2019t score a perfect game in basketball.\u00a0 Even if you hit every shot you take, you could have always taken one more.\u00a0 The closest thing in other team sports to the influence a dominate pitcher has is a goalie in hockey, but a goalie can only post a shutout.\u00a0 Pitchers can post shutouts and not be perfect.\u00a0 I imagine the same is true for goalies.\u00a0 It is this unique aspect of pitching that makes it the most interesting position in all of sports to me., 153051=The next two constants are much easier to ascertain.\u00a0 In July, there were 26,244 balls thrown by starters and 1,328 walked batters.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 19.76 balls per walk, up from 19.36 balls per walk in June.\u00a0 This data would suggest that hitters were slightly less likely to walk in July than previously.\u00a0 The FIP subtotal for all pitches in July was 0.52.\u00a0 The MLB Run Average for July was 4.17, meaning our FIP constant for May is 3.65., 433842=June, 394072=NL Adjusted On-Base + Slugging Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 255420=For reference, the following table details the FIP for each pitch type in the month of May., 352941=Before we get to the results, let me go over my methodology. It\u2019s extremely simple, and you can probably guess how this is done. If you don\u2019t want the boring details, please skip ahead. The first step to these calculations was to keep all factors not included in the BABIP formula constant. Each player still hits the same number of home runs. Each player still walks at the same rate. Each player still strikes out the same amount. The only component that changes is hits that don\u2019t leave the yard (1B, 2B, 3B). I took the denominator of the BABIP equation for each player (AB-K-HR+SF) and multiplied it by the league-average BABIP (.297). This gives us the number of non-HR hits a player would have tallied if luck was removed. To get the number of singles, doubles, and triples each player hit, I took the ratio of Actual Hit Type/Actual Total non-HR and multiplied by expected non-HR. For example, Mike Trout hit 115 singles, 39 doubles, and 9 triples in 2013. That means that 70.6% of his non-HRs were singles, 23.9% were doubles, and 5.5% were triples. When adjusted for BABIP, we would expect Trout to hit roughly 129 non-HRs this past season. Multiplying 129 by the component percentages gives us roughly 91 singles, 31 doubles, and 7 triples. Everything else remains the same., 253559=First, let\u2019s discuss the strikeout constant.\u00a0 In May, there were 52,100 strikes thrown by starting pitchers.\u00a0 Of these 52,100 strikes, 5,005 were turned into hits and 15,110 outs were recorded.\u00a0 Of these 15,110 outs, 4,058 were converted via the strikeout, leaving us with 11,052 ball-in-play outs.\u00a0 11,052 ball-in-play strikes and 5,005 hits sum to 16,057 balls-in-play.\u00a0 Subtracting 16,057 balls-in-play from our original 52,100 strikes leaves us with 36,043 strikes to distribute over our 4,058 strikeouts.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 8.88 strikes per strikeout.\u00a0 This is up from 8.47 strikes per strikeout in March and April.\u00a0 Hitters were slightly harder to strikeout in May that the previous two months., 434232=June, 404983=1900-1910, 405532=1911-1920, 370286=2013 OPS (Adjusted), 101050=First, let\u2019s discuss the strikeout constant.\u00a0 In August, there were 52,238 strikes thrown by starting pitchers.\u00a0 Of these 52,238 strikes, 4,887 were turned into hits and 15,293 outs were recorded.\u00a0 Of these 15,293 outs, 4,118 were converted via the strikeout, leaving us with 11,175 ball-in-play outs.\u00a0 11,175 ball-in-play strikes and 4,887 hits sum to 16,062 balls-in-play.\u00a0 Subtracting 16,062 balls-in-play from our original 52,238 strikes leaves us with 36,176 strikes to distribute over our 4,118 strikeouts.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 8.78 strikes per strikeout.\u00a0 This is slightly lower than our from 8.82 strikes per strikeout in June and July, meaning batters were slightly easier to strikeout in August., 388674=AL Adjusted On-Base Percentage Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 356504=NL Adjusted Batting Average Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 443533=After reading Jeff Sullivan\u2019s piece entitled \u201cIdentifying Baseball\u2019s Most Unhittable Pitches, So Far\u201d on August 21, I found his methodology to be quite interesting.\u00a0 It was suggested in the comments rather than looking at whiff rate we should consider who has allowed the weakest contact.\u00a0 Now, there are a couple of different ways to look at weakest contact.\u00a0 First, you could look at batted ball velocity.\u00a0 You could also look at batted ball distance as well.\u00a0 Both of these techniques would provide some measure of the severity of contact allowed by a pitcher.\u00a0 At the end of the day though, a warning track fly ball is still as effective for a pitcher as a pop up.\u00a0 I thought it would be better to look at who got hurt the least with their pitches., 200429=by Stats All Folks - July 9, 2014 \u00b7 Comments, 69903=by Stats All Folks - July 11, 2015 \u00b7 Comments (1), 403601=Using the data Dave listed in his follow-up article that limits the player pool to either 5000 PA or 2000 IP, we get the following results:, 406629=1931-1940, 407727=1951-1960, 378025=2013 wRC+ (Adjusted), 99101=A couple months back, I introduced a new method of calculating pitch values using a FIP-based WAR methodology.\u00a0 That post details the basic framework of these calculations and\u00a0 can be found here .\u00a0 The May, June, and July updates can be found here,\u00a0 here, and here respectively.\u00a0 This post is simply the August 2014 update of the same data.\u00a0 What follows is predominantly data-heavy but should still provide useful talking points for discussion.\u00a0 Let\u2019s dive in and see what we can find.\u00a0 Please note that the same caveats apply as previous months.\u00a0 We\u2019re at the mercy of pitch classification.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure your favorite pitcher doesn\u2019t throw that pitch that has been rated as incredibly below average, but we have to go off of the data that is available.\u00a0 Also, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s PitchF/x leaderboards list only nine pitches (Four-Seam Fastball, Sinker, Cutter, Splitter, Curveball, Slider, Changeup, Screwball, and Knuckleball).\u00a0 Anything that may be classified outside of these categories is not included.\u00a0 Also, anything classified as a \u201cslow curve\u201d is not included in Baseball Prospectus\u2019s curveball data., 419819=To do this, I decided to turn to the old standby from every scout in baseball, the 20-80 scale.\u00a0 As you\u2019re probably well aware, the 20-80 scale attempts to rate a player\u2019s skills numerically.\u00a0 50 is average.\u00a0 60 represents exactly one standard deviation above average.\u00a0 30 represents exactly two standard deviations below average, and so on and so forth.\u00a0 By taking the weighted standard deviation of the data set, we can determine how many standard deviations above or below average a certain pitch is.\u00a0 Looking at the full season data, the weighted standard deviation for four-seam fastballs is 0.0262 adjTB/P.\u00a0 Another quick calculation tells us that A.J. Burnett rated as 0.13 standard deviations above average.\u00a0 Converting that on a 20-80 scale rating, Burnett\u2019s four-seam fastball gets a rating of 51.\u00a0 On quick glance, the 51 rating makes much more sense than 0.1767 adjTB/P, which helps solve one of our problems., 364179=NL Adjusted On-Base Percentage Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 409564=Dave also listed six players that he felt would surely get inducted in the coming years.\u00a0 That list included Greg Maddux, Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Mariano Rivera, Tom Glavine, and Craig Biggio.\u00a0 If we include those six with the two already elected from the era (Barry Larkin and Roberto Alomar), the Hall would only need to elect four more members from the era to reach the current lowest standard.\u00a0 I would think that John Smoltz has a pretty persuasive case for the Hall of Fame as well, being the only pitcher with 200 wins and 150 saves.\u00a0 Also, Smoltz is one of the 16 members of the 3000 Strikeout Club.\u00a0 That list includes 10 current Hall of Famers (all elected by BBWAA).\u00a0 The other members not currently inducted include Smoltz, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, Pedro Martinez, and Greg Maddux.\u00a0 Dave already included Johnson and Maddux on his list of \u201cshould be in\u201d Hall of Famers.\u00a0 Martinez was born in 1971, so he isn\u2019t included in this discussion.\u00a0 That leaves Smoltz, Schilling, and Clemens.\u00a0 Clemens\u2019 story doesn\u2019t need to be rehashed at this point, and Schilling received 38.8% of the vote on his first ballot last year.\u00a0 Also, simply looking at traditional stats, you have to think Frank Thomas has a strong case as well (521 HR, .301 BA)., 70186=Now that Chris Sale\u2019s historic strikeout streak has ended, it seems an appropriate time to marvel at the dominance Sale has shown. Over an eight-game stretch from May 23 through June 30, Sale had the following line:, 415150=Back in August, I posted an article entitled \u201cBaseball\u2019s Most Extreme Pitches from Starters, So Far\u201d that posited the idea of total bases per hit allowed.\u00a0 In other words, I wanted to look at who was getting hit the hardest.\u00a0 Now, it was rightly suggested in the comments that this wasn\u2019t the greatest way to determine a pitch\u2019s quality.\u00a0 For example, let\u2019s look at the following two extremely hypothetical examples.\u00a0 One pitcher throws his fastball exactly 100 times.\u00a0 In those 100 pitches, he throws 99 of them for strikes.\u00a0 On the 100th pitch, he gives up a home run.\u00a0 Now, by looking at TB/H, this pitch has a rating of 4.00, which is the worst possible rating.\u00a0 However, he only gave up 0.04 total bases per pitch, which is excellent.\u00a0 By comparison, the second pitcher throws exactly 100 fastballs as well.\u00a0 He gives up 100 singles.\u00a0 By TB/H, his fastball has a rating of 1.00, which is significantly better than the first pitcher.\u00a0 However, he gave up 1.00 total bases per pitch, which is awful.\u00a0 If a pitcher gave up a base runner each time he threw a pitch, he probably would cease throwing that pitch very quickly.\u00a0, 92287=I think a trend is developing. Chris Sale threw the most valuable slider in June as well. By rating, Sale finished fourth out of 129 qualifying sliders. The three pitchers above him in rating (Andrew Miller, Mark Lowe, Darren O\u2019Day) are all relievers. To sum up, in June, Chris Sale had three pitches make up over 90% of his pitch mix. All three of those pitches were the most valuable pitch in their respective pitch types in June. He had the overall best rated four-seam fastball and the best slider thrown by a starter. His changeup was the \u201cworst\u201d of his three pitches and was still a top 15 rated changeup. Chris Sale was completely dominant in June. His nearest competitor for most valuable pitcher in June only accumulated a little more than half of Sale\u2019s value. Who knows when we may see a pitcher in this much of a groove again? For curiosity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve included a table with the most valuable and highest rated of each pitch type for your perusal. The overall highest rated pitch was Andrew Miller\u2019s slider., 435511=August, 397859=NL Adjusted wRC+ Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 362625=2013 OBP (Adjusted), 310210=Using all of the starters pitches thrown in March and April tabulated by Baseball Prospectus, the league FIP subtotal calculates as 0.61.\u00a0 League average RA for March and April for starters was 4.29.\u00a0 For March and April, our FIP constant is 3.68., 373823=Most Positive On-Base + Slugging Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 371843=NL Adjusted On-Base + Slugging Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 396167=AL Adjusted wRC+ Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 358776=Most Positive Batting Average Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 404435=<1900, 251989=A few weeks back, I introduced a new method of calculating pitch values using a FIP-based WAR methodology.\u00a0 That post details the basic framework of these calculations and\u00a0 can be found here.\u00a0 This post is simply the May 2014 update of the same data.\u00a0 What follows is predominantly data-heavy but should still provide useful talking points for discussion.\u00a0 Let\u2019s dive in and see what we can find.\u00a0 Please note that the same caveats apply as last month.\u00a0 We\u2019re at the mercy of pitch classification.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure your favorite pitcher doesn\u2019t throw that pitch that has been rated as incredibly below average, but we have to go off of the data that is available.\u00a0 Also, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s PitchF/x leaderboards list only nine pitches (Four-Seam Fastball, Sinker, Cutter, Splitter, Curveball, Slider, Changeup, Screwball, and Knuckleball).\u00a0 Anything that may be classified outside of these categories is not included.\u00a0 Also, anything classified as a \u201cslow curve\u201d (here\u2019s looking at you, Yu) is not included in Baseball Prospectus\u2019s curveball data., 435069=July, 386719=NL Adjusted Batting Average Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 433402=May, 406081=1921-1930, 203259=The next two constants are much easier to ascertain.\u00a0 In June, there were 28,442 balls thrown by starters and 1,469 walked batters.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 19.36 balls per walk, up from 18.77 balls per walk in May.\u00a0 This data would suggest that hitters were slightly less likely to walk in June than previously.\u00a0 The FIP subtotal for all pitches in June was 0.57.\u00a0 The MLB Run Average for June was 4.16, meaning our FIP constant for May is 3.59., 101820=The next two constants are much easier to ascertain.\u00a0 In August, there were 28,957 balls thrown by starters and 1,521 walked batters.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 19.04 balls per walk, down from 19.76 balls per walk in August.\u00a0 This data would suggest that hitters were more likely to walk in August than previously.\u00a0 The FIP subtotal for all pitches in August was 0.48.\u00a0 The MLB Run Average for August was 4.12, meaning our FIP constant for\u00a0 is 3.65., 360505=Most Negative Batting Average Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 253247=Before we begin, we must first update the constants used in calculation for May.\u00a0 As a refresher, we need three different constants for calculation: strikes per strikeout, balls per walk, and a FIP constant to bring the values onto the right scale.\u00a0 We will tackle them each individually., 408277=1961-1970, 202502=First, let\u2019s discuss the strikeout constant.\u00a0 In June, there were 50,861 strikes thrown by starting pitchers.\u00a0 Of these 50,861 strikes, 4,837 were turned into hits and 14,888 outs were recorded.\u00a0 Of these 14,888 outs, 3,981 were converted via the strikeout, leaving us with 10,907 ball-in-play outs.\u00a0 10,907 ball-in-play strikes and 4,837 hits sum to 15,744 balls-in-play.\u00a0 Subtracting 15,744 balls-in-play from our original 50,861 strikes leaves us with 35,117 strikes to distribute over our 3,981 strikeouts.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 8.82 strikes per strikeout.\u00a0 This is down from 8.88 strikes per strikeout in May.\u00a0 Hitters were slightly easier to strikeout in June than they were in May., 402708=I\u2019m writing this as a response to Dave Cameron\u2019s two articles on December 19 and 20\u00a0concerning the Hall of Fame.\u00a0 While I completely understand the point Dave is/was trying to make in both pieces, I felt that his methodology was slightly flawed and perhaps deserved a fresh look.\u00a0 As mentioned multiple times in the comments section on both articles, the data he used included players that were elected via the Veterans Committee.\u00a0 Also included were players elected by the Negro Leagues Committee.\u00a0 The purpose of this post is to look at players elected strictly by the BBWAA.\u00a0 That list includes 112 inductees, the most recent of which being Barry Larkin., 359020=2013 Average (Actual), 411618=If we use the ~50 year average age of election though, anyone born in 1964 or after still \u201chas a decent chance\u201d at election.\u00a0 If we figure an even distribution of eligible players born each year between 1961-1970, that means 60% of eligible players, or 96, still can make a case.\u00a0 That becomes 90 if we take out Maddux, Glavine, Griffey, Rivera, Johnson, and Biggio.\u00a0 As I stated earlier, they only need to elect four more to\u00a0reach previously seen levels of induction.\u00a0 4/90 is only 4.4% needed.\u00a0 That list of 90 players also doesn\u2019t include still eligible players such as Don Mattingly, Roger Clemens, Edgar Martinez, Fred McGriff, and Mark McGwire., 432562=March-April, 366176=Most Positive On-Base Percentage Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 378089=2013 wRC+ (Actual), 155139=For reference, the following table details the FIP for each pitch type in the month of July., 74524=The fact that the White Sox were only 4-4 in those eight games speaks to how badly the White Sox have played during 2015. Of those eight starts, six occurred during the month of June. It is these starts I\u2019d like to focus on through the lens of pitch values relative to the rest of the league. I\u2019ve posted some previous work on pitch values. The framework for the calculations can be found here. I\u2019ve made some tweaks to the calculations, mainly to allow for player specific Balls/BB and Strikes/K to be calculated and league specific adjustments rather than MLB-wide constants., 413553=by Stats All Folks - October 8, 2013 \u00b7 Comments (7), 375551=Most Negative On-Base + Slugging Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 200808=A couple months back, I introduced a new method of calculating pitch values using a FIP-based WAR methodology.\u00a0 That post details the basic framework of these calculations and\u00a0 can be found here.\u00a0 The May update can be found here.\u00a0 This post is simply the June 2014 update of the same data.\u00a0 What follows is predominantly data-heavy but should still provide useful talking points for discussion.\u00a0 Let\u2019s dive in and see what we can find.\u00a0 Please note that the same caveats apply as previous months.\u00a0 We\u2019re at the mercy of pitch classification.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure your favorite pitcher doesn\u2019t throw that pitch that has been rated as incredibly below average, but we have to go off of the data that is available.\u00a0 Also, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s PitchF/x leaderboards list only nine pitches (Four-Seam Fastball, Sinker, Cutter, Splitter, Curveball, Slider, Changeup, Screwball, and Knuckleball).\u00a0 Anything that may be classified outside of these categories is not included.\u00a0 Also, anything classified as a \u201cslow curve\u201d is not included in Baseball Prospectus\u2019s curveball data., 150531=A couple months back, I introduced a new method of calculating pitch values using a FIP-based WAR methodology.\u00a0 That post details the basic framework of these calculations and\u00a0 can be found here .\u00a0 The May and June updates can be found here and here respectively.\u00a0 This post is simply the July 2014 update of the same data.\u00a0 What follows is predominantly data-heavy but should still provide useful talking points for discussion.\u00a0 Let\u2019s dive in and see what we can find.\u00a0 Please note that the same caveats apply as previous months.\u00a0 We\u2019re at the mercy of pitch classification.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure your favorite pitcher doesn\u2019t throw that pitch that has been rated as incredibly below average, but we have to go off of the data that is available.\u00a0 Also, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s PitchF/x leaderboards list only nine pitches (Four-Seam Fastball, Sinker, Cutter, Splitter, Curveball, Slider, Changeup, Screwball, and Knuckleball).\u00a0 Anything that may be classified outside of these categories is not included.\u00a0 Also, anything classified as a \u201cslow curve\u201d is not included in Baseball Prospectus\u2019s curveball data., 418576=According to Baseball Prospectus and their PITCHf/x leaderboards, A.J. Burnett threw 614 four-seam fastballs this regular season.\u00a0 On those 614 pitches, he allowed 10 singles, nine doubles, five home runs, and had 202 of those pitches called balls.\u00a0 Burnett allowed 58 total bases and 50.5 xBB.\u00a0 Doing some quick arithmetic, he allowed 0.1767 adjTB/P.\u00a0, 104144=For reference, the following table details the FIP for each pitch type in the month of August., 202188=Before we begin, we must first update the constants used in calculation for June.\u00a0 As a refresher, we need three different constants for calculation: strikes per strikeout, balls per walk, and a FIP constant to bring the values onto the right scale.\u00a0 We will tackle them each individually., 435906=August, 377857=AL Adjusted wRC+ Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 436745=September, 152354=First, let\u2019s discuss the strikeout constant.\u00a0 In July, there were 47,449 strikes thrown by starting pitchers.\u00a0 Of these 47,449 strikes, 4,585 were turned into hits and 13,750 outs were recorded.\u00a0 Of these 13,750 outs, 3,725 were converted via the strikeout, leaving us with 10,025 ball-in-play outs.\u00a0 10,025 ball-in-play strikes and 4,585 hits sum to 14,610 balls-in-play.\u00a0 Subtracting 14,610 balls-in-play from our original 47,449 strikes leaves us with 32,839 strikes to distribute over our 3,725 strikeouts.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 8.82 strikes per strikeout.\u00a0 This is exactly the same as our from 8.82 strikes per strikeout in June., 384669=Since we looked at the leaders in each category, let\u2019s look at those who failed to meet such lofty standards in 2013., 254330=The next two constants are much easier to ascertain.\u00a0 In May, there were 29,567 balls thrown by starters and 1,575 walked batters.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 18.77 balls per walk, up from 18.50 balls per walk in March and April.\u00a0 This data would suggest that hitters were slightly less likely to walk in May than previously.\u00a0 The FIP subtotal for all pitches in May was 0.75.\u00a0 The MLB Run Average for May was 4.32, meaning our FIP constant for May is 3.58., 367904=Most Negative On-Base Percentage Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 256723=As we can see, only two pitches would be classified as below average for the month of May: four-seam fastballs and changeups.\u00a0 Sinkers also came in right around league average.\u00a0 Pitchers that were able to stand out in these categories tended to have better overall months than pitchers who excelled at the other pitches.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s proceed to the data for the month of May., 233878=As we can see, Jordan Zimmermann takes the top for this month most due to the\u00a0 quality of his Four-Seam Fastball.\u00a0 Zimmermann was classified as throwing five different pitches in June (Four-Seam, Sinker, Curveball, Slider, and Changeup) and managed to earn at least 0.1 WAR from the Four-Seam, Curveball, and Slider.\u00a0 The most valuable pitch overall in June was Zimmermann\u2019s Four-Seam Fastball.\u00a0 The least valuable was R.A. Dickey\u2019s Knuckleball.\u00a0 As far as offspeed pitches, Garrett Richards\u2019s 0.4 WAR from his slider lead the way.\u00a0 The least valuable fastball was Dan Haren\u2019s sinker., 98713=by Stats All Folks - September 8, 2014 \u00b7 Comments, 349702=Well, there we have it.\u00a0 By valuing his pitches, Nathan Eovaldi was the most valuable pitcher in MLB in March and April, and Wandy Rodriguez was the least valuable.\u00a0 The most valuable pitch was Eovaldi\u2019s four-seam fastball.\u00a0 The most valuable offspeed pitch was Jose Fernandez\u2019s curveball. \u00a0 The least valuable pitch was Danny Salazar\u2019s slider.\u00a0 The least valuable fastball was Johnny Cueto\u2019s cutter., 433010=May, 305427=Once again, we can consult the PitchF/x leaderboards for this information, though not directly.\u00a0 Yes, the PitchF/x leaderboards provide a column for walks, but this is the number of walks that ended with a certain pitch.\u00a0 For our purposes, we\u2019ll need to calculate expected walks based on the frequency of called balls.\u00a0 Luckily, there\u2019s a column for called balls to help us out.\u00a0 Now, how should we proceed?\u00a0 Well, maybe since four balls equal one walk we should just divide this number by four.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t correct though because even the best pitchers will only through something like 70% strikes.\u00a0 In a 100 pitch outing, the divide by four methodology would yield 7.5 walks each game, which is only slightly ridiculous.\u00a0 Clearly, the number we are looking for is not four.\u00a0 According to FanGraphs, there were 28,172 balls thrown and 1,523 walks allowed by starting pitchers in March and April.\u00a0 That\u2019s a ratio of 18.50 balls per walk.\u00a0 Back to our 30% example, that equates to 1.6 walks per 100 pitches, which is much more realistic.\u00a0 For our purposes, one walk will be credited for each 18.50 balls thrown by a pitcher., 354951=2013 AVG (Adjusted), 309230=In order to estimate the number of innings pitched with a certain pitch, we must first determine the number of total pitches each pitcher threw per inning.\u00a0 By dividing the total number of pitches thrown by the total number of innings pitched, we are able to determine for each pitcher how many pitches were required on average to complete an inning.\u00a0 By dividing the number of each individual pitch thrown by this ratio, we can estimate the number of innings thrown using a certain pitch.\u00a0 For example, there were 77,465 total pitches thrown by starters in March and April.\u00a0 Dividing this by our 4,780.2 IP from earlier gives us an average value of 16.20 pitches per inning.\u00a0 If a pitcher had thrown his curveball 100 times, we would estimate he would have thrown 6.17 innings with his curveball.\u00a0 Rather than using the league average value, the Pitch/Inning ratio is calculated for each individual pitcher., 150186=by Stats All Folks -

December 21, 2013 \u00b7 Comments (1), 354772=AL Adjusted Batting Average Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 183004=As we can see, Cole Hamels takes the top for this month due to the\u00a0 strength of his overall repertoire.\u00a0 Hamels was classified as throwing five different pitches in July (Four-Seam, Sinker, Cutter, Curveball, and Changeup) and managed to earn at least 0.1 WAR from all five.\u00a0 The most valuable pitch overall in July was Ian Kennedy\u2019s Four-Seam Fastball.\u00a0 The least valuable was Drew Hutchison\u2019s Changeup.\u00a0 As far as offspeed pitches, Garrett Richards\u2019s 0.5 WAR from his slider lead the way.\u00a0 The least valuable fastball was Hector Noesi\u2019s cutter., 408835=If you combine all the data, you get 112 elected players out of 1068 \u201celigible\u201d players.\u00a0 That works out to 10.5% of the eligible population being inducted.\u00a0 If we remove the 1961-1970 births, it\u2019s 110 elected out of 908 eligible, or 12.1%.\u00a0 If we try and bring the 1961-1970 total up to the overall average, that would mean ~17 inductees.\u00a0 To reach pre-1961 levels, we need ~19 inductees.\u00a0 To reach the lowest percentage of induction, we need a total of ~12 inductees.\u00a0 To reach the highest percentage, we need a total of ~36 inductees.\u00a0 I think it is safe to assume that, with the scrutiny given by Hall voters to the Steroid Era, the possibility of 36 inductees is nearly zero., 75220=According to Brooks Baseball, Sale threw 694 pitches during the month of June with a pitch mix of 45% Four-seam Fastball, 25% Changeup, 22% Slider, and 8% Sinker. The sinker was clearly Sale\u2019s worst pitch in June. With the 55 sinkers thrown, Sale managed to give up six hits (11%). With the other 639 pitches, he gave up 21 hits (3%). So just how good were his other pitches? Chris Sale accumulated 2.9 WAR by my calculations over the month of June. He accumulated 0.0 of that from his sinker. For reference, here is the top ten in WAR from the month of June., 370349=2013 OPS (Actual), 381450=Most Positive wRC+ Changes \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 443147=by Stats All Folks - August 24, 2013 \u00b7 Comments (4), 205233=For reference, the following table details the FIP for each pitch type in the month of June., 251648=by Stats All Folks - June 5, 2014 \u00b7 Comments, 100734=Before we begin, we must first update the constants used in calculation for August.\u00a0 As a refresher, we need three different constants for calculation: strikes per strikeout, balls per walk, and a FIP constant to bring the values onto the right scale.\u00a0 We will tackle them each individually., 283720=As we can see, Felix Hernandez ascended to the throne for this month riding the overall quality of his entire repertoire.\u00a0 Hernandez was classified as throwing five different pitches in May (Four-Seam, Sinker, Curveball, Slider, and Changeup) and managed to earn at least 0.1 WAR in each category.\u00a0 His best two pitches were his Sinker (0.4 WAR) and Changeup (0.3 WAR).\u00a0 The most valuable pitch overall in May was the Four-Seam Fastball thrown by Phil Hughes.\u00a0 The least valuable was Marco Estrada\u2019s changeup.\u00a0 As far as offspeed pitches, R.A. Dickey\u2019s 0.6 WAR from his knuckleball lead the way.\u00a0 Excluding Dickey\u2019s knuckleball due to the sheer number of times it was thrown, the most valuable offspeed pitch was Jason Hammel\u2019s slider.\u00a0 The least valuable fastball was Edinson Volquez\u2019s sinker., 362443=AL Adjusted On-Base Percentage Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 206586=As we can see, only three pitches would be classified as below average for the month of June: splitters, changeups, and knuckleballs.\u00a0 Four-Seam Fastballs and Sinkers also came in right around league average.\u00a0 Pitchers that were able to stand out in these categories tended to have better overall months than pitchers who excelled at the other pitches.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s proceed to the data for the month of June., 407178=1941-1950, 355014=2013 AVG (Actual), 390412=NL Adjusted On-Base Percentage Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 419083=At first glance, I\u2019m sure your reaction is similar to my initial reaction.\u00a0 Okay, so what does that mean?\u00a0 On its face, a correct response may contain the words \u201cI\u2019m not really sure\u201d.\u00a0 If we look at the summation of each four-seam fastball thrown by starters this year, we find that the league allowed 0.1800 adjTB/P, so A.J. Burnett threw a slightly above average four-seam fastball this year.\u00a0 To come to that conclusion though, you\u2019d have to know both a player\u2019s rate and the league rate.\u00a0 We can present this information in a much nicer and easier to understand way.\u00a0, 352226=With that disclaimer out of the way, I began wondering who the best/worst hitters are in baseball if batted-ball luck didn\u2019t figure into the equation. We hear analysis frequently about Player X who\u2019s having a breakout year, and the refrain is consistently that he is having better luck on batted balls than he had been having in the past. For example, BABIP was one of the main reasons cited for how Chris Johnson batted .321 in 2013 after hitting .268 over the previous two seasons. Many people look for fantasy sleepers based on a much lower than normal BABIP. The effects of BABIP are undeniably real and have been well documented. If we take BABIP out of the equation though, who rises to the top?, 85894=Since WAR is a counting stat, there are two components to accumulating a high total. First, you have to throw a lot of the specified pitch type. Pitchers that threw 300 four-seam fastballs almost always accumulate more PV-WAR than those who only threw 30. Secondly, the pitch has to be of certain quality. Throwing 1000 of the world\u2019s worst four-seam fastballs isn\u2019t nearly as valuable as throwing 100 of the world\u2019s best four-seam fastballs. In June, nine pitchers threw more four-seam fastballs than Chris Sale. No one that threw at least 90 total four-seam fastballs threw a better four-seam fastball than Sale. In fact, Sale\u2019s four-seam fastball was the third highest rated qualifying pitch in June. To qualify, the pitch had to be thrown more than average for that pitch type. For example, if there were 4,000 curveballs thrown in June by 40 total pitchers, anyone who threw more than 100 curveballs would qualify. Moving on, Sale\u2019s second most used pitch was his changeup. Here\u2019s the table for changeups., 445091=Baseball Prospectus provides PitchF/X leaderboards for eight different pitch types: four-seam fastball, sinker, cutter, splitter, changeup, curveball, slider, and knuckleball.\u00a0 I chose to look at only starting pitchers in this study.\u00a0 Also, to be considered, a pitcher had to have thrown at least 200 of the pitch of interest.\u00a0 The league leaders in games started are just above 25.\u00a0 If we are conservative and estimate 80 pitches per start, that allows for 2000 pitches thrown, so 200 would represent roughly 10% of the pitcher\u2019s arsenal.\u00a0 With that background information now covered, let\u2019s look at the best and worst pitchers in each pitch type.\u00a0 All data is accurate through August 22., 370104=AL Adjusted On-Base + Slugging Leaders \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 392336=AL Adjusted On-Base + Slugging Laggards \u2013 2013 (min. 500 PA), 105499=As we can see, only two pitches would be classified as above average for the month of August: four-seam fastballs and screwballs.\u00a0 Sinkers, cutters, and sliders also came in right around league average.\u00a0 Pitchers that were able to stand out in other categories tended to have better overall months than pitchers who excelled at the these pitches.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s proceed to the data for the month of August., 351692=by Stats All Folks - January 20, 2014 \u00b7 Comments (6), 432161=March-April, 82779=We can split Sale\u2019s June into two separate pitchers, and both \u201cSales\u201d were top-ten in Pitch Value WAR accumulated. The Chris Sale that threw nothing but fastballs (Four-seam Fastballs and Sinkers) was the best pitcher in baseball in June. The Chris Sale without a fastball (Sliders and Changeups) was the ninth-best pitcher in baseball. With that said, we can dig a little deeper into the value of each of his pitches. First, let\u2019s look at Sale compared to other four-seam fastballs. The table below gives the top five most valuable four-seam fastballs as well as a pitch rating based on June data set to a 20-80 scale.}",
