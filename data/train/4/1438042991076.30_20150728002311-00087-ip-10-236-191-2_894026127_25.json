    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{242642=everyday from 11am - 1:30 is meal equiv time. (only if you have a meal plan!) meal equiv is when you can get food for free as long the total price is under $6.50. pretty cool and if you happen to get over (like the total price is $7.50) then you just pay the difference ($1)., 288884=Plenty of things to do here. At first I had heard that TCNJ was a commuter school not true there is always something to do and plenty of people around. I've only been home once since August and it now November., 84665=TCNJ has one main dining hall that's open for all three meals. The food isn't terrible (sometime's it's great!) and there are a lot of options, but it does get boring rather quickly. Sometimes the dining hall has theme nights which are actually pretty fun. Between 11AM and 1:30PM students can visit 3 or 4 different locations and use their points to buy lunch. Points can be spent at any time, but during these special lunch hours each student gets a free $7.50, and points aren't subtracted from their account. Our library has a cafe that serves Starbucks coffee. Personally, I wish we had a few more dining options - sometimes lines in the dining hall can be very long!, 281799=There is a new College Town that is currently being built on campus and should be ready by 2015. According to TCNJ's website, it will add 278,000 square feet of housing amenities, including approximately 195,000 square feet of living quarters with capacity to house 446 students., 124019=The food at TCNJ is relatively good. There are so many choices in Eickhoff, the main dining hall. You can get everything from Chinese food to comfort food. There are a few other options on campus for food if you do want to change it up a bit. The Rathskeller and the Lion's Den in the student center are awesome places to hang out and eat, but they will cost you points. However, from 11:00 to 1:30, TCNJ has meal equivalency, which means the first $6.50 of your meal is free. That usually makes everyone on campus happy because it gives us an opportunity to change it up., 103625=while it's not princeton, tcnj is still very serious about academics and is more selective than many other colleges. as such, you should be serious about your work in high school as well. i didn't realize how selective tcnj was until after i was accepted, and i was surprised to see that many of my classmates had been rejected. for reference, i was top 13% of my high school class with a 1990 sat along with many extracurricular activities and credentials (eagle scout, track captain, etc.). so definitely take your academics/extracurriculars seriously if you plan to apply., 158503=When it comes to academics, be prepared to put time and effort into your work. Take advantage of TCNJ's many on-campus resources, like the tutoring center and the career center. Apply for on-campus jobs as early as August, because positions fill quickly. Explore the many extracurriculars and volunteering opportunities that TCNJ has to offer; they will help you to meet new people and make the college feel like a second home., 301582=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 148683=Taking a picture with Roscoe the lion is sort of a tradition. The Student Center is called the stud. Meal Equiv is the time from 11 am to 1:30 pm where you can get a meal from the library cafe or the lions den up to 6.50 without using meal points (Basically, you're getting six dollars of food free)., 194121=The food could be better and it is repetitive. However, the meal plans are excellent. You get 250 credits points (1 point=$1) per semester but you have to use them all before the year ends. In addition, from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm, you get an extra 6 points to spend in somewhere else other than Eick., 42014=The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) has one of the most academically challenging curriculums in the state and country. The class size averages 22:1 and the professors are very knowledgeable. They will never teach you information from years ago because a majority of them have their own research which they conduct on campus and open up to their students so they can get hands-on experience from their sophomore year.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who like seeing people they know whenever they walk around, students who are interested in and willing to do the work to really learn, and students who want great education in an equally great environment Tips for prospective students Utilize the library. It is new and gorgeous, and a great place for getting work done. There are also computer labs in every building - I didn't realize this before, but now I always use the one in the Political Science building in between my classes. If you aren't sure what you want to do career-wise, visit the career counselor, he is very helpful. Finally, enjoy your freshman year. The friends you make on your floor often become your best friends. Bang for the buck TCNJ has a great reputation for being one of the best colleges for its relatively low price, especially if you are from in-state. They also offer many scholarships, so coming here can be very, very affordable. Am enjoying being here The College of New Jersey has one of the most beautiful campuses Ive ever seen, especially in the fall and spring. There are two big lakes, with plenty of benches",
