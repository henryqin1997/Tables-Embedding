The Sea Venture hit a storm on 24 July 1609 and was shipwrecked off of Bermuda. Hopkins and others on board survived and remained for over a year on Bermuda while building a new seaworthy boat that they could use to complete their trip to Jamestown. Soon after he arrived in Jamestown, the colony was evacuated back to England., 105583=Introduction: Mary Harrell-Sesniak is a genealogist, author and editor with a strong technology background. In this guest blog post\u2014just in time for Thanksgiving\u2014Mary searches old newspapers to trace ancestry all the way back to the Pilgrims, who crossed the Atlantic Ocean on board the Mayflower in 1620 for a fresh start in the New World., 100829=New England Palladium (Boston, Massachusetts), 25 December 1800, page 4, 17880=The Rev. Bailey Loring (1786-1860) was a descendant of John Alden, who was a crew member on the Mayflower and one of the original settlers of Plymouth Colony. Rev. Loring\u2019s mother was Alethea (Alden) Loring (1744-1820), and her great-grandfather was John Alden, who married Priscilla Mullins., 58160=Joseph Atwood Ordway (1852-1904) is a descendant of Mayflower passenger Thomas Rogers\u2014and he thought so much of that genealogical fact, it was included in his obituary., 105975=Although endlessly rewarding, it is true that tracing ancestry is a time-consuming process requiring much patience\u2014especially if one wishes to connect to the Mayflower passengers, those 102 Pilgrims who sailed from Leiden, Holland, in September 1620 bound for the New World\u2014anchoring off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in November 1620., 117838=Being such a small colony of settlers, the Mayflower Pilgrim\u2019s children intermarried. As reported in this 1821 newspaper article, John Alden was a descendant of his grandfather by the same name\u2014and also of Peregrine White, via his grandmother. He is thought to have married twice, first to Lydia Lazell and later to Rebecca Weston, although neither of his wives are mentioned in this obituary. Note how many of John Alden\u2019s descendants were living when he died at the ripe old age of 103., 97343=Plymouth Rock, a large boulder on the edge of Plymouth Harbor, Massachusetts, is traditionally identified as the place where the Pilgrims first stepped ashore from the Mayflower in 1620 to found Plymouth Colony., 115781=Although not my Mayflower ancestor, I\u2019m fascinated by Peregrine White. He was the son of William and Susanna White, who crossed the ocean on the Mayflower with his older brother Resolved. Susanna was pregnant with Peregrine during the Atlantic crossing, and he became the first Plymouth Colony baby of English ancestry when he was born on 20 November 1620 on board the Mayflower in Provincetown Harbor.

Credit: Pilgrim Hall Museum & Wikipedia., 48981=So in 1620 he left along with 130 +/- other passengers and crew on the Mayflower to make the 66-day trip to America. It is estimated that today there are as many as 30 million Americans who are Mayflower descendants, although most are unaware of their ancestral tie to the founding of the country., 117070=George Young\u2019s lineage was noted in this 1771 obituary., 59232=Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), 6 May 1904, page 12, 108573=Marriage certificate for future Mayflower passengers Isaac Allerton and Mary Norris, 1611, from the collection of Mary Harrell-Sesniak, 47952=Stephen Hopkins picked up critical skills and experience on that ill-fated 1609 voyage. He was one of the few Mayflower Pilgrims with experience at sea. He had survived a shipwreck, and knew what it took to be resourceful in extreme conditions in order to build a seaworthy ship to continue the voyage to America., 48291=Perhaps the most critical skill he learned in 1609-1610 was to speak multiple Native American languages. He gained invaluable experience in getting to know and work with Native Americans. This experience would be pivotal 10 years later when the Pilgrims worked with Squanto and the local Native Americans in Plymouth Colony., 71743=Photo: USS Plymouth Rock underway, 8 April 1963. Source: Wikipedia., 119089=Elder James White, who founded the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Battle Creek, Michigan, was another direct descendant of the Mayflower Pilgrims. His religious affiliation and his Mayflower ancestry were reported in this 1881 newspaper obituary., 90241=Daily News Record (Harrisonburg, Virginia), 3 October 2012, 90406=According to this obituary, not only was Mary-Jane a descendant of Thomas Rogers\u2014but \u201cShe published a book on Thomas Rogers, Mayflower Pilgrim, in 1980.\u201d, 88204=Having studied this for the past 50 years, I\u2019ve concluded that nearly all Americans with ancestral roots prior to 1820 that lived in upper New England (Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and probably Rhode Island) have at least one ancestor that came over on the Mayflower., 122403=We are in good company. By 1909, one writer\u2019s conservative estimate calculated that by the 10th generation, any of the Mayflower ship passengers could have had at least 3,500,000 descendants! Since most Mayflower descendants are now of the 13th, 14th, 15th or 16th generation, that number has skyrocketed., 122743=The rising number of Mayflower Pilgrim descendants is reported in this 1909 newspaper article., 119966=Kalamazoo Gazette (Kalamazoo, Michigan), 9 August 1881, page 1, 99856=Federal Observer (Portsmouth, New Hampshire), 4 January 1799, page 4, 121113=Jackson Citizen Patriot (Jackson, Michigan), 17 July 1915, page 1, 77237=You can read Jack\u2019s obituary in the Eagle Tribune (Lawrence, Massachusetts) 2 November 2011., 37343=I didn\u2019t realize that the Mayflower had such a difficult time when the Pilgrims crossed the Atlantic in 1620., 46911=Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly a vacation\u2014but Pilgrim Stephen Hopkins lived on the island of Bermuda for over a year, from 1609 to 1610., 76755=\u2026after their own house burned. John Howland died in 1674 and Elizabeth lived there until the house was sold in 1680 and Jabez Howland moved to Rhode Island.

In 2010 he was awarded the Lura Sellew Medal, the highest honor that the Pilgrim John Howland Society bestows for service to the organization and the memory of the pilgrim John Howland., 99980=GenealogyBank has many newspaper articles reporting on Plymouth Rock celebrations over the years, including the 1820 celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Pilgrims\u2019 landing., 28890=Omaha World Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), 21 May 1897, page 10, 78373=Eagle Tribune (Lawrence, Massachusetts), 2 November 2011, 116912=One of your relatives is their grandson George Young (1689-1771), son of their daughter Sarah White (1663-1755) and Thomas Young (1663-1732)., 38033=Boston Herald (Boston, Massachusetts), 25 November 1970, page 26, 19140=Boston Recorder (Boston, Massachusetts), 10 May 1860, page 75, 120361=For example, Ellen Gould Harmon was the spouse of Elder James White\u2014and her obituary from 1915 makes more notice of his roots than her own., 91713=Note: FamilySearch International (FamilySearch.org) and GenealogyBank yesterday announced an agreement to make over a billion records from historical obituaries searchable online.

Approved List of Mayflower Ship Passengers Common genealogical advice suggests that you start your family history research with yourself and work backwards to prove ancestry. However, with Mayflower genealogy research, you might want to work \u201cdown the research ladder,\u201d instead of up, as it could very well save you a few steps. However, as I say, you don\u2019t need to travel to research your Mayflower Pilgrim ancestry\u2014you can do it from the comfort of your own home, relying on your computer and the Internet, using several helpful websites and having access to online historical newspapers. Marriage certificate for future Mayflower passengers Isaac Allerton and Mary Norris, 1611, from the collection of Mary Harrell-Sesniak I traveled to Leiden, Holland, several years ago to conduct first-hand research on my Mayflower Pilgrim ancestry, and found this Dutch marriage record for future Mayflower ship passengers Isaac Allerton and Mary Norris from 1611. Tragically, only half the Plymouth Rock settlers survived their first winter in the New World\u2014and if any are your progenitors, you could conceivably be required",

As accepted references, these Society publications allow you to bypass submitting proofs for any Mayflower descendant they\u2019ve already established.

Newspaper Evidence for Peregrine (or Peregrin) White and His Descendants An extraordinary amount of newspaper articles and obituaries mentioning Mayflower ancestry exist in GenealogyBank\u2019s historical newspaper archives. Although not my Mayflower ancestor, I\u2019m fascinated by Peregrine White. He was the son of William and Susanna White, who crossed the ocean on the Mayflower with his older brother Resolved.
