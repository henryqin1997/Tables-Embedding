    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{92498=In the fall of 2013, Acer refreshed its business-oriented TravelMate-line with new models and announced the P6 Ultrabook. The newest member of the company's higher-end Travelmate P6-series (there are also series B, P2, P4, and X notebooks)\u00a0 comes with a 4th generation Intel ULV Haswell processor, a large SSD, docking station support, and a business-tailored array of security features. At last count, Acer's website offers 15 models within the P6 series, ranging from a 13.3-inch model with an i3 processor to a 15.6-inch version with a quad-core i7 CPU. There are three versions of the Ultrabook with i5 or i7 processors, 4-8 \u00a0GB of RAM, and either a 120 or 256 GB SSD. The lowest version with i5-4200U, 4 GB of RAM, 120 GB SSD, integrated GPU, and 1366 x 768 pixel resolution screen has an MSRP of $950., 68923=The black value of 0.54 nits and the corresponding contrast ratio of 508:1 are good for a non-glare display panel. Aside from the issue with the backlight spill, blacks are rendered sufficiently dark and the occasional movie is going to be a decent enough experience. The matte Full-HD panel of the E7740 has a superior contrast ratio of around 870:1; the display of the T440s tops out at a pretty medicre 240:1., 57244=At the time of writing, Acer offers the Ultrabook with either a\u00a0Haswell i5-4200U, i5-4300U, or i7-4500U\u00a0ULV dual-core processors. Our review model is equipped with the latter CPU, 8 GB PC3-12800 DDR3 SDRAM, dedicated\u00a0Radeon HD 8750M,\u00a0and a 256 GB SSD. 4 GB of RAM are soldered onto the motherboard, while the additional slot contains another 4 GB module. The least expensive version with the i5-4200U ships with 4 GB of RAM instead. This model also only has 120 GB SSD, a display with HD+ resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), and, just like the model with the i5-4300U, does not contain a dedicated graphics card., 90351=Considering the hardware, the current street price of $1250 also seems quite fair, given that a Lenovo ThinkPad T440s Ultrabook with 256 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM is closer to $1600 - and that's without a dedicated graphics card. Same is true for the Dell E7440 Ultrabook, which also doesn't come with a dedicated GPU and costs north of $1800 with a Full-HD touchscreen and 4th-generation i5 CPU. From a price/performance standpoint, the Acer definitely has a leg up on the competition. But how does the lesser-known business machine fare compared to the well-known brands?, 74253=The 14-inch panel is supplied by\u00a0AUO113D (type B140HAN01.1) and supports Full-HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels. The ThinkPad T440s has 1600 x 900 pixels; the Latitude is offered with either 1366 x 768 pixels or two different Full-HD resolutions both touch and non-touch. Since the P645 does not come with a touchscreen, the panel lacks the glossy properties usually associated with this display type. The good news is that reflections are simply not an issue. Text is also very sharp and even very small fonts are easy to read., 4341=The system performance is, thanks to the fast SSD and dual-channel RAM,\u00a0very snappy\u00a0as the the PCMark 7 score of 4985 points also shows. The ThinkPad S440 with the same CPU and a Radeon HD 8670M offers nearly the same performance (4883 points). The T440S with the i5-4200U processor ships with a standard hard drive and scores 2287 points, which is a performance reduction of more than 50 %., 87695=The Ultrabook measures a scant 327.7 x\u00a0\u00a0236.2 x\u00a020.3 mm, which is about 10 mm less wide than the Dell Latitude 14 and more in line with 13.3-inch notebooks. A quick check reveals that the bezel to the left and right of the screen is indeed exceptionally thin at only about 8 mm. The weight of 1570 grams is comparable to the ThinkPad T440S; the Latitude E7440 is a tad heavier at 1630 grams. Overall, the notebook is easy to handle and fits into most carrying bags with ease.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129349=The Acer TP645 Ultrabook utilizes two graphics cards. The HD 4400 integrated into the\u00a0i7-4500U\u00a0is used for task requiring low performance like browsing or word processing, but when 3D power is required,\u00a0the switchable graphics activates the dedicated middle-class\u00a0Radeon HD 8750M\u00a0instead. The\u00a0DirectX 11.1-capable GPU is based on the 28nm GCN architecture, features a clock speed of 670 up to 870 MHz, comes with 384 shader cores, and addresses 2 GB of dedicated RAM. The 3DMark 11 score of almost 1800 points is neck-on-neck with Nvida's GT 730M Lenovo uses for the\u00a0T440p., 167857=Although this is a business Ultrabook, the TP645 can handle the occasional gaming sessions quite well. Many games run without issues as long as the setting are kept on low to medium quality. BioShock Infinite, for example, will run without any stutters at 1366 x 768 pixels (HD+) and the settings on medium (37 fps) or high (31 fps). Full-HD resolution with ultra-high quality is out of the question, however, as the frame rate drops to an unplayable 11 fps.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Games like Fifa 14 are of course playable with the integrated graphics as well: during our test, the HD 4400 managed framerates of 42 fps even with Full-HD resolution and the settings turned up to ultra-high. The dedicated GPU was able to maintain 78 fps using the same settings. Although the the target audience might not care too much about gaming performance, the Ultrabook acts much more like a multimedia notebook in this regard and clearly outperforms its competitors with integrated graphics only.

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise At idle, the system remains more or less inaudible at below 29 dB. Under load, the noise increases as expected to between 34 and 38 dB\u00a0depending on the task. During peak load scenarios, the Ultrabook topped out at 44 dB. Rivals like the Lenovo ThinkPad T440s Ultrabook\u00a0or the\u00a0Dell E7440 Ultrabook\u00a0are not quite as noisy at 40 dB and 35 dB, respectively, although it's important to keep in mind that neither system is equipped with a dedicated graphics card. Although 44 dB is still acceptable, the behavior of the fan might be more of an issue: during our stress test, the system fan switched between the highest and the next lowest setting every few seconds, which can get quite annoying after a while. Fortunately, this is not going to occur during normal usage scenarios. Noise Level Idle 28.7 / 28.8 / 28.9 dB(A)",
