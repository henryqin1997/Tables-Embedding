It's also nice for people who like to sleep a lot, since, unlike large campuses, LVC is about a 3 minute walk to any class. So in case you like to sleep in until 7:55 on a morning when you have an 8:00 class, you can still make it! Also, LVC has a variety of great food choices, so if you like to eat, this is the school for you!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The college is a bit pricey compared to many in-state schools, but compared to most private colleges, LVC gives great scholarships. If you are in the top 10% of your class, you receive half off of your tuition! Even then, those who graduate in the top 20% receive one-third off of tuition, and those in the top 30% receive one-fourth off of tuition! The education, again, is just awesome. I have learned so much in just one semester that most of my friends going to public universities have not in the same courses! Am enjoying being here I was truly nervous before I came to this school, but now I never want to leave! I was definitely unsure if I'd like my roommate, but she is so awesome! It's great because they actually give thought to the students they put to live together at this college, unlike large universities where it is random. All the people on my floor are my best friends now, we have bonded greatly! There is always something to do on campus too, whether it be a comedian on Fridays, a band playing at MJ's, fun fitness classes, or something else the college has planned, everybody always has a blast! At LVC, they have a Redbook where you can sign up for weekend events such as Hershey",
