The share of deposits (solid dark line) is the unweighted average share of deposits held in Multi-State banks (MSBs) in 47 states (excludes Delaware, Hawaii, and South Dakota) and the District of Columbia. An MSB is an institution with subsidiaries in at least two different states. Before 1994 information on the level of deposits is from the Call Reports, and after this year, from the FDIC's Summary of Deposits (solid light line). The two additional measures, the share of assets (discontinuous line) and of Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loans (dotted line) are constructed in the same way using Call Report information. Three vertical lines denote benchmarks in the process of bank integration: the first state to pass a law allowing out-of-state banks to acquire banks within its borders if the state of the acquiring bank reciprocates (Maine), the first states to reciprocate (Alaska and New York), and the year the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act was passed., 12873=The Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company act of 1956 prohibited Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) from establishing or purchasing bank subsidiaries across state lines unless the state of the target bank authorized the transaction. These restrictions remained until Maine passed a law allowing out-of-state BHCs to purchase local banks if the \"home\" state of the BHC reciprocated. No state followed Maine's lead in opening their financial sector to out-of-state banks until 1982 when Alaska and New York passed similar laws. The same year, as part of the Garn-St Germain Act, federal legislators amended the Bank Holding Company Act to allow failed banks to be acquired by any BHC, regardless of origin and state laws. This regulatory change, coupled with a series of bank and thrift failures during the 1980s, triggered a wave of interstate agreements that effectively permitted banking at the national level., 74605=Demyanyk, Yuliya, Charlotte Ostergaard, and Bent E.

The dependent variable is the spread between the firms' short-term borrowing interest rate and the prime rate in the period between 1976 and 1994.35 There are two sample selection criteria for these estimations. First, I include firms with at least two non-missing (and non-zero) interest rate observations before and after interstate entry deregulation. Second, all firm-year observations with interest rates and loan values equaling zero are omitted from the sample. These restrictions help isolate the effect of bank integration on bank-dependent firms' external financing costs. I track the spreads charged to the same group of firms before and after deregulation. Formally, the specification used to test the effect of bank integration on firm financing costs is the following:, 72624=Berger, Allen N., and Gregory F.

The first restrictions lifted were those that limited intrastate branching. By 1974, 13 states had already allowed unrestricted branching within their borders. In the next two decades, 35 more states eliminated partially or all restrictions on intrastate branching. Differences in states' willingness to allow branch networks sustained the development of very diverse bank systems across states, where some of them allowed only unit banking while other states permitted statewide branching., 79665=Opler, Tim, Lee Pinkowitz, Ren\u00e9 Stulz, and Rohan Williamson, 1999, The determinants and implications of corporate cash holdings, Journal of Financial Economics 52, 3-46., 289092=11.\u00a0\u00a0The criticism on theoretical grounds can be found in Alti (2003), Cooper and Ejarque (2001), Gomes (2001), Kaplan and Zingales (1997, 2000), and Moyen (1994).

A minimum coverage of four years of data is set for each firm due to the loss of observations implicit in the estimation procedure. Furthermore, a firm is required to have at least 2 years of data before and after an interstate agreement is signed by its \"home\" state.22 However, it is necessary to delete more firms due to possible outliers in the sample explained by acquisitions, revaluation of assets, or problems with the data. The result of this process is an unbalanced panel of firms for the period between 1976 and 1994.

Suarez, 2008, Firm volatility and banks: Evidence from U.S. banking deregulation, Working Paper, Federal Reserve Board., 33851=Bank integration during the 1970s and 1980s is measured using four different proxies. The first measure is an indicator variable equaling one when a state passed an interstate banking agreement with other states, and zero otherwise. Table I reports the dates when these agreements were enacted in each state.15 Maine passed the first interstate agreement in 1978 followed by Alaska and New York in 1982. On aggregate, 18 agreements were approved before 1985, 26 between 1986 and 1990, and 4 more before the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act passed in 1994.16, 34571=In addition to the indicator variable, there are three measures computed using commercial banks' balance sheet items. These integration measures are the share of deposits, commercial and industrial loans (C&I), and assets controlled by MSBs in each state. An MSB is defined as a bank with holdings in more than one state. For the period between 1976 and 1994, financial data is taken from the quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Reserve System., 78076=Kaplan, Steven, and Luigi Zingales, 2000, Investment-cash flow sensitivities are not valid measures of financing constraints, Quarterly Journal of Economics 115, 707-712., 35629=Table I shows the average share of deposits in MSBs by state before and after 1982. Most states have very small MSB penetration prior to this year. Some exceptions are found in western and midwestern states, explained by grandfathered agreements prior to the passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which explicitly prohibited interstate banking. The mean of the share of deposits held in MSBs increased from 9% before 1982 to 41% after out-of-state bank entry was deregulated in 1982., 296890=34.\u00a0\u00a0This variable is data item #105, and is widely populated in Compustat between 1977 and 1993.

Intg is a dummy variable equal to one if the state passed a law allowing interstate banking. Bank Dependence is proxied by the firms' access to public debt markets and the firms' size. Public debt is an indicator variable equaling one if a firm did not have any commercial paper or bond issues (or ratings) between 1970 and 1994, and had average positive total debt holdings in this period. Small and Large are dummy variables equal to one if the value of the firm's lagged real assets is located in the bottom tercile or top tercile, respectively. are additional firm controls including the lagged log of real assets and EBITDA and tangible assets divided by total assets. includes the log of the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI) for bank deposits at the state level and the growth in real per capita income.

Additionally, Petersen and Rajan (1994, 1995) find that small firms rely more on bank debt compared to larger firms. The model of corporate choice between public and private debt in the context of information asymmetries is covered by Diamond (1989, 1991) and Rajan (1992).\u00a0Return to text, 76113=Hansen, Lars Peter, 1982, Large sample properties of generalized method of moments estimators, Econometrica 50, 1029-1054., 291946=19.\u00a0\u00a0The earliest year for which I have location information comes after the first bank entry deregulation agreement was implemented (1982).

In column (3) and (4), Intg is the share of deposits in Multi-State banks (MSBs) by state and year. An MSB is an institution with subsidiaries in at least two different states. Firms included in the estimation of columns (1) and (3) did not have any commercial paper or bond issues (or ratings) between 1970 and 1994, and had average positive total debt holdings in this period. The complement of this group is included in the estimations of columns (2) and (4). Lags 3 and 4 of endogenous and predetermined variables and industry dummies (2-digit SIC) are used as instruments. Hansen test is the p-value of the J-statistic for over-identifying restrictions (distributed chi-square). The AR 1 (2) test shows the p-value from Arellano and Bond's (1991) first (second) order autocorrelation test.

Rajan, 1995, The effects of credit market competition on lending relationships, Quarterly Journal of Economics 110, 407-443., 48393=Table VI reports results for firms divided by size. Firms are defined as bank-dependent if their assets (in 1995 U.S. dollars) are below the sample median in the state where they are headquartered, or if their assets are in the bottom tercile of the distribution for the full sample of firms. Results from this set of estimations show that integration reduces financing constraints for small publicly-traded firms. This is corroborated by the negative and significant coefficient on the interaction of bank integration and cash for the estimations including bank-dependent firms. In contrast, large publicly-traded firms do not exhibit a significant change in their cash-investment sensitivities due to banking deregulation. As it was the case for firms with access to public debt markets, estimations including large firms are not well specified as signaled by the Hansen test., 74212=Datta, Sudip, Mai Iskandar-Datta, and Ajay Patel, 2000, Some evidence on the uniqueness of initial public debt offerings, Journal of Finance 55, 715-743.\u00a0, 70878=Arellano, Manuel, and Olympia Bover, 1995, Another look at the instrumental-variable estimation of error components models, Journal of Econometrics 68, 29-51., 77098=Hubbard, R.

A firm is classified as bank-dependent, if it had average positive debt, and did not issue nor had ratings of commercial paper or bonds between 1970 and 1994. Results in columns (1) and (3), show that the cash-investment sensitivity is positive and significant for bank-dependent firms. This result is consistent with previous evidence on firm financial constraints (Houston and James (2001)), as this group of bank-dependent firms is more likely to face greater information asymmetries when accessing external sources of finance., 57628=In Table IX I use different sample selection criteria to control for potential biases. The first issue is the possible confounding effects of both intrastate and interstate entry deregulation in the banking sector. Jayaratne and Strahan (1996, 1998) show that intrastate deregulation had a significant effect on income growth and bank efficiency at the state level. Following a pattern similar to that of interstate deregulation, states lifted branching restrictions within the state at different points in time. In columns (4) and (5) I exclude firms located in states where intra- and interstate reforms were implemented within one year.32 Results show that interstate deregulation significantly reduced firm financial constraints in this smaller sample., 76878=Houston, Joel F., Christopher James, and David Marcus, 1997, Capital market frictions and the role of internal capital markets in banking, Journal of Financial Economics 46, 135-164., 71074=Ashcraft, Adam, 2006, New evidence on the lending channel, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 38, 751-776., 2918=This paper presents the first firm-level analysis on the effect of interstate bank integration on firm financial constraints. Between 1976 and 1994, the share of deposits held by Multi-State Banks (MSBs) in the U.S. rose from 12% to 69%. Existing literature suggests that this increase in bank integration through cross-state acquisitions is associated with enhanced bank efficiency (Jayaratne and Strahan (1998)), improved interstate income insurance (Demyanyk, Ostergaard, and S\u00f8rensen (2007)), and less state-level business cycle volatility (Morgan, Rime, and Strahan (2004)).1However, these studies do not consider the impact of bank integration on individual firms. This paper fills that void by asking two questions: did bank integration reduce financing constraints for publicly-traded firms? Was this effect the result of bank geographical diversification or the introduction of more efficient banking practices in local markets?, 13808=Before 1994, 49 states and the District of Columbia had deregulated their banking markets allowing out-of-state entry. Typically, acquisitions by out-of-state BHCs were limited to banks from same-region states although some states were open to nationwide entry. Interstate branching was permitted nationwide with the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, which became effective in June 1997. Some states took advantage of a clause in the Act and opted out at an earlier date.5, 79102=Martin, J. Spencer, and Anthony M.

Most of the short-term borrowing is in the form of lines of credit from banks.

A firm-level investment equation is estimated in order to test if bank integration reduces the sensitivity of capital expenditures to the level of internal funds. The staggered deregulation of cross-state bank acquisitions that took place in the U.S. between 1978 and 1994 helps estimate the model. Integration decreases financing constraints for bank-dependent firms. The change in firms' access to external finance is explained by an increase in the share of locally headquartered geographically diversified banks., 42435=Panel A in Table III shows descriptive statistics for the main variables and all firms included in the sample. The median firm has real assets of 112 million (1995 US dollars). Panels B and C include the same statistics for the sub-samples of firms without and with access to public debt. The group of firms with no access to public debt, or bank-dependent, has median assets of 44 million, considerably lower and statistically different to the 793 million in assets of firms with access to public debt. Additionally, cash holdings are larger and leverage lower for bank-dependent firms.24 These findings indicate that bank-dependent firms hold more liquidity and acquire less debt, which suggest that this group of firms face greater external financing constraints (Houston and James (2001))., 39494=I define the first bank dependence indicator by using the firms' history of credit ratings and issues between 1970 and 1994. A firm is classified as being bank-dependent if it did not issue debt nor had any credit ratings in this period, and held an average positive total debt balance. Bond and commercial paper credit rating information is retrieved from Compustat. Bond and commercial paper issues are obtained from the Mergent Fixed Income Security Database (FISD) and Moody's Default Risk Service (DRS) Database. About two-thirds of firms in the sample are classified as being bank-dependent.20, 35182=Figure 1 shows the evolution of the three continuous integration measures in the last three decades. Bank integration, as measured by these shares, remained stable and close to 10% before 1982. From this year onwards, there was a considerable increase in the share of assets, C&I loans, and deposits held by MSBs, reaching the 60% mark in 1994. This pattern is consistent with the passage of interstate agreements beginning in 1982., 290689=16.\u00a0\u00a0Delaware and South Dakota are dropped from the sample due to the significant presence of credit card companies in these states starting in the 1980s. Hawaii did not deregulate before the Riegle-Neal act was passed in 1994. The District of Columbia is included in the sample.\u00a0Return to text, 37331=Firm level data is compiled from the Compustat database, which contains Balance Sheet and Income Statements for publicly-traded firms.18 The sample consists of U.S. manufacturing firms (SIC codes 2000 to 3999) between 1976 and 1994. The main advantage of using Compustat is that it covers firms before and after interstate banking deregulation took place.

Compustat's geographic information reports the location of firms headquarters only for the latest year available in the database. To determine whether a firm was affected by bank entry deregulation, I have to find the actual historical location of its headquarters. For this purpose, I use data from Compact Disclosure between 1988 and 1994. This source contains extracts from SEC filings updated every month, including the firm's address. With this information I establish the state where a firm was headquartered during the deregulation period.19, 73509=Cleary, W.

The methodology follows the well established literature on investment with financing constraints.4 An Euler equation for investment is estimated using firm-level data on publicly-traded firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector for the period between 1976 and 1994.
