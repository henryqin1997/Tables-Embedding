So without further delay, below is a look at Alabama's last 10 wins by 20 points or more against SEC teams. The Alabama football team forged a rout in conference play Saturday against rival Tennessee, 41-17, and for a team that has made a habit of close final scores, it was indeed a rarity. The Crimson Tide briefly trailed 14-10 early in the game, but then responded with a 31-3 run to turn a game that is normally a nail-biter into a laugher. So where are the real hammers in Alabama's recent history? For purposes of Rammer Jammer Hammers Alabama 41, Tennessee 17: D.J. Hall - 13 catches, 185 yards, 2 TDs \u0085 John Parker Wilson - 32 of 46, 365 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs. \u0085 Terry Grant - 26 carries, 104 yards, TD rush, TD catch. \u0085 Kareem Jackson - 2 INTs. \u0085 Leigh Tiffin - 4 of 5 on FGs. The Sunday Rewind is a weekly collection of notes and quotes from the Alabama football game of the weekend. October 21, 2007 The",
