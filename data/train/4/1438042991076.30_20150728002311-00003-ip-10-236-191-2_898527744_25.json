            "Campus is safe, but around campus is not. Campus police (an actual OKC police department) are GREAT, however!",
            "GREEK LIFE IS HUGE. Almost everyone belongs to a sorority or fraternity. But don't worry, these Greek kids are a little more down to earth than your typical Greek kids.",
            "The Oklahoma City Memorial is beautiful. There are a lot of fun coffee shops, the state fair, Bricktown, Pops, and many more great places. Sundays are slow, though, as Oklahoma is in the Bible belt. Good luck finding things open on Sundays!",
            "Having dietary restrictions stinks here. They do have a vegan bar during the week at lunch time. As a vegetarian, though, I was often disappointed by the food choices. They would also not cook my food on a separate grill from meat, so until I lived off campus and started cooking my own food, I had terrible digestion problems.",
            "Room checks are AWFUL. I hated being told to make my bed. Also, the housing department is terribly run. I moved off campus as soon as I could. The best place to live on campus is Cokesbury Court. They will try to sell United Methodist to you, but it is not worth it. The pipes have burst multiple times, flooding student's rooms, it is very loud, and poorly built. The honor dorms also stink. You would think the honors students would get the best housing, but they are the worst on campus.",
            "Depending on the class, the classes are challenging, fun, and multifaceted.",
            "If you are a student interested in the performing arts (dance, music, theatre), religion, or nursing, this is a FANTASTIC place to be. You are required to live on campus until you are twenty-one years old. Also, there are weekly room checks, which are basically alcohol checks. They can (and will) fine you for not making your bed.",
            "Oklahoma City University is full of friendly and accepting people. Campus is beautiful, and the area around campus is starting to clean up. There is a lot to do in Oklahoma City, and you'll have a lot of friends to do things with!"

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck They help me find scholarships and are a lot cheeper than other schools. *Plus you get one-on-one and don't have to be in a class of over 100 students. Am enjoying being here I love the small classes and the one-on-one with the professors. Am learning a lot The teachers here are really interested in helping me succeed. Most of the things I am re-learning, but who ever said that was a horrible thing?
