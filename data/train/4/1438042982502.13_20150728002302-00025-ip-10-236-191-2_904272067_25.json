The Commission seeks to develop a flexible and streamlined regulatory framework that will encourage efficient, innovative uses of the spectrum and to allow various services to operate on an interference-protected basis. In doing so, it further seeks to adopt service rules that will allow for the deployment of the various radar applications in this band, both within and outside the U.S. The Commission takes this action in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Robert Bosch, LLC (Bosch) and two petitions for reconsideration of the 2012 Vehicular Radar R&O., 160933=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 54213=This document contains corrections to the final regulations to the Commission's rules which were published in the Federal Register on Thursday, November 6, 2014 (79 FR 65906).

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) Incentive Auction Task Force seeks comment on the data and analyses released in this document and the attached Appendix., 58986=This document amends procedural rules implemented by the Commission's 2011 determination that docketing and electronic filing be utilized in proceedings involving \u201c[n]ewly filed formal common carrier complaints and newly filed pole attachment complaints before the Enforcement Bureau.\u201d The rule changes also apply to future filings made in existing Section 208 formal complaints and pole attachment complaints. In addition, the amendments make a few procedural changes to existing Section 208 formal complaint and pole attachment complaint filing rules to create uniformity among them and ease of administration for parties and staff when initiating service of pleadings or filing confidential matters with the Commission. The rules further establish a single electronic inbox within Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) to handle the initial filing of the above-identified new complaints. Accepted complaints will receive a distinct ECFS docket number; rejected complaints will remain on ECFS but will be stored within the Inbox., 83014=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) will revise its Schedule of Regulatory Fees in order to recover an amount of $339,844,000 that Congress has required the Commission to collect for fiscal year 2015.}",
