The refrigerator includes a compressor for compressing the coolant, a radiator for radiating heat from the coolant, a coolant cooler for cooling the coolant, a flow control valve for regulating the flow volume of the coolant, an evaporator for evaporating the coolant, and a heat-exchange-amount control for controlling the amount of heat exchanged in the coolant cooler. The coolant is circulated through the compressor, the radiator, the coolant cooler, the flow control valve, and the evaporator, in that sequence. 06-25-2009 Toshihiro Kouda, Shiga JP Patent application number Description Published 20130017397 POLYESTER FILMAANM Kouda; ToshihiroAACI ShigaAACO JPAAGP Kouda; Toshihiro Shiga JPAANM Fujita; MasatoAACI ShigaAACO JPAAGP Fujita; Masato Shiga JP - Disclosed is a polyester film with a coating layer that has excellent appearance quality and antistatic properties. The coating layer is formed on the polyester film by applying a coating liquid to at least one surface of the polyester film and drying the coating liquid thereon. The coating liquid contains an electron conductive compound; at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a polyalkylene oxide, glycerol, a polyglycerol, and an alkylene oxide",
