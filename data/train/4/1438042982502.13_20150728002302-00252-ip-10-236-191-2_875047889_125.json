As students walk around the campus caroling, luminarias (traditional New Mexican Christmas lights) are lit throughout the entire campus along with decorations. Another tradition we have is the burning of the Aggie; our rival school's (NMSU) mascot. During Red Rally, the students build a giant Aggie and at the end of Red Rally week, we burn the Aggie down!, 363283=Casas del Rio, Redondo, and Hokona Hall, I would say are without a doubt the best dorms on campus. Also, Casas del Rio are new for the fall 2012 semester., 578210=Albuquerque is home, but I've heard if you are from out of state it is hard to adjust. I love it here, and can't wait to graduate in May of next year!, 831214=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 232871=Get good grades. Ask your parents to get their federal taxes done as early after Jan. 1st as possible (if you're a dependent) or get your taxes done asap after Jan. 1st (if you're independent). Complete and submit the FAFSA as soon after Jan. 1st also (definitely before March 1st, which is UNM's priority deadline to be considered for institutional scholarships) and apply to AS MANY scholarships as you can in the first quarter of the year., 88278=Every Fall we have Red Rally, which is the beginning of Homecoming Week. For Red Rally, we burn a giant NM State Aggie (our rival school). On May 4th, we have May the Fourth Be With You, which is big Star Wars festival on campus. We also have several international and culture festivals on campus, which provide great entertainment on your walk between classes.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here As I mentioned the educational side of UNM is second to none. I think the other main aspect of a college that is taken into account when deciding where to attend is the campus and livability. UNM has a beautiful campus, filled with trees and grass. UNM even has a duck pond with a waterfall and dozens of ducks located in the center of campus. It is a joy to walk or ride my bike to classes because of the terrific scenery. Even when not going to class I often go for an afternoon bike ride just for the scenery. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot here at UNM. They are a top of the line school with excellent professors, GAs, and TAs. UNM has managed to find some of the mos interesting and qualified professors, GAs, and TAs. Last semester I took Philosophy 101 with Ethan Mills. He is a graduate student at UNM and teaches a few classes in the philosophy department. He has written a chapter in Steven Colbert's book I am America, and so can you. He made the class interesting and fun to many students (like myself) who have no interest in philosophy and were dreading the class.
