Voyager figures arrived in 1995, as did more TOS, TNG, and DS9 items.

Nearly the entire USS Enterprise-D crew was represented, plus Gowron, a Ferengi, a Borg, and a Romulan. Role-playing items included a type 2 phaser and communicator, while a shuttlecraft was produced for the figures. A model of the Enterprise-D was also released. The line was quite successful, and another wave of TNG figures, accessories, and vehicles was produced in the fall of 1993 along with a special boxed set of all seven of the original series' major crew members., 26317=In January 2008, it was reported that Playmates would be creating a toy line for J.J. Abrams' Star Trek. [1] This new line of figures, vehicles, and role-playing items was launched in April 2009. A second wave was planned for release in late 2009 and was later pushed back to spring 2010 before the releases were canceled and Playmates' Star Trek licensing was concluded. The company cited disappointing sales.
