            "Radford University does a great job of protecting its students. They have alert systems that contact students and their families whenever something has or is happening so you will be aware of threatening situations. The dorms are automatically locked at night so you need your ID to swipe in and you cannot use your ID to enter a dorm other than the one you live in. The campus police are very friendly; I have seen them dance with students at school events. However, they take their jobs very seriously. At student orientation, the campus police introduce themselves and encourage you to utilize their services when necessary. They are dedicated to their jobs and they care about your safety more than anything so do not be afraid to call them!",
            "Radford University gets you acquainted with activities they have to offer during the first week of school. Two days before classes started, the university had an outdoor movie night on the lawn which I thought was pretty awesome. They also have a club fair which introduces over two hundred clubs and organizations. Due to the university's surrounding environment, there are activities that you would not necessarily find in city-like areas such as kayaking, canoeing, white water rafting, mountain-biking, etc. Radford has a variety of activities available, but again you have to be willing to get out there.",
            "Radford University would be great for students who want to get away from the city life. The rural area allows a lot of exploring and beautiful sight-seeing but overall the area has a pretty slow pace unless you go to parties every night. Side-note: if you plan on getting drunk at all, do not get caught being so on campus because Radford is working hard to be a dry campus. When I first visited the school, I was told a freshman had brought beer in his dorm on move in day and before his parents could even get half way home, he was expelled. Radford is trying hard to boost their reputation so if you are coming here to party, be smart. This school is also a great place for students who are social or desire to become social because there are mass opportunities to make new friends.",
            "Radford University has an event called Quadfest that happens every year before spring exams. It started out as a festive on-campus event, but now it is known as an off-campus, weekend long party outlet. The students took over the event after the university stopped sponsoring the event in order to build their reputation as a dry campus. Therefore, students definitely look forward to it every year because it is so chaotic and barely censored.",
            "I would definitely say Radford University was worth the money I paid for it. It was all I expected to be: safe, friendly and free. There have been a few instances where the police or ambulances have had to intervene on campus, but for the most part nothing too severe has gone down. I cannot speak for everyone, but the majority of the people at Radford are friendly and open. In the beginning of my semester at Muse, a student decided to walk around scaring people by walking into their rooms (those who kept their doors open) wearing a morph suit. Instead of calling the cops and getting the crazy guy in trouble, people just shrugged it off as a joke, took pictures with him, and posted it on Facebook and everything. You are definitely your own person at Radford University and are treated as such. No one treats you like a child unless you give them a reason to. Luckily, I was pretty independent when it came to school work, but coming to Radford made me more aware of my responsibilities as an adult. Radford is convenient for students who live in-state because the university has buses that take you close to home for very good prices. Radford was certainly a great investment.",
            "First off, although Radford is a small city, there is plenty to do on and off campus. Do not let anyone tell you different because there are plenty of people who complain about having nothing to do when they just do not want to get off their lazy butts and explore. The school offers and introduces plenty of clubs during the first week of school and they are pretty entertaining. Furthermore, these clubs are always hosting activities which you can discover upon looking at the events television in the student center or the flyers posted all around campus. For example, just recently the African Student Association hosted an informative event about Kwanzaa that included African dancing, choir singing and free food that was pretty amazing. In the student center there is a bowling alley, a mini movie theater that plays pretty recent movies, and pool tables. If you are a sports person there is a gym in Muse Hall along with Peters Hall which holds the basketball court or you can gather some friends and play sports on many open spaces on campus. Nonetheless, if you want to go off campus there are buses (that are free for students) that take you to the mall and movie theater in Christiansburg that is about fifteen minutes away, Walmart, the Dedmon Center where sporting events are held, etc. I have only listed a few of the many things Radford University has to offer. There is plenty out there to do for fun, you just have to get yourself involved.",
            "I love the fact that there are two buffets on campus, one in Muse hall during lunch time and one in Dalton Hall that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Both buffets are amazing and they have a salad bar every day! They also have Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Papa John's, Wild Greens and a few other choices, but if you ever get sick of them there are always off-campus options close by as well. Some of the off-campus restaurants allow you to pay for meals with your Radford Express card which is basically your university ID card that you can put money on and use like a credit card. The only place I would not recommend eating on campus is the Austin Grill which is supposed to serve Tex-Mex , but, in my opinion, it does not satisfy. Also, if you love to eat the best meal plan to take is the Flex because you get a little over 500 dollars in food dollars for the semester that you can use anywhere on campus plus vending machine money. However, if somehow you spend your money too quickly, just wait until towards the end of the semester because students with too much Flex money left over start randomly buying food for people.",
            "Radford University has two types of on-campus housing: standard and traditional, standard having the more modern looking dorms. Each dorm building has study lounges students can use at any time which comes in handy when in need of quiet time. This year I am living in Muse Hall which is probably the most animated dorm on-campus because it is full of freshman but it provides a great experience. Sure there are some inconsiderate people who play their music ridiculously loud for no reason, but, from my experience, if you ask them nicely to turn it down they will do so. I recommend this dorm for freshman who would like to bond with their new classmates and make new friends. My friends and I literally walked on all thirteen floors of Muse and students greeted us in addition to letting us in their rooms to visit. It was pretty awesome! The rooms are pretty much what you make of them, if you do not decorate them, they will not look like much. There will be four students to a bathroom because Muse is a traditional building but it is not bad at all if you all communicate effectively. Also, living in Muse Hall means you will be farthest from all of your classes and the dining areas aside from the dining hall in Muse (obviously). P.S. Don't live in Draper! It's very rundown.",
            "I just finished my first semester here at Radford University and so far I have not had any classes that were too hard for me to handle. Honestly, if you take studying seriously then you will do just fine. There is no way of escaping writing papers so you should mentally prepare yourself for those. If you stink at writing papers, they have a writing center and a helpful writing website for you to utilize. Plus, you pay for them both in your tuition so you might as well use them. Radford University is also insistent on making its students great speakers so expect to have at least one oral presentation before you graduate. Keep in mind you are in college, therefore, average PowerPoint's will not get you very far and your presentation will most likely be timed and expected to be rehearsed. The professors at Radford are very dedicated to their jobs and they do what they can to help you as long as you are willing to help yourself (cliche, but very true). If you are struggling or are worried about an assignment, do not hesitate to contact your professor.",
            "Radford University is located in a mountainous area so the weather can be chilly at times but nothing too serious. As far as the dorms go, if you want to share a bathroom with only your roommate (and have air conditioning), then request standard living. The classes at the university are small so your professors are easy to reach. Do not be afraid to ask staff members for help because they are without doubt here for you. Nevertheless, if you are not sure of something be sure to check for yourself first. Something to pick up on when coming to Radford is learning how to be a proactive adult. Be on your toes when registering for classes because it gets very competitive and you may not get the classes you need that semester otherwise. More importantly, always keep in mind your purpose in coming to college. It is all well and good to experience the college life socially, but do not abuse your new found freedom or it will backfire and you are likely to find your money (or your family's money) wasted.",
            "Overall, Radford University is a very friendly place and the environment is extremely home-like. The staff members are helpful and there are plenty of resources available to help with academics, social life, etc. Radford University definitely cares about its students so if you come with an ambitious mind-set, you will be successful."

Those who like to work closely with their peers and professors. Liberal Arts students. Students that would appreciate the surrounding history, and beautiful mountains. Tips for prospective students Radford University is not a difficult place to get used to. It is not large and overbearing, but it isn't so small that you will know everybody, either. Get to know all of your professors if you plan on attending this college, they will help you out tremendously. However, I can't say that this is the most diverse community that can be found on a college campus, it is certainly not inhospitable. Also, don't listen to people who say that Radford is just a party school. Of course there are parties just like any other University in Virginia, but it's nothing special in that respect. Am enjoying being here",
