Four-wheel landing gear worked better on take-offs and landings, different body shape with the instrument panel in the middle and almost no floor gave unobstructed vertical vision, and later a bubble canopy gave undistorted vision. It launched on April 20, 1945 and was an immediate success. With room for 2 passengers, no obstructive body or windshield, and only a small instrument column between pilot and passenger, the pilot had uninterrupted view up and down. The Model 47, based on this design, made it's first flight on December 8, 1945. On March 8, 1946, it received CAA Type Certificate H-1 and was the first American commercial helicopter. The Bell 47 has since been produced by more countries than any other helicopter in the world.}",

The 47D-1 came during production with a larger 3 person capacity cabin to compete against other helicopters looking for buyers. During the Korean war, someone thought of using the helicopter to lift wounded soldiers from the front lines and delivering them directly to the hospitals. This prompted the Army to order many more H-13s for years to come. The Army had a tradition to sometimes use the names of Native American tribes and the H-13s were named \"Sioux\". The name did not catch on all that well but the nickname \"Angel of Mercy\" certainly did as these ships ferried wounded troops to safety.The field hospitals were called MASH units, acronym for \"Medical Army Surgical Hospital\", and",

It was the first helicopter that was designed and built at the Fort Worth plant in Texas and was produced with constant improvements well into the 1970's. The 47G also was the first 47 design to be produced outside the United States. In 1954, Augusta in Italy began producing Bell 47s under license until 1979. Other countries to do so were Kawasaki in Japan from 1954 to 1976, and Westland in England from 1965 to 1969. Through this time period, the 47G is most recognizeable from earlier models by the dual saddle gas tanks, curved lower cabin opening, and rear synchronized elevator at",
