    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{241352=RFC 2362 specifies that the BSR RP be selected as follows (RFC 2362, 3.7):, 24641=Allocating a unique IP multicast group address for an application is still a problem. Most short-lived applications use mechanisms like Session Description Protocol (SDP) and Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) to get a random address, a solution that does not work well with a rising number of applications in the Internet. The best current solution for long-lived applications is described in RFC 2770, but this solution suffers from the restriction that each autonomous system is limited to only 255 usable IP multicast addresses., 260078=RFC 2770, 241085=When Cisco and non-Cisco routers are being operated in a single PIM domain with PIM Version 2 BSR, care must be taken when configuring candidate RPs because the Cisco implementation of the BSR RP selection is not fully compatible with RFC 2362., 243250=In this example, a candidate RP on GigabitEthernet interface 1/0/0 announces a longer group prefix of 224.0.0.0/5 with a lower priority of 20. The candidate RP on GigabitEthernet interface 2/0/0 announces a shorter group prefix of 224.0.0.0/4 with a higher priority of 10. For all groups that match both ranges a Cisco router will always select the candidate RP on Ethernet interface 1 because it has the longer announced group prefix. A non-Cisco fully RFC 2362-compliant router will always select the candidate RP on GigabitEthernet interface 2/0/0 because it is configured with a higher priority., 259373=RFC 1112, 17181=ISM service is described in RFC 1112. This service consists of the delivery of IP datagrams from any source to a group of receivers called the multicast host group. The datagram traffic for the multicast host group consists of datagrams with an arbitrary IP unicast source address S and the multicast group address G as the IP destination address. Systems will receive this traffic by becoming members of the host group. Membership in a host group simply requires signaling the host group through IGMP Version 1, 2, or 3., 237010=The anycast RP example above uses IP addresses taken from RFC 1918. These IP addresses are normally blocked at interdomain borders and therefore are not accessible to other ISPs. You must use valid IP addresses if you want the RPs to be reachable from other domains., 242283=Inconsistent candidate RP selection between Cisco and non-Cisco RFC 2362-compliant routers in the same domain if multiple candidate RPs with partially overlapping group address ranges are configured can occur. Inconsistent candidate RP selection can prevent connectivity between sources and receivers in the PIM domain. A source may register with one candidate RP and a receiver may connect to a different candidate RP even though it is in the same group., 259723=RFC 1918, 8080=Following the election of the BSR, candidate RPs use unicast to announce to the BSR their willingness to be the RP. The BSR advertises the entire group-to-RP mapping set to the router link local address 224.0.0.13. Unlike the RP mapping agent in Auto-RP, which is used by Auto-RP to select the RP, every router in the BSR network is responsible for selecting the RP., 244713=In this configuration the candidate RP on Ethernet interface 2 announces group address 224.0.0.0/5 and 232.0.0.0/5 which equal 224.0.0.0/4, but gives the interface the same group prefix length (5) as the candidate RP on Ethernet 1. As a result, both a Cisco router and an RFC 2362-compliant router will select the RP Ethernet interface 2., 69478=Causes IP multicast traffic for the two Auto-RP groups 224.0.1.39 and 224.0.1.40 to be PIM dense mode flooded across interfaces operating in PIM sparse mode.}",
