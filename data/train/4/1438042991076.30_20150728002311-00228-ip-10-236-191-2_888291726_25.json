            "The clubs and organizations that the school has often hold events, many of which are fun. Also there is a movie theater down the road from the school and may other things that are easy to get to by the t.",
            "The cafe is a great place. The atmosphere is welcoming. However, the food could use improvement. The options are limited if you are a vegetarian or vegan so make sure you plan for that.",
            "There are five dorms on the campus. Riverway, Peabody, Pilgrim, Longwood, and CCSR. Each dorm has something different that separates them from the others. Riverway and CCSR are among the nicest dorms and are the toughest to get to live in. CCSR is upperclassmen. Every dorm but CCSR has a floor that is all first year students. Riverway has a kitchen in it, however, unless you know someone that lives in Riverway you can not use the kitchen. Peabody is the oldest and largest dorm on campus and has a long on every floor, Depending on the floor you live on and the other people on the floor it can seem more homey because people are always in the lounges. Peabody also contain the schools public safety desk.",
            "In many of the classes that Wheelock offers you will not have quizzes or tests through out the semester. Instead the classes require you to write papers. If you are a student who doesn't do well on tests but are an excellent writer this is the school for you.",
            "If you are a prospective student make sure that you look into other schools. Wheelock is a great school but it is important to make sure that the school offers the majors you want. Another tip that I can offer is to participate in as many events as you can as a first year student. This will allow you to meet many of the students that Wheelock has.",
            "Over all the school is very welcoming to everyone. The staff and faculty I have come across are very understanding and want to see the students succeed."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Those who like to write, have plenty of scholarships already, and like a small setting. This school also recently became co-ed, so the demographics are pretty sharp (97%female, 3%male). Tips for prospective students It is a private college, so tuition reflects this; however, if you plan to study Child Life this is the best school in the country in which to do just that!
