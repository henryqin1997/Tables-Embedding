Not saying this isn't a good school (especially journalism, in the top 10 in the state), BUT just dont' regret not going away, like myself. - Hang out on campus - Join a club - Get involved - Enjoy the concerts and such in the Spartan Complex - Get ready for a bunch of marijuanna clubs handing out their business cards/deals around campus! =P - 30 in from the beach/Santa Cruz Boardwalk - GO OFTEN! - 45 min from San Francisco - see the Golden Gate Bridge and other historical sights. Great shopping/food there. SEE ALCATRAZ Bang for the buck I think tuition is ridiculous at any school.

BUT a majority are pretty decent - as long as you remember they are human too, they are there to teach you, and you RESPECT them. Am enjoying being here Awesome place for commuter students who work. I happen to work downtown, so it's got a pretty central",
