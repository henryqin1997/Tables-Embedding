In step 1208, the configuration manager starts the service, and passes the handles of the logging and object queues to the service. In step 1209, if there are no more services to start, the procedure is completed. Otherwise, the setup information for the next service is retrieved in step 1210, and the procedure returns to step 1202 for handling of the next service., 89080=Main memory 1015 is comprised of dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Video memory 1014 is a dual-ported video random access memory. One port of the video memory 1014 is coupled to video amplifier 1016. The video amplifier 1016 is used to drive the cathode ray tube (CRT) raster monitor 1017. Video amplifier 1016 is well known in the art and may be implemented by any suitable apparatus. This circuitry converts pixel data stored in video memory 1014 to a raster signal suitable for use by monitor 1017. Monitor 1017 is a type of monitor suitable for displaying graphic images., 292067=FIG. 17 illustrates several examples of methods by which recipients may receive information from CPR network 1700. An application service may interface with a paging service to deliver messages to pager 1708. Another application service may transmit messages to designated recipients via facsimile machine 1707. A customer may receive information in customer application 1706 by interfacing with an application service over an ISDN line. Information may be delivered to e-mail distribution sites, such as Lotus Notes 1705 and CC.Mail P.O. 1704. CPR network 1700 may also use a TCP/IP-based application service to distribute information over internet/intranet 1701 in the form of e-mail for receipt by SMTP mail client 1702, or in the form of Java/HTML information for receipt by a Java applet executed on network computer 1703., 287604=In FIG. 16, multiple media sources, such as live programming feed 1601, satellite feed 1602, and video archive 1603, are coupled to CPR node 1600. Customer info and billing system 1614 is coupled to CPR node 1600 to provide a repository for customer preference and payment information. CPR node 1600 is coupled to one or more area distribution points, such as CPR node 1604. CPR node 1604 is further coupled to one or more local distribution points, such as CPR nodes 1605 and 1606, for distribution of the selected television signal to respective customer televisions via, for example, switched digital cable networks. Home television units 1607 and 1608, and home theater unit 1609 represent customer units coupled to CPR node 1605 for receipt of selected programming., 285088=Cable TV feed 1505 is coupled to CPR network 1500 to provide a cable video source or sink for the video network, and DVD player 1503 provides input into CPR network 1500 in the form of RGB video data. Database server 1502 is accessible via an SQL interface with CPR network 1500, to act as a video store for the network for archiving and reviewing video sessions., 285513=Desktop computer 1502 and network computer 1503 are coupled to CPR network 1500, and hence the video network, via internet/intranet 1501. Streaming video and audio may be received from the video network in UDP format over IP network 1501, and viewed by computers 1502 and 1503 using means such as a web browser or Java applet., 125406=In step 1102, the boot manager invokes the storage manager's Startup( ) method, and passes the storage manager an input queue handle for logging purposes, the filename to use for resource messages, and the local CPR node address. In step 1103, the boot manager invokes the Start( ) method of the queue and stream manager, and passes the input queue handle for logging purposes and the filename to use for resource messages. In step 1104, the boot manager invokes the Start( ) method of the remote service call manager, and passes the input queue handle for logging purposes and the filename to use for resource messages., 124867=In step 1101, the boot manager invokes the Start( ) method of the monitor manager, and passes the monitor manager an input queue handle for logging purposes, a filename to use for resource messages, and, optionally, a thread monitoring mode if more than one monitoring mode is supported. The monitor manager may be used in a multi-processor environment to determine processor affinity based on monitored thread execution behavior. The thread monitoring mode can be used to select an affinity assignment strategy., 291009=In FIG. 17, CPR network 1700 comprises one or more CPR nodes coupled via link services. CPR network 1700 is coupled through application services to one or more information sources, such as information feed 1709, legacy application 1710, and database 1711. For example, the legacy application may be coupled to CPR network 1700 via an SNA interface application service, and database 1711 may be coupled to CPR network 1700 via an SQL interface application service., 282742=On the server side (1401) of the business internet, various servers are coupled to CPR node 1409 via supporting communication networks. In this example, web server 1411 interfaces with an application service of CPR node 1409 via TCP/IP network 1410 (e.g., the Internet) to serve HTML/HTTP information to, for example, a web browser application on user computer 1404. Host application 1413 interfaces with an application service of CPR node 1409 via SNA (systems network architecture) network or interface 1412 to provide, for example, host application services over the CPR network to a user application on user computer 1405. Netware server 1415 interfaces with an application service of CPR node 1409 via SPX/IPX LAN 1414 to provide common Netware services., 126067=In step 1105, the boot manager starts the individual modules (compression, authentication, cryptographic, etc.) of the link manager by invoking their respective Start( ) methods. Each module is passed an input queue handle for logging, a filename for resource messages and the handle of a configuration file. In step 1106, the boot manager invokes the Start( ) method of the configuration manager, and passes the input queue handle for logging and the handle of a configuration file., 288499=Several methods for implementing customer programming selection are illustrated in FIG. 16. Telephone unit 1610 is provided for the user of home theater unit 1610 to select programming (e.g., using a touch-tone menu-driven system) through CPR node 1600. The customer can thus interact with the customer information and billing system 1614 to establish viewing preferences. Another method is to select viewing preferences over the Internet using a WWW-based application. Home television unit 1608 is coupled to CPR node 1600 via Internet 1611 to illustrate this approach. A third method is to select preferences through an operator interface. As illustrated with respect to home television unit 1607, a customer may submit preference information 1612, for example via a mailed or faxed form, or by speaking with an operator. The operator enters customer preference information 1612 into customer information and billing system 1614 via operator console 1613., 87624=The computer system of FIG. 10 also includes a video memory 1014, main memory 1015 and mass storage 1012, all coupled to bidirectional system bus 1018 along with keyboard 1010, mouse 1011 and CPU 1013. The mass storage 1012 may include both fixed and removable media, such as magnetic, optical or magnetic optical storage systems or any other available mass storage technology. Bus 1018 may contain, for example, thirty-two address lines for addressing video memory 1014 or main memory 1015. The system bus 1018 also includes, for example, a 32-bit data bus for transferring data between and among the components, such as CPU 1013, main memory 1015, video memory 1014 and mass storage 1012. Alternatively, multiplex data/address lines may be used instead of separate data and address lines., 233789=FIG. 12 is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a general service startup procedure carried out by configuration manager 127. In step 1200 of FIG. 12, the configuration manager uses the handle of the configuration file to access the service configuration setup database in the storage manager. In step 1201, the setup information for the first service is retrieved from the service configuration setup database. Using the setup information, an input queue is created in the logging manager in step 1202. If, in step 1203, an output logging queue has been created, the procedure continues at step 1205. If an output logging queue has not yet been created, the configuration manager creates an output queue in the logging manager in step 1204, before proceeding to step 1205. In step 1205, the configuration manager binds the input logging queue to the output logging queue., 293580=In FIG. 18, Java applets are executed on web browser 1805 and network computer 1806, both of which communicate Java/HTML information to CPR network 1800 via internet/intranet 1804. CPR network 1800 maintains an HTTP and TCP/IP-based application service for interfacing with internet/intranet 1804. CPR network 1800 also maintains an application service providing an HTML/HTTP connection with web server 1803. Database 1801 and legacy application 1802 are coupled to CPR network 1800 via SQL-based and SNA-based application services, and are thus accessible to web server 1803, as well as Java-based applets executed by web browser 1805 or network computer 1806., 291548=Content services within CPR network 1700 provide for the format conversion necessary for transmission of the information to the specified information recipients. Routing services may be used to direct the information to the specified recipients, and to configure the direction of information to other services required to fulfill the desired application. Application services provide the means by which the information is transmitted externally from CPR network 1700 to the recipients., 282148=In the business internet application of FIG. 14, user or client computers 1403-1405 at user/client site 1400 are coupled to CPR node 1406 via TCP/IP network 1402, using one or more TCP/IP-based application services of CPR node 1406 to interface with the CPR network comprising CPR nodes 1406 and 1409. Utilizing corresponding link services at each node, CPR node 1406 is further coupled to CPR node 1409 via one or more networks, such as ATM network 1407 and SPX/IPX wide area network 1408., 289567=In the personalized television network of FIG. 16, application services provide the interfaces for receiving the media input from sources 1601-1603, as well as interacting with customer information and billing system 1614 and customer units 1607-1609. Routing services may be employed to direct routing of selected programming through respective CPR nodes or distribution points to implement proper disbursement of selected programming. Content services may be implemented to perform any monitoring, censoring or other manipulation of programming content to conform to the selected preferences of each customer. Thus, a personalized television network may be implemented using a CPR system., 88546=In one embodiment of the invention, the CPU 1013 is a microprocessor manufactured by Intel, such as a processor from the 80\ufffd86 or Pentium processor families. Other possible microprocessors include the 680\ufffd0 or PowerPC 60\ufffd processor families manufactured by Motorola, the SPARC microprocessor from Sun Microsystems, and the DEC Alpha. However, any other suitable processor or microcomputer may be utilized. Further, the apparatus may comprise a plurality of microprocessors in a multi-processing arrangement., 231612=Index values 1000 and beyond are used to store data type information for the media object. The mapping of particular data types to each index above 1000 is specific to the type of media object, and is known by those services handling media objects of the given type. For example, services associated with faxing that use the media object type \u201c/Fax/FR/Outbound\u201d may store, at a first index, data regarding the number of pages in the fax, while at second and third indices, data regarding the recipient's telephone number and resolution may be stored. At another index, the fax data itself is stored. A fax application service may extract this information by invoking the Get( ) method of the object handler and specifying the appropriate media type index. Other services in the CPR system may add, delete or alter data in the media object over the course of the media object's transit of the CPR network., 124185=The lines between boot manager 120 and the other kernel components in FIG. 1 represent the start-up interaction. FIG. 11 illustrates one embodiment of a kernel resource startup procedure carried out by the boot manager. In step 1100, the boot manager invokes the logging manager's Start( ) method, and passes the logging manager the filename and logging level to use for internal logging, as well as the filename to use for resource messages. The logging level is used by the logging manager to filter out lower priority log messages. Those log messages whose logging level falls below the logging level stored in the logging manager are discarded., 284245=In the business video network application of FIG. 15, CPR network 1500, which comprises one or more CPR nodes, is used to link various video data sources and sinks. Each video data source and/or sink interfaces with CPR network 1500 via one or more application services. High-bandwidth studio video conferencing units 1504 are coupled to CPR network 1500 via multiple ISDN lines with the CPR network acting as a H.320 gateway. Low-bandwidth desktop video conferencing unit 1507 is coupled to CPR network 1500 via a single ISDN line. The studio and desktop video conferencing units may act as sources and/or sinks with respect to the video network. Mobile telephone 1506 is coupled to CPR network 1500 via a cellular link, and acts as an audio-only source and/or sink., 86846=An embodiment of the invention can be implemented as computer software in the form of computer readable program code executed on a general purpose computer such as illustrated in FIG. 10. A keyboard 1010 and mouse 1011 are coupled to a bi-directional system bus 1018. The keyboard and mouse are for introducing user input to the computer system and communicating that user input to central processing unit (CPU) 1013. Other suitable input devices may be used in addition to, or in place of, the mouse 1011 and keyboard 1010. I/O (input/output) unit 1019 coupled to bi-directional system bus 1018 represents such I/O elements as a printer, network communications card, modem, A/V (audio/video) I/O, etc.}",
