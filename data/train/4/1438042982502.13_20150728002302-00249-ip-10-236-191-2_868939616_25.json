Rainbow Union were very involved in campus life and community service. Several of the members were also members of Greek Life. We played games, talked about current LGBT issues, and had many community service/civic engagement events. Tap Dance Underground is a tap dancing club and you don't need to know how to tap dance to join. I had never tap danced (or done any dance) before, and I went to some of their meetings because my friend was in it. I helped them run their December show that they did, I was in control of music. Then I joined in January, worked as hard as I could to learn their routine, and we went to NYC in March to perform. I had a lot of fun during the trip and with the club in general. The president during this time was a Greek Life student, and he balanced school-work, a job, Greek Life, and this club well., 3624=ITS COLD BRING WARM THINGS ! Don't think winter is over until the sun is out and its 80 degrees... its almost April and its still snowing and very cold... its going to be like this for a while., 4695=I love Alfred. i have met so many Amazing people that it blows my mind. its one of those weird places you just meet so many amazing people. there are many activities and clubs to attend, and Alfred state students activities are always trying to make their students have a great time , for instances april 13th 2011 we are having Sick puppies CONCERT WOOT :D. and last year this time Kevin hart came and technically beta tested his jokes on us LOL., 115176=I fell at least 3 times when coming back here from January Break., 82868=Locations-There is one spot behind Shultz Hall called Heaven, it's the parking lot for the buildings in that area. From this spot, you can see all of campus and a lot of the town and surrounding area. I only was at this spot once, during the day, and it was beautiful. Traditions-Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are party/drinking days. Wednesday is Wasted Wednesday. In April, there is Hot Dog Weekend, which is a weekend devoted to drinking. There are some drugs done on campus and a lot of drinking done in residential halls., 122136=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
