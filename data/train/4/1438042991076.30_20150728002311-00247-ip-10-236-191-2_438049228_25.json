The valve disc arrangement comprises a first and a second valve disc, which are rotatable with respect to each other such that the valve is switchable between multiple switching positions, and, in some switching positions, either the source of pressurized air or the exhaust port are in fluid communication with the utilization elements. The valve discs provide a stepped increase in flow cross-section in a respective flow path to or from the utilization elements. The stepped increase is dependent on the angle of rotation between the valve discs. 20140346748 Published Description Patent application number Agnieszka Leszczuk, Wroclaw PL 01-10-2013 METHODS AND KITS FOR DECREASING INTERFERENCES IN PLASMA OR SERUM CONTAINING ASSAY SAMPLES OF SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAYS - Methods and kits are provided for decreasing interferences and inaccuracies due to nonoptimal sample handling of blood samples in plasma or serum containing assay samples of specific binding assays by addition of a large polycation to the assay sample during the specific binding assay. 20130011827 06-09-2011 METHODS AND KITS FOR DECREASING INTERFERENCES IN PLASMA OR SERUM CONTAINING ASSAY SAMPLES OF SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAYS",

Subsequently granules are plasticized and then injected at a temperature between 180 and 400\u00b0 C. into the mold heated to a temperature between 60 and 150\u00b0 C. Then obtained moulder is cooled and in the final stage it is hermetically packed in a vacuum and sterilized. In addition, the granules of the thermoplastic polymer composite are used, obtained by addition of bactericidal additive introduced into the thermoplastic polymer granules, preferably a silver powder with a particle size from 15 to 100 nm, in an amount of 0.1-3 wt %. 05-14-2015 Agnieszka Opalinska, Zyrardow PL Patent application number Description Published 20090256083 Zirconium Dioxide Luminescence Oxygen Sensor - A method of measuring oxygen partial pressure in gases, such as hot engine exhaust gases, uses a calibrated luminescence sensor and comprises the steps of bringing nanocrystalline zirconinum dioxide ZrO 10-15-2009 Agnieszka Otrowicz, Wroclaw PL Patent application number Description Published 20130295647",
