This class can generate labels suitable for printing that use the same color coded stripes used in resistors. Manuel Lemos Number 4 July 2012 \u00a0 \u00a0 Innovation Award What is the best PHP qr code generation class? I need php code to generate qr code offline \u00a0 \u00a0 Recommendations This class can generate label images for color coded resistors. It takes the resistance value of an electric resistor and generates an image for a page with a grid of labels that show the resistance value with the respective color code stripes, as well",

The numeric codes are a maximum of 3 characters 0-9 and a letter for meters or feet. QR code generation is placed beside the colour coded label. ### The generated QR code can contain: - URL - E-mail address - Phone Number - SMS - Address VCARDS - Calendar Event - Custom Text QR codes have many uses for inventory, logistics, documentation, manifests or usage instructions to name a few. I'm just tired of wasting my time looking for the right size cable when they are all labeled differently or not at ALL! on a job site. An example of the dilemma I would face when looking for a 50 foot cable; which cable is more likely to be a 50 ft cable marking that is clear? - The one with the red label? - The one with the",
