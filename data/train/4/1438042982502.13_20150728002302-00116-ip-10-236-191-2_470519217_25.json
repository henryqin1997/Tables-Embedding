L-(N-benzyl)histidine methyl ester hydrochloride salt (1.1 eq, 500 mg) was added as well as Et3N (2.2 eq, 471 mL), with HOBT (1.1 eq, 229 mg). After 15 mn, EDCI (1.1 eq, 502 mg) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. EtOAc was added and the organic layer washed with NaHCO3 saturated, 10% citric acid and brine (3\ufffd50 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude material was eluted on column chromatography (silica gel), with EtOAc/hexanes 1:3, then with CHCl3:MeOH 9:1. The title compound was isolated as an oil in 30% yield (230 mg, 0.447 mmol)., 198234=This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/127,533, filed Jul. 31, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,559,127 which issued on May 6, 2003, which, in turn, was based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/112,010, filed Jul. 31, 1997., 505595=N-(Toluene-4-sulfonyl)sarcosine was prepared from sarcosine using the procedure described in Method 1. Coupling was conducted using the procedure described in Method 3. The title compound, prepared by hydrolysis of the ester using the procedure described in Method 7, was obtained as a solid, mp=>200\ufffd C. (dec.)., 552265=Cells are washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in the same. They are then analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell sorter (\u201cFACS\u201d) analysis as described in Yednock et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270:28740., 394747=In some cases, the compounds of formula I or IA or intermediates thereof may contain substituents having one or more sulfur atoms. Such sulfur atoms will be present, for example, when the amino acid of formula II employed in the above reactions is derived from L-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, L-(5,5-dimethyl)thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, L-thiamorpholine-3-carboxylic acid and the like. When present, such sulfur atoms can be oxidized either before or after the above coupling reactions to provide a sulfoxide or sulfone compound using conventional reagents and reaction conditions. Suitable reagents for oxidizing a sulfide compound to a sulfoxide include, by way of example, hydrogen peroxide, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), sodium periodate and the like. The oxidation reaction is typically conducted by contacting the sulfide compound with about 0.95 to about 1.1 equivalents of the oxidizing reagent in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about \u221250\ufffd C. to about 75\ufffd C. for about 1 to about 24 hours. The resulting sulfoxide can then be further oxidized to the corresponding sulfone by contacting the sulfoxide with at least one additional equivalent of an oxidizing reagent, such as hydrogen peroxide, MCPBA, potassium permanganate and the like. Alternatively, the sulfone can be prepared directly by contacting the sulfide with at least two equivalents, and preferably an excess, of the oxidizing reagent. Such reactions are described further in March, \u201cAdvanced Organic Chemistry\u201d, 4th Ed., pp. 1201\u20131202, Wiley Publisher, 1992., 478247=Amino acid methyl esters were prepared using the method of Brenner and Huber Helv. Chim. Acta 1953, 36, 1109., 444375=Compounds having the desired biological activity may be modified as necessary to provide desired properties such as improved pharmacological properties (e.g., in vivo stability, bio-availability), or the ability to be detected in diagnostic applications. For instance, inclusion of one or more D-amino acids in the sulfonamides of this invention typically increases in vivo stability. Stability can be assayed in a variety of ways such as by measuring the half-life of the proteins during incubation with peptidases or human plasma or serum. A number of such protein stability assays have been described (see, e.g., Verhoef et al., Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet., 1990, 15(2):83\u201393)., 538121=1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) (1:1 mixture of diastereomers): \u03b4=10.43 (d, 1H); 8.80 (m, 2H); 8.45 and 8.25 (two m, 1H), 8.23 (m, 1H); 8.04 (m, 3H); 7.82 (m, 2H); 7.65 (m, 2H); 7.20 (m, 2H); 4.76 (m, 1H); 4.45 (m, 1H); 3.40 and 3.42 (two s, 3H); 3.00 (m, 2H), 1.65 and 1.70 (two s, 3H)., 477919=N-Tosylation of the appropriate amino acid was conducted via the method of Cupps, Boutin and Rapoport J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 3972., 393941=Furthermore, a compound of formula I or an intermediate thereof having a substituent containing an iodoaryl group, for example, when R5 is a (4-iodophenyl)methyl group, can be readily converted either before or after the above coupling reactions into a biaryl compound. Typically, this reaction is conducted by treating the iodoaryl compound with about 1.1 to about 2 equivalents of an arylzinc iodide, such as 2-(methoxycarbonyl)phenylzinc iodide, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine), in an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from about 24\ufffd C. to about 30\ufffd C. until reaction completion. This reaction is further described, for example, in Rieke, J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 1445., 438490=Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (\u201cpatches\u201d). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252, issued Jun. 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents., 532251=N-(Toluene-4-sulfonyl)-2-thienylethylamine was prepared using the procedure described in Method 1. This compound was reacted with t-butyl bromoacetate yielding N-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-N-(2-thienylethyl)glycine t-butyl ester (following the method of Zuckermann, Kerr, Kent, and Moos J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10646\u201310647). The ester was hydrolyzed using the procedure described in Method 17. The title compound was prepared following the procedure described in Method 13., 520134=L-(O-Benzyl)-serine methyl ester hydrochloride salt (6.28 g, 25.5 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) with tosyl chloride (1.1 eq, 5.36 g) and Et3N (2.2 eq, 7.48 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. EtOAc was added as well as brine, and the organic layer dried over MgSO4. The desired N-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-L-(O-benzyl)-serine methyl ester was isolated as an oil, in 100% yield (10.04 g, 25.5 mmol). This was then taken up in dry acetone (50 mL) with iodomethane (1.1 eq, 1.88 mL) and K2CO3 (1.1 eq, 4.10 g). The solution was refluxed overnight. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. EtOAc was added and the organic layer was washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The desired N-methyl derivative was isolated as a clear oil in 40% yield (4.16 g, 11 mmol). The ester was dissolved in a 1:1 solution of dioxane:H2O with NaOH (1.1 eq, 50 mL). The desired compound was isolated as a solid., 556660=Antibody GG5/3 against \u03b14\u03b21 integrin (Keszthelyi et al., Neurology, 1996, 47:1053\u20131059), which delays the onset of symptoms, is used as a positive control and is injected subcutaneously at 3 mg/kg on Day 8 and 11., 491293=N-(Toluene-4-sulfonyl)glycine (547 mg, 2.40 mmol) was slurried in CH2Cl2 (7 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. Oxalyl chloride (0.30 mL) was added, followed by one drop of DMF. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 hr. The volatiles were removed in vacuo and the acid chloride dissolved in CH2Cl2 (8 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. Phenylalanine benzyl ester toluensulfonate (919 mg, 2.1 mmol) was added, followed by triethylamine (0.75 mL). The mixture was allowed to slowly warm to room temperature and stirred for 19 hr. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (40 mL) and washed with 1N HCl (2\ufffd10 mL), 1M NaHCO3 (15 mL), brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (3:2 Hexane/EtOAc) to give the dipeptide benzyl ester (0.51 g, 50%). The benzyl ester was dissolved in THF (20 mL) and 10% Pd/C (60 mg) was added. The mixture was hydrogenated at 15 psi H2 for 1.5 hr. The mixture was filtered through a pad of diatomaceous earth and evaporated in vacuo to give a residue which was recrystallized from MeOH/CHCl3 to give the title compound as a white solid (304 mg, 76%), mp=157\u2013161\ufffd C., 480138=To a chilled (0\ufffd C.) THF/H2O solution (2:1, 5\u201310 mL) of the appropriate ester was added LiOH (1.1 equivalents). The temperature was maintained at 0\ufffd C. and the reaction was complete in 1\u20133 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue was taken up into H2O and the pH adjusted to 2\u20133 with aqueous HCl. The product was extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined organic phase was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to yield the desired acid., 552780=This assay may also be used to determine the plasma levels needed to saturate the binding sites of other integrins, such as the \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, which is the integrin most closely related \u03b14\u03b21 (Palmer et al, 1993, J. Cell Bio., 123:1289). Such binding is predictive of in vivo utility for inflammatory conditions mediated by \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, including by way of example, airway hyper-responsiveness and occlusion that occurs with chronic asthma, smooth muscle cell proliferation in atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion following angioplasty, fibrosis and glomerular scarring as a result of renal disease, aortic stenosis, hypertrophy of synovial membranes in rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammation and scarring that occur with the progression of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease., 548717=Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine as described by Yednock, supra., 535674=N-(Toluene-4-sulfonyl)sarcosine was coupled to 4-cyanophenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (prepared via the method of Wagner, Voight, and Vieweg Pharmazie 1984, 39, 226\u2013230) to give N-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)sarcosyl-D,L-4-cyanophenylalanine methyl ester. The compond was prepared via hydrolysis of the methyl ester using 0.5 N NaOH in THF/water., 548899=Jurkat cells were incubated with 1.5 mM MnCl2 and 5 \u03bcg/mL 15/7 antibody for 30 minutes on ice. Mn+2 activates the receptor to enhance ligand binding, and 15/7 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an activated/ligand occupied conformation of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin and locks the molecule into this conformation thereby stabilizing the VCAM-1/\u03b14\u03b21 integrin interaction. Yednock, et al., supra. Antibodies similar to the 15/7 antibody have been prepared by other investigators (Luque, et al, 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:11067) and may be used in this assay., 555025=The standard multiple sclerosis model, Experimental Autoimmune (or Allergic) Encephalomyelitis (\u201cEAE\u201d), is used to determine the effect of candidate compounds to reduce motor impairment in rats or guinea pigs. Reduction in motor impairment is based on blocking adhesion between leukocytes and the endothelium and correlates with anti-inflammatory activity in the candidate compound. This model has been previously described by Keszthelyi et al., Neurology, 1996, 47:1053\u20131059, and measures the delay of onset of disease., 356829=Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein., 487274=To a methanol (10\u201315 mL) solution of the azlactone was added NaOAc (1 equivalent) and 10% Pd/C. This mixture was placed on the hydrogenator at 40 psi H2. After 8\u201316 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and the filtrate concentrated to yield the dehydrodipeptide methyl ester. The ester was dissolved in dioxane/H2O (5-10 mL), to which was added 0.5 N NaOH (1.05 equivalents). After stirring for 1\u20133 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue was redissolved in H2O and washed with EtOAc. The aqueous phase was made acidic with 0.2 N HCl and the product was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic phase was washed with brine (1\ufffd5 mL), dried (MgSO4 or Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated to yield the acid as approximately a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers., 512230=N-(Toluene-4-sulfonyl)sarcosine was coupled to N-methyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester using the procedure described in Method 3 to give N-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)sarcosyl-N-methylphenylalanine methyl ester. The title compound was prepared via hydrolysis of the methyl ester using LiOH in THF/water. Proton and carbon NMR analysis indicated a mixture of amide bond rotomers in about a 65:35 ratio., 506701=Sodium metal (1.40 g, 61 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (100 mL) containing diethyl acetamidomalonate (6.62 g, 30.5 mmol) and 3-picolyl chloride hydrochloride (5.00 g, 30.5 mmol) were added. The mixture was heated to reflux for 6 hr, and then cooled and filtered to remove NaCl (washed with EtOH). The solvent was removed in vacuo and the mixture was taken up into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3\ufffd100 mL). The solvent was removed and the residue purified by silica gel flash chromatography (95:5 CH2Cl2/MeOH) to give diethyl 2-(3-pyridylmethyl)-2-acetamidomalonate (2.84 g, 30%)., 547908=The activity of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin was measured by the interaction of soluble VCAM-1 with Jurkat cells (e.g., American Type Culture Collection Nos. TIB 152, TIB 153, and CRL 8163), a human T-cell line which expresses high levels of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin. VCAM-1 interacts with the cell surface in an \u03b14\u03b21 integrin-dependent fashion (Yednock, et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270:28740)., 479601=To a chilled (0\ufffd C.) THF/H2O solution (2:1, 5\u201310 mL) of the appropriate ester was added LiOH (or NaOH) (0.95 equivalents). The temperature was maintained at 0\ufffd C. and the reaction was complete in 1\u20133 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the aqueous phase was lyophilized resulting in the desired carboxylate salt., 518129=1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): \u03b4=7.64 (d, 2H, J=8.24 Hz); 7.26 (m, 13H); 5.16 (q, 2H, J=12.1 Hz); 4.92 (d of t, 1H, J=6.71 & 11.29 Hz); 3.7.70 (d, 1H, J=16.48 Hz); 3.43 (d, 1H, J=16.48 Hz); 3.15 (m, 2H); 2.56 (s, 3H); 2.44 (s, 3H)., 553659=Accordingly, the above-described assay may be performed with a human colon carcinoma cell line, SW 480 (ATTC #CCL228) transfected with cDNA encoding \u03b19 integrin (Yokosaki et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269:26691), in place of the Jurkat cells, to measure the binding of the \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. As a control, SW 480 cells which express other \u03b1 and \u03b21 subunits may be used., 365699=The intermediate N-sulfonyl amino acids of formula IV, wherein R3 is hydrogen, can also be prepared by reacting a sulfonamide of formula V: R1\u2014SO2\u2014NH\u2014R2\u2003\u2003V wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, with a carboxylic acid derivative of the formula L(R3)CHCOOR where L is a leaving group, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, mesylate, tosylate and the like, R3 is as defined above and R is hydrogen or an alkyl group. This reaction is typically conducted by contacting the sulfonamide V with at least one equivalent, preferably 1.1 to 2 equivalents, of the carboxylic acid derivative in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, in an inert diluent, such as DMF, at a temperature ranging from about 24\ufffd C. to about 37\ufffd C. for about 0.5 to about 4 hours. This reaction is further described in Zuckermann et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1992, 114, 10646\u201310647. Preferred carboxylic acid derivatives for use in this reaction are \u03b1-chloro and \u03b1-bromocarboxylic acid esters such as tert-butyl bromoacetate, and the like. When an carboxylic acid ester is employed in this reaction, the ester group is subsequently hydrolyzed using conventional procedures to afford an N-sulfonyl amino acid of formula IV.}",
