(Professors are great, too) What to do for fun Join a club, for example, art or dance club. This will expose you to much more resources. Try to keep up with the things that you always like to do, go to concerts, hit the mountains for a ski, snowboard or hike. Call family, they miss you. Food and Dining LAVC has a Dining Hall. There are lots of choices for people. Eating together with people is a very intimate event. We may not realize it in our day because of the multitude of restaurants, picnic areas, etc. Keep yourself healthy. Your mind, body and spirit thrive best when eating and drinking what you NEED.
