    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention of this application is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific examples thereof have been shown in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not to be limited to the particular forms or methods disclosed, but to the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Once all options have been parsed in frame (2) or the system (at 160) determines that the current frame has no optional fields as in frame (1), the system control logic (at 168 or 170) will return to the main parsing loop (at 108 in FIG. 11). Thus, for \u201cframe (2)\u201d the option processing control loop (at 160 through 166) is alternately applied with the description structures of FIG. 6 and FIGS. 8, 9, and 7. The GP End Of List Option does not refer back to the master option description because it indicates an end to option processing. Any remaining option bits are assumed to be pad and are disregarded so that the check for more options (at 160 in FIG. 12) will fail and return to frame protocol parsing (at 108 in FIG. 11). Using the exemplary frame, \u201cFrame (2),\u201d described above as an example with ParsePtr pointing at line 3, and CurrentProtocol pointing at the GP master option description shown",
