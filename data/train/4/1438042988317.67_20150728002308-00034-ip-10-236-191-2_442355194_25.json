            "Heat processing method and apparatus for semiconductor process - A heat processing method for a semiconductor process includes placing a plurality of target substrates stacked at intervals in a vertical direction within a process field of a process container. Each of the target substrates includes a process object layer on its surface. Then, the method includes supplying an oxidizing gas and a deoxidizing gas to the process field while heating the process field, thereby causing the oxidizing gas and the deoxidizing gas to react with each other to generate oxygen radicals and hydroxyl group radicals, and performing oxidation on the process object layer of the target substrates by use of the oxygen radicals and the hydroxyl group radicals. Then, the method includes heating the process object layer processed by the oxidation, within an atmosphere of an annealing gas containing ozone or oxidizing radicals, thereby performing annealing on the process object layer.",
            "Film formation method and apparatus for semiconductor process - A silicon nitride film is formed on a target substrate by performing a plurality of cycles in a process field configured to be selectively supplied with a first process gas containing a silane family gas and a second process gas containing a nitriding gas. Each of the cycles includes a first supply step of performing supply of the first process gas while maintaining a shut-off state of supply of the second process gas, and a second supply step of performing supply of the second process gas, while maintaining a shut-off state of supply of the first process gas. The method is arranged to repeat a first cycle set with the second supply step including an excitation period of exciting the second process gas and a second cycle set with the second supply step including no period of exciting the second process gas."
