She learn how to survive long in any battle. She is the force to be reckon with.Her goal is to become an ultimate warrior for the Sentinel. Because of Sentinel don't have female melee hero, i made one. Her role is a tank and anti-hero (arguable). She is a total damage dealing hero (also arguable). Surely she is not a support hero because have no disable and any supportive spells (kinda selfish ), but she have 3 defensive skills and 3 offensive. She is a Hybrid.
