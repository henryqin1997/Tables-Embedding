Great for these types of students students that prefer smaller class settings should look into ivy tech. that's one reason i came here because i do believe it is easier to learn in a class where more than likely everyone wants to be there. it is also better if you like more one on one time with your teacher, since the classes are smaller it is easy to get that time. Bang for the buck i believe it is totally worth the money to come here. seeing",
