            "This is an audience recording from the Big Generator tour, recorded in Hollywood, FL (at a place called the \"Sportatium\", according to the notes) in 1988. I think it's just Anderson and Howe performing a small piece of Ritual. Sound quality is muffled but listenable. Interesting and rare track.",
            "Another song from the same Hollywood, FL audience recording. Still muffled but listenable. I guess they didn't perform this track very often, or at least they had never released a live version, which is surprising given the song's popularity amongst fans. They stretch this performance out a bit compared to the studio version. It opens with Anderson giving some nearly incoherent explanation of how the song is about war. OK, if you say so.",
            "An audience recording from the Big Generator tour, recorded in Philadelphia Nov 30, 1987. I guess this was another rarely played live song. Unfortunately the sound quality of this recording is absolutely the pits. Probably the worst sounding thing in the Yesoteric series so far. It's so muffled, distant and hissy that for the first couple minutes all you can make out is a drum beat. It clears up a tiny bit, to the point where you can tell what song it is, but this recording is just unlistenable.",
            "An audience recording from Memphis, TN Jul 7, 1989, which captures this rarely-performed song. I think this might have been early in the tour, and they quickly decided to drop this tune for some reason. The recording is listenable, but very very quiet and mostly treble until the bass suddenly kicks in and is super-loud and slightly distorted. The recording also sounds like it might have been converted to MP3 at some point because it has some \"digital distortion\" on it.",
            "Another rarity from the Memphis audience recording. About the same sound quality as Quartet. Guess the band decided to drop this one too.",
            "Totally pointless. The compiler must have been desperate to for filler to pad out the tape side, so he threw in this King Biscuit Flower Hour promotional \"medley\", which is just clips of a bunch of ABWH live songs jammed together with quick edits. Decent sound quality, but unnecessary.",
            "This is where the Yesoteric series officially jumped the shark. So we're down to bonus tracks from the CD reissue of an obscure 70s French prog rock band, just because they covered a snippet of a Yes song? Sure, they did a decent job of it, but who cares? I've got an audience recording of the band French TV playing a couple minutes worth of \"Ritual\", can I get that included in the next Yesoteric volume?",
            "See above comments.",
            "As mentioned in the notes for tape 11's Rabin soundcheck from this show, some taper somehow recorded a part of the soundcheck a the Seattle stop on the Union tour in 1991. Unlike the Rabin recording, this one is nearly unlistenable. The volume level is so low that you have to crank the volume up to max just to hear it, and then it gets buried in hiss. To make matters worse, the taper starts shifting around about half way through the track, and his rustles and bumps are 100 times louder than the guitar playing, effectively drowning it out. And when it comes right down to it, this is just Howe noodling around and not even playing anything interesting. This easily could have been skipped.",
            "This is listed as a performance from Los Angeles, CA Jul 19, 1986, which I'm pretty sure means that it's from the King Biscuit Flower Hour broadcast that was later officially released. Which makes this recording unnecessary. Actually, Max Bacon's awful singing makes this recording unnecessary."

The keyboardist is Mark Mancina, who later produced ELP's Black Moon. The sound quality is really bad - all treble with a nasty whine through it. If you turn the treble all the way down and the bass all the way up, it's almost listenable., 8249=In 2009, I was digging though some old tapes and found the box of Yesoteric tapes that I had traded for over a decade earlier and had pretty much forgotten about. For some odd reason, I decided to re-listen to them and try to transfer the best of the still unreleased stuff to CDR. That turned into a major project including a lot of research, so I figured while I was going through all that work I should probably write up a web page to document the series and gather all the information into one place., 244005=Side One: South Side of the Sky (Tulsa, OK 1975) Sweet Dreams (3/84) Polonaise Igor solo (both from 3/26/98 Warsaw, Poland, no Dolby) Owner of a Lonely Heart Open Your Eyes I've Seen All Good People Roundabout (unplugged from the Mark & Brian show, 1998) The Neat Change: I Lied to Auntie May Sandman (Peter Banks from 68) Winston's Fumbs: (a later post questioned whether it was \"Fumbs\" or \"Frumbs\") Real Crazy Apartment Snow White (Kaye from 67), 7311=Eventually someone came up with the idea of hosting the Yesoteric material on a Yes fan web site as MP3s. Unfortunately, the site had fairly close ties with the band (I think it eventually became the band's semi-official site), so Yes (or their management) eventually found out about it. Needless to say, they weren't too keen on the idea, especially since a lot of the material had either been officially released or was being considered for bonus material on future releases. So they politely but firmly asked that the MP3s be taken down. I'm not sure about this, but they might have also asked that the tapes stop being traded and all \"promotion\" of the Yesoteric series cease, because sometime around the year 2000 it became very difficult to find any information about it. Although I did find a couple web pages that seemed to indicate that the MP3s continued to circulate via CDR trading for a while after that.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Side 1 The original \"cover\" on my copy of tape one had the songs listed in completely the wrong order (or else the tape had them in the wrong order). Anyway, some of the titles of the many, many remixes of the same songs might be mixed up (no pun intended), but I've done my best to figure out what's what. There are a couple odds and ends from the 1970s thrown in as filler at the end of side two. Anyway, this first tape includes the ton of remixes that the band (or their producers) created out of the songs from 90125, Big Generator and Union. Maybe this material was chosen to kick off the series because it has fairly decent sound quality (compared to the rest of the tapes) and the material was still \"fresh\" (or at least recent) at the time. Union. I guess when the band was going strong they released most everything and didn't generate a lot of \"rarities\", but when they were struggling artistically they created a lot of \"unreleaseable\" stuff. Going For the One era through Close to the Edge in the whole Yesoteric series. But there's sure a lot of stuff from the post- The Yes Album through Oddly, the first tape of the series starts off with material from the \"YesWest\" version of the band, not with the \"classic\" line-up of Yes in their progressive rock heyday.

Side 2 Artist Song Length Notes Yes Rhythm of Love, Move to the Rhythm Mix 6:58 I could easily have the titles of these versions of Rhythm of Love mixed up, but I think they're correct based on the song lengths listed on the tape case. They're all just various dance versions, and all sound pretty similar to my ears. Yes Rhythm, Dance to the Rhythm Mix 4:26 See above notes. I have no idea where all these dance remixes of this song came from. Yes Rhythm, Rhythm of Dub mix 7:56 See above notes. This one is a little more muffled than the rest, particularly towards the end. Yes Lift Me Up, a capella opening 5:24 This is fairly similar to the album version, except that it opens with the chorus sung a capella. No idea where this comes from. Yes Big Generator remix 3:36 This remix brings the bass more to the front and features some alternate lyrics (that sound like they were improvised by Anderson on the spot) near the end. The recording is very muffled and hissy and it sounds like the tape was damaged at one point. It's also fairy quiet and \"distant\" sounding. No",
