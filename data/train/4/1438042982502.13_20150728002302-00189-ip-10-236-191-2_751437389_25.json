Whether this is funded by direct taxes or by mandates to employers, this will be an added form of tax in the broad sense. For example, local schools that must provide additional\u00a0 insurance benefits to part-time workers will burden local taxpayers. Similarly a restaurant must greatly increase menu prices to pay for part-time worker medical coverage.. An even bigger problem is the unemployed that have no employer to pick up the tab. Another is the partly employed. A person working 25 hours per week on each of two jobs is still considered a part-time worker and probably receives no health care benefits at the present time. A an added problem arises with the fully employed workers for very small businesses and small town government agencies that will likely fold if forced to pay health care benefits. An enormous arises with job applicants with serious preconditions in health that are terribly expensive to a health care insurance plan such as job applicants with AIDS, seriously ill children, drug dependencies, need of organ transplants, etc. Still another compounding problem arises with the explosion in demand for health care workers at all levels who will be needed to provide for over 40 million previously uninsured. Taxpayers one way or another will have to pick up the tab for educating and training these workers. Still another problem is that taxpayers will have to build many new hospitals and medical clinics. In other words the costs keep piling up for any type of universal health care, and these costs will likely be unmentioned burdens in the political campaigns of 2008.

This proposed Statement would replace and enhance the disclosure requirements in FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, for all outstanding contingencies, both those recognized on the balance sheet and those contingencies that would be recognized as liabilities if the criteria for recognition in paragraph 8 of Statement 5 were met; it as well applies to contingent liabilities from business combinations. The proposal would \"...(a) expand the population of loss contingencies that are required to be disclosed, (b) require disclosure of specific quantitative and qualitative information about those loss contingencies, (c) require a tabular reconciliation of recognized loss contingencies to enhance financial statement transparency, and (d) provide an exemption from disclosing certain required information if disclosing that information would be prejudicial to an entity's position in a dispute.\" In the proposal, the FASB states that the project was taken on because \"investors and other users of financial information have expressed concerns that disclosures about loss contingencies under the existing guidance ... do not provide adequate information to assist users of financial statements in assessing the likelihood, timing, and amount of future cash flows associated with loss contingencies.\" Clearly, the WSJ Opinion page editors disagree with this assessment (see the related article) and FASB Chairman Bob Herz responds to their Op-Ed piece., 169701=Humor Between September 1 and September 30, 2008, 765831=With the various types of structured-finance deals, a trend began of companies using Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) to hide risks. From an accounting perspective, the key question was whether a company that owned particular financial assets needed to disclose those assets in its financial statements even after it transferred them to an SPE. Just as derivatives dealers had argued that swaps should not be included in their balance sheets, financial companies began arguing that their interest in SPEs did not need to be disclosed . . . In 1991. the acting chief accountant of the SEC, concerned that companies might abuse this accounting standard, wrote a letter saying the outside investment had to be at least three percent (a requirement that helped implode Enron and its auditor Andersen because the three percent investments were phony):, 326894=The Enron story is likely to appear in accounting classrooms for years, much as Equity Funding's scandal did throughout the 1970s and beyond. Enron's downfall contains many useful lessons and this book may be the best at detailing them for accounting and auditing students. It is also a great morality play with important ethical lapses and lessons. Interestingly, the book begins with a Statement of Values reprinted from Enron's 1998 annual report. It also describes the Code of Ethics at Enron and how Lay often touted the integrity of the company's leaders. Amazing., 671129=The elusiveness of a meaning for 'true and fair' in an accounting context stems from a lack of meaning for that quintessentially British phrase in a capital markets context. Financial reporting is about producing information: is it possible that truth telling could not result in fair reporting? Answer: no way. Therefore, 'and fair' adds nothing whatsoever; and besides, everyone learns in Accounting 101 that accrual accounting and 'truth' don't mix anyway. The point is that cunning Tweedie, like Soc Gen and its auditors, can construe 'true and fair' to mean anything and at any time. Just like the emperor in the cautionary fairy tale, IFRS wears no clothes; his royal highness and subjects are deceived by the Tweedie tailor (pun intended) to disbelieve their eyes, and to behave as if IFRS is adorned with some noble British bromide.

The financial regulators have a wider remit and are also concerned with the financial health of the whole system. These shortcomings were recognised after the 1929 stock market crash.

It's also on a lot of small businesses and two-earner middle-aged middle-class couples in their peak earnings years in high cost-of-living areas. (Obama's large increase in energy taxes, not documented here, would disproportionately harm low-income Americans. And, while he says he will not raise taxes on the middle class, he'll need many more tax hikes to pay for his big increase in spending.) . . . Now trade. In the primaries, Sen. Obama was famously protectionist, claiming he would rip up and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Since its passage (for which former President Bill Clinton ran a brave anchor leg, given opposition to trade liberalization in his party), Nafta has risen to almost mythological proportions as a metaphor for the alleged harm done by trade, globalization and the pace of technological change. Yet since Nafta was passed (relative to the comparable period before passage), U.S. manufacturing output grew more rapidly and reached an all-time high last year; the average unemployment rate declined as employment grew 24%; real hourly compensation in the business sector grew twice as fast as before; agricultural exports destined for Canada and Mexico have grown substantially and trade among the three nations has tripled; Mexican wages have risen each year since the peso crisis of 1994; and the two binational Nafta environmental institutions have provided nearly $1 billion for 135 environmental infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border.

What's more, these changes have been adopted and implemented by parties left and right. This Europe is a shining example of exactly the sort of postpartisan government action that the Obama campaign says it is about. The cutting of corporate income- tax rates is an excellent example of European market-friendly bipartisanship. Germany's right-left coalition of Christian and Social Democrats implemented a large rate cut earlier this year, reducing the top marginal corporate rate to about 30% from 39%.

These traditionally left-of-center parties understand that in a globalized economy, wealth and investment are mobile, flowing to those countries that provide hospitable investment climates.

First, big lies are woven into a large dose of truth, so they won't look to be as big as they are. There are certainly many things in the SEC's proposal to recommend it, especially along the lines of expanding the types of reserves that would be disclosed, and updating important definitions. Second, when the justification for a proposal makes no sense, there can be no debate; you can't tell the emperor he's naked. The lesson of the Cox's SEC is to never forget about the big special interests that write big checks to the big politicians that made him emperor for a day.

The IASB is also working on off-balance sheet items with the key question being: when should an entity be brought onto another entity's balance sheet? The input received in these meetings will help the IASB in shaping its forthcoming proposals on reviewing consolidation rules under IFRS. Deliverables are expected in 2009. Proper due process must be carried out. I believe we need to look hard at issues such as dynamic provisioning \u2013 and how to account for prudential reserves built up by banks to buffer for bad times. It should not have escaped people's attention that banks in Spain were better placed to withstand the turmoil because they had not yet adopted the relevant IFRS Standard. There is a lesson there that needs to be drawn .... On accounting, SEC Chairman Cox has unveiled a roadmap where US companies would switch from US GAAP to IFRS by 2014. Unthinkable only two years ago! A dramatic signal indeed. Following the EU's lead, the US is indicating it also wants to choose global standards. One set, in sight, at last.

The data show that the 2003 Bush tax cuts caused what may be the biggest increase in tax payments by the rich in American history. The nearby chart shows that the top 1% of taxpayers, those who earn above $388,806, paid 40% of all income taxes in 2006, the highest share in at least 40 years. The top 10% in income, those earning more than $108,904, paid 71%. Barack Obama says he's going to cut taxes for those at the bottom, but that's also going to be a challenge because Americans with an income below the median paid a record low 2.9% of all income taxes, while the top 50% paid 97.1%. Perhaps he thinks half the country should pay all the taxes to support the other half. Aha, we are told: The rich paid more taxes because they made a greater share of the money. That is true. The top 1% earned 22% of all reported income. But they also paid a share of taxes not far from double their share of income. In other words, the tax code is already steeply progressive. We also know from income mobility data that a very large percentage in the top 1% are \"new rich,\" not inheritors of fortunes. There is rapid turnover in the ranks of the highest income earners, so much so that people who started in the top 1% of income in the 1980s and 1990s suffered the largest declines in earnings of any income group over the subsequent decade, according to Treasury Department studies of actual tax returns.

The key twist was that, in three years, PERCS automatically converted into common stock, according to a specified stock if the common stock was at $50, so as to limit the upside of PERCS. Essentially, an investor buying PERCS committed to buy a company's stock in three years, and also sold some of the upside potential of that stock by selling a three-year call option (similar to those Andy Krieger was trading at Bankers Trust).
