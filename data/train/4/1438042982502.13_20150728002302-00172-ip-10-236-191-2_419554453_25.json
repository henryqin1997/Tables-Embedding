A light sensing assembly in the input device is positioned to receive scattered light and includes a band-pass filter. A barrier is located directly above the area where the light beam is incident on the top surface to prevent light from traveling directly from the light source assembly to the light sensing assembly. 20090002347 Published Description Patent application number Wei Huang, Hefei CN 05-07-2015 MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES, AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME - The present disclosure provides methods and systems for assaying a sample. A microfluidic device to perform an assay of a sample (e.g., biological sample) is described having a sample application site, a porous component and a flow channel. The porous component provides for uniform dissolution of a reagent and mixing of the sample and reagent without filtering the sample. 20150125882 07-17-2014 LOW-COST POINT-OF-CARE ASSAY DEVICE - The present disclosure provides methods and systems for analyzing a liquid sample. A micro-fluidic device to perform an assay of a liquid sample is described that includes a sample application site and a vent outlet in fluid communication with the capillary channel. A cap is provided that is",

Embodiments provide a minimally invasive, yet precisely accurate, approach to determining whether tumors are malignant or benign by distinguishing the characteristics of contrast reagent activity in benign and malignant tumors. Exemplary embodiments provide MRI measured biomarkers for tumor malignancy determination, effectively eliminating or limiting the false positives suffered by existing MRI techniques. 08-18-2011 20140058249 METHOD AND APPARATUS USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FOR CANCER IDENTIFICATION - Embodiments provide a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique and optionally software\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cshutter-speed\u201d model\u2014to analyze image data of cancer patients.
