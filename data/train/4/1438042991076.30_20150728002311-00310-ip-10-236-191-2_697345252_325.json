In general, these provisions generally will not apply after December 31, 2011, provided, however, that such provisions will continue to apply thereafter in respect of distributions by a regulated investment company that is a U.S. real property holding corporation or would be so treated for this purpose to the extent such distributions are attributable to certain capital gain dividends from REITs. Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the application to their own circumstances of the above-described rules. It is unknown as of now whether or not this rule, which has expired, will be extended., 642785=Unless treated as a \u201cdomestically-controlled\u201d RIC, a Fund will be a \u201cU.S. real property holding corporation\u201d if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (which includes shares of U.S. real property holding corporations and certain participating debt securities) equals or exceeds 50% of the fair market value of such interests plus its interests in real property located outside the United States plus any other assets used or held for use in a business. A \u201cdomestically controlled\u201d RIC is any RIC in which at all times during the relevant testing period 50% or more in value of the RIC\u2019s stock was owned by U.S. persons. This provision relating to domestically controlled regulated investment companies generally will not apply after December 31, 2011. It is unknown as of now whether or not this rule, which has expired, will be extended., 427043=The investment restrictions set forth below have been adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) as fundamental policies that cannot be changed with respect to a Fund without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. The investment objective of each Fund and all other investment policies or practices of the Fund are considered by the Trust not to be fundamental and accordingly may be changed without shareholder approval. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a \u201cmajority of the outstanding voting securities\u201d means the lesser of the vote of (i) 67% or more of the Shares of the Fund present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding Shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the Shares of the Fund., 7047=The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the Registrant shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this Registration Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, or until the Registration Statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine., 482576=For each in-person quarterly Board Meeting, each Independent Trustee receives $1,500. For each additional in-person meeting, each Independent Trustee receives $1,000 and for any phone meeting, each Independent Trustee receives $500. In addition, the Independent Trustees are reimbursed for all reasonable travel expenses relating to their attendance at the Board Meetings. The table below shows the aggregate compensation to be paid by the Trust to each non-interested trustee during the Trust\u2019s fiscal period ending April 30, 2013 (estimating future payments based upon existing arrangements):, 2739=REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 T, 733922=In the calendar year 2012, the dates of regular holidays affecting the following securities markets present the worst case redemption cycle for a Fund as follows:, 287418=The selection and weighting of Fund securities are implemented using a sampled portfolio of the Emerging Market. Additionally, the Fund may hold short positions in exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and other exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d) whose returns are highly correlated to the Emerging Market., 90307=The portfolio management team uses equity recommendations from a leading investment research firm serving leading hedge funds, institutions, and other investors as the basis for the Fund\u2019s positions. Each day, the research firm produces and delivers to the portfolio manager a group of equity security recommendations that the research firm deems to have the greatest potential for capital depreciation. These equities comprise the Fund\u2019s portfolio. The recommendations may include exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and other exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d)., 476813=The Trust has concluded that Mr. Chao should serve as trustee of the Funds because of the experience he has gained working in a business capacity for several public companies, and the experience he has gained serving as trustee of the other Funds advised by the Advisor since 2008., 606484=Dividends from net investment income are declared and paid at least annually by each Fund. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for each Fund to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code, in all events in a manner consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Trust may distribute at least annually amounts representing the full dividend yield on the underlying Portfolio Securities of the Funds, net of expenses of the Funds, as if each Fund owned such underlying Portfolio Securities for the entire dividend period in which case some portion of each distribution may result in a return of capital for tax purposes for certain shareholders., 472672=Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee has been established to: (i) assist the Board of Trustees in matters involving mutual fund governance and industry practices; (ii) select and nominate candidates for appointment or election to serve as Trustees who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust or its Advisor or distributor (as defined by the 1940 Act); and (iii) advise the Board of Trustees on ways to improve its effectiveness. All of the Independent Trustees serve on the Nominating Committee. As stated above, each Trustee holds office for an indefinite term until the occurrence of certain events. In filling Board vacancies, the Nominating Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders. Nominee recommendations should be submitted to the Trust at its mailing address stated in the Fund\u2019s Prospectus and should be directed to the attention of the IndexIQ Active ETF Trust Nominating Committee., 407953=Preliminary Statement of Additional Information Subject to Change Dated August 21, 2012, 452061=The Chairman of the Board, Adam Patti, is an interested person of the Trust as that term is defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the \u201cInterested Trustee\u201d) because of his affiliation with the Advisor. Two of the Trustees, Reena Aggarwal and Gene Chao, and their immediate family members have no affiliation or business connection with the Advisor or the Funds\u2019 principal underwriter or any of their affiliated persons and do not own any stock or other securities issued by the Advisor or the Funds\u2019 principal underwriter. These Trustees are not Interested Persons of the Trust and are referred to herein as \u201cIndependent Trustees.\u201d, 556974=The Administrator, through the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cNSCC\u201d) (discussed below), makes available on each Business Day, immediately prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time), the list of the names and the required number of shares of each Deposit Security to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business Day) for the Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, in order to effect creations of Creation Units of the Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of the Deposit Securities is made available., 566438=Placement of Creation Orders Outside the Clearing Process. Fund Deposits made outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement with the Trust, the Distributor and the Administrator. A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order creating Creation Units to be effected outside the Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party, but such orders must state that the DTC Participant is not using the Clearing Process and that the creation of Creation Units will instead be effected through a transfer of securities and cash directly through DTC. A Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the DTC Participant on the Transmittal Date in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Trust by no later than 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, of the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to the Administrator through the Federal Reserve wire system in a timely manner so as to be received by the Administrator no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the next Business Day immediately following such Transmittal Date. An order to create Creation Units outside the Clearing Process is deemed received by the Distributor on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received by the Distributor not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date; and (ii) all other procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. However, if the Administrator does not receive both the requisite Deposit Securities and the Cash Component by 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., respectively, on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date, such order will be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such cancelled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation Units of the Fund so created will occur no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor., 581360=With respect to the Fund, the Administrator, through the NSCC, makes available immediately prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time) on each Business Day, the Fund Securities that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities which are applicable to creations of Creation Units., 377560=Long-term capital gains of non-corporate Fund shareholders (i.e., individuals, trusts and estates) are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% for taxable years that begin on or before December 31, 2012. In addition, for those taxable years, Fund distributions of qualifying dividend income to non-corporate Fund shareholders qualify for taxation at long-term capital gain rates. Under current law, the taxation of qualifying dividend income at long-term capital gain rates will no longer apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012., 312013=The Funds may invest in listed and liquid depositary receipts, including listed unsponsored depositary receipts that have been in existence since 1984. Unsponsored depositary receipts may be established by a depositary without participation by the underlying issuer. Holders of an unsponsored depositary receipt generally bear all the costs associated with establishing the unsponsored depositary receipt. These investments may involve additional risks and considerations including, for example, risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or region, currency fluctuations or controls and the possibility of expropriation, nationalization or confiscatory taxation. The issuers of the securities underlying unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the United States and, therefore, there may be less information available regarding such issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Additionally, to the extent the value of a depositary receipt held by a Fund fails to track that of the underlying security, the use of the depositary receipt may result in tracking error in such Fund., 438334=The Funds may lend portfolio securities constituting up to 331/3% of their total assets (as permitted by the 1940 Act) to unaffiliated broker-dealers, banks or other recognized institutional borrowers of securities, provided that the borrower at all times maintains with the Funds cash, U.S. government securities or equivalent collateral or provides an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Funds equal in value to at least 100% of the value of the securities loaned. During the time portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the Funds an amount equivalent to any dividends or interest paid on such securities, and the Funds may receive an agreed-upon amount of interest income (to be retained by the Funds) from a borrower who delivered equivalent collateral or provided a letter of credit. Loans are subject to termination at the option of the Funds or the borrower. The Funds may invest any cash collateral and earn additional income, or it may receive an agreed-upon amount of interest income from the borrower who has delivered equivalent collateral or a letter of credit. The Funds may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a negotiated portion of the income earned on the cash to the borrower or placing broker. The Funds do not have the right to vote securities on loan, but could terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment. The Funds currently do not intend to lend their portfolio securities., 253283=The selection and weighting of Fund securities are implemented using a sampled portfolio of the International Market. Additionally, the Fund may hold short positions in exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and other exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d) whose returns are highly correlated to the International Market., 317788=The Funds may invest in (or short) ETFs, exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d). Through their short positions in ETFs, ETNs and ETPs, the Funds will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles investments, or reference assets in the case of ETNs, including the possibility that the value of the securities or instruments held by an ETF, ETN or ETP could increase or decrease. Certain of the ETFs, ETPs, or ETNs may hold common portfolio positions, thereby reducing any diversification benefits. In addition, the value of an ETN may be influenced by time to maturity, level of supply and demand for the ETN, volatility and lack of liquidity in the underlying market, changes in the applicable interest rates, and changes in the issuer\u2019s credit rating and economic, legal, political or geographic events that affect the referenced market. If a rating agency lowers the issuer\u2019s credit rating, the value of the ETN will decline and a lower credit rating reflects a greater risk that the issuer will default on its obligation. The ETNs and ETPs in which the Funds invest are pooled investment vehicles that are not registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) and, therefore, are not subject to the regulatory scheme of the 1940 Act including the investor protections afforded by the 1940 Act., 383308=Special Issues for Foreign Shareholders. If a Fund shareholder is not a U.S. citizen or resident or if a Fund shareholder is a foreign entity, the Fund\u2019s ordinary income dividends (including distributions of net short-term capital gains and other amounts that would not be subject to U.S. withholding tax if paid directly to foreign Fund shareholders) will be subject, in general, to withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or at a lower rate established under an applicable tax treaty). However, for Fund tax years that began on or before December 31, 2011, interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends generally will not be subject to withholding tax; provided that the foreign shareholder furnishes the Fund with a completed IRS Form W-8BEN (or acceptable substitute documentation) establishing the Fund shareholder\u2019s status as foreign and that the Fund does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the foreign Fund shareholder would be subject to withholding tax if the foreign shareholder were to receive the related amounts directly rather than as dividends from the Fund. It is unknown as of now, whether or not these special rules, which have currently expired, will be extended., 679896=[ \u2022 ] [ \u2022 ], 2012, 154735=The selection and weighting of Fund securities are implemented using a sampled portfolio of the U.S. Small Cap Market. Additionally, the Fund may hold short positions in exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and other exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d) whose returns are highly correlated to the U.S. Small Cap Market., 477516=The Funds are newly formed and did not have any shares outstanding as of the date of this SAI. Listed below for each Trustee is the aggregate dollar range of equity securities in all registered investment companies overseen by each Trustee that are in the same family of investment companies as the Trust, as of December 31, 2011., 636858=Recent legislation, effective after December 31, 2012, if applicable to a shareholder, will impose a new 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income. Please consult your tax advisor regarding this tax., 731764=The dates of the Regular Holidays in calendar year 2012 are:, 420433=(each, a \u201cFund\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d). Other portfolios may be added to the Trust in the future. The shares of the Funds are referred to herein as \u201cFund Shares\u201d or \u201cShares.\u201d The offering of Shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d)., 373343=A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if the Fund does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the twelve months ended October 31 of such year. Each Fund intends to make distributions necessary to avoid the 4% excise tax., 40362=The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, exchange-traded notes (\u201cETNs\u201d) and other exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d). Through its positions in ETFs, ETNs and ETPs, the Fund will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles\u2019 investments, or reference assets in the case of ETNs, including the possibility that the value of the securities or instruments held by an ETF, ETN or ETP could decrease. In addition, certain of the ETFs, ETPs, or ETNs may hold common portfolio positions, thereby reducing any diversification benefits., 408552=[___________], 2012, 776668=All accounts, books and other documents required by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder are maintained at:, 429780=B. Borrow money, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and any applicable exemptive relief. The 1940 Act presently allows a fund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow money for temporary purposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the time of the loan and (3) enter into reverse repurchase agreements., 508339=The following table provides additional information about other portfolios or accounts managed by the Funds\u2019 portfolio managers as of _______ ___, 2012., 718702=At [ \u2022 ][ \u2022 ], 2012, certain officers of the Trust were also employees of the Advisor., 361808=The NAV is calculated by the Administrator and Custodian and determined each Business Day as of the close of regular trading on the [_________] (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. New York time).

Orders to redeem Creation Units outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed the Participant Agreement. A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of Creation Units to be effected outside the Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party, but such orders must state that the DTC Participant is not using the Clearing Process and that redemption of Creation Units will instead be effected through transfer of shares directly through DTC. An order to redeem Creation Units outside the Clearing Process is deemed received by the Administrator on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received by the Administrator not later than 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, if transmitted by mail, or by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, if transmitted by other means, on such Transmittal Date; (ii) such order is accompanied or proceeded by the requisite number of shares of the Fund and the Cash Redemption Amount specified in such order, which delivery must be made through DTC to the Administrator no later than 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., respectively, Eastern Time, on the next Business Day following such Transmittal Date (the \u201cDTC Cut-Off-Time\u201d); and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed., 733320=The dates of the Regular Holidays in calendar year 2013 are:, 419245=The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on [_________] and is authorized to have multiple segregated series or portfolios.

The Trust currently consists of a number of separate investment portfolios, this SAI addresses the following investment portfolios of the Trust:, 561632=All orders to create Creation Units must be placed for one or more Creation Unit size aggregations of shares (50,000 in the case of the Funds). All orders to create Creation Units, whether through the Clearing Process (through a Participating Party) or outside the Clearing Process (through a DTC Participant), must be received by the Distributor no later than the close of the regular trading session on the Exchange (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) (\u201cClosing Time\u201d), in each case on the date such order is placed in order for the creation of Creation Units to be effected based on the NAV of shares of the Fund as next determined on such date after receipt of the order in proper form.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by trustees, officers or controlling persons of the Registrant in connection with the successful defense of any act, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such trustees, officers or controlling persons in connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issues., 639101=In general.

It is unknown as of now whether or not these special rules, which have expired, will be extended., 542010=Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual shareholders meeting if the 1940 Act does not require such a meeting. Generally, there will not be annual meetings of Trust shareholders.
