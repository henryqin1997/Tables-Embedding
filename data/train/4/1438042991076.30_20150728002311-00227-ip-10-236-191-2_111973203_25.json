            "Number of times the entire transmit window was full. If this number is small compared with the number of sequenced packets transmitted, then either the local node is not sending large bursts of data to the remote node, or acknowledging packets are being received so promptly that the window limit is never reached.",
            "Average round-trip time, in microseconds, for a packet to be sent and acknowledged. VC round trip time values are dependent on the delayed ACK or the ACKholdoff delay, that is, 100 ms. The VC trip time is also dependent on the network traffic. If there is sufficient cluster traffic, the receive window at the remote node gets filled and the ACK is delivered sooner. If the cluster is idle with no traffic, there may be a delay of 100ms to send the ACK. Hence, in an idle cluster with less traffic, the VC round trip delay value is normally high. As the traffic increases, the VC round trip time delay value drops.",
            "Average deviation, in microseconds, of the round-trip time. Deviation/Variance: Whenever a new ACK delay is measured, it is compared with the current estimate of the ACK delay. The difference is a measure of the error in the delay estimate (delayError). This delayError is used as a correction to update the current estimate of ACK delay. To prevent a \"bad\" measurement from estimate, the correction due to a single measurement is limited to a fraction. The average of the absolute value of the delayError from the mean is used as estimation for the delays variance.",
