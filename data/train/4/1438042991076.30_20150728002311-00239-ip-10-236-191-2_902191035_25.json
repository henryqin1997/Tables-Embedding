    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot State Fair Community College is providing me with many opportunities to challenge myself academically. It also provides the algebra curriculum in graduated steps to better serve each students individual needs; they offer algebra classes from basic math all the way to college algebra. State Fair also has several higher level math classes for those who want to challenge themselves further or for those who need to fulfill a degree requirement. There is much to be said about their biological science classes also. I have found the teachers to be very friendly while also providing sufficient course rigor. I am also involved in a student success program called TRiO. Through TRiO I have been able to receive free, personal tutoring when needed and I also have the opportunity to share my knowledge with other by becoming a tutor or mentor. The only downfall I have found in the schools academics thus far is the chemistry department. Unlike most other universities the chemistry classes have no formal lecture time, which I found made it very difficult to learn new material.
