The CIDI is a comprehensive, fully standardized interview that is used to assess mental disorders and provide diagnoses according to definitions and criteria of the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10, World Health Organization 1992, 1993) and the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, 1994). The CIDI is especially suitable for large epidemiological studies because it can be administered by lay interviewers, does not require outside informants or medical records, and does not assume the presence of a current disorder. It is used in both clinical and research settings., 7382=Title: Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) (CIQGAD_C ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2003 - 2004 First Published: August, 2006 Revised: NA Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Composite Diagnostic Interview Schedule Record Source: NHANES 2003 - 2004 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2003 - 2004 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 3257=Special examination sample weights were developed for the half-sample that was eligible for the interview. Because of small samples sizes, it is recommended that the data from the 2-year files (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) be combined and that 6-year weights be used for all analyses. For an estimate for the 6-years 1999-2004, a 6-year weight variable can be created by taking 2/3 of the 4 year weight for each sampled person in 1999-2002 and 1/3 of the 2 year weight for each sampled person in 2003-04. For more information on weighting, please see the NHANES analytic guidelines.}",

A value of \u201c1\u201d indicates a positive diagnosis, and a value of \u201c5\u201d indicates a negative diagnosis. The NHANES CIDI questions were developed in accordance with the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for three diagnoses. As part of the final data preparation effort, responses to the questions were evaluated using a computer algorithm, first to assess each criterion, and then to combine criteria into diagnoses. The diagnostic algorithms were constructed criterion by",
