    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51908=A mixture of 450 mg of ibuprofen, thickener 0.1-1.0% by weight and 100 mg of citric acid was adjusted to pH 3 with 1N sodium hydroxide and treated by a disperser at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes. Then, ibuprofen particles were sedimented by centrifugation, a supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and a concentration of the dissolved ibuprofen was determined by HPLC method., 90572=A mixture of 60 g of ibuprofen, 12 g of surface active agent (polyglycerol monostearate), 50 g of glycerol and 200 g of 0.5% citrate buffer (pH 3) was processed at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes by means of Micros MIC-0 type mixer (Nara Kikai Seisakusho) and then diluted with said citrate buffer to 50 times. Xanthan gum was added as a thickener, the mixture was uniformly dispersed and then another drug dihydrocodein phosphate was added. The whole mixture was uniformly dispersed by means of a disperser, a total amount was adjusted to 100% by adding purified water and then heated at a temperature of from 55 to 65\ufffd C. for 20 minutes., 57518=A mixture of 60 g of ibuprofen, 12 g of surface active agent (polyglycerol monostearate), 50 g of glycerol and 200 g of 0.5% citrate buffer (pH 4) was treated at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes by means of Micros MIC-0 type mixer (Nara Kikai Seisakusho) and then diluted with said citrate buffer to 50 times. For comparison, 50-fold diluted ibuprofen with said citrate buffer, the surface active agent and glycerol were processed by means of pulverizing and dispersing apparatus recited in Table 4 (provided that the disperser was treated according to the method of Test Example 2 and the homomixer was according to the method of Test Example 1) and then particle size was measured by means of a particle size distribution meter (Microtrack Inc.).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Furthermore, according to the process for the preparation of this invention, there may be simply and easily prepared a suspension having superior properties. According to this invention, there can be provided a suspension of a sparingly water-soluble acidic drug (especially, ibuprofen and the like) which has excellent thermal stability and dispersion stability over a prolonged period of time and highly dissolvable, and which does not need to be redispersed by vigorous shaking just before oral administeration because no tight sedimentation of suspended particles to the bottom of a vessel occurs. Moreover, the present suspension can be subjected to a high-temperature sterilization and can be prepared so as not to give an unpleasant rough feeling in the mouth. Industrial Applicability q.s. Purified water q.s. Antiseptic mg 300 0.5% Citrate buffer (pH 3) mg 10000 Sweetening agent mg 100 Titanium oxide",
