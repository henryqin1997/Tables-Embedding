During the 2014 season, eleven schools competed in Sun Belt football: Appalachian State, Arkansas State, Georgia Southern, Georgia State, Idaho, Louisiana\u2013Lafayette, Louisiana\u2013Monroe, New Mexico State, South Alabama, Texas State, and Troy.[1], 113866=In 2014, the SBC placed three teams in bowl games through their tie-ins: Louisiana\u2013Lafayette, Arkansas State, and South Alabama. Texas State was also bowl-eligible but did not receive a bowl invitation.[29] Georgia Southern and Appalachian State, despite having bowl-eligible records (9-3 and 7-5, respectively) and the former winning the conference championship, were not bowl-eligible due to FCS-to-FBS transition rules, since 81 full FBS members became bowl-eligible for the 76 bowl slots available., 13164=The conference title was won by Georgia Southern, in its first year as both a Sun Belt member and an FBS program. The Eagles became only the third team to win a conference championship in their first FBS season. The other two schools to accomplish this feat were Nevada, Big West Conference champions in 1992, and Marshall, which won the Mid-American Conference crown in 1997. Georgia Southern also became the first team ever to go unbeaten in conference play in its first FBS season (both the 1992 Nevada and 1997 Marshall teams lost once in conference play).[2]}",
