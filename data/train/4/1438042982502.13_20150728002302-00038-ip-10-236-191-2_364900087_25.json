Usage Guidelines The sample command enables the specified sampling method for the object. You can specify the following sampling methods. Absolute Delta Changed Absolute sampling uses the value of the MIB object during sampling. The default sampling method is absolute. Delta sampling uses the last sampling value maintained in the application. This method requires applications to do continuous sampling. The changed sampling method uses the changed value of the object since the last sample. Examples The following example shows how to specify the sampling method as absolute:  Router(config)# snmp mib event trigger owner owner1 name triggerA Router(config-event-trigger)# sample absolute",
