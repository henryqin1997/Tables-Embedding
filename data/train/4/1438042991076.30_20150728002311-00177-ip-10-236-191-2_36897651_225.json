In the anime episode Espeon, Not Included, the four elder sisters' fans match the elemental themes of their Pok\u00e9mon. Both of the anime episodes which featured all of the Kimono Sisters had Masaaki Iwane as animation director. Bill's mother was once a Kimono Girl, according to Pok\u00e9 Maniac Brent, who reveals trivia about Bill via Pok\u00e9gear. In HeartGold and SoulSilver versions, when the Kimono Girls are summoning the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, they dance clockwise for Ho-Oh and counter-clockwise for Lugia. In the French and German localizations of Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the name Keiko was used for different Kimono Girls. For some reason, the Kimono girls were given different but still Japanese names in the English versions. The French localization also followed suit, but were renamed to their original Japanese names in Generation IV with the exception of Koume, who was referred to as Umeko instead. Trivia The Kimono Girls make a small cameo",
