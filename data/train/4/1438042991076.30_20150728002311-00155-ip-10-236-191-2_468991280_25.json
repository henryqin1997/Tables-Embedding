Samples were generated with oligo controls by making 2%, 1% mutant and 100% wildtype and all samples were mixed with 1% of the internal control. Four reaction conditions were tested using two different dilutions (1:20 and 1:100, Table 5, T is the mutant nucleotide and C is the control nucleotide) of the labeled nucleotides to see how this influences variability. The results of these reactions are shown in FIG. 1.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18704=This application claims priority to, and the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 60/357,585, filed Feb. 15, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein., 78246=In one aspect, methods of the invention comprise interrogating in a biological sample one or more DNA fragment(s) of a length that would not be substantially present in noncancerous cells or cellular debris. In a preferred embodiment, such fragments are larger than a typical apoptotic spindle fragment, or larger than about 170 base pairs. However, also in a preferred embodiment, methods of the invention comprise interrogating DNA fragments that are greater than about 200 base pairs, and preferably greater than about 500 base pairs. There is no upper limit on these fragments, as all that is necessary is that the fragment be larger than an apoptotic fragment. Typically, however, fragments indicative of cancer or precancer cells are between about 200 and about 3500 base pairs, and ideally between about 500 and about 2500 base pairs., 22811=Attempts have been made to identify and use nucleic acid events that are indicative of cancer and other diseases. However, even when such events are identified, using them to screen patient samples, especially heterogeneous samples, has proven unsuccessful either due to an inability to obtain sufficient sample material, or due to the low sensitivity that results from measuring only a single marker. For example, simply obtaining an adequate amount of human DNA from one type of heterogeneous sample, stool, has proven difficult. See Villa, et al., Gastroenterol., 110: 1346-1353 (1996) (reporting that only 44.7% of all stool specimens, and only 32.6% of stools from healthy individuals produced sufficient DNA for mutation analysis). Other reports in which adequate DNA has been obtained have reported low sensitivity in identifying a patient's disease status based upon a single cancer-associated mutation. See Eguchi, et al., Cancer, 77: 1707-1710 (1996) (using a p53 mutation as a marker for cancer)., 66156=In another embodiment, methods of the invention comprise extending the primer extension product in the presence of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides, the nucleotides being of the same type (e.g., A, T, C, or G) and being complementary to one or more nucleotides downstream from the target region but not complementary to a nucleotide within the target region. In one embodiment the ratio of the labeled nucleotide to unlabeled nucleotide is 1:1. Methods of the invention may also include incorporating more than one monomer of the labeled nucleotide or unlabeled nucleotide into the extension product.}",
