The dining hall is under Sodexo, but the food is just not worth the money at all. Especially since the grade dropped to an A to a C in 2011., 1436=Clayton State is a cheaper community college, so it seems cheaper than other schools. For someone trying to save their money though, even between 1000 and 2000 dollars for 2 or 3 classes can be expensive. I am learning a lot though and do not have to travel far to go to school.}",

The freedom of college is WONDERFUL! But it can get in the way. Nobody is there to tell you what to do and when to do it. You're completely grown by college. Just stay focus. Don't party too much! But enjoy your college life! Bang for the buck Clayton State is extremely cheap. Aim for the Hope Scholarship as an extra assistance. But you are able to pay for the tuition with or without small scholarships. Am enjoying being here Clayton State was not my first choice, but I do not regret attending the University. It is a very nice, warm, and inviting environment. Everyone is nice and it is always something to do on campus. I absolutely enjoy it here Am learning a lot",
