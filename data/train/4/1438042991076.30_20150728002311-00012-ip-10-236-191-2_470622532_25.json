Once the system is awakened, a filter policy may be run on the packet, as represented by step 1110 of FIG. 11B. Although the filter policy may have many possible outcomes, e.g., ignore or delete junk mail, FIG. 11B represents two possible outcomes, namely one that downloads the full email (step 1111) or one that downloads only the headers (step 1120). A notification policy may then be run to determine if the user should be notified of one or more of the downloaded emails in steps 1112 and 1121. If the user should be notified, a user notification is represented (step 1113 or step 1122), as well as the writing of data, typically the header data, to an available auxiliary display (step 1114 or step 1124). The system is restored to its sleep state via step 1116 or step 1126, either of which returns to step 1102 of FIG. 11A.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{100199=Further, in this example, estimates are based on a power average (Pavg) of 0.865 watts for an event notification subsystem system with Direct Push enabled while in S3-like sleep state, e.g., normal S3 plus USB wake plus WWAN wake, but not sending/receiving. In this example, the power average of an event notification subsystem system using the poll mode while in S3 is 0.5 watts, while the power average of an enabled system while in S0 is 6.0 watts, assuming the lid is closed and the main display is off. Other estimates for this example include a wake (S0) time for each notification of 120 seconds. With such a wake time, the average time between notifications Tavg based on ten hours per day for a light user is 1500 seconds (25 minutes), for a medium user is 600 seconds (10 minutes), and for a heavy user is 360 seconds (6 minutes). An estimate for the size of the battery in an event notification subsystem system comprises 6 cells of 8.4 watt-hours/cell for a total of 50.4 watt-hours., 109038=\u201cBlackout period wake events\u201d comprises a setting that in one implementation is not enabled or configured by default, but rather requires advanced interaction to enable, and possibly define. A blackout period defines a time period during which event notification subsystem feature is not needed. During a blackout period, the event notification subsystem is disabled, e.g., from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM if another period is not chosen. The blackout time may be passed to the network subsystem as global time, to help with travel situations. If mail and/or calendar notifications have been queued up during a blackout period, the network subsystem will trigger a wake notification at the end of a blackout period; queued up notifications may be delivered to Auxiliary display in a single batch. If enabled, the blackout period enhances the system battery life and avoids notifying the user at inopportune times. Blackout or an equivalent setting may be used to turn off the system and/or radio in other environments, e.g., so the computer can be prevented from communicating yet still be used in other ways during an airplane flight.}",
