            "We don't have a dorm at Ivy Tech. However, there are plenty of apartments in the area that are close to the school. And if you live close to campus already, you don't need an apartment and just commute.",
            "It may feel like a high school atmosphere at times, but it is quite challenging. They expect your best while understanding that there are other things in life that must be done. Not many other colleges are like that."
