            "Operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, SU's Public Safety staff works to maintain a safe campus atmosphere for everyone. However, this is a pretty safe campus due to its size and location.",
            "SU has a rich tradition of Greek life with a community that is more than 100 years old. Currently, there are 11 social frats and sororities.",
            "We offer more than 100 student organizations serving a wide range of interests. - Nationally recognized community and service learning programs - More than 25,000 community service hours contributed by students annually - Student-run radio station, newspaper and literary publications - Student, faculty and professional choral, orchestral and theatrical performances - Public lectures and performances featuring national and international artists and authorities - Active campus ministry programs serving many faiths",
            "If think you'll like a more intimate and personalized experience, in a beautiful setting in a river town in Central PA, this is a place to consider.",
            "The annual Thanksgiving dinner is one of the unique traditions that we have at Susquehanna. An annual tradition since 1981, the faculty serves the student body at a formal dinner, acknowledging that we help make the school what it is. Another nice tradition is the welcome incoming students receive at the Opening Convocation. It helps you to realize that you will travel full circle in your 4 years at Susquehanna.",
            "With a student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1, more than 100 student organizations, more than 60 facilities, 94 percent of the students receiving institutional grants to offset financial need and/or scholarship recognition, and loads of job opportunities, it offers a lot of bang for your buck.",
            "Check out Trax for dance parties, live bands and special events like Caribbean Night, Mardi Gras and Salsa Night. With a state-of-the-art sound system, free food and drink, and a great light show it can be a lot of fun. You can also catch a movie at Charlie's Coffeehouse, a casual, intimate atmosphere, and a great place to study with friends! Susquehanna's Outdoor Recreation Center rents equipment for camping, backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, cross-country skiing, and lots of other fun activities!",
            "The school offers everything from relaxed, restaurant-style dining to rapid retail convenience. They do a pretty good job for a small school.",
            "About 80 percent of us live on campus in a variety of housing. The professional and well-trained residence life staff does a great job of making dorm life a success for all. The First Year Program is great, and provides support for incoming freshman.",
            "Susquehanna offers a challenging Honors Program and emphasizes experience-based learning, including internships, study-abroad semesters and award-winning community service programs.",
            "Small classes and a student-faculty ratio of about 13 to 1 offer students personal attention and challenging opportunities. Student participation and team learning are encouraged, as is faculty-student research that exposes students to current, practical applications in their field of study.",
            "Susquehanna is a great learning community that values diversity and encourages intellectual collaboration among faculty and students. It is welcoming of individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs. It offers one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen!"

In March of 2010, Susquehanna University opened its New Science Building (see here: http://www.susqu.edu/26110.asp) for classes. This $32 million complex was designed specifically for biology, chemistry, and earth and environmental science classes, complete with all new laboratories and a roof-top greenhouse. Susquehanna University\u2019s New Science Building has earned silver-level LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. In short - if you're looking for science like I was, Susquehanna is the place for you!, 141821=We have some fun traditions like playing our rival school, Juniata College, for an actual goal post that they stole from us in 1952. We battle it out each year in football to see who will get the goal post back and it's became such a fun game! We also have a joke about the numerous squirrels running around on campus, they're so much fun!, 187905=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 37104=The Thursday before Thanksgiving, the professors serve a big Thanksgiving dinner for the students. Also, there is a Candlelight Service in December, which is a really beautiful service with many great hymns., 53223=Join sports! With the school taking off the off-campus housing for the 2014-2015 year there will be almost NOTHING to do on the weekends so hopefully if would change., 846=Watch your Flex money. Most new students run out of it three weeks before the end of the semester, if not sooner. Ask the cashier on your way out of Benny's or Clyde's so you can keep tabs on it. Be prepared to work hard, but have fun at the same time. The Student Activities Committee plans several bus trips to NYC and Washington, D.C. for a small bus fee throughout the year, and hosts free concerts and comedians as well (Spring 2009 consisted of comedian Josh Blue, and two concerts, Ryan Star and David Cook, and Fabolous), 134196=The annual Thanksgiving dinner is one of the unique traditions that we have at Susquehanna.
