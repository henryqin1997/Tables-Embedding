The Classic Chambered resonators are compact & can be installed into tight spots where there is a small straightaway section of pipe - like in tailpipes. Like all Classic Chambered products, these are proudly made in the USA!, 16679=22540-VETTE, 23484=From www.corvetteforum.com (May 2012 \ufffd Thanks to Eric in Boyington Beach, FL.), 55740=November 2013: New added items to our line are these stamped X-pipe assemblies Sizes 2.25\ufffd, 2.5\ufffd, & 3\ufffd. They are available in aluminized steel or 409 Stainless. X-pipes balance pressures between both exhaust banks on dual exhaust applications, and help with sound wave cancellation & mellowing of the exhaust note. X-pipes typically assist with scavenging & can add a few more HP in some instances. The stamped design allows for a more compact style, with more precise & better-flowing internals than typical cut-and-weld design X-pipes., 22371=Thanks to L.B. of Scottsdale, AZ. for this clip.
