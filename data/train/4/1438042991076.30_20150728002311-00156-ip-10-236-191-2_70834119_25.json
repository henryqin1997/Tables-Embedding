Commands that exist in both /usr/bin and /usr/5bin have two table entries, the first documents the /usr/bin command, and the second entry documents the /usr/5bin command. The SunOS release 5.7 directory structure is different than the SunOS release 4 structure; some commands behave the same, but have a different path name. For example, the SunOS release 4 /usr/etc/newfs command now resides in /usr/sbin/newfs, but the interface has not changed. This command, and others like it, are considered the same (S) according to this table's guidelines. Note - If an interface is listed as not available (N), check the Notes section for information about its replacement. Replacement commands, when available, are also shown in the SunOS release 5.7 column. If an interface has an alternative (A), check the Notes section for its replacement. If an interface is listed as the same (S), the Solaris 7 interface supports all features of the SunOS release 4 interface. In some cases the interface has been enhanced, but can be considered a complete superset of the SunOS release 4 interface.
