    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{113183=The \u201cAxSYM\u201d B12 assay is based on the Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) technology. The \u201cAxSYM\u201d analyzer and the method for using the \u201cAxSYM\u201d analyzer are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,691, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The assay for vitamin B12 is discussed in Abbott AxSYM\ufffd System B12, List No. 3C79, 69-0912/R2, February 1999, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill., the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference., 97886=Porcine intrinsic factor was produced by the parietal cells of the porcine stomach. Because the parietal cells are highly concentrated in the fundic region of the stomach, the fundic region was used for total RNA isolation. The stomach tissue stored in \u201cRNA Later\u201d solution (purchased from Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.) was homogenized in \u201cTRIzol\u201d reagent (purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), and total RNA was isolated using the protocol recommended by the vendor. The total RNA isolated from the porcine stomach was used as the starting material in the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) reactions. The designs of the primers for RT-PCR were based on the known homology between human, mouse, and rat intrinsic factor. The first six RT-PCR runs, each of which involved different reaction conditions, failed to produce the porcine intrinsic factor cDNA. Additional primers (i.e., a total of 8 primers) were made and were used in all possible combinations in the seventh RT-PCR run. In this seventh RT-PCR run, a porcine intrinsic factor cDNA fragment, referred to herein as Porcine IF cDNA200-1254 (1054 bp in length, SEQ ID NO: 1, its reverse complement SEQ ID NO: 2, and its amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 3), was obtained using the Forward Primer huIF200For (SEQ ID NO: 10) and Reverse Primer huIF Reverse 1 (SEQ ID NO: 11). The RT-PCR profile was as follows: RT step was performed at a temperature of 42\ufffd C. for 25 minutes. This step was followed by the PCR step, which included one initial denaturation step at a temperature of 94\ufffd C. for 30 seconds; then 40 cycles of the following conditions: a temperature of 94\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 57\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 1 minute; followed by a final extension at a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. To obtain full-length porcine intrinsic factor cDNA, additional primers (i.e., a total of 9 primers) were made, and RT-PCR runs were performed. The first four RT-PCR runs, each of which involved different reaction conditions, failed to produce the porcine intrinsic factor cDNA. In the fifth RT-PCR run, a porcine intrinsic factor cDNA fragment (1234 bp in length), referred to herein as Porcine IF cDNA14-1248, was obtained using Forward Primer huIF-For14 (SEQ ID NO: 12) and Reverse Primer huIF 1248Rev (SEQ ID NO: 13). The RT-PCR profile was as follows: RT step was performed at a temperature of 42\ufffd C. for 40 minutes. This step was followed by the PCR step which included one initial denaturation step at a temperature of 99\ufffd C. for 4 minutes; then 43 cycles of the following conditions: temperature of 95\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 61\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 1 minute; followed by a final extension at a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 0.5 minute. This cDNA fragment (1234 bp in length), referred to herein as Porcine IF cDNA14-1248, (denoted by SEQ ID NO: 4, and its reverse complement SEQ ID NO: 5 and its amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 6) was cloned into the TA cloning vector (pCR 2.1, purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transformed into \u201cTop10\u201d E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to produce the Porcine IF cDNA14-1248 (SEQ ID NO: 5)., 101925=Using the Porcine IF cDNA14-1248 (SEQ ID NO: 5) as the template and the Forward Primer pIFMP-ForI (SEQ ID NO: 14) and Reverse Primer pIFMP-RevXhoI (SEQ ID NO: 15), the cDNA encoding the Porcine IF cDNA54-1254-Mature Peptide was amplified by PCR. The PCR profile was as follows: one initial denaturation step at a temperature of 95\ufffd C. for 5 minutes; then 33 cycles of the following conditions: a temperature of 95\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 57\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 1 minute; followed by a final extension at a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. This PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEMEX-1 expression vector (purchased from Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.). The expressed protein was insoluble and formed inclusion bodies., 72798=Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecules, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1995) Human Antibodies and Hybridomas 6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1994) Mol. Immunol. 31:1047-1058). Antibody portions, such as Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion molecules can be obtained using standard recombinant DNA techniques, as described herein., 109720=The \u201cARCHITECT\u201d B12 assay is a two-step assay with an automated sample pretreatment, for determining the presence of vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols. The \u201cARCHITECT\u201d analyzer and the method for using the \u201cARCHITECT\u201d analyzer are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,784, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The assay for vitamin B12 is described in ARCHITECT\u2122 System B12, List No. 6C09, 69-0689/R1, December 1998, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill., the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The sample and Pre-Treatment Reagent 1, Pre-Treatment Reagent 2, and Pre-Treatment Reagent 3 are combined. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is aspirated and transferred into a new reaction vessel. The pre-treated sample, assay diluent, and intrinsic factor coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. Vitamin B12 present in the sample binds to the intrinsic factor coated microparticles. After washing, vitamin B12-acridinium-labeled conjugate is added in the second step. The vitamin B12-acridinium-labeled conjugate is capable of undergoing a chemiluminescent reaction. Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of vitamin B12 in the sample and the relative light units detected by the \u201cARCHITECT\u201d i optical system. Further details on the system and assay technology can be found in \u201cARCHITECT\u201d i System Operations Manual, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The reagents for the assay are described below (the amounts per bottle are for 100 tests):, 119658=SEQ ID NO: 1 represents the nucleotide sequence of the Porcine IF cDNA200-1254 (1054 bp), 65660=The phrases \u201crecombinant construct\u201d, \u201cexpression construct\u201d and \u201crecombinant expression construct\u201d are used interchangeably herein. These phrases refer to a functional unit of genetic material that can be inserted into the genome of a cell using standard methodology well known to one skilled in the art. Such construct may be itself or may be used in conjunction with a vector. If a vector is used then the choice of vector is dependent upon the method that will be used to transform host plants as is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, a plasmid vector can be used. The skilled artisan is well aware of the genetic elements that must be present on the vector in order to successfully transform, select and propagate host cells comprising any of the isolated nucleic acid fragments of the invention. The skilled artisan will also recognize that different independent transformation events will result in different levels and patterns of expression (Jones et al., (1985) EMBO J. 4:2411-2418; De Almeida et al., (1989) Mol. Gen. Genetics 218:78-86), and thus that multiple events must be screened in order to obtain lines displaying the desired expression level and pattern. Such screening may be accomplished by Southern analysis of DNA, Northern analysis of mRNA expression, Western analysis of protein expression, or phenotypic analysis., 62573=Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used herein are well known in the art and are described more fully in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, 1989 (hereinafter \u201cSambrook\u201d)., 61527=The phrase \u201cstable transformation\u201d refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into a genome of a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. In contrast, the phrase \u201ctransient transformation\u201d refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the nucleus, or DNA-containing organelle, of a host organism resulting in gene expression without integration or stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as \u201ctransgenic\u201d organisms. The preferred method of cell transformation of rice, corn and other monocots is the use of particle-accelerated or \u201cgene gun\u201d transformation technology (Klein et al., (1987) Nature (London) 327:70-73; U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050), or an Agrobacterium-mediated method using an appropriate Ti plasmid containing the transgene (Ishida Y. et al., 1996, Nature Biotech. 14:745-750). The term \u201ctransformation\u201d as used herein refers to both stable transformation and transient transformation., 103891=To further increase the solubility of the protein and to enhance proper protein folding, the cDNA insert encoding the Porcine IF cDNA54-1254-Mature Peptide was excised from pMAL-IF using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI and inserted into pET32a vector (purchased from Novagen, Madison, Wis.) digested with EcoRI and SalI. This vector produces porcine intrinsic factor as a fusion protein with Thioredoxin protein (TrX; molecular weight \u02dc18 kDa). The predicted molecular weight of the pET32a-IF fusion protein is \u02dc62 kDa. The TrX component rendered the porcine intrinsic factor protein partially soluble., 101205=The Porcine IF cDNA14-1248 (SEQ ID NO: 5) was used as the template to produce the cDNA sequence encoding the porcine intrinsic factor mature peptide, referred to herein as Porcine IF cDNA54-1254-Mature Peptide. The nucleotide sequence of the coding strand of Porcine IF cDNA54-1254-Mature Peptide (1200 bp in length) is denoted by SEQ ID NO: 7, its reverse complement is denoted by SEQ ID NO: 8. Translation of the open reading frame in SEQ ID NO: 7 suggests that porcine intrinsic factor mature peptide contains 399 amino acids, with an amino acid sequence denoted by SEQ ID NO: 9. The encoded mature peptide has a predicted molecular weight of \u02dc44 kDa., 102755=To produce a soluble version of this protein, cDNA encoding the Porcine IF cDNA54-1254-Mature Peptide was amplified by PCR using IF cDNA14-1248 (SEQ ID NO: 5) as the template and the Forward primer pIF-PIC-MP-For EcoR1 (SEQ ID NO: 16) and the Reverse pIF-MP-pMAL-SaI1 Rev primer (SEQ ID NO: 17) and the following PCR conditions: one initial denaturation step at a temperature of 95\ufffd C. for 5 minutes; then 35 cycles of the following conditions: a temperature of 95\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 56\ufffd C. for 30 seconds, then a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 1 minute; followed by a final extension at a temperature of 72\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. The resultant PCR was introduced into the pMAL expression vector (purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to create the plasmid pMAL-IF. This plasmid (pMAL-IF) produces porcine intrinsic factor as a fusion protein with Maltose Binding Protein (MBP; molecular weight \u02dc43 kDa). The predicted molecular weight of the pMAL-IF fusion protein is \u02dc87 kDa. The MBP component rendered the porcine intrinsic factor protein partially soluble., 70304=The phrase \u201cantigen-binding portion\u201d of an antibody (or simply \u201cantibody portion\u201d), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., hIL-18). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Such antibody embodiments may also be bispecific, dual specific, or multi-specific formats; specifically binding to two or more different antigens. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the phrase \u201cantigen-binding portion\u201d of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the phrase \u201cantigen-binding portion\u201d of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123). Such antibody binding portions are known in the art (Kontermann and Dubel eds., Antibody Engineering (2001) Springer-Verlag. New York. 790 pp. (ISBN 3-540-41354-5)., 39189=The term \u201cidentity\u201d refers to the relatedness of two sequences on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis over a particular comparison window or segment. Thus, identity is defined as the degree of sameness, correspondence or equivalence between the same strands (either sense or antisense) of two DNA segments (or two amino acid sequences). \u201cPercentage of sequence identity\u201d is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a particular region, determining the number of positions at which the identical base or amino acid occurs in both sequences in order to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of such positions by the total number of positions in the segment being compared and multiplying the result by 100. Optimal alignment of sequences may be conducted by the algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 85:2444 (1988) and by computer programs which implement the relevant algorithms (e.g., Brutlag, Doug, Computational Molecular Biology Multiple Sequence Alignment [online], Feb. 7, 2007 [retrieved on Sep. 11, 2007]. Retrieved from the Internet:<URL: (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biochem218/11Multiple.pdf\u2267; Higgins et al., CABIOS. 5L151-153 (1989)), FASTDB (Intelligenetics), BLAST (National Center for Biomedical Information; Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Research 25:3389-3402 (1997)), PILEUP (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.) or GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA (Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.). (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,120.), 43794=The term \u201chybridization\u201d as used herein is generally used to mean hybridization of nucleic acids at appropriate conditions of stringency as would be readily evident to those skilled in the art depending upon the nature of the probe sequence and target sequences. Conditions of hybridization and washing are well known in the art, and the adjustment of conditions depending upon the desired stringency by varying incubation time, temperature, and/or ionic strength of the solution are readily accomplished. See, for example, Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989, as noted above and incorporated herein by reference. (See also Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, ed. Ausubel et al. and Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993), both incorporated herein by reference.) Specifically, the choice of conditions is dictated by the length of the sequences being hybridized, in particular, the length of the probe sequence, the relative G-C content of the nucleic acids and the amount of mismatches to be permitted. Low stringency conditions are preferred when partial hybridization between strands that have lesser degrees of complementarity is desired. When perfect or near perfect complementarity is desired, high stringency conditions are preferred. For typical high stringency conditions, the hybridization solution contains 6\ufffdS.S.C., 0.01 M EDTA, 1\ufffdDenhardt's solution and 0.5% SDS. Hybridization is carried out at about 68 degrees Celsius for about 3 to 4 hours for fragments of cloned DNA and for about 12 to about 16 hours for total eukaryotic DNA. For moderate stringencies, one may utilize filter pre-hybridizing and hybridizing with a solution of 3\ufffd sodium chloride, sodium citrate (SSC), 50% formamide (0.1 M of this buffer at pH 7.5) and 5\ufffdDenhardt's solution. One may then pre-hybridize at 37 degrees Celsius for 4 hours, followed by hybridization at 37 degrees Celsius with an amount of labeled probe equal to 3,000,000 cpm total for 16 hours, followed by a wash in 2\ufffdSSC and 0.1% SDS solution, a wash of 4 times for 1 minute each at room temperature and 4 times at 60 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes each. Subsequent to drying, one exposes to film. For lower stringencies, the temperature of hybridization is reduced to about 12 degrees Celsius below the melting temperature (Tm) of the duplex. The Tm is known to be a function of the G-C content and duplex length as well as the ionic strength of the solution.}",
