            "Subjects self-administered one x 100 mg GWP42003 capsule twice daily (the first dose was 30 minutes before breakfast [fasted] and the second was 30 minutes before the evening meal [typically 12 hours apart]). This gave a total daily dose of 200 mg GWP42003.",
            "Subjects self-administered two x 100 mg GWP42003 capsules twice daily (the first dose was 30 minutes before breakfast [fasted] and the second was 30 minutes before the evening meal [typically 12 hours apart]). This gave a total daily dose of 400 mg GWP42003.",
            "Subjects self-administered four x 100 mg GWP42003 capsules twice daily (the first dose was 30 minutes before breakfast [fasted] and the second was 30 minutes before the evening meal [typically 12 hours apart]). This gave a total daily dose of 800 mg GWP42003.",
            "Placebo capsules were presented as Licaps\u00ae size double zero (Size 00) hard gelatin capsules containing excipients (Gelucire 44/14). Each capsule exactly matched the GWP42003 capsules in terms of appearance, size, smell and taste. Subjects self-administered one, two or four placebo capsules twice daily, according to the same regimen as active treatment."
