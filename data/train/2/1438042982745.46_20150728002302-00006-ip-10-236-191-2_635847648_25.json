Due to a regression, the permissions of any jar file updated with the jar command are changed to read and write by user only. The workaround is to use the chmod command on the affected file to allow access by other and world. Area: java/jar Synopsis: Regression - jar command changes file permissions. Known Issues -XX:CompileCommandFile=.hotspot_compiler for the .hotspot_compiler file. -XX:Flags=.hotspotrc will revert to old behavior for .hotspotrc. Command line options to support old behavior: This release contains changes to the default implicit loading of the .hotspot_compiler and .hotspotrc file. For existing deployments which rely on .hotspot_compiler (e.g. to exclude a method from hotspot compilation), an unsupported behavioral option has been provided to simulate the old loading behavior. Area: hotspot/runtime_arguments Synopsis: Improve VM configuration file loading. This release contains fixes for security vulnerabilities.
