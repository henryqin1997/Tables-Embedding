The following message will be displayed on the terminal connected to R1 when R3 is assigned the IP address 172.16.28.1., 19318=If the new device does not learn the IP address of the TFTP server via DHCP option 150, it will transmit the TFTP session initialization requests as network layer broadcasts using the IP destination broadcast address of 255.255.255.255. Routers block network layer broadcast datagrams which prevents the TFTP session initialization requests from reaching the TFTP server, and AutoInstall will fail. The solution to this problem is to use the ip helper-address address command. The ip helper-address address command changes the broadcast address of TFTP session initialization request from 255.255.255.255 to the address that is configured with the address argument. For example, the ip helper-address 172.16.29.252 command will change IP destination broadcast address of 255.255.255.255 to 172.16.29.252., 110509=Connect R2 to the Fast Ethernet network and power it on.
