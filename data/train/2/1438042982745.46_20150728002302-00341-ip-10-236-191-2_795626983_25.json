From our performance you could tell we were not going to get through to the quarter-finals. We had a big chance, but we just received a big blow. This kind of defeat ... the players are guilty, but I'm guilty too. I'm the main man who is responsible for this. A 7-0 defeat is much too ugly for Azerbaijan. I have never had this kind of defeat., 64487=1 February 2014, 79678=Italy prepared for the match against us better [than Slovenia, who Azerbaijan beat 7-6]. They saw how we played our last match and they managed to prepare very well. It's a big risk if you use a flying goalkeeper. It's always like this. Italy organised their game well, scored many goals and now we go home. It's certainly a very unpleasant situation. We could even have afforded to lose by one goal, but conceding that many goals is a great pity., 79167=Biro Jade, Azerbaijan forward In the last five minutes before half-time I started to feel that we would lose. When we conceded the third goal, it was clear that it wasn't our lucky day. We wanted to play on the counterattack, but it was just the opposite. Italy created chances and scored on counterattacks. At the end of the first half we saw that everything would be very hard for us. But I didn't expect we would lose by such a big scoreline. We couldn't imagine this., 67833=2 February 2014, 89928=http://www.uefa.com/futsaleuro/season=2014/matches/round=2000398/match=2013050/postmatch/quotes/index.html#italy+enjoy+redemption, 57699=30 January 2014, 61075=31 January 2014, 80516=\u00a9UEFA.com 1998-2015.
