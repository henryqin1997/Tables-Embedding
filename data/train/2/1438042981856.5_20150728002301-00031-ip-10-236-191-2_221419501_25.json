Named in honor of Ian Shelton, Canadian astronomer, best known for his discovery of the supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud on 1987 Feb. 24. During his four years as resident observer at the University of Toronto Southern Observatory, he participated in programs with astronomers worldwide, and more recently he has generously contributed to the astronomical education of school children, parents and teachers.
