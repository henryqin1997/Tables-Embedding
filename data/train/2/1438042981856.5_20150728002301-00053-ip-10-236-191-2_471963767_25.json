Recombinant antigens were expressed and purified antigens used in the immunological analysis described in Example 1. Proteins were induced by IPTG and purified by gel elution, as described in Skeiky et al., J. Exp. Med. 181:1527-1537, 1995. Representative sequences of DNA molecules identified in this screen are provided in SEQ ID Nos.: 1-25. The corresponding predicted amino acid sequences are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 63-87., 114839=Immunogenic antigens may also be produced recombinantly using a DNA sequence that encodes the antigen, which has been inserted into an expression vector and expressed in an appropriate host. DNA molecules encoding soluble antigens may be isolated by screening an appropriate M. tuberculosis expression library with anti-sera (e.g., rabbit) raised specifically against soluble M. tuberculosis antigens. DNA sequences encoding antigens that may or may not be soluble may be identified by screening an appropriate M. tuberculosis genomic or cDNA expression library with sera obtained from patients infected with M. tuberculosis. Such screens may generally be performed using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989., 125304=Immunogenic portions of the antigens described herein may be prepared and identified using well known techniques, such as those summarized in Paul, Fundamental Immunology, 3d ed., Raven Press, 1993, pp. 243-247 and references cited therein. Such techniques include screening polypeptide portions of the native antigen for immunogenic properties. The representative proliferation and cytokine production assays described herein may generally be employed in these screens. An immunogenic portion of a polypeptide is a portion that, within such representative assays, generates an immune response (e.g., proliferation, interferon-\u03b3 production and/or interleukin-12 production) that is substantially similar to that generated by the full length antigen. In other words, an immunogenic portion of an antigen may generate at least about 20%, and preferably about 100%, of the proliferation induced by the full length antigen in the model proliferation assay described herein. An immunogenic portion may also, or alternatively, stimulate the production of at least about 20%, and preferably about 100%, of the interferon-\u03b3 and/or interleukin-12 induced by the full length antigen in the model assay described herein., 114110=In general, M. tuberculosis antigens, and DNA sequences encoding such antigens, may be prepared using any of a variety of procedures. For example, soluble antigens may be isolated from M. tuberculosis culture filtrate by procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including anion-exchange and reverse phase chromatography. Purified antigens are then evaluated for their ability to elicit an appropriate immune response (e.g., cellular) using, for example, the representative methods described herein. Immunogenic antigens may then be partially sequenced using techniques such as traditional Edman chemistry. See Edman and Berg, Eur. J.

No. 08/523,436, filed Sep. 1, 1995, now abandoned, each of the above-mentioned is herein incorporated by reference in the entirety., 243288=Thirty two clones were purified. Of these, 31 represented sequences that had not been previously identified in human M. tuberculosis. Representative sequences of the DNA molecules identified are provided in SEQ ID Nos.: 26-51 and 105. Of these, TbH-8-2 (SEQ. ID NO. 105) is a partial clone of TbH-8, and TbH-4 (SEQ. ID NO. 43) and TbH-4-FWD (SEQ. ID NO. 44) are non-contiguous sequences from the same clone. Amino acid sequences for the antigens hereinafter identified as Tb38-1, TbH-4, TbH-8, TbH-9, and TbH-12 are shown in SEQ ID Nos.: 88-92. Comparison of these sequences with known sequences in the gene bank using the databases identified above revealed no significant homologies to TbH-4, TbH-8, TbH-9 and TbM-3, although weak homologies were found to TbH-9. TbH-12 was found to be homologous to a 34 kD antigenic protein previously identified in M. paratuberculosis (Acc. No. S28515). Tb38-1 was found to be located 34 base pairs upstream of the open reading frame for the antigen ESAT-6 previously identified in M. bovis (Acc. No. U34848) and in M. tuberculosis (Sorensen et al., Infec. Immun. 63:1710-1717, 1995)., 242810=All pools were pre-adsorbed with E. coli lysate and used to screen the H37Ra and H37Rv expression libraries, as described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Bacteriophage plaques expressing immunoreactive antigens were purified. Phagemid from the plaques was rescued and the nucleotide sequences of the M. tuberculosis clones deduced., 156452=Alternatively, a vaccine may contain DNA encoding one or more polypeptides as described above, such that the polypeptide is generated in situ. In such vaccines, the DNA may be present within any of a variety of delivery systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including nucleic acid expression systems, bacterial and viral expression systems. Appropriate nucleic acid expression systems contain the necessary DNA sequences for expression in the patient (such as a suitable promoter and terminating signal). Bacterial delivery systems involve the administration of a bacterium (such as Bacillus-Calmette-Guerrin) that expresses an immunogenic portion of the polypeptide on its cell surface. In a preferred embodiment, the DNA may be introduced using a viral expression system (e.g., vaccinia or other pox virus, retrovirus, or adenovirus), which may involve the use of a non-pathogenic (defective), replication competent virus. Techniques for incorporating DNA into such expression systems are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The DNA may also be \u201cnaked,\u201d as described, for example, in Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745-1749, 1993 and reviewed by Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692, 1993. The uptake of naked DNA may be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently transported into the cells., 167996=IFN-\u03b3 was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA plates were coated with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed to human IFN-\u03b3 (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.) in PBS for four hours at room temperature. Wells were then blocked with PBS containing 5% (W/V) non-fat dried milk for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed six times in PBS/0.2% TWEEN-20 and samples diluted 1:2 in culture medium in the ELISA plates were incubated overnight at room temperature. The plates were again washed and a polyclonal rabbit anti-human IFN-\u03b3 serum diluted 1:3000 in PBS/10% normal goat serum was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for two hours at room temperature, washed and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma Chemical So., St. Louis, Mo.) was added at a 1:2000 dilution in PBS/5% non-fat dried milk. After a further two hour incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed and TMB substrate added. The reaction was stopped after 20 min with 1 N sulfuric acid. Optical density was determined at 450 nm using 570 nm as a reference wavelength Fractions that resulted in both replicates giving an OD two fold greater than the mean OD from cells cultured in medium alone, plus 3 standard deviations, were considered positive., 201922=Genomic DNA was isolated from the M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra. The DNA was randomly sheared and used to construct an expression library using the Lambda ZAP expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Rabbit anti-sera was generated against secretory proteins of the M. tuberculosis strains H37Ra, H37Rv and Erdman by immunizing a rabbit with concentrated supernatant of the M. tuberculosis cultures. Specifically, the rabbit was first immunized subcutaneously with 200 \u03bcg of protein antigen in a total volume of 2 ml containing 10 \u03bcg muramyl dipeptide (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.) and 1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Four weeks later the rabbit was boosted subcutaneously with 100 \u03bcg antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Finally, the rabbit was immunized intravenously four weeks later with 50 \u03bcg protein antigen. The anti-sera were used to screen the expression library as described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Bacteriophage plaques expressing immunoreactive antigens were purified. Phagemid from the plaques was rescued and the nucleotide sequences of the M. tuberculosis clones deduced., 40791=While macrophages have been shown to act as the principal effectors of M. tuberculosis immunity, T cells are the predominant inducers of such immunity. The essential role of T cells in protection against M. tuberculosis infection is illustrated by the frequent occurrence of M. tuberculosis in AIDS patients, due to the depletion of CD4 T cells associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Mycobacterium-reactive CD4 T cells have been shown to be potent producers of gamma-interferon (IFN-\u03b3), which, in turn, has been shown to trigger the anti-mycobacterial effects of macrophages in mice. While the role of IFN-\u03b3 in humans is less clear, studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, either alone or in combination with IFN-\u03b3 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, activates human macrophages to inhibit M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, it is known that IFN-\u03b3 stimulates human macrophages to make 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. Similarly, IL-12 has been shown to play a role in stimulating resistance to M. tuberculosis infection. For a review of the immunology of M. tuberculosis infection see Chan and Kaufmann in Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control, Bloom (ed.), ASM Press, Washington, D.C., 1994., 152032=In a related aspect, the present invention provides fusion proteins comprising a first and a second inventive polypeptide or, alternatively, a polypeptide of the present invention and a known M. tuberculosis antigen, such as the 38 kD antigen described in Andersen and Hansen, Infect. Immun. 57:2481-2488, 1989, (Genbank Accession No. M30046) or ESAT-6 (SEQ ID Nos. 103 and 104), together with variants of such fusion proteins. The fusion proteins of the present invention may also include a linker peptide between the first and second polypeptides., 115788=DNA sequences encoding soluble antigens may also be obtained by screening an appropriate M. tuberculosis cDNA or genomic DNA library for DNA sequences that hybridize to degenerate oligonucleotides derived from partial amino acid sequences of isolated soluble antigens. Degenerate oligonucleotide sequences for use in such a screen may be designed and synthesized, and the screen may be performed, as described (for example) in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989 (and references cited therein). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may also be employed, using the above oligonucleotides in methods well known in the art, to isolate a nucleic acid probe from a cDNA or genomic library. The library screen may then be performed using the isolated probe., 166984=The purified polypeptides were then screened for the ability to induce T-cell proliferation in PBMC preparations. The PBMCs from donors known to be PPD skin test positive and whose T-cells were shown to proliferate in response to PPD and crude soluble proteins from MTB were cultured in medium comprising RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% pooled human serum and 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin. Purified polypeptides were added in duplicate at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 \u03bcg/mL. After six days of culture in 96-well round-bottom plates in a volume of 200 \u03bcl, 50 \u03bcl of medium was removed from each well for determination of IFN-\u03b3 levels, as described below. The plates were then pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi/well of tritiated thymidine for a further 18 hours, harvested and tritium uptake determined using a gas scintillation counter. Fractions that resulted in proliferation in both replicates three fold greater than the proliferation observed in cells cultured in medium alone were considered positive., 126553=Portions and other variants of M. tuberculosis antigens may be generated by synthetic or recombinant means. Synthetic polypeptides having fewer than about 100 amino acids, and generally fewer than about 50 amino acids, may be generated using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such polypeptides may be synthesized using any of the commercially available solid-phase techniques, such as the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis method, where amino acids are sequentially added to a growing amino acid chain. See Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2146, 1963. Equipment for automated synthesis of polypeptides is commercially available from suppliers such as Applied BioSystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif., and may be operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Variants of a native antigen may generally be prepared using standard mutagenesis techniques, such as oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. Sections of the DNA sequence may also be removed using standard techniques to permit preparation of truncated polypeptides.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for the purpose of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the order of the individual antigens within the fusion protein may be changed and that comparable activity would be expected provided each of the epitopes is still functionally available. In addition, truncated forms of the proteins containing active epitopes may be used in the construction of fusion proteins. Recombinant protein was prepared essentially as described above. The DNA and amino acid sequences for the resulting fusion protein (hereinafter referred to as TbF-8) are provided in SEQ ID NO: 354 and 355, respectively. 38 kD DNA was used to perform PCR using the primers PDM-176 and PDM-175 (SEQ ID NO: 352 and 353, respectively), and 1 \u03bcl PET28Ra3/38 kD/38-1/Ra2A-12 DNA at 110 ng/\u03bcl.
