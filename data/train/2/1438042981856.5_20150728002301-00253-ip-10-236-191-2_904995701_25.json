Reviewer has been to campus. 3 out of 3 people found this review useful. 2 of 32 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Any student that learns best in small classes. If you're looking to go for internships this is definitely the place to go because your teachers will get to know you and like you and will be willing to help you find jobs and/or internships. If you like getting involved in community service, or just doing a lot of extras with your friends Marian has a TON of things to do outside of the classroom.",
