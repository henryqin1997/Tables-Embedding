            "Campus Safety is so helpful. I got locked out of my room 3 times on the same night and they came to help me every time. You really get to know them and feel safe with them around.",
            "We do not have a Greek life and it is refreshing. We build bonds among each other and I think this is better than belonging to one specific house.",
            "We offer a lot of clubs ranging from cultural clubs to academic clubs. You can also start your own club. They are very good ways to meet people and all the clubs are inclusive.",
            "It is great for people who are willing to try something new like going to an all women's college in a small town. It is great for strong women looking to make a difference.",
            "We have many traditions at Mount Holyoke, such as elfing(sophomore class leaving gifts for first year class), M&C's(late night snack), and Pangy Day(a day where we celebrate womanhood).",
            "Although it is a small town, you have the Peter Pan buses that can take you to Boston and New York at low costs. You can also visit neighboring towns. It is really fun meeting a lot of people your age. It also offers time for relaxing in such a calming environment.",
            "The food is great and the chefs are very nice. You can eat at any of the dining halls and it is different food everywhere you go.",
            "The dorms are pretty and dorm choosing is very fair.",
            "Mount Holyoke is definitely hard but it is worth it. You learn so much and the teachers are very willing to help.",
            "Be prepared for great people and traditions. Mount Holyoke women are very happy to be here.",
            "Mount Holyoke is a beautiful place where you learn a lot about yourself through the great education and your surroundings. It is filled with wonderful women from different backgrounds and experiences. It is a place to meet strong women like yourself."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33252=dorm life at mount holyoke is what you make of it. some of the halls are simply in a better location on campus than others, so if you are in one of the halls on the outskirts (ham/mcgregor, dickinson, 1837, the delles,etc) it can be frustrating. however, all the dorm restrooms and common spaces are kept up with by housekeeping. the hall presidents and advisers are always on hand to help handle problems as they arise., 49951=We have several dining hall selections on campus; we have seven all-you-can-eat buffet-style dining halls (located within dorms), and one cash-value Cafe (I am the manager at this dining hall). The dorm dining halls have hot breakfast each morning, and any dorms without dining halls have a continental breakfast Monday through Friday mornings. The food is very good, as far as college food goes; it's much better than food I've eaten at other colleges. The only downside is the dining halls get VERY crowded, particularly from 12:20 to 1 and from 6 to 7., 194668=There is a goose called Jorge who lives with the ducks in the stream beside Prospect Hall. There is a rumor that he is replaced every few years to keep the tradition alive. Also every Sunday through Thursday night at 9:30 there are M&C (Milk and Cookies) that are served. It's nice to have a snack while doing homework., 173672=Mount Holyoke is FILLED with wonderful traditions, some silly and some inspiring. There are M&Cs, Elfing, the Laurel Parade, Mountain Day, May Day, DisOrientation, Pangynaskeia (lovingly known as Pangy Day), and most importantly: the tradition of women helping women., 100625=Pangy Day! It's pretty much like a May Day festival held towards the end of the year out on the green., 230975=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 190133=The Octagon Room in the library is hard to get to, but productivity emanates from its walls. On school nights, from 9:30 to 10:00, the school puts out assorted snacks in the kitchen or dining halls as a study break. Traditionally known as M&Cs.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Will enjoy being here I actually did an overnight and i loved it! The dorms are very reasonably sized and comfortably fit the residents. There was so much to do on campus i couldn't decide, and everyone was willing to hang out and chat with me like i already went there instead of treating me as some random high school kid. Everyone made me feel as if I was already apart of the school. Will learn a lot I've visited the school twice and all the students I had met are driven and excited about the academics! They told me how approachable the faculty is and how each one of their professors is excited about the subjects they teach. I definitely felt the connection between the students and professors when i saw them at campus activities.
