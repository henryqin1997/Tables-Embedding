            "Go to the beaches on campus, watch movies & hang out with my friends, as lame as it sounds--study & do work with my roommates at Starbucks. There's a lot to do on campus & off-- student activities is always planning something.",
            "The dining services are awful, really I go maybe 2-3 times a semester. Brunch on the weekends is the best.",
            "Small quarters but if you're with people you like it's much more enjoyable!",
            "Be smart & safe on the weekends. Don't be discouraged by the size, I see new people everyday. There's 4 private beaches so bring your bathing suits, a towel & a volleyball or something of the sort! Enjoy your internship. If you happen to hate it you can await switch majors...that's why they do it! Tons of freshman switch! Bring 2 pairs of shower shoes. Don't pick your roommates, you're better off going random! I promise. Don't order out a lot & get in a gym routine. Avoid eating lodge late at night. Have fun!",
            "It is a beautiful campus with caring professors and kind students. The internship program is completely worthwhile and a one of a kind experience. The experiences, friends and networking I have created here are worth more than words can describe."

Need quiet to study? Go to the cyber cafe in Van Loan - barely anyone is ever there. And don't miss out on one of the best traditions Endicott has to offer: Doc Wylie's awesome 10 o'clock BBQs at his mansion on the sea. Eat your fill of burgers and ice cream. Wander the house and get a view of the crowd from the roof. Dip your feet in the hot tub. Go down the stairs to get to the beach. Sit on the grass and watch the fireworks (yes, there were fireworks at the last BBQ to celebrate Dr. Wylie's 25 years as President). And, of course, chat with the friendly and charming President of Endicott College, a man you will always see interacting with students, which is a rare sight, indeed, at many other colleges., 151205=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 146895=The food is very good, in terms of school dining. The Callahan Center was rebuilt in 2014, so it is very new. There are many options and it is well managed and kept clean.}",
