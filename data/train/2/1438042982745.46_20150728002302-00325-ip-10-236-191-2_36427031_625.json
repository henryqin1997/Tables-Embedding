Riley has many similarities with Sir Aaron from Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. In addition to design similarities, both Trainers have a Lucario and can use Aura. Riley is the only human in the games confirmed to be able to use Aura, as displayed in his intro animation and through a line of in-battle speech where he mentions feeling the player's Aura. In the anime, he is one of two known and currently living human users of Aura, the other being Ash. Of all the potential partners in the Battle Tower, Riley has the largest pool of Pok\u00e9mon to choose from. Trivia Serious Training on Iron Island!! Debut Lucario is Riley's only known Pok\u00e9mon. He trained it while on Iron",
