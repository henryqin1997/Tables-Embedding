    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck For over $30,000 a year, it is a bit pricey. We are known to be The World's Premier Culinary College. We have the most Certified Master Chef/Bakers on campus, compared to any other location. The majority of the instructors/professors have industry experience which lend to lots of recommendations, suggestions, and networks. On the other hand it is quite inconvenient that in my dorm we only have one working washing machine out of three. Three are not even enough for the whole building. The internet service is sort of shotty, it is sometime very unreliable which is very annoying. For that price tag it should be fully functional 24/7. The meal plan is on and off for me. IT is great to have a bountiful cuisine choice for lunch and dinner, but the menus cycle every three weeks, which can become very boring. After externship we have a meal swipe which can be used at the Apple Pie Cafe or Courtside Cafe, which its great but at Apple Pie a swipe, which is equivalent to $8 it is not even enough to get a sandwich and a soda. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being here. There is an awesome view and you are surrounded by nature with the Hudson River viewable from some dorms. It is very picturesque.",
