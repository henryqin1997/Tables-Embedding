His promise was recognised with an NBC Denis Compton Award in 2005, and in the same year he made his first-class debut for Glamorgan against Bangladesh A aged 17 years and 325 days., 51818=In 2010 he played for the Unicorns in the Clydesdale Bank 40, contributing a couple of quick 30s and 40s and hitting a rapid half-century against Surrey, before returning to Glamorgan's Seconds. He remained there in 2011, and as well as batting in the top order also found his medium-pace seamers called upon more often.

He still had not secured a spot in the first XI when, in June 2009, he was suspended for three weeks by the county after being caught drink-driving.
