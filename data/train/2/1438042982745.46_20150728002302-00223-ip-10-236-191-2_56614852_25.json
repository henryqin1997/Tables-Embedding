The Packers got the ball with just under six minutes left on their own 20 and drove 80 yards in 15 plays, taking 8:36 off the clock., 47999=In the early moments of the fourth, on another third down -- 3rd-and-6 from the Dallas eight-yard line -- Rodgers completed a seven-yard pass to Jordy Nelson. On the next play, Rodgers snuck over the goal line for a 10-0 lead with 13:14 to play., 46058=Romo, who came into the game with a perfect 13-0 November record, did not have a good return to his home state, recording 251 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception on 24-of-39 passing for the Cowboys (6-3), who had won their last previous games. Roy Williams caught five passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, and Marion Barber led a weak rushing attack with 26 yards on five carries., 48257=On the ensuing possession, Romo fumbled on second down after he was sacked. Felix Jones appeared to recover the fumble for Dallas, but the ball popped out while he was on the ground. Clay Matthews recovered for the Packers at the Cowboys' three-yard line, and Rodgers threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Haver three plays later for a 17-0 advantage with 10:49 on the clock., 45092=Green Bay, WI (Sports Network) - Aaron Rodgers threw for 189 yards and a touchdown, and the Green Bay Packers dominated the Dallas Cowboys, 17-7, to hand Tony Romo his first-ever loss in November.}",
