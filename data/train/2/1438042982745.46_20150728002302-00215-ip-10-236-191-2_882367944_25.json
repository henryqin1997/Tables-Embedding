    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students The campus is slightly larger than you would think, so take a tour and see how you like it. The tour guide was extremely helpful and knowledgeable when I took the tour Bang for the buck BCTC is less expensive than a larger school here in Kentucky, but so many of the classes are the same. Am enjoying being here I have taken classes at 3 different BCTC campuses, and have liked every one of them. Am learning a lot The class sizes are much smaller than a large university, making things much more hands on and personal. You can learn a lot at this school and the professors are very helpful.
