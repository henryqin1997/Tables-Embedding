It features 1066\u00a0MHz FSB, fits into the Tigerton's mPGA604 socket, and is compatible with the both the Intel Caneland, and IBM X4 chipsets. These processors support DDR2-1066 (533\u00a0MHz), and have a maximum TDP below 130\u00a0W. They are intended for blades and other stacked computer systems. Availability was scheduled for the second half of 2008. It was followed shortly by the Nehalem microarchitecture. Total transistor count is 1.9 billion.[25], 152862=Westmere-EX is the follow-on to Beckton/Nehalem-EX and the first Intel Chip to have ten CPU cores. The microarchitecture is the same as in the six-core Gulftown/Westmere-EP processor, but it uses the LGA 1567 package like Beckton to support up to eight sockets., 162663=The Xeon E7 v2 line was an update, released in February 2014 to replace the original Xeon E7 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. There was no Sandy Bridge version of these processors., 27793=In mid-2001, the Xeon brand was introduced (\"Pentium\" was dropped from the name). The initial variant that used the new NetBurst microarchitecture, \"Foster\", was slightly different from the desktop Pentium 4 (\"Willamette\"). It was a decent chip for workstations, but for server applications it was almost always outperformed by the older Cascades cores with a 2 MB L2 cache and AMD's Athlon MP. Combined with the need to use expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM, the Foster's sales were somewhat unimpressive., 36846=Due to a lack of success with Intel's Itanium and Itanium 2 processors, AMD was able to introduce x86-64, a 64-bit extension to the x86 architecture. Intel followed suit by including Intel 64 (formerly EM64T; it is almost identical to AMD64) in the 90\u00a0nm version of the Pentium 4 (\"Prescott\"), and a Xeon version codenamed \"Nocona\" with 1 MB L2 cache was released in 2004. Released with it were the E7525 (workstation), E7520 and E7320 (both server) chipsets, which added support for PCI Express, DDR-II and Serial ATA. The Xeon was noticeably slower than AMD's Opteron, although it could be faster in situations where Hyper-Threading came into play., 119380=At low end of the 3400-series is not a Lynnfield but a Clarkdale processor, which is also used in the Core i3-500 and Core i5-600 processors as well as the Celeron G1000 and G6000 Pentium series. A single model was released in March 2010, the Xeon L3406. Compared to all other Clarkdale-based products, this one does not support integrated graphics, but has a much lower thermal design power of just 30 W. Compared to the Lynnfield-based Xeon 3400 models, it only offers two cores., 73221=On 26 June 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5100 series) codenamed Woodcrest (product code 80556); it was the first Intel Core microarchitecture processor to be launched on the market. It is a server and workstation version of the Intel Core 2 processor. Intel claims that it provides an 80% boost in performance, while reducing power consumption by 20% relative to the Pentium D., 170927=Xeon E7-48xx\u00a0v3 and E7-88xx\u00a0v3 series also contain functional bug-free support for Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX), which was disabled via a microcode update in August 2014 for Haswell-E, Haswell-WS (E3-12xx v3) and Haswell-EP (E5-16xx/26xx v3) models, due to a bug that was discovered in the TSX implementation.[34][35][36][37][38][39], 21814=The first Xeon-branded processor was the Pentium II Xeon (code-named \"Drake\"). It was released in 1998, replacing the Pentium Pro in Intel's server lineup. The Pentium II Xeon was a \"Deschutes\" Pentium II (and shared the same product code: 80523) with a full-speed 512\u00a0kB, 1\u00a0MB, or 2\u00a0MB L2 cache. The L2 cache was implemented with custom 512 kB SRAMs developed by Intel. The number of SRAMs depended on the amount of cache. A 512 kB configuration required one SRAM, a 1 MB configuration: two SRAMs, and a 2 MB configuration: four SRAMs on both sides of the PCB. Each SRAM was a 12.90\u00a0mm by 17.23\u00a0mm (222.21\u00a0mm\u00b2) die fabricated in a 0.35\u00a0\u00b5m four-layer metal CMOS process and packaged in a cavity-down wire-bonded land grid array (LGA).[1] The additional cache required a larger module and thus the Pentium II Xeon used a larger slot, Slot 2. It was supported by the 440GX dual-processor workstation chipset and the 450NX quad- or octo-processor chipset., 29796=In 2002 Intel released a 130\u00a0nm version of Xeon branded CPU, codenamed \"Prestonia\". It supported Intel's new Hyper-Threading technology and had a 512\u00a0kB L2 cache. This was based on the \"Northwood\" Pentium 4 core. A new server chipset, E7500 (which allowed the use of dual-channel DDR SDRAM), was released to support this processor in servers, and soon the bus speed was boosted to 533\u00a0MT/s (accompanied by new chipsets: the E7501 for servers and the E7505 for workstations). The Prestonia performed much better than its predecessor and noticeably better than Athlon MP. The support of new features in the E75xx series also gave it a key advantage over the Pentium III Xeon and Athlon MP branded CPUs (both stuck with rather old chipsets), and it quickly became the top-selling server/workstation processor., 127231=Gainestown or Nehalem-EP, the successor to the Xeon Core microarchitecture, is based on the Nehalem microarchitecture and uses the same 45\u00a0nm manufacturing methods as Intel's Penryn. The first processor released with the Nehalem microarchitecture is the desktop Intel Core i7, which was released in November 2008. Server processors of the Xeon 55xx range were first supplied to testers in December 2008.[27], 154818=The Xeon E3-12xx line of processors, introduced in April 2011, uses the Sandy Bridge chips that are also the base for the Core i3/i5/i7-2xxx and Celeron/Pentium Gxxx products using the same LGA 1155 socket, but with a different set of features disabled. Notably, the Xeon variants include support for ECC memory, VT-d and trusted execution that are not present on the consumer models, while only some Xeon E3 enable the integrated GPU that is present on Sandy Bridge. Like its Xeon 3400-series predecessors, the Xeon E3 only supports operation with a single CPU socket and is targeted at entry-level workstations and servers. The CPUID of this processor is 0206A7h, the product code is 80623., 120728=Bloomfield is the codename for the successor to the Xeon Core microarchitecture, is based on the Nehalem microarchitecture and uses the same 45\u00a0nm manufacturing methods as Intel's Penryn. The first processor released with the Nehalem architecture is the desktop Intel Core i7, which was released in November 2008. This is the server version for single CPU systems. This is a single-socket Intel Xeon processor. The performance improvements over previous Xeon processors are based mainly on:, 39619=64-bit Xeon MPs were introduced in April 2005. The cheaper \"Cranford\" was an MP version of Nocona, while the more expensive \"Potomac\" was a Cranford with 8\u00a0MB of L3 cache. Like Nocona and Irwindale, they also have product code 80546., 172453=By 2013 Xeon processors were ubiquitous in supercomputers\u2014more than 80% of the Top500 machines in 2013 used them. For the very fastest machines, much of the performance comes from compute accelerators; Intel's entry into that market was the Xeon Phi, the first machines using it appeared in the June 2012 list and by June 2013 it was used in the fastest computer in the world., 48774=Released on 29 August 2006,[2] the 7100 series, codenamed Tulsa (product code 80550), is an improved version of Paxville MP, built on a 65\u00a0nm process, with 2\u00a0MB of L2 cache (1\u00a0MB per core) and up to 16\u00a0MB of L3 cache. It uses Socket 604 [1]. Tulsa was released in two lines: the N-line uses a 667\u00a0MT/s FSB, and the M-line uses an 800\u00a0MT/s FSB. The N-line ranges from 2.5\u00a0GHz to 3.5\u00a0GHz (model numbers 7110N-7150N), and the M-line ranges from 2.6\u00a0GHz to 3.4\u00a0GHz (model numbers 7110M-7140M). L3 cache ranges from 4\u00a0MB to 16\u00a0MB across the models.[3], 167023=Introduced in September 2014, Xeon E5-16xx\u00a0v3 and Xeon E5-26xx\u00a0v3 series use the new LGA\u00a02011-v3 socket, which is incompatible with the LGA\u00a02011 socket used by earlier Xeon\u00a0E5 and E5\u00a0v2 generations based on Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge microarchitectures. Some of the main benefits of this generation, compared to the previous one, are improved power efficiency, higher core counts, and bigger last level caches (LLCs). Following the already used nomenclature, Xeon E5-26xx v3 series allows dual-socket operation., 84060=Intel released relabeled versions of its quad-core (2\u00d72) Core 2 Quad processor as the Xeon 3200-series (product code 80562) on 7 January 2007.[14] The 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 \"quad-core\" (dual-die dual-core[15]) comprised two separate dual-core die next to each other in one CPU package. The models are the X3210, X3220 and X3230, running at 2.13\u00a0GHz, 2.4\u00a0GHz and 2.66\u00a0GHz, respectively.[16] Like the 3000-series, these models only support single-CPU operation and operate on a 1066\u00a0MHz front-side bus. It is targeted at the \"blade\" market. The X3220 is also branded and sold as Core2 Quad Q6600, the X3230 as Q6700., 117498=Xeon 3400-series processors based on Lynnfield fill the gap between the previous 3300-series \"Yorkfield\" processors and the newer 3500-series \"Bloomfield\". Like Bloomfield, they are quad-core single-package processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture, but were introduced almost a year later, in September 2009. The same processors are marketed for mid-range to high-end desktops systems as Core i5 and Core i7. They have two integrated memory channels as well as PCI Express and Direct Media Interface (DMI) links, but no QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) interface., 24206=In 1999, the Pentium II Xeon was replaced by the Pentium III Xeon. Reflecting the incremental changes from the Pentium II \"Deschutes\" core to the Pentium III \"Katmai\" core, the first Pentium III Xeon, named \"Tanner\", was just like its predecessor except for the addition of Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and a few cache controller improvements. The product codes for Tanner mirrored that of Katmai; 80525., 147997=Beckton or Nehalem-EX (EXpandable server market) is a Nehalem-based processor with up to eight cores and uses buffering inside the chipset to support up to 16 standard DDR3 DIMMS per CPU socket without requiring the use of FB-DIMMS.[29] Unlike all previous Xeon MP processors, Nehalem-EX uses the new LGA 1567 package, replacing the Socket 604 used in the previous models, up to Xeon 7400 \"Dunnington\". The 75xx models have four QuickPath interfaces, so it can be used in up-to eight-socket configurations, while the 65xx models are only for up to two sockets. Designed by the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) Santa Clara and Hudson Design Teams, Beckton is manufactured on the P1266 (45\u00a0nm) technology. Its launch in March 2010 coincided with that of its direct competitor, AMD's Opteron 6xxx \"Magny-Cours\".[30], 114870=Announced on 15 September 2008.[26], 158395=The Xeon E5-16xx processors follow the previous Xeon 3500/3600-series products as the high-end single-socket platform, using the LGA 2011 package introduced with this processor. They share the Sandy Bridge-E platform with the single-socket Core i7-38xx and i7-39xx processors. The CPU chips have no integrated GPU but eight CPU cores, some of which are disabled in the entry-level products. The Xeon E5-26xx line has the same features but also enables multi-socket operation like the earlier Xeon 5000-series and Xeon 7000-series processors., 160597=The Xeon E5 v2 line was an update, released in September 2013 to replace the original Xeon E5 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. The maximum number of CPU cores was raised to 12 per processor module and the total L3 cache was upped to 30\u00a0MB.[31][32] The consumer version of the Xeon E5-16xx v2 processor is the Core i7-48xx and 49xx., 168994=Introduced in May 2015, Xeon E7-48xx\u00a0v3 and Xeon E7-88xx\u00a0v3 series provide higher core counts, higher per-core performance and improved reliability features, compared to the previous Xeon E7\u00a0v2 generation. Following the usual SKU nomenclature, Xeon E7-48xx\u00a0v3 and E7-88xx\u00a0v3 series allow multi-socket operation, supporting up to quad- and eight-socket configurations, respectively.[34][35], 135886=The uni-processor version without QPI comes as LC35xx and EC35xx, while the dual-processor version is sold as LC55xx and EC55xx and uses QPI for communication between the processors. Both versions use a DMI link to communicate with the 3420 that is also used in the 3400-series Lynfield Xeon processors, but use an LGA 1366 package that is otherwise used for processors with QPI but no DMI or PCI Express links. The CPUID code of both Lynnfield and Jasper forest is 106Ex, i.e., family 6, model 30., 156528=Xeon E3-12xx v2 is a minor update of the Sandy Bridge-based E3-12xx, using the 22\u00a0nm shrink, and providing slightly better performance while remaining backwards compatible. They were released in May 2012 and mirror the desktop Core i3/i5/i7-3xxx parts., 78936=On 11 November 2007, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5200 series) codenamed Wolfdale-DP (product code 80573).[8] It is built on a 45\u00a0nm process like the desktop Core 2 Duo and Xeon-SP Wolfdale, featuring Intel 64 (Intel's x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology. It is unclear whether the \"Demand Based Switching\" power management is available on the L5238.[9] Wolfdale has 6\u00a0MB of shared L2 Cache., 44560=An MP-capable version of Paxville DP, codenamed Paxville MP, product code 80560, was released on 1 November 2005. There are two versions: one with 2\u00a0MB of L2 Cache (1\u00a0MB per core), and one with 4\u00a0MB of L2 (2\u00a0MB per core). Paxville MP, called the dual-core Xeon 7000-series, was produced using a 90\u00a0nm process. Paxville MP clock ranges between 2.67\u00a0GHz and 3.0\u00a0GHz (model numbers 7020\u20137041), with some models having a 667\u00a0MT/s FSB, and others having an 800\u00a0MT/s FSB., 43061=The first dual-core CPU branded Xeon, codenamed Paxville DP, product code 80551, was released by Intel on 10 October 2005. Paxville DP had NetBurst microarchitecture, and was a dual-core equivalent of the single-core Irwindale (related to the Pentium D branded \"Smithfield\") with 4\u00a0MB of L2 Cache (2\u00a0MB per core). The only Paxville DP model released ran at 2.8\u00a0GHz, featured an 800\u00a0MT/s front side bus, and was produced using a 90\u00a0nm process., 137992=Gulftown or Westmere-EP, a six-core 32\u00a0nm Westmere-based processor, is the basis for the Xeon 36xx and 56xx series and the Core i7-980X. It launched in the first quarter of 2010. The 36xx-series follows the 35xx-series Bloomfield uni-processor model while the 56xx-series follows the 55xx-series Gainestown dual-processor model and both are socket compatible to their predecessors., 60713=On 14 March 2006, Intel released a dual-core processor codenamed Sossaman and branded as Xeon LV (low-voltage). Subsequently an ULV (ultra-low-voltage) version was released. The Sossaman was a low-/ultra-low-power and double-processor capable CPU (like AMD Quad FX), based on the \"Yonah\" processor, for ultradense non-consumer environment (i.e., targeted at the blade-server and embedded markets), and was rated at a thermal design power (TDP) of 31 W (LV: 1.66\u00a0GHz, 2\u00a0GHz and 2.16\u00a0GHz) and 15 W (ULV: 1.66\u00a0GHz).[4] As such, it supported most of the same features as earlier Xeons: Virtualization Technology, 667\u00a0MT/s front side bus, and dual-core processing, but did not support 64-bit operations, so it could not run 64-bit server software, such as Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, and therefore was limited to 16\u00a0GB of memory. A planned successor, codenamed \"Merom MP\" was to be a drop-in upgrade to enable Sossaman-based servers to upgrade to 64-bit capability. However, this was abandoned in favour of low-voltage versions of the Woodcrest LV processor leaving the Sossaman at a dead-end with no upgrade path., 64714=The 3000 series, codenamed Conroe (product code 80557) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU,[5] released at the end of September 2006, was the first Xeon for single-CPU operation. The same processor is branded as Core 2 Duo or as Pentium Dual-Core and Celeron, with varying features disabled. They use LGA 775 (Socket T), operate on a 1066\u00a0MHz front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading. Conroe Processors with a number ending in \"5\" have a 1333\u00a0MT/s FSB.[6], 91998=A quad-core (2\u00d72) successor of the Woodcrest for DP segment, consisting of two dual-core Woodcrest chips in one package similarly to the dual-core Pentium D branded CPUs (two single-core chips) or the quad-core Kentsfield. All Clovertowns use the LGA 771 package. The Clovertown has been usually implemented with two Woodcrest dies on a multi-chip module, with 8\u00a0MB of L2 cache (4\u00a0MB per die). Like Woodcrest, lower models use a 1066\u00a0MT/s FSB, and higher models use a 1333\u00a0MT/s FSB. Intel released Clovertown, product code 80563, on 14 November 2006[17] with models E5310, E5320, E5335, E5345, and X5355, ranging from 1.6\u00a0GHz to 2.66\u00a0GHz. All models support: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT. The E and X designations are borrowed from Intel's Core 2 model numbering scheme; an ending of \u22120 implies a 1066\u00a0MT/s FSB, and an ending of \u22125 implies a 1333\u00a0MT/s FSB.[16] All models have a TDP of 80\u00a0W with the exception of the X5355, which has a TDP of 120\u00a0W. A low-voltage version of Clovertown with a TDP of 50\u00a0W has a model numbers L5310, L5320 and L5335 (1.6\u00a0GHz, 1.86\u00a0GHz and 2.0\u00a0GHz respectively). The 3.0\u00a0GHz X5365 arrived in July 2007, and became available in the Apple Mac Pro [2] on 4 April 2007.[3][18] The X5365 performs up to around 38\u00a0GFLOPS in the LINPACK benchmark. [4], 38105=A slightly updated core called \"Irwindale\" was released in early 2005, with 2 MB L2 cache and the ability to have its clock speed reduced during low processor demand. Although it was a bit more competitive than the Nocona had been, independent tests showed that AMD's Opteron still outperformed Irwindale. Both of these Prescott-derived Xeons have the product code 80546., 98946=On 11 November 2007 Intel presented Yorkfield-based Xeons \u2013 called Harpertown (product code 80574) \u2013 to the public.[5] This family consists of dual die quad-core CPUs manufactured on a 45\u00a0nm process and featuring 1066\u00a0MHz, 1333\u00a0MHz, 1600\u00a0MHz front-side buses, with TDP rated from 40\u00a0W to 150\u00a0W depending on the model. These processors fit in the LGA 771 package. All models feature Intel 64 (Intel's x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology. All except the E5405 and L5408 also feature Demand Based Switching.[19][20] The supplementary character in front of the model-number represents the thermal rating: an L depicts a TDP of 40\u00a0W or 50\u00a0W, an E depicts 80\u00a0W whereas an X is 120\u00a0W TDP or above. The speed of 3.00\u00a0GHz comes as four models, two models with 80\u00a0W TDP two other models with 120\u00a0W TDP with 1333\u00a0MHz or 1600\u00a0MHz front-side bus respectively. The fastest Harpertown is the X5492 whose TDP of 150\u00a0W is higher than those of the Prescott-based Xeon DP but having twice as many cores. (The X5482 is also sold under the name \"Core 2 Extreme QX9775\" for use in the Intel SkullTrail system.), 165078=Introduced in May 2013, Xeon E3-12xx\u00a0v3 is the first Xeon series based on the Haswell microarchitecture. It uses the new LGA\u00a01150 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Haswell processors, incompatible with the LGA 1155 that was used in Xeon\u00a0E3 and E3\u00a0v2. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. The main benefit of the new microarchitecture is better power efficiency., 53946=On 23 May 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5000 series) codenamed Dempsey (product code 80555). Released as the Dual-Core Xeon 5000-series, Dempsey is a NetBurst microarchitecture processor produced using a 65\u00a0nm process, and is virtually identical to Intel's \"Presler\" Pentium Extreme Edition, except for the addition of SMP support, which lets Dempsey operate in dual-processor systems. Dempsey ranges between 2.50\u00a0GHz and 3.73\u00a0GHz (model numbers 5020\u20135080). Some models have a 667\u00a0MT/s FSB, and others have a 1066\u00a0MT/s FSB. Dempsey has 4\u00a0MB of L2 Cache (2\u00a0MB per core). A Medium Voltage model, at 3.2\u00a0GHz and 1066\u00a0MT/s FSB (model number 5063), has also been released. Dempsey also introduces a new interface for Xeon processors: LGA 771, also known as Socket J. Dempsey was the first Xeon core in a long time to be somewhat competitive with its Opteron-based counterparts, although it could not claim a decisive lead in any performance metric \u2013 that would have to wait for its successor, the Woodcrest., 136443=The Celeron P1053 belongs into the same family as the LC35xx series, but lacks some RAS features that are present in the Xeon version.}",
