            "Come visit and check out the campus. Not only is it gorgeous, it also has the friendliest students you will ever meet. My first day visiting I had ten people come up to me to ask where I needed to go. (I guess I looked lost!)",
            "Kansas State is a wonderful school filled with tons of school pride, great teachers, and friendly students. The small-town feel in a big city instantly makes it feel like home. Should be your #1 choice for college!"

Homecoming, 44802=Scholarships are available for pretty much every activity that you're willing to get involved in (including Physics club), but you have to make sure to specifically mention the groups that you're involved in when you meet with your financial aid advisor. Make sure to pay the dorm down-payment, which is either $400 or $500 and is due around the same time that you fill out the housing contract, as early as you can. Waiting until May (when you're planning on moving into dorms in August) can result in you being placed in temporary housing, which means you are stuck wherever housing is available and then you'll receive an email anywhere from three days to four months after moving telling you that you have two days to pack and move everything to another room. Freshman year is generally the best time to take the off-the-wall classes, because once you get into your major specific classes, depending on your field of study, you could run into a bit of a time crunch. Should you have any difficulty with learning material for a specific class, K-State offers free tutoring to students throughout the day at the dining centers. More information can be found online or at the entrances to the dining halls. It is possible to learn a ton, take demanding classes, have a strong GPA, and still have a social life, you just have to be willing to put in the effort and not be afraid to ask for help when you need it., 711722=Make sure to apply for admission early. Fill out the admission and scholarship application before November 1st and take the ACT before your senior year. Also, visit campus on specialized student days. The campus isn't too big and everyone is very friendly., 296967=No matter what your major is or is going to be, get to know the students and professors in your classes and don't be afraid to ask for help. That's what office hours are for. There are a ton of tutoring opportunities available for almost every subject. You just have to utilize them. And no matter how cold it is outside in December, go to class!, 816308=The campus safety at Kansas State University is one of the best. At night there are police that patrol the campus, and there are emergency phone call booths on every side walk. It is so safe at KSU that I have left my car running in the parking lot to warm it up when it's cold outside. Is there crime, yes, but nothing major. The biggest crime that happens on campus is somebody's bicycle was stolen because they did not lock it up. Even at 4 o'clock in the morning there are always students walking back from a late night study session or finishing a project. If feel extremely safe when I am on campus at K-State., 579381=There are so many safety precautions in place; even at 3:00 in the morning I feel safe on campus., 883641=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Do your research on where you want to live. Lots of students get into the Greek life and end up regretting it. It isn't as good as they tell you (from a first hand experience). Look into dorm opportunties if you want to meet new people and stay away from the greek life. It is not good for your academics (which is what your going to college for). There is plenty of partying elsewhere trust me :). Bang for the buck Tuition is bad anywhere you go. But the constant raise of tuition gets annoying. They are talking about starting a plan where you pay the tuition you started with as a freshman the entire time you're in college even if the tuition goes up. Am enjoying being here There is something for everyone. Whether you want a quiet coffee shop, a good party, or lots of student activities, Manhattan has it. I've lived here for my whole life (20 years) and i don't want to leave. Great community! Am learning a lot Lots of very intelligent professors and many to choose from. Very good learning environment.",
