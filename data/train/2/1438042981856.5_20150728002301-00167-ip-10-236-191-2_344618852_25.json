The campaign consisted of paid media, public relations, including a speakers\u2019 bureau, and community health activities., 76917=We purchased 953 30-second advertisements on prime-time network television (equal to 4835 gross rating points) and 1645 60-second radio advertisements (3245 gross rating points). (Gross rating points are a media industry measure to assess message penetration.) In addition, we purchased 10 quarter-page advertisements in the local daily newspaper and 1314 30-second advertisements on cable television. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0, 71862=The media relations campaign activities resulted in 28 television news stories, 5 radio news stories, 10 newspaper stories, and 125 television news promotions. Pledges to walk daily were made by 10,800 individuals. The BC Walks Web site had 11,360 hits, and 961 individuals logged their minutes walked. The campaign speakers\u2019 bureau made 42 presentations that were attended by 1492 people. There were 30 worksite walking programs, which included 1207 employees and their family members who pledged to walk. Five schools, with approximately 2000 students, developed walking programs. In addition, the campaign distributed 250 prescription pads promoting the campaign to physicians and nurse practitioners in Broome County., 71100=Of the 1396 eligible respondents (aged 40 to 65) who were surveyed at baseline, 949 (68%) were identified as being insufficiently active. Of these 949 respondents, 575 resided in Broome County, and 374 resided in Chautauqua County. At follow-up, 393 (68%) of baseline respondents in Broome County and 207 (55%) of baseline respondents in Chautauqua County were reinterviewed. Table 2 shows the distribution of demographic and behavioral characteristics for participants with and without follow-up data. Most demographic characteristics were similar between intervention and control communities and between dropouts and completers (participants with follow-up information). However, compared with Chautauqua County, more Broome County completers reported fair to poor health and more reported being employed., 80785=Physical activity levels in the United States have remained relatively unchanged during the past 20 years (1). Physical inactivity is responsible for approximately 250,000 deaths annually in the United States (2) and is likely a major contributing factor in the epidemics of overweight, obesity, and diabetes (3). In 1995 and 1996, major public health reviews recognized the health benefits of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as walking 30 minutes daily (4-5). The recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and the U.S. surgeon general is to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity at least 30 minutes per day 5 days per week. Individuals not meeting the recommendation are deemed insufficiently active and at greater risk for chronic disease (4-5)., 83509=Suggested citation for this article: Reger-Nash B, Fell P, Spicer D, Fisher BD, Cooper L, Chey T, et al.
