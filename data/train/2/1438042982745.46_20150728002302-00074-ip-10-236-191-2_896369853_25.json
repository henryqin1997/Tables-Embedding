            "If you are a student that loves to have a social life, yet have a good education this is great for you. Mostly African-Americans attend this school, but we welcome any and everybody.",
            "If you are able to get a car, it would be wise to do so if you are not a fan of walking. If you can't, save up money for gas if you know people that drive and cabs if they are unavailable.",
            "It may be a little expensive to attend VSU, especially if you're an out-of-state student like myself, but it is all worth it. You will have a great and traditional college experience, as well as earn a great education.",
            "I love it here and I'm so glad that I go to VSU! You meet great people here and in a lot of cases, some people become like family to you. I have made some mistakes, but that was all my fault and I am changing that. You just have to be focused here and do not be afraid to ask people for help. A lot of people are willing to help you any way that they can if you're willing to help yourself. I would not trade this experience for the world!",
            "I have learned so much while being here at VSU. You are able to get to know most of your professors and it is very easy to find help; all you have to do is ask. It is also easy to get distracted by the great party scene but that is up to you and you only. If you can balance your work and social life you will be fine."
