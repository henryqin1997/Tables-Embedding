The commands are used to perform various tasks that this chapter describes. smreg \u2013 If you are not running at least the Solaris Express 5/06release, this command is used to register all console applications. , use this command only to register legacy applications that were created for a version of the console that is not at least Java Web Console 3.0. wcadmin \u2013 Starting with the Solaris 10 11/06 release, this command is used to configure the console, and to register and deploy console applications. For more information, see the wcadmin(1M) man page. smcwebserver \u2013 This command starts and stops the console's web server.

Click the Start Each Application in a New Window check box if you want to run the application in a new window. If you do not select this option, the application will run in the default window, replacing the launch page. Click the link for the application that you want to run. Tip \u2013 You can also launch an individual application directly and bypass the launch page by using the following syntax: https://hostname.domain:6789/app-context-name where app-context-name is the name that is used when the application is deployed. To find the application context name, you can do one of the following: Read the application's documentation. Run the wcadmin list -a or the smreg list -a command to see a list of deployed web applications and their context names. Run the application from the web console's launch page and note the URL that is displayed in the address location field. You can type the URL directly the next time",
