Two of Wake Forest's top three players left school early to enter the draft. Florida State must replace 2008-09 ACC scoring leader Toney Douglas., 48930=That one-two punch has left Scheyer and junior Nolan Smith as the only scholarship guards on the roster, though that could change if Andre Dawkins - listed as a five-star prospect for the Class of 2010 - receives clearance to play at Duke a year earlier than expected., 62277=Top 10 upsets: A November to remember, 43538=Though Duke reached the Sweet 16 and won the ACC tournament last season, the Blue Devils haven't quite lived up to the program's lofty standards recently. North Carolina has won two national titles since Duke made its last trip to the Final Four, a fact that hasn't gone unnoticed on Tobacco Road. Duke hasn't reached the Final Four since 2004, which marks its longest drought since the mid-1980s., 50579=Duke also could counteract its lack of guards by making the most of its size. Duke's roster includes six players who are at least 6-8 and four guys who are at least 6-10. The Blue Devils don't need long memories to see how this formula could work in the ACC: Florida State earned its first NCAA tournament bid since 1998 last season with five guys 6-7 or taller earning at least 16 starts., 41678=August 11, 2009}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Duke made its 14th consecutive NCAA tournament appearance last season, but the Blue Devils haven't advanced to the Final Four since reaching the semifinals in 2004. That marks Duke's longest Final Four drought since the seven-season absence between its 1978 semifinal appearance and its 1986 berth in the championship game. Here is how Duke has fared over the past five season. Duke's 'drought' \"We had a lift that morning and our strength coach said, 'We're not going to be here next year. We're lifting this morning, but next year we're going to be warming up for a shootaround for this game,' \" Scheyer recalls. \"All of us looked at each other and we all agreed with him, to say the least.\" Then again, players don't attend Duke merely to win ACC titles; they typically have bigger goals in mind. That much was evident when the Blue Devils reported to a weight-training session the morning of the NCAA championship game, several hours before their archrivals would win their second national title in the past five seasons. Ninety-nine percent of the programs in the country would love to have Duke's problems. The Blue Devils are coming off a season in which they went 30-7, earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament and won their eighth ACC",
    "textAfterTable": "At the time, the Blue Devils had plenty of reason to feel optimistic. Duke figured to return the nucleus of its Sweet 16 squad - it didn't have a senior who averaged as much as five points per game last season. But Duke's outlook has changed. First came swingman Gerald Henderson's decision to forgo his senior season to enter the NBA draft, where he was taken by the Charlotte Bobcats with the 12th pick. Then came the announcement that freshman guard Elliot Williams planned to transfer to Memphis to be closer to his ailing mother. That one-two punch has left Scheyer and junior Nolan Smith as the only scholarship guards on the roster, though that could change if Andre Dawkins - listed as a five-star prospect for the Class of 2010 - receives clearance to play at Duke a year earlier than expected. Duke's ability to withstand that lack of depth in the backcourt depends largely on the progress of Scheyer and Singler. Scheyer played the best basketball of his career late last season after moving to point guard. He averaged 18.6 points, 2.4 assists and 1.8 steals over the last 12 games of the season and was named the ACC tournament's most valuable player. Singler, a 6-foot-8 junior, earned second-team All-ACC honors as a power forward last season, but the Blue Devils plan to capitalize on his versatility by making him more",
