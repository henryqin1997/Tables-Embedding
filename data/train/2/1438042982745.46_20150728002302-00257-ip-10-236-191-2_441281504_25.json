The break-off part encloses the rubber stopper without radical contact. It has a retaining pin, the free end of which rests axially on the rubber stopper\u2014when the tamperproof seal is fitted, and it has at least two open apertures. The length of the break-off part corresponds to at least twice the length of the internal thread of the conical adapter lock. 20110015578 Published Description Patent application number Christiane Lowke, Berlin DE Christiane L'Heritier, Paris FR 03-26-2015 METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR THE AUTOMATIC SELECTION OF A SCANNING PROTOCOL - A method is disclosed for automatically selecting a scanning protocol for a tomographic recording of an X-ray image of a patient in that at least one patient-specific value is retrieved in the internal memory of a first computer. The patient-specific value can in particular be a measure of the anticipated X-ray absorption by the patient. The method includes automatically comparing the patient-specific value with retrievably stored reference values, wherein",
