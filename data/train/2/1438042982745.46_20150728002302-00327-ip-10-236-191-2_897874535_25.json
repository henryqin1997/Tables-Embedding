            "Monmouth has an extremely safe campus, it has a 21 person police force ON CAMPUS. Then there is still the Blue Light system all around campus.",
            "Sororities: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Sigma Tau, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Phi Epsilon, Lambda Theta Alpha, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Zeta Tau Alpha. Fraternities: Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Pi, Sigma tau Gamma, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Xi, and Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity.",
            "The clubs and activities around Monmouth are great. There is almost 80 clubs, and 13 Frats and Sororities! The clubs range from The Accounting Society to the Yoga club! The Student Activities Board is in charge of planning most of the social events during the school year and they do a great job!",
            "MU is great for any and all students!",
            "All colleges and universities are expensive these days, but Monmouth does offer a big load for the amount you are paying. First and most important, a great education, 24/7 academic help, 24/7 activities and fun, great campus. Then there is the beautiful weather, a giant mall less than a mile away, the beach less than a mile away, the horse race track, and easy access to Philly and New York!",
            "There is an endless list of fun at Monmouth, there is over 60 clubs and activities. Intramural and club sports all year long, a great quad for doing whatever you may please. THE BEACH is 3/4 of a mile away! A couple concerts a year, Taylor Swift might come this year! Stuff like Barstool Blackout, movie nights, athletic events, etc. Anything you can imagine, Monmouth can probably provide it!",
            "One way to describe Monmouth's dining is that they keep it to the basics. But they are extremely good at what they make, you'll get your usual pizza, fries, chicken, etc. The food is very good, there is the choice of the salad bar, too. Also, every Sunday, the weekend workers put a Cajun mix on some classics!",
            "I believe that most all dorms are the same all around the country. The newer dorms, like Mullaney, are nicer than older ones, I.E. Elmwood, Pinewood. But all the dorms do their jobs, the RA's are great; living in dorms with a completely new person is an experience you'll never get at any other point in life!",
            "The Monmouth University never aims for their students to just be bored in class because they want to challenge their students. The classes are small enough so that the teacher will know you by your name and be able to talk to you if you need any help.",
            "When looking at Monmouth University, make sure that you just come in with an open mind. Monmouth has the clubs and events so that every single student can find their nitch. Safe fun every weekend and great people all around. Then there is also the academic side, there are so many possibilities for majors and minors, and a great study abroad program!",
            "Monmouth is determined to getting its students graduated with employment, as quickly as possibly. But the experience of Monmouth University is amazing, the campus, clubs, sports, and events are always happening to fill your time. Monmouth wants all students to love their experience and have happiness when looking back on the memories."

But in general, I feel Monmouth's prices are far too high. total cost of attendance is approx. $40,000.... a little under for the 2010-2011 school year, and that price will only increase. I feel that much of the tuition is spent on unnecessary things, and that it's not used to enhance our academic experience. Monmouth spends the money earned from tuition on three things: landscaping, deserts in the dining hall that aren't even that good (they also make FAR too many deserts), and free shirts., 158087=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 54693=Join campus organizations. The radio and TV studios are comparable to professional studios. The Plangere building, where they are housed, was given by the found of the Asbury Park Times in 2001-2002. Also, the indoor athletic facilities are the newest to campus, so if you can join a sports team - DO IT! Monmouth hosts several athletic events at this venue and it's so stellar, it almost justifies your tuition price! Off campus, the beach is about 1/2 mile away. In warm weather, take advantage of it. There are plenty of restaurants, especially late night Nelly's, for those underage and, when of age, there are great bars and clubs. Jacks and Stingrays are a staple among Monmouth students. There's great shopping at the Promenade on Ocean Drive and the new Outlets, Monmouth Mall and Freehold Mall are close by as well. Monmouth U is in a perfect location as Asbury's Stone Pony is only 20 minutes away and NYC is just a train ride away. Six flags is also an option. That can be reached in under 30 minutes., 114100=One way to describe Monmouth's dining is that they keep it to the basics.

Class sizes are really small, and the professors are always willing to meet with you and are also really understanding. MU has a lot of resources if you are not doing well, like the Writing Center, the Math Center, and the Tutoring Center, which can match you with a tutor for any class you are taking.
