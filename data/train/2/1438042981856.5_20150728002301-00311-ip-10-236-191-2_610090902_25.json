The display of an 800 Euros (~$1056) notebook should be able to deliver higher contrast and lower black levels. The\u00a0N750JV (637:1, 0.52 cd/m\u00b2) and especially the\u00a0Aspire (837:1, 0.38 cd/m\u00b2) have significantly better results. The screen of the CX70 cannot cover the sRGB and AdobeRGB color spaces. This is not a problem for most users, since these spaces are important only for professional image editing., 56024=We tested the display in its factory state (target color space sRGB) and we detected significant DeltaE 2000 deviations in most of the colors, with the strongest ones in the soft blue tones and the gray. Only yellow and yellow-green were right on target (DeltaE less than 5). The display has a blue tint.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{278027=The CX70 completed the\u00a0WLAN test\u00a0after\u00a03:48 h. The Aspire (3:23 h) was slightly behind. The N750JV (4:34 h) is clearly ahead of the competition. Once again, the CX70 clearly surpasses its predecessor (1:53 h). During this test various websites were automatically loaded every 40 seconds. The energy saving profile is chosen and the display brightness is set at 150 cd/m\u00b2. The\u00a0DVD playback\u00a0stopped after\u00a02:50 h\u00a0on the CX70. Both of the rivals (Aspire: 2:44 h, N750JV: 2:54 h) are roughly on the same level. For the DVD test the energy saving profile is chosen (or a higher one, if the DVD does not play smoothly), the brightness is set at maximum, and the wireless modules are turned off., 167216=If gaming performance is of high importance to the buyer, the\u00a0Aspire is the better alternative. The device is available for 900 Euros (~$1188) with a Full HD display and without Windows operating system. A trimmed down version of the V3-772G (GeForce GT 750M, HD+ screen, Windows 8) costs around 800 Euros (~$1056). The previous model, the\u00a0Aspire V3-771G, has even more savings potential. The version with Core i5 processor and GeForce GT 650M is currently available for less than 700 Euros (~$924). We have already reviewed two models of the V3-771G family (Aspire V3-771G-736B161TMaii and Aspire V3-771G-7361161.12TBDCakk). However, each of those had a Core i7 processor. The\u00a0N750JV is also an alternative. But at 1200 Euros (~$1585), it is significantly more expensive than the Aspire., 276824=In idle use the battery of the CX70 lasts\u00a06:49 h. The\u00a0N750JV (6:53 h) is on par, while the\u00a0Aspire (5:46 h) has a shorter runtime. The CX70 has increased its battery life by two hours compared to its predecessor (4:48 h). The battery life in idle mode was determined using the Battery Eater Reader's test - the brightness is set at minimum, the energy saving profile is chosen, and the wireless modules are turned off. Under\u00a0load\u00a0the CX70 held out for\u00a00:56 h and thus lasted only slightly more than the competition (0:49 h). Once again, the N750JV (0:57 h) is on par. The Aspire (1:11 h) holds slightly longer. The battery life under load was determined using the Battery Eater Classic test - the brightness is set at maximum, high performance profile is chosen, and the wireless modules are activated., 22967=A small increase in the PCMark results can be achieved by using a second RAM module. The system memory then works in dual-channel mode. The PCMark7 result increases by about 3.5% to 2578 points. The PCMark Vantage results rise by 5.6% to 8807 points. If the CX70 is equipped with an SSD, the PC Mark results skyrocket. Our\u00a0Solid State Drive (Crucial RealSSD C300 - 64 GB) doubled the results\u00a0to 5053 points (PCMark 7) and 17098 points (PCMark Vantage). In practice, this means that the system reacts faster and the boot and load times of Windows and other programs are shorter., 123279=In addition to the\u00a0HD Graphics 4600 graphics chip by Intel, the laptop is also equipped with an Nvidia GeForce GT 740M GPU. The GeForce card is used when more graphics power is needed - when playing games for example. All other tasks are carried out by the Intel chip. Both GPUs support\u00a0DirectX 11.1. The GeForce graphics card belongs to the middle class and works with a\u00a0base clock frequency of 980 MHz. Overclocking to 1058 MHz is possible (Turbo). The CX70 makes full use of this functionality. Unfortunately, the GPU has only a 64-bit memory bus width. Therefore, it performs below its potential. The predecessor\u00a0featured a 128-bit one., 243305=During our stress test (Prime95 and Furmark running for at least an hour) the CPU's frequency on AC power was 2.5 to 2.6 GHz. It rarely reached 2.4 to 2.7 GHz. On battery power, the CPU operated at 2.6 to 2.7 GHz for the first couple of minutes. At the end, the frequency settled at 2.2 GHz. This behavior only occurs during the stress test. If only the processor is put under load, the CPU works at full power even on battery. This was proven by our test with Cinebench R11.5. The\u00a0graphics card completed the stress test on both AC and battery power at the maximum Turbo frequency (1058 MHz)., 292608=The\u00a0Acer Aspire V3-772G and the\u00a0Asus N750JV are the better choice if higher gaming performance and a high-quality display are the requirements. The Aspire even has better gaming performance than the N750JV. The Aspire offers more choice to the buyer - lots of different configurations are available. You can even save some money, if you choose the previous model\u00a0Aspire V3-771G. The N750JV offers a great sound system and an attractive casing (aluminum and plastic). But at 1200 to 1400 Euros (~$1585 to ~$1848) it is significantly more expensive than the competition.}",
