We handle backups, security, monitoring and alerting, system administration, and server upgrades. You get a Postgres endpoint that works with any standard Postgres client software. Our servers are hosted on fast SSD drives at DigitalOcean. Deployments are currently available in San Francisco, New York, London, Amsterdam, and Singapore; additional locations may be available by the time you read this. Control your databases from a web console or with our easy REST API. Most common Postgres extensions are included for free, including PostGIS. Custom setups are available, and we're always adding new features based on user requests.",
