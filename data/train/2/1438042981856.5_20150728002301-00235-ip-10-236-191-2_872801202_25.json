The final column is the difference between those two numbers for each team. 5. The \"quotient of change\" was finding the difference in between average recruiting ranking per team and average conference finish per team, and then adding those numbers together for the conference total over that span. 4. If teams jumped to new conferences in that span (Nebraska and Colorado), their conference standing average was determined over a five-year span, instead of six. Their recruiting rankings still were averaged over a six-year span. 3. If two teams from different divisions of a conference had the same conference record, the tie-breaker was overall record.\u00a0 If two teams from the same division had the same conference record, the tie-breaker was head-to-head result. 2.
