Here arew Walters\u2019 stats:, 238294=White Sox prospect Carlos Sanchez, a 19 year old out of the Dominican Republic, has seen some time at shortstop , but having split time between shortstop and second base in his career, we\u2019ll almost assuredly see him at second base in the Futures Game. \u00a0Sanchez, 5\u201911\u2033, 175, isn\u2019t the caliber of prospect of any of the players above, but he has promise and has been playing out of his mind in 2012. Sanchez features a compact swing with little power, but he hits a lot of line drives, mostly singles, and has the speed to beat out groundballs. Sanche also can bunt for base hits. Sanchez\u2019s bat speed is average, but his pitch recognition has made serious progress and he draws a fair amount of walks. Sanchez is very fast, but he needs a ton of work reading pitchers on the basepaths, not only to steal bases but even to take extra-bases. His instincts on the bases simply aren\u2019t there right now and he\u2019s not nearly a good enough baserunner as he should be with his speed. Defensively, Sanchez is able to put his speed to better use, and he has soft hands with a strong arm, tools that have allowed him to see time at shortstop as well even though his future is at second base. Sanchez doesn\u2019t have elite upside, but has room to grow in terms of hitting, his plate discipline, and especially on the basepaths. In 2012, Sanchez has really impressed offensively at High-A, posting a .325/.380/.405 line with 13 doubles, 3 triples, 1 homer, 33 RBI, and 13 of 24 steals. Sanchez has struck out 47 times versus 23 walks, and he has played 40 games at shortstop versus 29 at second base. Sanchez has been a breakout prospect for the White Sox this year, and it got him to Futures Game and we\u2019ll see just how far it can get him., 216296=post: http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/2012/06/29/phantom-ball-with-video-and-monty/, 326226=\u2014 Daryl Van Schouwen (@CST_soxvan) June 16, 2012, 118648=21-year old RHP Matt Heidenreic was a 4th round pick in the 2009 draft, and a PTBNL (player to be named later).
