    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25497=A proper amount of each flaky black bright pigment was added to an acrylic resin coating material (Acryl Auto Clear Super, manufactured by NIPPON PAINT Co. , Ltd. , solid matter about 50% by mass) so as to be 10% by mass in the resin, and well mixed and stirred, and then applied to a hiding power measurement paper by an applicator with intervals of 9 mil (9/1000 inch) and dried. The coated sheet was subjected to measurement of brightness L15 value at 15\u00b0 angle, hue a value and b value by a multi-angle spectrocolorimeter (X-rite MA 68II, Color Techno System Corp.). As the brightness L 15 value is higher, the brightness is higher and gives more brightness., 89864=\u00a9 2004-2015 FreePatentsOnline.com. All rights reserved. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use. A SumoBrain Solutions Company, 40501=Flaky glass (Micro Glass Fine Flake RCXFFX-1040 (9507), manufactured by Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. , C glass composition, average thickness 1.3 \u00b5m, average particle diameter 38 \u00b5m) 1.2 kg was added to 4 L of ion exchange water and stirred by a stirrer to obtain a slurry. After an aqueous solution of 0.5% by mass of tin(II) chloride 0.3 L was added to the slurry at normal temperature, the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The flaky glass was recovered by vacuum filtration and washed with ion-exchange water. The flaky glass was suspended in 4 L of pure water to obtain a slurry, and an aqueous solution of 2% by mass of palladium(II) chloride 0.01 L was added to the slurry, followed by stirring for 5 minutes . The flaky glass was recovered by vacuum filtration and washed with pure water., 13668=As the thin film material for coating on the surface of the flaky glass base material in the present invention is used triiron tetroxide (black iron oxide, magnetite Fe3O4) or a low order titanium oxide (black titanium oxide, TiOx wherein x is less than 2 and generally 1.5 to 1.8). A mixture of triiron tetroxide and a low order titanium oxide may be used and a laminate of a thin film of triiron tetroxide and a thin film of a low order titanium oxide may be used. In view of the safety and effect of dark interference color development, triiron tetroxide is preferably used. Adjustment of the thickness of the thin film in the coating makes it possible to give interference color. The thickness is 10 nm to 1.0 \u00b5m (1000 nm). If the thickness is thinner than 10 nm, black coloration is weak, and if it exceeds 1.0 \u00b5m, problems that it takes a long time to produce or that the coating layer is cracked may occur. If the thickness of the coating layer is 30 to 300 nm, beautiful interference color can be seen. If it exceeds 300 nm, the light absorption is intensified and the interference color becomes weak, however, the black coloration is intensified and the hiding power is increased., 31069=Each flaky glass thus obtained (100 g) was added to and dispersed in 1 L of purified water, and kept under heating at 75\u00b0C in a thermostat water tank. The resulting solution was adjusted to a pH of about 3.2 with a diluted hydrochloric acid. After that, 10% iron (III) chloride solution was added. In this case, the pH was kept about 3.2 by a diluted sodium hydroxide solution, thereby to give a flaky glass of which surface was coated with Fe2O3. The addition amount of the 10% iron(III) chloride solution was adjusted so as to make the coating thickness approximately even. That is, in the case where the thickness of the mother flaky glass was 0.7 \u00b5m, the total addition amount of the 10% iron(III) chloride solution was adjusted to 2005 g; in the case the thickness was 1.3 \u00b5m, the total addition amount of the 10% iron(III) chloride solution was adjusted to 1080 g; and in the case the thickness was 5 \u00b5m, the total addition amount of the 10% iron(III) chloride solution was adjusted to 281 g. After completion of the addition, the flaky glass suspension solution was filtered, and the recovered residue was dried, the residue was previously fired at 600\u00b0C for 2 hours to obtain Fe2O3-coated flaky glass.}",
