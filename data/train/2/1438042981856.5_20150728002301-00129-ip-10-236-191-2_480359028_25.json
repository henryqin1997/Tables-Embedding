Binding was assayed in the following manner. Polystyrene microtiter plate wells were coated with one of the proteins to be tested, at 2 \u03bcg/well. Coating was allowed to proceed during overnight incubation, at 4\ufffd C. Approximately 1010 phagemids were added to test binding. After extensive washing with PBS, the plates were incubated with rabbit anti-M13, anti-rabbit BRP, and substrate. The level of binding was measured by the intensity of color produced. The optical density was measured at A405. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and the average was calculated., 34673=It has been established that scFv penetrate tissues and are cleared from the blood more rapidly than a full size antibody because they are smaller in size. Adams, G. P., et al., Br. J. Cancer 77, 1405\u20131412 (1988); Hudson, P. J., Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11(5), 548\u2013557 (1999); Wu, A. M., et al., Tumor Targeting 4, 47 (1999). Thus, scFv are often employed in diagnostics involving radioactive labels such as tumor imaging to allow for a more rapid clearance of the radioactive label from the body. A number of cancer targeting scFv multimers have recently undergone pre-clinical evaluation for in vivo stability and efficacy. Adams, G. P., et al., Br. J. Cancer 77, 1405\u20131412 (1988); Wu, A. M., et al., Tumor Targeting 4, 47 (1999)., 69681=In the present invention, an scfv antibody library produced by the phage display technique was utilized to obtain and produce targeting molecules. Flow cytometry, particularly fluorescence-activated cell sorting (\u201cFACS\u201d), was used for identifying and isolating specific phage clones, the peptide or polypeptide of which recognizes target cells. Phage-expressed scFv antibody fragments are amenable to in vitro screening, enrichment and selection of high affinity clones (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337; 5,720,954). Thus, a library of this type offers a powerful means for generating new tools for research and clinical applications, and has numerous advantages over the conventional approach (Caron et al., Cancer Supplement, 73, 1049\u20131056 (1994)). The library contains the potential for a high diversity of antibody molecules (Nissim et al., EMBO J., 692\u201369 8 (1994)). In the present instance, stable human cDNA can be used as a continuous source of material for antibody production (U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,439). Molecule recognition and selection are not influenced by the in vivo immunogenicity of candidate target proteins., 178037=3.1.2.5 Second and third rounds of panning were carried out as described for the first panning round of the YPR procedure with the following modifications: (i) For the second panning 1012 of R1(a), combined with 1012 of R1(t), were used and (ii) elution was carried out with glycine (pH 2.2) only. The amplified eluate of the second round was designated R2. (iii) For the third round of biopanning, 1012 of R2 was used, and elution was carried out as in the second round. The amplified stock of round three was designated R3., 22421=This application claims priority to provisional application Ser. No. 60/258,948, filed on Dec. 29, 2000, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference hereto., 87526=Expression of the E. coli osmB promoter is regulated by osmotic pressure. Vectors carrying this promoter can be used to produce high levels of a wide variety of recombinant eukaryotic and prokaryotic polypeptides under control of the osmB promoter in an E. coli host. A fuller description is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,776 (Fischer, Aug. 18, 1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,304 (Fischer, Aug. 31, 1999)., 86078=The subject invention provides for production of a scFv based on the Fv peptide of the invention. Promoters incorporated into the vectors used for the cloning and amplification of the scFv in prokaryotic cells can be chosen from a wide selection. A promoter is a DNA sequence that is situated upstream of structural genes and is capable of controlling the expression of genes. Promoters are found in the natural state in the chromosome(s) of the organism and can also be engineered into prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression vectors. Promoters engineered into specific loci on the desired DNA fragment provide for finely tuned and precisely controlled expression of the gene of interest. In the present invention, several promoters were used in constructs that include the gene coding for the Fv of choice. Promoters include, but are not limited to the following: deo, P1\u2013P2, osmB, \u03bbPL, \u03b2-lac-U5, SR\u03b1 5, and CMV early promoter. Deo is a double stranded DNA plasmid which, upon introduction into a. suitable E. coli host, renders the host capable of effecting expression of DNA encoding a desired naturally-occurring polypeptide or polypeptide analog thereof under the control of the constitutive E. coli-derived deoxyribonucleotide promoter, deo P1\u2013P2. A fuller description is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,776 (Fischer, Aug. 18, 1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,304 (Fischer, Aug. 31, 1999)., 88230=\u03b2-lac-U5 is a lacZ promoter (Gilbert and Muller-Hill, PNAS (US), 58, 2415 (1967)., 117768=In another preferred embodiment of the peptide or polypeptide of the subject invention, 1\u20131000 amino acids may be added either to the C-terminus or to the N-terminus of the peptide, while the peptide maintains its biological activity. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, 150\u2013500 amino acids may be added either to the C-terminus or to the N-terminus of the peptide or polypeptide, while the peptide maintains its biological activity. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, 800\u20131000 amino acids may be added either to the C-terminus or the N-terminus of the peptide or polypeptide, while the peptide or polypeptide maintains its biological activity., 184798=5.1.1 Colony test: In one set of experiments, a mixture of 109 specific phagemids, derived from the biopanning protocol, which render infected E. Coli ampicillin resistant, and 1011 wild-type M13 phage, which do not carry ampicillin resistance and serve as a \u201cblocker\u201d, was incubated with 105 cells, chosen from a panel of cell types. Following incubation and washing, the bound phage were eluted with trypsin, and an aliquot was used to infect E. coli TG-I. The E. coli were then plated on 2\ufffdTY/AMP plates and incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. The number of colonies obtained for each clone was calculated and compared. The results give a measure of the binding affinity and specificity of the phagemids., 137900=FACS analysis indicated that the tetramers made by Y1-biotag and streptavidin-PE were 100 to 1000 fold more sensitive that Y1 scFv monomers in the absence of serum. Y1-biotag tetramers with strepavidin-PE appear to specifically bind to one of the Y1-reactive cell lines (KG-1). The differential of this reaction, from background binding, was very high, and offered high sensitivity to detect low amounts of receptor. FACS evaluation of normal whole blood with Y1-SAV tetramers indicated that no highly reactive population is present. Monocytes and granulocytes were positive to a small extent. In cell lines where a positive result was present, such as with KG-1 cells, the tetramers were at least 100-fold more reactive., 177719=3.1.2.4 Amplification: The clones were amplified as described in section 3.1.1.5. The amplified stocks of \u02dc1012 phagemid/ml from the acid and trypsin elution protocols, designated R1(a) and R1(t) stocks, respectively, were combined and used for subsequent rounds of panning., 337178=10.8.2 Western blot analysis: The supernatant for the above cells was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Expression of each chain was detected with (a) goat anti-human IgG-HRP (H+L; Sigma Cat #A8667) for heavy chain detection and (b) biotinylated goat anti-human \u03bb3 chain (Southern Biotechnology Association, Cat #2070-08) for light chain detection. Expression of both chains was confirmed by the above assays, and co-transfection was carried out to obtain full size Y1-IgG1., 176213=3.1.2.1 Selection: Clone selection was accomplished by panning 108 fixed human platelets with 1011 phagemids (Nissim library) in 1 ml PBS/HEPES/1% BSA buffer. Binding was allowed to proceed for one hour at RT while mixing the sample by rotation., 313197=10.4.2 For the constant IgGI regions (\u03b3 chain), a human B cell clone (CMV - clone #40), immortalized at BTG, was selected for PCR amplification. This clone was shown to secrete IgG1 against human CMV and was also shown to induce ADCC response in in-vitro assays. For the CH1-CH3 cDNA, oligonucleotides 5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGTGC(T/C)TCCACCAAGGGCCCATC(G/C)GTCTTC (sense) (SEQ ID NO: 229) and 5\u2032-TTTGCGGCCGCTCATTTACCC(A/G)GAGACAGGGAGAGGCT (anti-sense) (SEQ ID NO: 230) were synthesized and used for PCR amplification. As described for the CL cDNA encoding sequence, the PCR product of expected size (\u02dc1500 bp) was purified, sequenced, and digested with AvrII and NotI restriction enzymes., 31221=The use of phage display technology has enabled the isolation of scFvs comprising fully human sequences. For example, fully human antibody against the human TGFb2 receptor based on a scFv clone derived from phage display technology was recently developed. This scFv, converted into a fully human IgG4 that is capable of competing with the binding of TGFb2 (Thompson et al., J. Immunol Methods, 227, 17\u201329 (1999)), has strong anti-proliferative activity. This technology, known to one skilled in the art, is more specifically described in the following publications: Smith, Science, 228, 1315 (1985); Scott et al, Science, 249, 386\u2013390 (1990); Cwirla et al., PNAS, 87, 6378\u20136382 (1990); Devlin et al., Science, 249, 404\u2013406 (1990); Griffiths et al., EMBO J., 13(14), 3245\u20133260 (1994); Bass et al., Proteins, 8, 309\u2013314 (1990); McCafferty et al., Nature, 348, 552\u2013554(1990); Nissim et al., EMBO J., 13, 692 \u2013698 (1994); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,427,908, 5,432,018, 5,223,409 and 5,403,484, lib., 314231=10.6 An additional vector, pBJ-Y1-LP, was constructed based on the Y1-LC to allow double selection based on the puromycin resistant gene (PAC). In this vector the neomycin-resistant gene of the Y1-LC plasmid was replaced with a fragment of \u02dc1600 bp encoding for the PAC gene (from the pMCC-ZP vector)., 28493=Several other humanized and chimeric antibodies are under development or are in clinical trials. In addition, a humanized Ig that specifically reacts with CD33 antigen, expressed both on normal myeloid cells as well as on most types of myeloid leukemic cells, was conjugated to the anti-cancer drug calicheamicin, CMA-676 (Sievers et al., Blood Supplement, 308, 504a (1997)). This conjugate, known as the drug MYLOTARG\ufffd, has recently received FDA approval (Caron et al., Cancer Supplement, 73, 1049\u20131056 (1994)). In light of its cytolytic activity, an additional anti-CD33 antibody (HumM 195), currently in clinical trials, was conjugated to several cytotoxic agents, including the gelonin toxin (McGraw et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother, 39, 367\u2013374 (1994)) and radioisotopes 131I (Caron et al., Blood 83, 1760\u20131768 (1994)), 90Y (Jurcic et al., Blood Supplement, 92, 613a (1998)) and 213Bi (Humm et al., Blood Supplement, 38:231P (1997))., 151996=For intravenous administration, the formulation preferably will be prepared so that the amount administered to the patient will be an effective amount from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg of the desired composition. More preferably, the amount administered will be in the range of about 1 mg to about 500 mg of the desired composition. The compositions of the invention are effective over a wide dosage range, and depend on factors such as the particulars of the disease to be treated, the half-life of the peptide or polypeptide-based pharmaceutical composition in the body of the patient, physical and chemical characteristics of the pharmaceutical agent and of the pharmaceutical composition, mode of administration of the pharmaceutical composition, particulars of the patient to be treated or diagnosed, as well as other parameters deemed important by the treating physician., 187090=5.1.3.2 Phagemid binding to fixed platelets: Polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with 108 fixed platelets and were incubated overnight, at 4\ufffd C. Approximately 1010 phagemids were used for evaluating binding. Washing and incubation of plates and determination of binding level were carried out as described in 5.1.3.1 above., 163183=The subject invention provides for a peptide or polypeptide having, the formula or structure: A-X-B wherein X is a hypervariable CDR3 region of 3 to 30 amino acids; and A and B can each be amino acid chains from 1 to 1000 amino acids in length, wherein A is the amino end and B is the carboxy end., 246216=8.2 Binding of platelet-selected clones to leukemic cells: As noted in the introduction, platelet cell surface markers may be expressed on premature hematopoietic cells. The binding of platelet-selected clones was tested by FACS analysis. FACS analysis was performed after staining whole blood, followed by RBC lysis, or on Iso-prep- (Ficoll cushion) purified mononuclear cells. ScFvs were prepared from each clone, purified on protein-A, and FITC labeled (as described in Sections 4.1\u20134.4). In order to enable production of intact scFv in the non-suppressor E. coli strain HB2151, the amber codon (TAG) found in the VH-CDR3 of the Y-27 clone was mutated by DNA site-directed mutagenesis to code for glutamic acid (GAG). The target cells for such studies were cells isolated from fresh blood samples of various patients with leukemia. The samples were obtained from three Medical Centers in Israel., 303822=A construct was designed where the following sequence, LNDIFEAQKIEWHE (SEQ ID NO: 219), was added at the C-terminus of the Y1 by PCR and cloning into an IPTG inducible expression vector cassette. The clone was named Y1-biotag. This sequence is a substrate for the enzyme BirA, that in the presence of free biotin, the enzyme is capable of covalently connecting biotin to the lysine (K) residue (Phenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Science. 1996 October 4;274(5284):94\u20136, Altman J D et al). This construct was produced as inclusion bodies in BL21 bacterial cells. Refolding was performed as described previously. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in guanidine-DTT. Refolding was done by dilution in a buffer containing arginine-Tris-EDTA. Dialysis and concentration was performed followed by HiTrapQ ionic exchange purification., 45529=In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a peptide or polypeptide having the formula or structure: A-X-B wherein X is a hypervariable CDR3 region of 3 to 30 amino acids; A and B can each be amino acid chains from 1 to 1000 amino acids in length, wherein A is the amino end and B is the carboxy end., 167911=1.3 Bacterial strains\u2014TG-1 and HB2151: Fresh bacterial cultures were prepared for infection by growing the cells to A600 of 0.5\u20130.9 (exponentially growing cells). E. coli TG-1 cells were used for phage propagation and E. coli HB2151 cells were used for scFv protein production., 175434=3.1.1.6 Re-Panning on whole cells: The amplified stock of the third membrane panning, T16M3, was used to pan intact AML cells. Selection was carried out in a final volume of 0.5 ml MPBS containing 2\ufffd107 cells and 1010 Colony Forming Units (CFU) of phagemids (Nissim library), and 1013 wild-type bacteriophage M13, with slow agitation for 2 hours at 4\ufffd C. Bound phagemids were eluted from the washed cell pellet with 50 \u03bcl of Trypsin:EDTA (0.25%:0.05%), then neutralized by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of FCS. For titration and amplification, 1 ml of an E. coli TG-I culture (A600=0.5) was used. The amplified, and final, stock was designated T16M3.1., 180294=4.1 Production of soluble scFv: pHEN1, a vector used to construct the original phagemid library, was designed with an amber stop codon encoded at the junction of the scFv gene and the pII1 gene. Therefore, when the vectors of selected clones are introduced by phagemid infection into E. coli HB215 1, which is a non-suppressor strain, this system enables production and secretion of soluble scFv into the bacterial periplasm (Harrison et al., Methods in Enzymology, 267, 83\u2013109 (1996)). The scFv is then readily retrievable from the culture broth. Soluble scFvs are produced under the control of the lacZ promoter (Gilbert and Muller-Hill, PNAS (US), 58, 2415 (1967)), which is induced with IPTG., 188314=5.2 Binding Tests at the scFv level: Binding of the scFvs produced in the periplasm of HB2151 was compared in several cell types by two different assays, by EIA and by FACS analysis., 171654=2.3 Sequence analysis: The encoded scFv DNA of \u02dc800 bp within the phagemid particles was amplified by PCR using an upstream primer #203743 (5\u2032-GAAATACCTATTGCCTACGG) (SEQ ID NO: 209) and a downstream primer #181390 (5\u2032-TGAATTTTCTGTATGAGG) (SEQ ID NO: 210). DNA fragments were fully sequenced from both ends by the automatic ABI PRISM DNA sequencer (310 Genetic Analyzer, Perkin Elmer) using ABI PRISM Big Dye termination cycle sequencing kit and the above primers. Two additional primers, primer #191181 (5%-CGATCCGCCACCGCCAGAG) (SEQ ID NO: 211) and its complementary primer #191344 (5\u2032-CTCTGGCGGTGGCGGATCG) (SEQ ID NO: 212), which are located at the flexible polypeptide junction region between the heavy and light chains, were used for sequencing., 122426=Mulitvalent forms of scFv have been produced by others. One approach has been to link two scFvs with linkers. Another approach involves using disulfide bonds between two scFvs for the linkage. The simplest approach to production of dimeric or trimeric Fv was reported by Holliger et al., PNAS, 90, 6444\u20136448 (1993) and A. Kortt, et al., Protein Eng., 10, 423\u2013433 (1997). One such method was designed to make dimers of scFvs by adding a sequence of the FOS and JUN protein region to form a leucine zipper between them at the c-terminus of the scFv. Kostelny S A et al., J Immunol. 1992 Mar 1;148(5):1547\u201353; De Kruif J et al., J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar 29;271(13):7630\u20134. Another method was designed to make tetramers by adding a streptavidin coding sequence at the c-terminus of the scFv. Streptavidin is composed of 4 subunits so when the scFv-streptavidin is folded, 4 subunits accommodate themselves to form a tetramer. Kipriyanov S M et al., Hum Antibodies Hybridomas, 1995;6(3):93\u2013101. In yet another method, to make dimers, trimers and tetramers, a free cysteine is introduced in the protein of interest. A peptide-based cross linker with variable numbers (2 to 4) of maleimide groups was used to cross link the protein of interest to the free cysteines. Cochran J R et al., Immunity, 2000 Mar;12(3):241\u201350., 173751=3.1.1.2 Selection was carried out on immobilized AML cell membranes by the addition of 2 ml MPBS containing 1012 phagemids from the original Nissim library. The tube was slowly agitated for 30 minutes, then incubated for an extra 90 minutes without agitation, both steps at RT. Following three rounds of panning on AML cell membranes, one round of panning was carried out on whole AML cells., 174689=3.1.1.5 Amplification: Colonies from the large plates were scraped and pooled. An aliquot (\u02dc107) of ampicillin resistant E. coli TG-1 cells was grown in liquid culture to A600 of \u02dc0.5, then infected with helper phage (VSC-M13, Stratagene) to produce a large amplified phagemid stock. Phagemids were rescued by a PEG precipitation procedure (18a). The amplified T1 6MI stock above (\u02dc1011 phagemids/ml) was used for subsequent rounds of panning. The selection procedure was repeated for two additional rounds, using 1011 phagemids of the previously amplified stock. The amplified stock of the third panning procedure on immobilized membranes was designated T16M3.}",
