Dubois, Roswell, GA US Harriet Dubois, Herndon, VA US Patent application number Description Published 20140258739 ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL IN A NETWORK - A power manager in a network monitors a set of multiple interconnected network elements for failures. During non-failing operation, the multiple interconnected network elements cooperatively communicate amongst each other to provide one or more computer devices connectivity to a core network. In response to detecting a failing network element in the set, the network power manager adaptively controls power settings of at least one non-failing network element in the set of multiple interconnected network elements. Via power control notifications, power settings of the non-failing network elements that depend on the particular failing network element can be reduced to save power in the network. Subsequent to correcting the failure, when the particular network element is functioning properly again, the network power manager notifies the non-failing network elements in the reduced power mode to switch back to a standard power mode and standard operational mode again. 09-11-2014 20140259102 PROTECTION AGAINST ILLEGITIMATE LINK TERMINATION IN A WIRELESS NETWORK - A wireless access point may be openly accessible to public use.
