    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Occidental is great for students who are self-motivated and are looking for a smaller campus lifestyle. You have the ability to participate in smaller classes and organizations. Wonderful for students who want to get involved in campus life, whether it is joining a club or working in an office! Great for students who love the city-life: Los Angeles is such as diverse and large city! Tips for prospective students Be proactive! Take multiple classes that interest you to start finding a major you would like to focus on. Join clubs and local organizations to become involved in the community and causes that inspire you. Do research, study abroad, and above all, make connections! There are so many wonderful professors and students at Occidental that you can make long-lasting friendships with. Keep on track! Don't forget that college will get harder every year. Multiple people told me that too, but I didn't realize what they really meant until coming here. Don't be scared, but just make sure you are on top of your classes. If you ever need assistance there are staff members and professors that can help. Start to think ahead about career options and definitely visit the Career Development Center as they are extremely helpful and kind! Bang for the buck",
