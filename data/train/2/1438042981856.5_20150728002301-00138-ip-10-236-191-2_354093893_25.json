Of these, 156 (26.4%) refused to be in the study, and 56 (9.6%) did not complete the study questionnaire primarily because their general medicine physician was ready to begin their visit. In all, 388 (65.9%) individuals completed the entire baseline interview, including the questionnaire. No compensation was offered for participation. After the informed consent process, participants took part in a 10- to 15-minute, face-to-face interview that included sociodemographic items, a literacy assessment, and the 44-item questionnaire. The literacy assessment consisted of administering the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), a screening instrument used to determine the ability of patients to read and pronounce common medical terminology and lay terms for body parts and illnesses (24,25). Raw REALM scores are converted to grade ranges: 0\u201318 = third grade and below, 19\u201344 = fourth to sixth grade, 45\u201360 = seventh to eighth grade, and 61\u201366 = high school. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 227 of these patients six to 12 months after the baseline interview, beginning November 2001 through December 2003. Patients\u2019 screening status was obtained through medical record review also during this period., 63919=The 44-item questionnaire included items designed to assess knowledge of colorectal cancer and specific screening tests and attitudes and beliefs toward colorectal cancer and available screening options. Knowledge questions were adapted from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Supplement, with modifications to reflect current terminology (e.g., use of the term flexible sigmoidoscopy or flex sig instead of proctoscopy) (26). Attitudinal and belief items were developed based on findings from focus groups conducted among this same population of veterans (27). Reader comprehension of the questionnaire items was evaluated using five one-hour cognitive interviews among a convenience sample of community-based, screening-eligible adults. All interviews were conducted by one of the research investigators (Ferreira) and followed available guidelines established for properly conducting cognitive interviews in survey development (28). Interview techniques included both \u201cconcurrent think-aloud\u201d and specific probes. The interviews were tape-recorded and abstracted for relevant information, which was used to modify the questionnaire. The modified questionnaire was then administered to a pilot group of 15 patients who were approached in the general medicine clinics (29)., 66546=We designed a 44-item questionnaire to measure patient knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs associated with colorectal cancer screening and administered the questionnaire to 388 veterans. Male veterans aged 50 years and older who had not received colorectal cancer screening (defined as having a fecal occult blood test [FOBT] within one year or a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy within five years) were recruited from general medicine clinics at the VA Chicago Health System between May 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002. Patients were ineligible if they 1) had received a FOBT within one year; 2) received a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy within five years; 3) had a personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps; or 4) had a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, individuals with dementia, impaired vision, hearing problems, or acute illness were deemed ineligible to participate in the study. We excluded patients with impaired vision because the instrument we employed to assess health literacy required the ability to view a list of words. The study protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board., 49322=Author Affiliations: Alfred Rademaker, PhD, Feinberg School of Medicine; Charles L.
