            "Make sure they have your major! Also SCSU has a liberal arts program so if you are trying to jump into your major from day one this is not the school for you. The liberal arts program has helped me become more well rounded though.",
            "It is a great school in my opinion. The classes are small so you actually are getting one-on-one time with the teacher. Most teachers are very helpful from experience."

Southern is a respected nursing school and the program's very competitive. In 2015 we will have a new library and science building, both are going to be huge and contain everything a student could need and more.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Out of the four state schools, I'd have to say in my opinion Southern has the most to offer. The campus is the nicest and the activites are so often that you always see your money at use. Am enjoying being here I live on campus and love it so much! Southern is a perfect match for me and I could never imagine going anywhere else. Am learning a lot I've learned more in a year and a half here at Southern than I did all throughout high school. If you choose the right professors learning is fun as well!
