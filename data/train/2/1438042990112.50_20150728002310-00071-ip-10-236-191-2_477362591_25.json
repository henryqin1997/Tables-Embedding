    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6354=The anticipated product size of hBD-3 protein is 5 kDa. However recent studies have reported that hBD-3 protein exhibits a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa, consistent with the formation of a dimer (Schibli, D. J., et al., J Biol Chem, 2002. 277(10): p. 8279-89). This difference in weight may be in part explained by post-translational modification of proteins (i.e., glycosylation) or is due to dimers of hBD-3 present as a result of non-reduced disulfide bonds. Synthetic, control hBD-3 (90 ng) was detected by immunoblot analysis (FIG. 16, lane 1). hBD-3 protein of the expected molecular weight (5 kDa or 14 kDa) was not detected in conditioned medium harvested from transfected or mock (untransfected) NIKS (see FIG. 16, lanes 4 & 5). The presence of the high molecular weight band observed in lanes 4 and 5 appears to be dependent on the presence of serum in the conditioned medium. Only a very faint high molecular weight band was observed in serum-free conditioned medium harvested from transfected or mock (untransfected) NIKS keratinocytes.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{283878=The organotypic cultures in the initial expression studies are prepared using cells expressing individual \u03b2-defensin transgenes. However, chimeric organotypic cultures ca be prepared by mixing NIKS cells overexpressing different \u03b2-defensins to achieve a broader range of antimicrobial activities. The cells expressing \u03b2-defensin transgenes can be used in conjunction with cells derived from a patient (See, e.g., U.S. Appl. 2002/0192196) or in conjunction with untransfected NIKS cells so that potency can be adjusted. This strategy provides further flexibility in protein expression profiles in skin tissue., 249141=A genomic DNA fragment containing the human involucrin promoter sequence was isolated using PCR primers based on published sequences (Crish et al., J Biol Chem, 1998. 273(46): p. 30460-5). The integrity of the cloned involucrin promoter PCR product was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing using involucrin specific primers. The involucrin promoter is not expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes, but is specifically activated in differentiated keratinocytes. It is preferable to direct overexpression of the KGF-2 to differentiated keratinocytes to avoid interfering with normal keratinocyte differentiation., 233233=NIKS cells were transfected using Trans-It Keratinocyte Transfection Reagent (Mirus Corp.) and grown in either EpiLife Medium (Cascade Biologics) or NIKS medium (Stratatech Corporation). Supernatants were collected for three days and used in the development of a direct KGF-2 ELISA Assay. The 100 ul supernatants were incubated in plate (Nunc Immunoassay plate) over night; at a minimum samples were plated in duplicate. The next day, the samples were washed 3\ufffd(1\ufffdPBS/0.05% Tween-20) 300 ul/well; blocked plate (1\ufffdPBS/1% BSA/5% Sucrose) 300 ul/well @ rt for 30 minutes; washed 3\ufffd(1\ufffdPBS/0.05% Tween-20) 300 ul/well; incubated with rabbit anti-huKGF-2 Ab (0.2 ug/well) @ rt for 2 hours; washed 3\ufffd(1\ufffdPBS/0.05% Tween-20) 300 ul/well; incubated with goat anti-rabbit HRP (0.8 mg/ml) Ab\u2014use at 1:1000 dilution @ rt for 30 minutes; washed 3\ufffd(1\ufffdPBS/0.05% Tween-20) 300 ul/well; prewarmed TMB @ rt 100 ul/well for 30 minutes at room temperature; added 50 ul of 2N H2SO4; read O.D. 450 nm and 620 nm; corrected for plate imperfections (450 nm-620 nm)., 85191=In some embodiments, the present invention provides human skin equivalents (e.g., keratinocytes) that express exogenous antimicrobial polypeptides. In intact human skin, the stratum corneum serves as the first line of defense against microbial organisms. The stratum corneum is the uppermost, nonviable, desiccated layer of the epidermis that is composed of fully differentiated keratinocytes. The innate immune response prevents invasion of microbial organisms if the outer most layer of the skin barrier is penetrated. This response includes phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils and their production of reactive oxygen intermediates that kill microbial agents. Associated with this line of defense are antimicrobial peptides that are naturally expressed and localized to the upper layers of the epidermis. The most thoroughly studied human antimicrobial peptides belong to two subfamilies, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins, which differ from one another by their disulfide bond pairing, genomic organization and tissue distributions (Ganz, T. and J. Weiss, Semin Hematol, 1997. 34(4): p. 343-54). The \u03b2-defensins are characteristically found in epithelial tissues and are expressed in human keratinocytes. This defensin subfamily demonstrates strong antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, fungi and viruses., 280031=A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay is also performed. The smallest amount of conditioned medium from NIKS cells transiently transfected with each of the \u03b2-defensin genes required to inhibit the growth of the test organism is determined. In this assay a series of culture tubes (or wells of a multi-well plate) containing bacterial growth medium with varying concentrations of NIKS conditioned medium is inoculated with the test organism. After an incubation period the turbidity is measured and the MIC is determined. Synthetic antimicrobial \u03b2-defensin peptides are used as positive controls. The MIC results are compared to those previously published by others (i.e., stimulated concentration range 15-70 ug/gm tissue or 3.5-16 uM. Harder, J., et al., Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta, but not IL-6, induce human beta-defensin-2 in respiratory epithelia. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 2000. 22(6): p. 714-21. These relative ranges are only intended to provide guidance in an effort to achieve a reasonable point of reference., 92290=The burn wound is an ideal environment for bacterial growth and provides a pathway for microbial invasion. Luterman and coworkers concluded \u201cBurned skin is a nidus and portal for bacterial invasion, causing burn wound sepsis, the leading cause of death in burn units around the world\u201d (Luterman, A., C. C. Dacso, and P. W. Curreri, Am J Med, 1986. 81(1A): p. 45-52). Infection is further promoted by skin loss and post burn immuno-suppression. As expected, human defensin gene expression is diminished in full thickness burn wounds most probably due to the destruction of the epithelium. For example, human \u03b2-defensin gene (hBD-2) expression is virtually undetectable in the burn wound suggesting the loss of defensins due to thermal destruction of the skin (Milner, S. M. and M. R. Ortega, Burns, 1999. 25(5): p. 411-3). A routinely used debridement procedure may also contribute to significant removal of epithelia in a wound bed. Debridement speeds the healing of ulcers, burns, and other wounds by removing dead tissue so that the remaining living tissue can adequately heal. Wounds that contain non-living (necrotic) tissue take longer to heal because necrotic debris is a nutrient source for bacteria in a wound. The debridement procedure introduces a potential risk that surface bacteria may be introduced deeper into the body, causing infection., 206422=In other preferred embodiments, the host cells or cultured skin tissue find use for screening the efficacy of drug introduction across the skin or the affect of drugs directed to the skin. In these embodiments, cultured skin tissue or host cells are treated with the drug delivery system or drug, and the permeation, penetration, or retention or the drug into the skin equivalent is assayed. Methods for assaying drug permeation are provided in Asbill et al., Pharm Res. 17(9): 1092-97 (2000). In some embodiments, cultured skin tissue is mounted on top of modified Franz diffusion cells. The cultured skin tissue is allowed to hydrate for one hour and then pretreated for one hour with propylene glycol. A saturated suspension of the model drug in propylene glycol is then added to the cultured skin tissue. The cultured skin tissue can then be sampled at predetermined intervals. The cultured skin tissue is then analyzed by HPLC to determine the concentration of the drug in the sample. Log P values for the drugs can be determined using the ACD program (Advanced Chemistry Inc., Ontario, Canada). These methods may be adapted to study the delivery of drugs via transdermal patches or other delivery modes., 103318=In certain embodiments, mutant defensins are utilized in the methods and compositions of the present invention. For example, in some embodiments, disulfide bond formation in beta-defensin 3 is disrupted by mutation of one or more cysteine residues. In preferred embodiments, 5 of the 6 cysteine residues (e.g., Cys40, Cys45, Cys55, Cys62, and Cys63) are mutated to alanine or other uncharged amino acid not capable of forming disulfide bonds. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that disruption of disulfide bond formation in beta-defensin 3 increases the antimicrobial activity of the protein (See e.g., Hoover et al., Antimicrobial agent and chemotherapy 47:2804 (2003) and Wu et al., PNAS 100:8880 (2003)). The hBD-3 mutants of the present invention may have altered (e.g., greater or less) antimicrobial activity than wild type hBD-3 or they may have similar antimicrobial activity. It is further contemplated that the disruption of disulfide bonds reduces or eliminates the ability of hBD-3 to elicit a chemotactic response. The elimination of chemotactic response may be desirable for avoidance of immune response to skin equivalents grafted onto hosts (e.g., human hosts)., 88554=Historically the \u03b1-defensins have been found in storage granules of specialized cell types such as neutrophils and Paneth cells of the small intestine, whereas the \u03b2-defensins are expressed in epithelial tissues. The \u03b1-defensins also have an inhibitory pro-region in their amino-terminal sequence, which is cleaved off after release from granules. The pro-region is likely to contain a granule targeting motif but may function independently as a protease inhibitor. The broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity is mediated in part by permeabilization of biological membranes. Although extremely potent for killing invading microorganisms, \u03b1-defensins have also been shown to be toxic to eukaryotic cell types (Lichtenstein, A., et al., Blood, 1986. 68(6): p. 1407-10; Okrent et al., Am Rev Respir Dis, 1990. 141(1): p. 179-85). The \u03b1-defensin-induced pleiotropic cell killing activity makes this subfamily of defensins unattractive as a gene candidate for expression in living human skin substitutes., 277331=This Example describes assays for hBD activity. To determine if transient expression of \u03b2-defensins in NIKS monolayer cultures results in enhanced bactericidal activity, a modified in vitro inhibition zone assay is utilized. Hultmark, D., et al., Insect immunity. Attacins, a family of antibacterial proteins from Hyalophora cecropia. Embo J, 1983. 2(4): p. 571-6. Briefly, thin (1 mm) agarose plates are seeded with a microbe of choice (E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. pyogenes or C. albicans). The melted agarose (1%) contains Luria-Bertani broth with or without supplemented salt. Vogel, H. J., Acetylornithinase of Escherichia coli: partial purification and some properties. J Biol Chem, 1956. 218: p. 97-106. The test organism, (\u02dc5\ufffd104 log-phase cells/ml) is added just before pouring the plate. Small wells (3 mm diameter) are punched in the assay plates and loaded with 3 ul of harvested culture medium conditioned for at least 24 hours by untransfected NIKS, NIKS transiently transfected with the empty expression construct, or NIKS transiently expressing each \u03b2-defensin. Alternatively, discs are loaded with 3 ul of harvested conditioned medium described above and placed on a plate containing the seeded microbial lawn. A positive control sample of a synthetic hBD-3 peptide (2-30 ug/ml) or an antibiotic such as streptomycin (100 ug/ml) is added to the conditioned medium and assayed, along with a negative control (unconditioned medium sample). After overnight incubation at 30\ufffd C., the inhibition zones are recorded using a ruler and if necessary a magnifying glass. The units of activity are read from a standard curve with the zones obtained by a dilution series for the synthetic \u03b2-defensin peptide (i.e., hBD-3 synthetic peptide). Garcia, J.

Its interaction with plasma membranes of Xenopus oocytes and the induction of macrophage chemoattraction. Cell Tissue Res, 2001. 306(2): p. 257-64. Antimicrobial potency is measured and compared to published standards (hBD-3 synthetic peptide or streptomycin). Ideally, the square of the diameter of the inhibition zone is proportional to the log of the concentration of an antibacterial factor. Frohm, M., et al., Biochemical and antibacterial analysis of human wound and blister fluid. Eur J Biochem, 1996. 237(1): p. 86-92. This cost effective assay is standardly used as a measure of antimicrobial activity, however it provides only semi-quantitative results of antibacterial activity., 299065=The antimicrobial activity assay employed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus carnosus and is a modification of the protocol described by Porter and coworkers (Porter, E. M., et al., Infect Immun, 1997. 65(6): p. 2396-401). Briefly, gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria are grown overnight. The following day the test organisms are subcultured for 2.5 hr and working dilutions of 104 bacteria/ml for Escherichia coli or 105 bacteria/ml of Staphylococcus carnosus in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)-1% TSB are created. All the reactions mix 50 \u03bcl of experimental reagent (lysis, supernatants or purified protein) with 50 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension. These reactions are then incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 1.5 hr. The reactions are diluted 100-fold in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)-1% TSB and plated on TSB plates using a spiral plater (Spiral Biotech, Norwood, Mass.). The plates are then incubated for 12 to 16 hr at 37\ufffd C. Colonies on these plates are counted and the number of viable bacteria is determined and expressed as colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml)., 286279=To determine if human skin substitute tissue generated from \u03b2-defensin-expressing NIKS cells results in enhanced bactericidal activity, a modified in vitro inhibition zone assay is utilized. Both the conditioned medium and biopsy punches from 14, 21, and 28 day old skin substitute tissues are analyzed for antimicrobial activity. Briefly, thin (1 mm) agarose plates are seeded with a microbe of choice (E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. pyogenes or C. albicans). The melted agarose (1%) contains Luria-Bertani broth with or without supplemented salt. The test organism, (\u02dc5\ufffd104 log-phase cells/ml) is added just before pouring the plate. To assay for \u03b2-defensin activity in conditioned medium from skin substitute tissues small wells (3 mm diameter) are punched in the assay plates and loaded with 3 ul of harvested culture medium conditioned for at least 24 hours by human skin substitutes generated with untransfected NIKS or NIKS clones stably expressing each \u03b2-defensin. Alternatively, discs may be loaded with 3 ul of harvested conditioned medium described above and placed on a plate containing the seeded microbial lawn. A positive control sample of a synthetic hBD-3 peptide (2-30 ug/ml) or an antibiotic such as streptomycin (100 ug/ml) will be added to the conditioned medium and assayed, along with a negative control (unconditioned medium sample). To assay the human skin substitute directly, four 8 mm punches are collected from each 44 cm2 circular skin substitute tissue. As described above, each biopsy punch is homogenized (PowerGen Homogenizer), and placed on a plate containing the seeded microbial lawn. After overnight incubation at 30\ufffd C., the inhibition zones are recorded using a ruler and if necessary a magnifying glass. The units of activity are read from a standard curve with the zones obtained by a dilution series for the synthetic \u03b2-defensin peptide (i.e., hBD-3 synthetic peptide). Antimicrobial potency is measured and compared to published standards (hBD-3 synthetic peptide or streptomycin). Ideally, the square of the diameter of the inhibition zone is proportional to the log of the concentration of an antibacterial factor. Frohm, M., et al., Biochemical and antibacterial analysis of human wound and blister fluid. Eur J Biochem, 1996. 237(1): p. 86-92. This cost effective assay is standardly used as a measure of antimicrobial activity, however it will provide only semi-quantitative results of antibacterial activity., 24340=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/909,119, filed Jul. 30, 2004 (allowed), which claims priority to provisional patent application Ser. Nos. 60/491,869, filed Aug. 1, 2003, and 60/493,664, filed Aug. 8, 2003, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety., 281960=NIKS cell clones that exhibit several different increased \u03b2-defensin expression levels are used to prepare human skin substitute tissues using organotypic culturing techniques. See, e.g., U.S. application Ser. No. 10/087,388; 10/087,346; 10/087,641 and PCT Application US 02/06088, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The organotypic cultures consist of dermal and epidermal compartments. The dermal compartment is formed by mixing normal human neonatal fibroblasts with Type I collagen in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin and allowing contraction. The epidermal compartment is produced by seeding NIKS cells on the contracted collagen gel in 25 \u03bcl of a mixture of Ham's F-12:DME (3:1, final calcium concentration 1.88 mM) supplemented with 0.2% FCS, 0.4 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 24 \u03bcg/ml adenine, and 100 units/ml P/S. Cells are allowed to attach 2 hours at 37\ufffd C., 5% CO2 before flooding culture chamber with media (day 0). On day 2 cells are fed with fresh medium. On day 4, cells are lifted to the air/medium interface on the surface of a media-saturated cotton pad, which allows the cultures to be fed from below. Organotypic cultures are incubated at 37\ufffd C., 5% CO2, 75% humidity and are fed fresh medium every 2 days. By day 10, the NIKS cells stratify to form the basal, spinous, granular and cornified epidermal layers., 288820=Micro-broth Dilution Assay: A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay is performed. The smallest amount of conditioned medium and biopsy punches from 14, 21, and 28 day old skin substitutes from NIKS cells stably transfected with each of the \u03b2-defensin genes required to inhibit the growth of the test organism are determined. In this assay, a series of culture tubes (or wells of a multi-well plate) containing bacterial growth medium with varying concentrations of conditioned medium from skin substitute tissues is inoculated with the test organism. To assay the human skin substitute directly, four 8 mm punches are collected from each 44 cm2 circular skin substitute tissue. As described above each biopsy punch is homogenized (PowerGen Homogenizer), and varying concentrations are incubated with the test organism. After an incubation period the turbidity is measured and the MIC is determined. Synthetic antimicrobial \u03b2-defensin peptides are used as positive controls. The MIC results are compared to those previously published by others (i.e., stimulated concentration range 15-70 ug/gm tissue or 3.5-16 uM. These relative ranges are only intended to provide guidance in an effort to achieve a reasonable point of reference., 91502=When expressed, the \u03b2-defensin peptides appear to initially localize to the cytoplasm of undifferentiated or less differentiated keratinocytes. As these cells differentiate and move closer to the epidermal surface, they secrete these antimicrobial peptides onto the keratinocyte membrane or into the intracellular space. The signal peptide sequence is thought to contribute to the specialized localization of this active peptide. Finally human \u03b2-defensin peptides accumulate in the dehydrated cells of the epidermal surface. Studies demonstrate that, although the three \u03b2-defensin genes are very similar, their expression is determined by completely different regulatory mechanisms (Frye, M., J. Bargon, and R. Gropp, J Mol Med, 2001. 79(5-6): p. 275-82)., 86581=Microorganisms have difficulty acquiring resistance to the defensin peptides, making these peptides very attractive for therapeutic use as antibiotics (Schroder, J. M., Biochem Pharmacol, 1999. 57(2): p. 121-34). In clinical trials, defensin peptides applied to skin have been found to be safe (Hancock, R. E., Lancet, 1997. 349(9049): p. 418-22). The safety of topically-applied defensins is consistent with the finding that human epidermal keratinocytes express defensin peptides in vivo., 97082=hBD-2 peptide was originally identified in desquamated squames of psoriatic skin and hBD-2 gene expression has since been identified in normal human keratinocytes (Harder, J., et al., Genomics, 1997. 46(3): p. 472-5). This gene encodes for a 4 kDa basic peptide. Variable endogenous levels of expression have been observed when comparing skin from various sites on the body, with the most prominent expression observed in facial skin and foreskin. Expression is localized to the suprabasal layers and the stratum corneum of intact skin. Low levels of hBD-2 protein have been detected in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in basal layers of skin tissue. These proteins are believed to be secreted into the cell membrane or intercellular spaces as the cells achieve a suprabasal position in the tissue and eventually concentrate in the dehydrated cells of the stratum corneum. hBD-2 peptide efficiently combats clinical isolates of gram negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and E. coli, while only having a bacteriostatic effect, at high concentrations, on gram positive bacterial strains such as S. aureus (Liu, A. Y., et al., J Invest Dermatol, 2002. 118(2): p. 275-81). Studies show that endogenous expression is triggered by inflammatory cytokines as well as exposure to bacteria. Finally, not only does hBD-2 have antimicrobial activity, it also modulates the inflammatory response in various skin conditions (Garcia, J. R., et al., Cell Tissue Res, 2001. 306(2): p. 257-64)., 73454=The NIKS cells arose from the BC-1-Ep strain of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes isolated from an apparently normal male infant. In early passages, the BC-1-Ep cells exhibited no morphological or growth characteristics that were atypical for cultured normal human keratinocytes. Cultivated BC-1-Ep cells exhibited stratification as well as features of programmed cell death. To determine replicative lifespan, the BC-1-Ep cells were serially cultivated to senescence in standard keratinocyte growth medium at a density of 3\ufffd105 cells per 100-mm dish and passaged at weekly intervals (approximately a 1:25 split). By passage 15, most keratinocytes in the population appeared senescent as judged by the presence of numerous abortive colonies that exhibited large, flat cells. However, at passage 16, keratinocytes exhibiting a small cell size were evident. By passage 17, only the small-sized keratinocytes were present in the culture and no large, senescent keratinocytes were evident. The resulting population of small keratinocytes that survived this putative crisis period appeared morphologically uniform and produced colonies of keratinocytes exhibiting typical keratinocyte characteristics including cell-cell adhesion and apparent squame production. The keratinocytes that survived senescence were serially cultivated at a density of 3\ufffd105 cells per 100-mm dish. Typically the cultures reached a cell density of approximately 8\ufffd106 cells within 7 days. This stable rate of cell growth was maintained through at least 59 passages, demonstrating that the cells had achieved immortality. The keratinocytes that emerged from the original senescencing population were originally designated BC-1-Ep/Spontaneous Line and are now termed NIKS. The NIKS cell line has been screened for the presence of proviral DNA sequences for HIV-1, HIV-2, EBV, CMV, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HBV, HCV, B-19 parvovirus, HPV-16 and HPV-31 using either PCR or Southern analysis. None of these viruses were detected., 94029=Some \u03b2-defensin family members are upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli or bacterial invasion. Others remain non-responsive, downregulated or suppressed in response to inflammatory stimuli or bacterial exposure. In unwounded, intact skin, the calculated epidermal concentrations of \u03b2-defensin peptides are well within the range needed for their antimicrobial effects. The \u03b2-defensins possess chemotactic activity for immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. These chemotactic responses require much lower concentrations than required for antimicrobial activity (Yang, D., et al., Science, 1999. 286(5439): p. 525-8). As a result of this cross-talk, the \u03b2-defensins are thought to mediate an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, the \u03b2-defensins appear to play a multifunctional role by promoting both an adaptive immune response and inflammation, while facilitating wound healing through their antimicrobial activity. Adaptive immunity is promoted through the endogenous antimicrobial peptides in healthy human skin and likely provides an effective shield from microbial infection; however, patients with unhealthy or chronic skin wounds would also benefit from boosted local antimicrobial peptide levels., 247535=This Example describes preliminary experimental results obtained when skin equivalents expressing exogenous KGF-2 were used to close wounds in a mouse wound model. In this experiment, organotypic cultured skin (i.e., skin equivalents) were grafted onto the denuded back of athymic nude mice. Skin equivalents containing native NIKS cells were compared to genetically modified skin equivalents expressing KGF-2. All tissues were meshed (2:1 ratio) immediately prior to being grafted onto mice. Interstitial wound space closure was monitored in the mice. Each observation time point included recording micrometer measurements of the wound area; these measurements were supplemented with digital photography. At post operative day 3 (POD 3), complete wound closure of interstitial spaces have been observed in the mice with the genetically modified NIKS organotypic skin tissue (KGF-2), but not observed in mice grafted with the NIKS culture tissue control., 95308=The hBD-1 gene encodes for a 3.9 kDa basic peptide that was originally identified in hemofiltrates from human patients with end stage renal disease (Bensch, K. W., et al., FEBS Lett, 1995. 368(2): p. 331-5). hBD-1 bactericidal activity is predominantly against gram negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Constitutive hBD-1 expression has been observed in skin from various sites on the body. The overexpression of hBD-1 in immortalized human skin cells (HaCat) is associated with keratinocyte cell differentiation. Overexpression was confirmed to have no effect on proliferating cells. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that \u03b2-defensin gene expression is a consequence of differentiation, rather than an inducer of differentiation in keratinocytes (Frye, M., J. Bargon, and R. Gropp, J Mol Med, 2001. 79(5-6): p. 275-82). hBD-1 expression in differentiated keratinocyte cells is inhibited upon exposure to bacteria. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that this result indicates that this factor is an important mediator of the healing process in regenerating epithelia. These studies confirm the upregulation of hBD-1 expression is a result of factors not associated with an inflammatory response. This antimicrobial peptide is not induced by inflammatory cytokines, which is consistent with the lack of cytokine-responsive transcription factor regulatory elements in the hBD-1 5\u2032regulatory sequences., 62913=\u201cPCR\u201d refers to the techniques of the polymerase chain reaction as described in Saiki, et al., Nature 324:163 (1986); and Scharf et al., Science 233:1076-1078 (1986); U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202. As used herein, x is \u201cheterologous\u201d with respect to y if x is not naturally associated with y or x is not associated with y in the same manner as is found in nature., 70308=Generally, any source of cells or cell line that can stratify into squamous epithelia is useful in the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the use of any particular source of cells that are capable of differentiating into squamous epithelia. Indeed, the present invention contemplates the use of a variety of cell lines and sources that can differentiate into squamous epithelia, including both primary and immortalized keratinocytes. Sources of cells include keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts biopsied from humans and cavaderic donors (Auger et al., In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.\u2014Animal 36:96-103; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,968,546 and 5,693,332, each of which is incorporated herein by reference), neonatal foreskins (Asbill et al., Pharm. Research 17(9): 1092-97 (2000); Meana et al., Burns 24:621-30 (1998); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,096; 6,039,760; and 5,536,656, each of which is incorporated herein by reference), and immortalized keratinocytes cell lines such as NM1 cells (Baden, In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 23(3):205-213 (1987)), HaCaT cells (Boucamp et al., J. cell. Boil. 106:761-771 (1988)); and NIKS cells (Cell line BC-1-Ep/SL; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,837, incorporated herein by reference; ATCC CRL-12191). Each of these cell lines can be cultured or genetically modified as described below in order to produce a cell line capable of expressing an exogenous polypeptide., 267287=The example describes the construction of hBD expression vectors. A genomic DNA fragment containing the human involucrin promoter sequence was isolated using PCR primers based on published sequences. Crish, J. F., T. M. Zaim, and R. L. Eckert, The distal regulatory region of the human involucrin promoter is required for expression in epidermis. J Biol Chem, 1998. 273(46): p. 30460-5. The integrity of the cloned involucrin promoter PCR product was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing using involucrin specific primers. The involucrin promoter is not expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes, but is specifically activated in differentiated keratinocytes. In previous studies, we have demonstrated the use of this involucrin promoter fragment support expression in monolayer cultures of NIKS keratinocytes. It is preferable to direct overexpression of the \u03b2-defensins to differentiated keratinocytes to avoid interfering with normal keratinocyte differentiation., 98614=The hBD-3 gene encodes for a 5 kDa basic peptide that was identified by screening genomic sequences for antimicrobial activity and the ability to activate monocytes. The gene was cloned from differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Strongest expression has been exhibited in the skin and tonsil. Endogenous expression is triggered by inflammation, and therefore, hBD-3 is not constitutive but rather a readily inducible antimicrobial peptide. This peptide is also a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and neutrophils, which are strongly involved in the innate immune response (Garcia, J. R., et al., Cell Tissue Res, 2001. 306(2): p. 257-64). hBD-3 possesses a broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide activity at low micromolar concentrations, against many potential pathogenic microbes including P. aeruginosa, S. pyrogenes, multiresistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and the yeast C. albicans. hBD-3 gene expression is also induced in HaCat and cultured skin-derived keratinocytes when stimulated with heat-inactivated bacteria (Harder, J., et al., Nature, 1997. 387(6636): p. 861). It is speculated that some disorders of defective innate immunity, such as unexplained recurrent infections of particular organs, may be caused by abnormalities that reduce expression of one or more genes that encode defensins or other antimicrobial peptides. Synthetic hBD-3 protein exhibits a strong antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and fungi., 93676=Bacteria typically encountered in a burn wound include E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and C. albicans (Heggers, J. P., Treatment of infection in burns, H. DN, Editor. 1996, WB Saunders: London. p. 98-135). All of these microbes are killed by one or more of the \u03b2-defensin antimicrobial peptides., 55845=As used herein, the term \u201cNIKS cells\u201d refers to cells having the characteristics of the cells deposited as cell line ATCC CRL-12191., 90425=Several factors are thought to contribute to the antimicrobial action of the \u03b2-defensins on microbes. First because of their cationic and amphiphilic characteristics, antimicrobial peptides bind and insert into the cytoplasmic membrane, where they assemble into multimeric pores, and destroy the target microbe by changing membrane conductance and altering intracellular function (White, S. H., W. C. Wimley, and M. E. Selsted, Curr Opin Struct Biol, 1995. 5(4): p. 521-7; Boman, H. G., Annu Rev Immunol, 1995. 13: p. 61-92). Most antimicrobial peptides kill microorganisms by forming pores in the cell membrane. These peptides are not toxic to mammalian cells due to the sensitivity of these peptide antibiotics to cholesterol and phospholipids, major components of mammalian cell membranes. The \u03b2-defensins are attractive candidates for therapeutic use as antibiotics since it is difficult for microorganisms to acquire resistance to the peptides' bactericidal mechanism of action (Schroder, J. M., Biochem Pharmacol, 1999. 57(2): p. 121-34).}",
