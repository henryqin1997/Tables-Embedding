            "Audio Signal Reproduction Apparatus - An audio signal reproduction apparatus reproduces an audio signal from a recording medium for recording an audio signal such as a CD. In the normal reproduction, on receiving a movement instruction (e.g., forward or backward jump instruction of music during reproduction) of a reproduction position of an input audio signal in accordance with operation input of an operator, the audio signal reproduction apparatus calculates the movement amount of the reproduction position, and moves the reproduction position to a position moved with respect to the present reproduction position by the movement amount to execute the reproduction. The movement position of the reproduction position is set by a beat unit of the audio signal forming the music during the reproduction."

The query executor dynamically generates a task, and executes a plurality of tasks in parallel. In execution of each task, each time data is required to be read from a database, the query executor generates a task for acquiring the data, and in execution of the generated task, issues a data read request for reading the data from the database, to thereby shorten a time taken to execute each task. 01-27-2011 20120005191 DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD - A database management system has a query interface for receiving a query and a query executor for executing the received query.
