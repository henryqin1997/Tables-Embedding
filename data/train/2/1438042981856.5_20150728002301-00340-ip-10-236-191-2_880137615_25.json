    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{663434=You have the option to choose from a meal plan which can let you go an infinite number of times to the main restaurant called TAOS. TAOS offers a variety of foods, and one of the best things is they have a special menu for vegans/vegetarians. They also have days where they have food themes from other places. One of the downsides, however, would have to be that they close pretty early, so if you wanted food at around 10:00 p.m. you would have to go to the food court, which doesn't have too much to offer in my opinion., 289598=Be sure to fill out the FAFSA and the Scholar Dollar$ Application before March 1st of the Fall you are going to attend to get any aid you may need., 501631=Apply before September of your senior year. Deadlines for institutional scholarships are Dec 1. Apply for housing as soon as possible. There are only 3 residence halls open to Freshman and they fill up fast. Don't take an excessive amount of classes(15+), your freshman year unless your major requires it for on time graduation. Fill out the Scholar Dollars application as soon as you receive your letter of admission. The sooner you apply the more scholarships you are eligible for., 231272=May be rought staying away from home, but with the great views from the dorms and friendly people in the area there is no need to feel blue., 373868=We have a luminaria walk every year on the first Sunday of December its beautiful. The campus is lined up with luminarias, and you get to see it all in a horse carriage, along with hot cocoa and singing Christmas songs., 679969=All of the professors I've had so far are extremely fun and understanding. Try to schedule classes when you know you will go. Do not register for a 7:30 AM class if you know that will not wake up., 4755=APPLY EARLY! My biggest fault was changing my mind at the last minute. I was only able to get loans because I didn't meet the March 1st deadline for scholarships. So always be on top of your deadlines. And have fun! The first few weeks I just studied. Keep a healthy balance of social activities as well as academics. I now do Zumba, have a part time job, and hang out with friends. Even though I've been studying less, my grades are still going up because I'm happy. I'm balanced and thus better able to stay focused., 688175=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 455147=Greek life at New Mexico State university is one of the strongest and active group of students. Most greek are passionate about their chapter which makes every event a good time. Each chapter offers a different brotherhood/sisterhood where everyone can find their place. The Greek GPA average was higher than the undergradute GPA average for the 2012 Fall Semester.}",

    "textAfterTable": "When I first started looking at colleges, money was definitely a factor. NMSU has helped me in that area by providing scholarships for grades, your major and miscellaneous things. Am enjoying being here NMSU is the perfect school for me. It's far enough away from home that I have my independence, but Las Cruces is such a college community that it's like having your family here. All over the city people are watching the games, coming to support events and overall being completely supportive of your college experience! Am learning a lot Here at NMSU my classes are engaging and focus on all aspects. You don't just spend your time reading out of the book, but rather applying the practices to your life. You will always find meaning to take from your classes.
