    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6632=Surprisingly, a strong level of transient NPTII gene expression levels could also be obtained by replacing the nos terminator with the terminator of the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) gene (Genbank accession number V01292, SEQ ID NO. 56). This finding is interesting because the yeast ADH1 terminator does not share homology with any plant terminator. Importantly, it should be noted here that many yeast terminators do not function adequately in plants. For instance, almost no GUS gene expression was observed in a similar experiment as described above with the GUS gene followed by the yeast iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) terminator (Genbank accession number SCCYT1). An improved vector carrying the selectable marker gene NPTII was generated by replacing the nos terminator with the yeast ADH1 terminator. The binary vector containing a selectable marker gene for transient transformation is designated \u201cLifeSupport\u201d (FIG. 5).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{201507=A T-DNA-free vector that can be maintained in both E. coli and A. tumefaciens was obtained by removing the entire T-DNA region of the conventional binary vector pCAMBIA1301 (Cambia, AU). This was accomplished by simultaneously ligating a 5.9 kb SacII-SphI fragment of pSIM1301 with 2 fragments amplified from pCAMBIA1301 using the oligonucleotides pairs: 5\u2032-CCGCGGTGATCACAGGCAGCAAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 58) and 5\u2032-AAGCTTCCAGCCAGCCAACAGCTCCCCGAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 59), and 5\u2032-AAGCTTGGCTACTAGTGCGAGATCTCTAAGAGAAAAGAGCGTTTA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 60), and 5\u2032-GCATGCTCGAGATAGGTGACCACATACAAATGGACGAACGG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 61), respectively., 196417=Development of a new method that makes it possible to transform plants with only native DNA requires, in the first place, a replacement of the T-DNA including LB and RB. Unfortunately, advanced BLAST searches of public databases including those maintained by The National Center For Biotechnology Information, The Institute for Genomic Research, and SANGER failed to identify any border sequences in plants. It was therefore necessary to consider plant DNA sequences that are similar but not identical to T-DNA borders, designated here as \u201cborder-like\u201d (border-like). Examples of plant border-like sequences that were identified in public databases are shown in Table 2. The challenge in trying to replace T-DNA borders with border-like sequences is that border sequences are highly conserved (see Table 2). A large part of these sequences is also highly conserved in the nick regions of other bacterial DNA transfer systems such as that of IncP, PC194, and \u03c6X174, indicating that these sequences are essential for conjugative-like DNA transfer (Waters et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 88: 1456-60, 1991). Because there are no reliable data on border sequence requirements, the entire border seems therefore important in the nicking process. A single study that attempted to address this issue by testing the efficacy of border mutants in supporting DNA transfer is unreliable because negative controls did not appear to function appropriately (van Haaren et al., Plant Mol Biol 13: 523-531, 1989). Furthermore, none of the results of this study were confirmed molecularly. Despite these concerns, two possibly effective border mutants are shown in Table 2 as well., 175491=As an alternative to the two-strain Agrobacterium-mediated transformation approach described above, plants may also be transformed with a single strain that contains a P-DNA with both a native marker gene and the actual sequences of interest. The present invention demonstrates that it is possible to use salt tolerance genes as native markers for transformation. Such salt tolerance genes include crop homologs of the Arabidopsis genes SOS1 (Shi et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2002), AtNHX1 (Apse et al., Science. 285: 1256-8, 1999), Avp1 (Gaxiola et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 98: 11444-9, 2001), and CBF3 (Kasuga et al., Nat Biotechnol. 17: 287-91, 1999)., 34107=This application is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/369,324, filed on Feb. 20, 2003, and which granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7,250,554 on Jul. 31, 2007, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. Nos. 60/357,661, filed on Feb. 20, 2002 and 60/377,602, filed on May 6, 2002, which are all incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to methods for improving the nutritional, health, and agronomic characteristics of a plant by modifying specific, well-characterized DNA in the plant's genome. As opposed to classical plant breeding, the inventive process does not introduce unknown or potentially toxic genes into the plant genetic make-up. Furthermore, the inventive method, unlike conventional genetic engineering strategies, does not incorporate nucleic acids from foreign species, i.e., species that are not inter-fertile with the plant to be modified by genetic engineering, into the plant genome. Plants developed though the inventive plant breeding process display improved agronomic characteristics. Particularly preferred plants of the present invention include potatoes that exhibit unproved health and tuber storage characteristics, and turfgrasses that exhibit improved disease and drought tolerance., 51359=Recent studies report that some plant genes themselves may be used as transformation markers. Examples of such plant markers include Pga22 (Zuo et al., Curr Opin Biotechnol. 13: 173-80, 2002), Cki1 (Kakimoto, Science 274: 982-985, 1996) and Esri (Banno et al., Plant Cell 13: 2609-18, 2001). All of the genes, however, trigger cytokinin responses, which confer an undesirable phenotype to the transformed plant. Furthermore, such plant markers would still need to be removed upon transformation by any of the methods described above., 147890=LifeSupport Vector: a LifeSupport vector is a construct that contains an expressible selectable marker gene, such as a neomycin phosphotransferase marker, that is positioned between T-DNA or T-DNA-like borders. The LifeSupport vector may be modified to limit integration of such a marker, as well as other polynucleotides, that are situated between the border or border-like sequences, into a plant genome. For instance, a LifeSupport vector may comprise a mutated virD2, codA::upp fusion, or any combination of such genetic elements. Thus, a modified virD2 protein will still support T-DNA transfer to plant nuclei but will limit the efficiency of a subsequent genomic integration of T-DNAs (Shurvinton et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 89:11837-11841, 1992; Mysore et al., Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 11: 668-683, 1998). Alternatively, codA::upp gene fusion can be used as negative selectable marker prior to regeneration. In one preferred construct, the LifeSupport vector comprises the npt marker operably linked to the yeast ADH terminator element., 222613=Phosphate levels in potato tubers can be determined by using AOAC Method 995.11 Phosphorus (Total) in Foods (45.1.33 Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International, 17th Edition). Samples are prepared by dry ashing in a muffle furnace followed with an acid digestion. The dissolved samples are then neutralized and treated with a molybdate-ascorbic acid solution and compared to a series of phosphorus standards (treated similarly). A dual beam spectrophotometer would be used for the calorimetric analysis at 823 nanometers. A significant decrease in phosphate content, which is beneficial for the environment, is expected., 173993=Fifth, the frequency of T-DNAs and P-DNAs moving together into the plant cell nucleus can also be enhanced by using a single Agrobacterium strain carrying two compatible binary vectors with the T-DNA and P-DNA, respectively. An example of two compatible binary vectors are a pSIM 1301-derived vector and a pBI121-derived vector., 172908=Second, the T-DNA strain can be modified to express an omega-mutated virD2 gene. The modified virD2 protein will still support T-DNA transfer to plant nuclei but limit the efficiency of a subsequent genomic integration of T-DNAs (Shurvinton et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 89: 11837-11841, 1992; Mysore et al., Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 11: 668-683, 1998). The most preferred method of expressing a modified virD2 gene is by inserting an omega-mutated virD2 gene driven by the virD promoter in the backbone of the T-DNA vector., 42382=Genetic engineering can be used to modify, produce, or remove certain traits from plants. While there has been limited progress in improving the nutritional value and health characteristics of plants, most improvements target plant traits that promote ease of crop cultivation. Thus, certain plants are resistant to the glyphosate herbicide because they contain the bacterial gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (Padgette et al., Arch Biochem Biophys. 258: 564-73, 1987). Similarly, genetic engineering has produced insect-, viral-, and fungal-resistant plant varieties (Shah et al., Trends in Biotechnology 13: 362-368, 1995; Gao et al., Nat Biotechnol. 18: 1307-10, 2000; Osusky et al., Nat Biotechnol. 18: 1162-6, 2000), but few with enhanced nutrition or health benefits., 228567=The copper binding domain in potato PPO was identified by aligning this protein with a sweet potato PPO protein that was shown to contain conserved Cysteine (Cys) residue at position 92, Glutamine residue (Glu) at position 236, and Histidine (His) residues at positions 88, 109, 118, 240, 244 and 274 coordinating the two active site coppers (Kiabunde et al., Nature Structural Biol., 5: 1084-1090, 1998). These Cys, Glu, and His residues are also present in potato PPO., 40826=It can be equally difficult to rapidly increase levels of positive nutritional compounds in food crops due to the inherent imprecision of conventional plant breeding. For instance, it would be desirable to increase levels of \u201cresistant starch\u201d (Topping et al., Physiol Rev 81: 1031-64, 2001) in a variety of crops. Such starch is ultimately responsible for promoting immune responses, suppressing potential pathogens, and reducing the incidence of diseases including colorectal cancer (Bird et al., Curr Issues Intest Microbiol 1: 25-37, 2000). However, the only available plants with increased levels of resistant starch are low-yielding varieties like maize mutants \u201camylose extender\u201d, \u201cdull\u201d, and \u201csugary-2.\u201d Creation of new high resistant starch sources, such as potato, would enable broader dietary incorporation of this health-promoting component., 48653=Furthermore, because of the infidelity of T-DNA transfer, about 75% of transformation events in plants such as tomato, tobacco, and potato contain plasmid \u201cbackbone\u201d sequences in addition to the T-DNA (Kononov et al., Plant J. 11: 945-57, 1997). The presence of such backbone sequences is undesirable because they are foreign and typically contain origins of replication and antibiotic resistance gene markers., 194411=Conventional transformation systems use Agrobacterium-derived T-DNAs as vehicles for the transfer of foreign DNA from Agrobacterium to plant cells (Schilperoort et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,838, 1990). Although T-DNAs usually comprise several hundreds of basepairs, delineated by a left-border (LB) and right-border (RB) repeat, they can also merely consist of such borders. The T-DNA borders play an essential role in the DNA transfer process because they function as specific recognition sites for virD2-catalyzed nicking reaction. The released single stranded DNA, complexed with Agrobacterial virD2 and virE2, is transferred to plant cell nuclei where it often integrates successfully into the plant genome. All T-DNA borders that have been used for foreign DNA transfer are derived from nopaline and octopine strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes (Table 2). These borders and often some flanking Agrobacterium DNA are present in thousands of binary vectors including, for example, pPAM (AY027531), pJawohl (AF408413), pYL156 (AF406991), pINDEX (AF294982), pC1300 (AF294978), pBI121 (AF485783), pLH9000 (AF458478), pAC161 (AJ315956), BinHygTOp (Z37515), pHELLSGATE (AJ311874), pBAR-35S (AJ251014), pGreen (AJ007829), pBIN19 (X77672), pCAMBIA (AF354046), pX6-GFP (AF330636), pER8 (AF309825), pBI101 (U12639), pSKI074 (AF218466), pAJ1 (AC138659), pAC161 (AJ315956), pSLJ8313 (Y18556), and pGV4939 (AY147202). Recently, two homologs of T-DNA borders were identified in the chrysopine-type Ti plasmid pTiChry5 (Palanichelvam et al., Mol Plant Microbe Interact 13: 1081-91, 2000). The left border homolog is identical to an inactive border homolog located in the middle of the T-DNA of pTi15955. The right border homolog is unusually divergent from the sequence of functional T-DNA borders. It is therefore unlikely that these homologs are functionally active in supporting DNA transfer from pTiChry5 to plant cells., 188281=Alternatively, other potato promoters can be operably linked to sequences of interest from potato. Such promoters include the patatin gene promoter (Bevan et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 14: 4625-38, 1986), or a fragment thereof, that promotes expression in potato tubers, the potato UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,783) and the promoter of the ubiquitin gene (Garbarino et al., Plant Physiol, 109: 1371-8, 1995)., 45515=One commonly used regulatory element is the 35S \u201csuper\u201d promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), which is typically used in plant engineering to induce high levels of expression of transgenes to which it is directly linked. However, the 35S promoter also can enhance the expression of native genes in its vicinity (Weigel et al., Plant Physiol., 122: 1003-13, 2000). Such promoters may thus induce unpredictable alterations in the expression of endogenous genes, possibly resulting in undesirable effects such as increased alkaloid production. Preferred \u201cstrong\u201d promoters are generally those isolated from viruses, such as rice tungro bacilliform virus, maize streak virus, cassava vein virus, mirabilis virus, peanut chlorotic streak caulimovirus, figwort mosaic virus and chlorella virus. Other frequently used promoters are cloned from bacterial species and include the promoters of the nopaline synthase and octopine synthase gene., 179820=Overexpressing a mutant PPO gene that contains a non-functional copper-binding domain can lower the activity of all PPO genes that are mainly expressed in tubers and associated organs such as sprouts. The mutations render the polyphenol oxidase protein inactive because it is unable to bind copper. The skilled artisan would know where to make point mutations that would, in this case, compromise the function of a gene product. The applicants identified the copper binding domain in potato PPO by aligning the potato PPO protein sequence with a sweet potato PPO protein sequence (Klabunde et al., Nat Struct. Biol., 5:1084-90, 1998). Areas of conservation, particularly those containing conserved histidine residues in copper-binding sites, were targets for inactivating the transgene product. Because the almost complete absence of PPO activity in such organs may negatively impact the plant's ability to resist pathogens, the present invention also describes an improved method of only lowering a specific PPO gene that is predominantly expressed in all parts of the mature tuber except for the epidermis. Silencing of this specific PPO gene by using a trailer sequence associated with that gene does not reduce PPO expression in the tuber epidermis, the part of the tuber that is most directly exposed to pathogens attempting to infect.}",
