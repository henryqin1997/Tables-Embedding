Cowboys linebacker Ernie Sims was flagged for a critical personal foul penalty on third down to keep Cincinnati's drive alive before Cincinnati's fourth field goal., 74321=It took Cincinnati less than two minutes to answer. BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Marvin Jones ran for 19 and 37 yards, respectively, to reach the red zone, and on the fifth play of the 70-yard march, Hawkins ran in motion, caught Dalton's shovel pass behind the line of scrimmage and sprinted to the right pylon for an 8-yard score., 72238=There was a moment of silence held for Brown before the game, which came down to the final seconds after Dez Bryant caught a 27-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo with 6:35 remaining, cutting the Cowboys' deficit to 19-17., 73181=Sixty-eight of Dallas' yards came on an 8-play march that ended in Bryant's touchdown catch off a deep post., 74895=Brandon Carr forced a turnover early in the second quarter when he stepped in front of A.J. Green, picked off Dalton's pass and ran 37 yards to the Cincy 27. Romo and Jason Witten hooked up for a 25-yard gain on the next snap, and on 3rd-and-goal from the one, Murray leaped over the pile and broke the plane with the nose of the ball with 10:33 left in the half., 74178=Bailey put the Cowboys on the board with a 37-yard field goal 6:24 into the game after Romo threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-1., 73302=The Bengals called five straight pass plays on the ensuing drive, the last resulting in a sack on third down to force a punt. Dallas took over at its own 28-yard line and used up the final 3:44 behind the strength of three third- down conversions, the last a 6-yard run by DeMarco Murray that moved the ball to the Cincinnati 24-yard line with 24 seconds showing.}",
