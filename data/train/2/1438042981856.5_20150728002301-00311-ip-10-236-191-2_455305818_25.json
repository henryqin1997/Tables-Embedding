    "textBeforeTable": "For those of you planning to use the ol\u0092 laser sword later on, after you find the parts required to make one, keep in mind that the bonuses gained from advanced ranks of Melee Proficiency do not apply to lightsabers; that weapon has its own proficiency that you\u0092ll need to advance in. You can actually begin investing in Lightsaber Focus or Specialization before you obtain one, and have those set aside until the happy day arrives. The third ranks of weapon proficiencies, called weapon specializations, are a unique case, since they are only available to characters of the Soldier class. When a character specializes in a weapon, he or she adds two damage to the total damage dealt on the blow. Although your main character won\u0092t get a lightsaber until the middle stretch of their adventure, you can still plan ahead and get them a Lightsaber Weapon Focus early on. Since combat is such a core aspect of the KOTOR gameplay, every character will want to pick a weapon type (if not two) and advance its proficiency to its second rank. Even if a simple +1 to hit doesn\u0092t sound impressive, you have to consider that, over the course of the game, your characters will",
    "textAfterTable": "Armor Proficiency A piece of body armor cannot be used by a character unless they have a Proficiency for armor of that weight class. Pretty simple, really. All Jedi Classes start with only the Light armor proficiency, but keep in mind that heavier armor generally reduces or negates the Dexterity bonus to Defense, so if you have a high Dexterity stat, you may as well find a great piece of Light armor and use that. Also note that many Force Powers are not useable while you are wearing armor. Since Feats are somewhat precious commodities as it is, it\u0092s probably for the best that you use the default proficiencies that your character starts with, rather than buying a proficiency for higher-level armor that might not be useful later in the game. Note also that many pieces of head armor will require certain armor proficiencies to use, thus greatly restricting the kinds of equipment that characters without any armor proficiencies (such as Kreia and Visas) can use.
