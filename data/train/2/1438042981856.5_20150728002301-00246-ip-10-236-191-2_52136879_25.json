Stafford caught a 22-yard pass and Titus Young later advanced the chains on a 3rd-and-7 play with a 15-yard catch. It was a 7-0 game as Will Heller caught a pass over the middle and banged his way into the end zone on a 10-yard score with 10:58 left in the first., 79435=The Lions had an answer on their next touch with a nine-play, 87-yard drive that was capped on a leaping catch in the left corner of the end zone by Johnson for a 13-yard score and a 14-7 lead with 9:11 to play in the first half., 77682=The Saints came right back with a 14-play, 80-yard trek that was finished when Sproles went up the middle untouched on a 17-yard score for a 31-21 advantage with 9:53 to play., 75259=The Lions, meanwhile, were in a playoff game for the first time since 1999 and were just three seasons removed from the first and only 0-16 season in the history of the NFL., 77870=Stafford was intercepted on the first play of the Lions' next touch and that led to a 56-yard touchdown catch by Meachem to essentially seal the win with 7:29 left., 77380=Stafford answered on the Lions' next touch with an eight-play, 80-yard drive that he capped with a roll out to the right and just touch the pylon with the ball before going down on a one-yard score with 1:08 left in the third. Johnson caught passes of 15, 21 and 42 yards during the drive.}",
