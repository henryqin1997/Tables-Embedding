            "Campus Safety is really important on campus. We have a health center which I heard is really useful. The Auraria Police Department are also doing a great job.",
            "All the clubs and activities held on campus are really fun. All clubs are really dedicated into what they do; especially TRiO SSS!",
            "I have not seen any unusual traditions or locations on campus before.",
            "For fun, we have an open gym, swimming pool, we are located right in the heart of downtown so there are stores close by. There are always club events and activities that are held. Free stuff sometimes.",
            "The food court are pretty packed during certain times. The food are not bad at all! Dining is really nice for studying and group sessions.",
            "I don't live on campus so I can't really say how the dorms are like. But I have heard that you are more focus on campus, no stress about transportation from home to the campus and the dorms are pretty nice.",
            "Professors here at the University of Colorado are there to do their job. There are FCQs for each instructors upon their teaching skills, work ethic, and average class grades. The times and days are really manageable.",
            "When you think that there's no way you could afford a 4-year college, think again. I was one of those who stress about tuition and fees, but the University of Colorado really wants to help their students as best as they can. There are many resources on campus that are there to help.",
            "Extremely diverse in many ways of helping students from different backgrounds. The perfect place in committed to getting a degree and pursuing a career!"
