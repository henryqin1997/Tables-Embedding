    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students For all the students who are planning to attend Cerritos I highly recommend that you register as soon as possible. When it comes to enrollment choose your classes wisely and pick the classes you want to take ahead of time so that when it comes time to enroll it can be done fast and easy. Bang for the buck Unlike most Universities, Cerritos is a great start for first time college students. It's an affordable college that offers the same material and classes at most Universities. Why pay more for knowledge when you can get it cheaper? The only thing that is quite expensive would have to be the books. But of course you can find cheap books all over the place. There are great books across the street from Cerritos Campus who sell books at a reasonable price. Am enjoying being here I enjoy Cerritos College a lot. It's close by and it's not hard to get there at all. The only thing that is a hassle is the parking. I always arrive to school ahead of time just so I can get a good parking spot and arrive to my class on time. The only classes are amazing! I can stay in my pajamas all day and do Homework.",
