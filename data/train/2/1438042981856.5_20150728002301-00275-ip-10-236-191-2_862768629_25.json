            "Participants were administered pazopanib 800 mg (2 x 400 mg tablets) orally OD continuously. Pazopanib was to be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours after a meal. Participants received study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent for any other reasons.",
            "Participants were administered sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily in 6-week cycles (4 weeks of treatment, followed by 2 weeks without treatment).

Significant events and approaches for the overall study following participant enrollment, but prior to group assignment Pre-Assignment Details Per protocol amendment, the number of participants (par.) was increased to ~1100 (including all par. enrolled in Studies VEG108844 and VEG113078 [NCT01147822; a substudy in Asian par.]). This summary is a pooled analysis of both studies. 1110 par. were analyzed; 927 from VEG108844 (reflected in the protocol enrollment field), 183 from VEG113078.
