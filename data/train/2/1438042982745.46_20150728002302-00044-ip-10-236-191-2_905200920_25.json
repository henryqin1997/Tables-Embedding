There are plenty of sports or other clubs and activities! Food and Dining I have never gotten food at Luzerne, it is way too expensive!! People do say it tastes alright though. Dorm Life Luzerne does not have dorms, however, many people live around the campus or commute! I am a commuter, and I think it is easier for me to maintain my schedule with not being in a dorm. Academic Rigor Make sure that you always have what you need for class! Tips for prospective students",
