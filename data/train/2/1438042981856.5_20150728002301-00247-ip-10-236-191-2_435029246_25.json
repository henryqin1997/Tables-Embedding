            "Description",
            "HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTING CIRCUIT SUBSTRATE AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS THEREOF - A manufacturing process of a high thermal conducting circuit substrate is provided. First, a metal core substrate is provided and then the metal core substrate is etched at different etching speeds. Afterwards, two insulating layers are formed respectively on two sides of the etched metal core substrate. In addition, as an option, two conducting layers are formed respectively on two sides of the metal core substrate and are on top of the insulting layers. The conducting layers are patterned according to designs appropriate for the products. Because the high thermal conducting circuit substrate fabricated as the aforementioned manufacturing process mainly comprises the metal core substrate, it helps to elevate the thermal conduction of the circuit substrate itself.",
            "METHOD OF FABRICATING SUBSTRATE - A method of fabricating a substrate includes following steps. First, a metallic panel having a first surface and a second surface is provided. A first half-etching process is carried out to etch the first surface of the metallic panel to a first depth so that a first patterned metallic layer is formed on the first surface. Next, a first insulating material is deposited into gaps in the first patterned metallic layer to form a first insulator. Thereafter, a second half-etching process is carried out to etch the second surface of the metallic panel to a second depth and expose at least a portion of the first insulator so that a second patterned metallic layer is formed on the second surface. The first depth and the second depth together equal the thickness of the metallic panel.",
            "PROCESS OF ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE - A process of electronic structure is provided. First, a carrier board is provided, in which the carrier board has a first surface. Next, a first release layer is formed on the first surface of the carrier board. The first release layer has property of withstanding high-temperature and temporary adhesion capability and the first release layer entirely or mostly overlays the first surface. Then, a built-up structure is formed on the first release layer. Finally, a separating process is performed so that the built-up structure is separated from the carrier board to form an electronic structure.",
            "EDGE SEPARATION EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHOD THEREOF - An edge separation equipment and an operating method thereof are suitable for a carrier and a circuit board in a coreless process. The carrier is attached to the circuit board by a mechanically separable interface, and the edge separation equipment is used to separate the edge of the carrier from the edge of the circuit board. The edge separation equipment includes a platform, a supporting device and a wind knife device. The platform has a supporting surface on which the carrier or the circuit board is mounted. The supporting device is configured at a side of the platform. The wind knife device is configured on the supporting device, and the air jet supplied by the wind knife device blows toward the edge of the carrier and the edge of the circuit board, such that there is an edge separation width between the carrier and the circuit board."

The pump is mounted on the base and includes a water feeding pipe connecting a water inlet port and the pressure vessel. The pressure vessel includes a water discharge port and an electromagnetic valve. The electromagnetic valve includes air inlet and discharge pipes. The pump supplies water to the pressure vessel to allow air to mix with the water inside the pressure vessel, making the water full of tiny air bubbles. As such, residual pesticides remaining on fruits and vegetables may attach to the tiny air bubbles containing in the water when the water is used to clean the fruits and vegetables,",
