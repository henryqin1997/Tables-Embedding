            "Communication System and Method Between an On-Vehicle Voice Recognition System and an Off-Vehicle Voice Recognition System - A vehicle based system and method for receiving voice inputs and determining whether to perform a voice recognition analysis using in-vehicle resources or resources external to the vehicle.",
            "THREE-DIMENSIONAL VEHICLE BACKUP CAMERA DISPLAY SYSTEM AND METHOD - A system and method for displaying a vehicle backup image are presented. The system includes at least one camera supported by the vehicle. The camera creates an image of a vehicle environment in which the vehicle is disposed. The image includes a first image section of a first portion of the vehicle environment and a second image section of an adjacent second portion of the vehicle environment. A display operatively connects to the camera to receive the first and second image sections. The display includes a first display section having a first display surface displaying the first image section and disposed at a first angle. The display further includes a second display section having a second display surface displaying the second image section and disposed at a second angle such that the second display surface and the first display surface define an obtuse angle therebetween.",
            "SLANTED MAP - A display device generates a combined display that is viewable by the driver of a vehicle. The combined display may be composed of a plurality of displays, wherein one or more overlaying displays appear partially or completely in front of a first display, each overlaying display having an opaque portion that conveys information and a substantially transparent portion through which the first display is viewable. One or more monitors may generate the first display and overlaying displays. A monitor may be divided into multiple screens to generate a plurality of the displays. A screen that generates the first display may be directly viewable by the driver, while the screens the generate the overlaying displays may be outside the driver's line of sight. The display device may include one or more reflecting surfaces and one or more refracting surfaces for directing the overlaying displays into the driver's line of sight."

The average pore size of the porous receptor materials on the sensors increases systematically from one sensor to the next in the array. At least one detector is arranged to detect responses of the resonant sensors when the array is exposed to a sample potentially containing one or more of the analytes. In some embodiments, a processor is programmed to determine from the sensor responses the presence, amount or relative concentration of target molecules in the sample. 20150192548 Published Description Patent application number Steven Yamamoto, San Diego, CA US 08-12-2010 SPINAL THERAPY UNIT - A spinal therapy device comprising an elastomeric sleeve having an opening at each end, a pair of spherical objects held together within said sleeve, means to substantially close one end of the sleeve and means to releasably close the other end of the sleeve. 20100204625 Published Description Patent application number Ross Yamamoto, Los Angeles, CA US //]]> BarDraw('2937737',['Patent applications by Ronald K.

Depending on the depth of the user's hand or arm, the context of the verbal command is determined and verbal commands corresponding to the determined context are selected. Speech recognition is then performed on an audio signal using the selected verbal commands. By using an appropriate set of verbal commands, the accuracy of the speech recognition is increased. 12-19-2013 Stuart M. Yamamoto, Hacienda Heights, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20110131037 Vocabulary Dictionary Recompile for In-Vehicle Audio System - An in-vehicle audio system and methods are provided. A respective word or a respective phrase may be associated with each item of audio content stored in the in-vehicle audio system. The in-vehicle audio system may perform an action with respect to one of the stored items of audio content in response to a spoken command, which may include the respective word or the respective phrase associated with the one of the stored items. When audio content is to be added to the in-vehicle audio system, phonetics related to the audio content may be generated and added to a vocabulary dictionary during a compile process.
