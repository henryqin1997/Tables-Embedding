In 1997, the Commission initiated a proceeding seeking comment on the extent to which legislative changes, technological changes, and market changes warrant comprehensive reform of the separations process. In 2001, the Commission adopted the Federal-State Joint Board on Jurisdictional Separations' recommendation to impose an interim freeze of the part 36 category relationships and jurisdictional cost allocation factors for a period of five years, pending comprehensive reform of the part 36 separations rules. In 2006, the Commission adopted an Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which extended the separations freeze for a period of three years and sought comment on comprehensive reform. In 2009, the Commission adopted a Report and Order extending the separations freeze an additional year to June 2010. In 2010, the Commission adopted a Report and Order extending the separations freeze for an additional year to June 2011. In 2011, the Commission adopted a Report and Order extending the separations freeze for an additional year to June 2012., 145882=Abstract: The Commission's closed captioning rules are designed to make video programming more accessible to deaf and hard of hearing Americans.

What exactly is a Federal... Continue reading \u2192, 196619=Abstract: The Commission adopted a Notice or Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to streamline its procedures for reviewing satellite license applications. Before 2003, the Commission used processing rounds to review those applications. In a processing round, when an application is filed, the International Bureau (Bureau) issued a public notice establishing a cut-off date for other mutually exclusive satellite applications, and then considered all those applications together. In cases where sufficient spectrum to accommodate all the application was not available, the Bureau directed the applicants to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution. Those negotiations took a long time, and delayed provision of satellite services to the public., 499110=The Commission began implementing the electronic filing of tariffs on January 31, 1997, when it released the Streamlined Tariff Order. On November 17, 1997, the Bureau made this electronic system, known as the Electronic Tariff Filing System, available for voluntary filing by incumbent LECs. The Bureau also announced that the use of ETFS would become mandatory for all incumbent LECs in 1998., 455324=Agency Contact: Douglas Slotten, Attorney-Advisor, Federal Communications Commission, Wireline Competition Bureau, 445 12th Street SW., Washington, DC 20554, Phone: 202 418-1572, Email: douglas.slotten@fcc.gov., 488340=Abstract: In 2009, the FCC launched a public process to determine whether and what actions might be necessary to preserve the characteristics that have allowed the Internet to grow into an indispensable platform supporting our nation's economy and civic life. After receiving input from more than 100,000 individuals and organizations and several public workshops, this process has made clear that the Internet has thrived because of its freedom and openness\u2014the absence of any gatekeeper blocking lawful uses of the network or picking winners and losers online. The Open Internet Order builds on the bipartisan Internet Policy Statement the Commission adopted in 2005. The Order requires that all broadband providers are required to be transparent by disclosing their network management practices, performance, and commercial terms; fixed providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; fixed providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic; mobile providers may not block access to lawful Web sites, or applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services; and all providers may engage in \u201creasonable network management,\u201d such as managing the network to address congestion or security issues. The rules do not prevent broadband providers from offering specialized services, such as facilities-based VoIP; do not prevent providers from blocking unlawful content or unlawful transfers of content; and do not supersede any obligation or authorization a provider may have to address the needs of emergency communications or law enforcement, public safety, or national security authorities., 177688=Petitions for Reconsideration have been filed in the Commission's rulemaking proceeding concerning Fixed and Mobile Services in the Mobile Satellite Service Bands at 1525-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz, 1610-1626.5 MHz and 2483.5-2500 MHz, and 2000-2020 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz and published pursuant to 47 CFR 1.429(e).

The Commission also holds in abeyance, until the conclusion of this proceeding, any pending license applications and equipment authorization requests that involve operation of low power auxiliary devices on frequencies in the 700 MHz Band after the end of the DTV transition., 449325=On February 12, 2004, the Commission adopted a Second Report and Order resolving several issues on which the Commission sought comment in the FNPRM. First, the Commission modified the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d rule to permit rate-of-return carriers to bring recently acquired price cap lines back to rate-of-return regulation. Second, the Commission granted rate-of-return carriers the authority immediately to provide geographically deaveraged transport and special access rates, subject to certain limitations. Third, the Commission merged Long Term Support (LTS) with Interstate Common Line Support (ICLS)., 263512=Abstract: Cable systems and other multichannel video programming distributors are not entitled to retransmit a broadcast station's signal without the station's consent. This consent is known as \u201cretransmission consent.\u201d Since Congress enacted the retransmission consent regime in 1992, there have been significant changes in the video programming marketplace. In this proceeding, comment is sought on a series of proposals to streamline and clarify the Commission's rules concerning or affecting retransmission consent negotiations., 227879=Agency Contact: Amy Brett, Asst. Div. Chief, Industry Analysis Div., Federal Communications Commission, Media Bureau, 445 12th Street SW., Washington, DC 20554, Phone: 202 418-2703, Email: amy.brett@fcc.gov., 470461=On February 8, 2011, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on proposed rule revisions to address access stimulation. The Commission sought comment on a proposal to require rate-of-return LECs and competitive LECs to file revised tariffs if they enter into or have existing revenue sharing agreements. The proposed tariff filing requirements vary depending on the type of LEC involved. The Commission also sought comment on other record proposals and on possible rules for addressing access stimulation in the context of intra-MTA call terminations by CMRS providers. Comments were filed on April 1, 2011, and reply comments were filed on April 18, 2011., 493741=Abstract: In 2007, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in WC Docket No. 07-244. The Notice sought comment on whether the Commission should adopt rules specifying the length of the porting intervals or other details of the porting process. It also tentatively concluded that the Commission should adopt rules reducing the porting interval for wireline-to-wireline and intermodal simple port requests, specifically, to a 48-hour porting interval., 142591=On July 12, 2011, the Commission released an NPRM that would assist Consumers in detecting and preventing the placement of unauthorized charges on their telephone bills, an unlawful and fraudulent practice, commonly referred to as \u201ccramming.\u201d, 219208=Abstract: On January 18, 2001, the Commission adopted a Report and Order (R&O) and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, addressing a number of issues related to the conversion of the nation's broadcast television system from analog to digital television.

The E911 proceeding goes a step further and is aimed at improving the effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 dispatchers with additional information on wireless 911 calls., 120641=Following a December 4, 2007 NPRM, on June 17, 2008, the Commission released a Report and Order amending its rules to require sellers and/or telemarketers to honor registrations with the National Do-Not-Call Registry indefinitely, unless the registration is cancelled by the consumer or the number is removed by the database administrator., 280378=Abstract: In a series of orders in several related proceedings issued since 1996, the Federal Communications Commission has taken action to improve the quality and reliability of 911 emergency services for wireless phone users. Rules have been adopted governing the availability of basic 911 services and the implementation of enhanced 911 (E911) for wireless services., 422716=On March 18, 2010, the Commission issued a Report & Order and Memorandum Opinion & Order. In this order, the Commission addressed an inequitable asymmetry in the Commission's current rules governing the receipt of universal service high-cost local switching support (LSS) by small incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs). By modifying the Commission's rules to permit incumbent LECs that lose lines to receive additional LSS when they cross a threshold, the order provides LSS to all small LECs on the same basis. Nothing in the order is intended to address the long-term role of LSS in the Commission's high-cost universal service policies, which the Commission is considering as part of comprehensive universal service reform. April 16, 2010, the Commission issued an Order and NPRM addressing high-cost universal service support for non-rural carriers serving insular areas. In the NPRM, the Commission sought comment on amending its rules to provide additional low-income support in Puerto Rico., 461182=On December 13, 2007, the Commission announced the effective date of its revised CPNI rules (72 FR 70808)., 117956=Agency Contact: Cheryl J.

Comments on the Second FNPRM were due on April 23, 2004, and May 10, 2004., 52934=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 211549=Agency Contact: Howard Griboff, Deputy Chief, Federal Communications Commission, International Bureau, 445 12th Street SW., Washington, DC 20554, Phone: 202 418-0657, Fax: 202 418-1414, Email: howard.griboff@fcc.gov., 469258=Abstract: The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is examining whether its existing rules governing the setting of tariffed rates by local exchange carriers (LECs) provide incentives and opportunities for carriers to increase access demand endogenously with the result that the tariff rates are no longer just and reasonable. The Commission tentatively concluded that it must revise its tariff rules so that it can be confident that tariffed rates remain just and reasonable even if a carrier experiences or induces significant increases in access demand. The Commission seeks comment on the types of activities that are causing the increases in interstate access demand and the effects of such demand increases on the cost structures of LECs. The Commission also seeks comment on several means of ensuring just and reasonable rates going forward. The NPRM invites comment on potential traffic stimulation by rate-of-return LECs, price cap LECs, and competitive LECs, as well as other forms of intercarrier traffic stimulation. Comments were received on December 17, 2007, and reply comments were received on January 16, 2008., 241014=Abstract: Congress has mandated that after February 17, 2009, full-power broadcast stations must transmit only in digital signals, and may no longer transmit analog signals.
