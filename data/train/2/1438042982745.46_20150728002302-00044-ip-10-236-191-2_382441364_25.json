President Skorton and Bob Bowlsby have been very supportive of our efforts. I feel honored to be a coach at the University of Iowa. All of us on the staff are very excited about the future of our program.\"\u00a0 The problem is that since Ferentz signed that very rich contract his overall record is 19-18 and his record in the Big Ten is 11-13.\u00a0 When you win more than 10 games for 3 straight seasons, sign a very rich contract, and then win 19 games in 3 years, it certainly raises some eyebrows.\u00a0 The yearly records themselves (7-5, 6-7, 6-6) are interesting, but even more troubling is actually watching Iowa play football during the 2002-2004 period, and then watch Iowa play in the last couple of seasons.\u00a0 Technology is a great thing, and watching an Iowa team playing in 2002-04 period on one television and last year's team playing on another TV that are side-by-side is to see the difference between night and day.\u00a0 The first thing that screams off of the TV screens is that the overall intensity level is dramatically different, with the 2002-04 teams playing with much more passion, drive, and fire.\u00a0 The second very noticeable item is the amount of stupid penalties and lack of focus by the Iowa players in the last couple of years.\u00a0 Another thing is that the Iowa sideline, when it is shown, looks more out of control and in chaos in the last couple of years.\u00a0 Lastly, other things that we noticed in the last two seasons is that the special teams didn't look as well coached, the offensive and defensive lines did not fire off the ball as well, the quarterbacks didn't look as well prepared, and the Iowa defense gave up a lot more big plays.\u00a0 What does it mean that almost from the day that Kirk Ferentz signed a new long-term\u00a0 and very rich contract, that his Iowa teams are playing a lot worse football?\u00a0 We don't know exactly, but there is a huge difference between the Iowa teams in the \"pre-big Ferentz contract\" years and the \"post-big Ferentz contract\" years, and that should be very troubling for the people making the hiring and firing decisions at Iowa., 23312=Iowa has a fairly easy non-conference schedule in 2008, with Maine and Florida International visiting Iowa City to start the year, which is about as a guaranteed 2 wins as you can get in game of college football today.\u00a0 After the embarrassing loss to Iowa State in '07, Iowa should be motivated to beat the Cyclones this season, which should allow the Hawkeyes should be, 23110=We predict that Kirk Ferentz and Iowa will have a 6-6 record in 2008., 23765=3-0 heading to play Pitt on September 20.\u00a0 We see the Pitt game as the beginning of the end of the Hawkeyes in 2008, with a\u00a0 loss of Pitt being the first loss of 6 in the last 9 games of the season.\u00a0 The biggest problem for Iowa in recent years has been in the Big Ten, and we see Iowa going 2-6 in the conference, which if it happened would give Ferentz a 4-year record of 17-19 in the Big Ten.\u00a0 If Ferentz and Iowa do indeed go 6-6 and have a losing record in the Big Ten in 2008, the question will then turn to if Iowa can continue to pay a coach that is putting mediocrity onto the football field.\u00a0 Reading Ferentz's contract, , it is not entirely clear to us what Ferentz's December 2008 buyout would be, but our best guess puts it around $4.55 million.\u00a0 Would Iowa pay a football coach $4.55 million to buyout a contact?\u00a0 We are doubtful that they would, but if Iowa does put up a 6-6 record in 2008, the Hawkeye fans are going to be demanding that someone answer for Iowa's recent football records, and the football coach would be the obvious person to go.\u00a0 Of course, it is not a \"fait accompli\" that Iowa will go 6-6 in 2008.\u00a0 Kirk Ferentz can draw on his experience during the 9 years that he coached on Hayden Fry's staff at Iowa (1981-89) and remember a time when the Hawkeye football team was down after several very good years.\u00a0 Iowa football can return to its pre-2005 days by very simply playing with a lot more passion, intelligence, and focus.\u00a0 It is the head coach and his staff's job to make sure that their team is prepared to play each opponent, and that has just not been the case in recent seasons at Iowa.\u00a0 Ferentz and Iowa have a chance to turn things around in 2008, but nothing is going to change until the head football coach at Iowa decides that mediocrity is not going to be tolerated any longer within his football program, regardless of the eventual outcomes of the games.\u00a0 If Ferentz demands excellence from his staff and players, the 6 win season we have predicted could easily be 9 wins instead.\u00a0, 26808=*Ferentz will be fired if he does not get to at least a 6-6 (.500) record in 2008, regardless of the buyout amount., 26217=2008 Coaches Hot Seat Prediction:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6-6, 26534=Will Ferentz be back for the 2009 season?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YES*, 7107=2008 SCHEDULE}",
