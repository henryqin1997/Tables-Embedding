EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this notice, DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for residential boilers. The notice also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results., 73747=In this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNOPR), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes a number of changes to the proposed test procedure rule published on October 17, 2014. Specifically, DOE proposes to clarify that a ceiling fan is not subject to the test procedure if the plane of rotation of the ceiling fan's blades cannot be within 45 degrees of horizontal, rather than exempt air circulators (or air-circulating fan heads) from the test procedure. DOE also proposes to test high-volume small-diameter ceiling fans according to test procedures based on the current DOE test procedure for ceiling fans, rather than the Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc. (AMCA) 230 test procedure. All ceiling fans larger than seven feet in diameter would still be tested according to a test procedure based on the AMCA 230 test procedure, but all ceiling fans less than seven feet in diameter would be tested according to test procedures based on the current DOE test procedure. DOE also proposes that the test require mounting all ceiling fans with blade spans less than or equal to seven feet to the real ceiling, rather than a false ceiling, during testing. The proposed test method would also increase the number of speeds at which ceiling fans with blade spans greater than seven feet are tested, and clarify the weighting associated with each tested speed in the energy efficiency metric and update the test room dimensions for ceiling fans with blade spans greater than seven feet. Finally, DOE proposes to clarify the effective date corresponding to the NOPR proposal to reinterpret the statutory definition of a ceiling fan to include hugger ceiling fans., 212434=This document announces an extension of the time period for submitting comments, data and information on the preliminary technical support document (TSD) for general service lamps (GSLs) energy conservation standards published on December 11, 2014. The comment period is extended to February 23, 2015., 33322=Title 10 published on 2015-01-01, 99067=On March 12, 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) and technical support document (TSD) that analyze the potential economic impacts and energy savings that could result from potential energy conservation standards for certain residential furnaces. DOE published this NOPR and analysis so stakeholders can review and provide input on the relevant outputs and the underlying assumptions and calculations. The comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the subject residential furnaces was scheduled to end June 10, 2015. After receiving requests for additional time to comment, DOE has decided to extend the comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the energy conservation standards for residential furnaces until July 10, 2015., 12929=On December 29, 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) to clarify the test procedures for fluorescent lamp ballasts. That proposed rulemaking serves as the basis for the final rule. DOE is issuing a final rule to reorganize, reformat, correct, and clarify the scope of the energy conservation standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts. In addition, DOE is removing the outdated test procedure at Appendix Q and redesignating the current test procedure at Appendix Q1 as Appendix Q. DOE is also clarifying the test procedure setup at redesignated Appendix Q. Finally, DOE is revising the laboratory accreditation language and is providing clarification on the process for evaluating compliance with standards., 3080=On July 11, 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy published a final rule amending the test procedures for consumer water heaters and certain commercial water heaters. This correction addresses an error in one of the amendatory instructions for the regulatory text. Neither the error nor the correction in this document affects the substance of the rulemaking or any of the conclusions reached in support of the final rule., 123911=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) and TSD (technical support document) that analyzes the potential economic impacts and energy savings that could result from potential energy conservation standards for hearth products. DOE published this NOPR and analysis so stakeholders can review the relevant outputs and the underlying assumptions and calculations. After receiving a request for additional time to comment, DOE has decided to extend the comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the energy conservation standards for hearth products until May 11, 2015., 103732=On March 31, 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) and technical support document (TSD) that analyze the potential economic impacts and energy savings that could result from potential energy conservation standards for residential boilers. DOE published this NOPR and analysis so stakeholders can review and provide input on the relevant outputs and the underlying assumptions and calculations. The comment period for the NOPR pertaining to residential boilers was scheduled to end June 1, 2015. After receiving requests for additional time to comment, DOE has decided to extend the comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the energy conservation standards for residential boilers until July 1, 2015., 22964=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including general service fluorescent lamps (GSFLs) and incandescent reflector lamps (IRLs). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to determine whether more-stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this final rule, DOE is adopting more-stringent energy conservation standards for GSFLs. It has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for these products would result in significant conservation of energy, and are technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE concluded in this final rule that amending energy conservation standards for IRLs would not be economically justified., 17805=On October 21, 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) to amend the test procedures for fluorescent lamp ballasts. That NOPR serves as the basis for this action. This final rule amends DOE's regulations concerning the test procedures for the measurement of energy consumption for fluorescent lamp ballasts. Specifically, these amendments clarify the requirement to use the test procedures in Appendix Q1 to demonstrate compliance with the energy conservation standards that apply to fluorescent lamp ballasts manufactured on or after November 14, 2014. These revisions follow the intent of the fluorescent lamp ballast test procedure final rule to support any new or revised energy conservation standards at the time those standards require compliance. This final rule also corrects the formula for power factor, which contained a mathematical error as adopted in that final rule., 197667=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, sets forth various provisions designed to improve energy efficiency for consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment. In addition to specifying a list of covered residential products and commercial equipment, EPCA contains provisions that enable the Secretary of Energy to classify additional types of consumer products as covered products. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has previously published a proposed determination of coverage to classify gas-fired hearth products as covered consumer products under the applicable provisions in EPCA. In this document, DOE proposes an energy conservation standard for hearth products following its notice of proposed coverage determination. This proposed rule also announces a public meeting to receive comment on the proposed standard and associated analyses and results., 79698=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including residential dehumidifiers. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this document, DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for different categories of residential dehumidifiers. This document also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results., 139127=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is giving notice that it intends to establish a negotiated rulemaking working group under the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee (ASRAC) in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (NRA) to negotiate proposed Federal standards for the energy efficiency requirements of miscellaneous refrigeration standards. The purpose of the working group will be to discuss and, if possible, reach consensus on a proposed rule for the scope and definitions, certain aspects of the test procedure, and energy conservation standards for miscellaneous refrigeration products, as authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, as amended. The working group will consist of representatives of parties having a defined stake in the outcome of the proposed standards, and will consult as appropriate with a range of experts on technical issues. The working group is expected to make a concerted effort to negotiate a final term sheet within four (4) months of its first meeting. At a minimum, within four months (4) of its first meeting, the working group is required to provide a status update to ASRAC. An extension of no more than two (2) months may be provided given formal feedback and recommendation from ASRAC members after deliberation and discussion surrounding the working group's status update. Lastly, DOE is announcing the first Working Group session, which is open to the public, on Monday, May 4, and Tuesday, May 5., 7401=On December 3, 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNOPR) to amend the test procedures for conventional cooking products. The oven-related procedures proposed in that rulemaking serve as the basis for this final rule. As part of the SNOPR, DOE proposed to incorporate methods for measuring conventional oven volume, clarified that the existing oven test block must be used to test all ovens regardless of input rate, and proposed a method to measure the energy consumption of conventional ovens equipped with an oven separator. Additionally, DOE proposed technical corrections to the units of measurement in certain calculations. This final rule amends the current procedure to include the proposed changes listed above, as well as clarifications to certain definitions, that will take effect 30 days after the final rule publication date. These changes will be mandatory for product testing to demonstrate compliance with any new or amended energy conservation standards when they take effect and for representations of the energy consumption of conventional ovens starting 180 days after publication., 128766=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including residential water heaters. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to determine whether more stringent amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. Accordingly, DOE established amended energy conservation standards for several classes of residential water heaters in an April 2010 final rule. In this notice, DOE proposes to amend its definitions pertaining to residential water heaters and to clarify the applicability of energy conservation standards for residential water heaters that are utilized as a secondary back-up heat source in solar-thermal water heating systems. Specifically, DOE is proposing to create a definition for \u201csolar-assisted fossil fuel storage water heater\u201d and \u201csolar-assisted electric storage water heater\u201d and clarify that water heaters meeting these definitions are not subject to the amended energy conservation standards for residential water heaters established by the April 2010 final rule., 207463=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend the test procedure proposals presented in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), published on May 21, 2014. The proposed revisions include modifications to the whole-home dehumidifier test setup and conduct, and revisions to the measurement of energy use in fan-only operation first proposed in the May 2014 NOPR. DOE also introduces a methodology to determine whole-home dehumidifier case volume, clarifies the equations used to calculate corrected relative humidity and capacity for portable and whole-home dehumidifiers, and provides additional technical corrections and clarifications. The additional proposals are to be combined with the initial proposals from May 2014., 84608=On March 11, 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that proposes to revise its test procedure for residential furnaces and boilers established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (80 FR 12876). DOE published this NOPR so stakeholders can review and provide input on these proposed revisions. The comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the subject residential furnaces and boilers test procedure was scheduled to end May 26, 2015. After receiving a request for additional time to comment, DOE has decided to reopen the comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the test procedure for residential furnaces and boilers until July 10, 2015., 144757=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is giving notice that it intends to establish a negotiated rulemaking working group under the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee (ASRAC) in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (NRA) to negotiate proposed definitions, certain aspects of a proposed test procedure (if applicable), and proposed energy conservation standards for fans and blowers. The purpose of the working group will be to discuss and, if possible, reach consensus on the scope of the rulemaking, certain key aspects of a proposed test procedure, and proposed energy conservation standard for fans and blowers, as authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, as amended. As part of its negotiations, the working group will consider scope of coverage and system interaction impacts of potential standards for fans and blowers. The working group will consist of representatives of parties having a defined stake in the outcome of the regulations, including the proposed standards, and will consult as appropriate with a range of experts on technical issues. The working group is expected to make a concerted effort to negotiate a final term sheet within three (3) months of its first meeting. At the completion of negotiation, the term sheet will be presented to ASRAC at an open meeting for their deliberation and decision on whether or not to pass it on as a formal recommendation to DOE. Lastly, DOE is announcing the first Working Group session, which is open to the public, on Wednesday, May 6, and Thursday, May 7, 2015., 28243=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is amending its test procedures for vented home heating equipment and pool heaters established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. This rulemaking fulfills DOE's statutory obligation to review its test procedures for covered products at least once every seven years. The amendments add provisions for testing vented home heating equipment that utilizes condensing technology, and incorporate by reference six industry test standards to replace the outdated test standards referred to in the existing DOE test procedure. For pool heaters, the amendments incorporate by reference Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) Standard 1160-2009, \u201cPerformance Rating of Heat Pump Pool Heaters,\u201d and ANSI/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 146-2011, \u201cMethod of Testing and Rating Pool Heaters,\u201d to establish a test method for electric pool heaters (including heat pump pool heaters). The amendments also clarify the test procedure's applicability to oil-fired pool heaters., 108718=This notice announces a petition from Williams Furnace Company (Williams) requesting that the Department of Energy (DOE) extend the compliance date for the direct home heating equipment and pool heaters test procedure final rule published on January 6, 2015 by 180 days, with respect to Williams. The compliance date for the direct home heating equipment and pool heaters test procedure final rule is July 6, 2015. Williams states in its petition that due to a clarification in the vented home heating equipment test procedure, this timeframe for compliance does not provide Williams sufficient time to conduct further testing and complete any required design modifications to meet the standard using the new test procedure. DOE seeks comment on Williams' petition to extend the compliance date, with respect to Williams, for the direct heating equipment test procedure by 180 days., 58241=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for room air conditioners (room ACs). According to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act's 6-year review requirement, DOE must publish by April 8, 2017 a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) to propose new standards for room ACs or a notice of determination that the existing standards do not need to be amended. This RFI seeks to solicit information from the public to help DOE determine whether amended standards for room ACs would result in a significant amount of additional energy savings and whether those standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. In addition, DOE has identified several issues associated with the currently applicable test procedure for room ACs on which DOE is particularly interested in receiving comment., 187565=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) which is proposing energy conservation standards for residential dishwashers. The comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the energy conservation standards for residential dishwasher products ended February 17, 2015. DOE is reopening the comment period for comments related to the analysis that estimates the potential economic impacts and energy savings that could result from an energy conservation standard for residential dishwashers. Comments will be accepted until March 25, 2015., 134152=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) withdraws a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2013 that proposed to establish a waiver process to allow the manufacture and sale of certain large-volume (>55 gallon) electric storage water heaters under 1-year waivers granted by DOE, provided that a specific set of features are included and conditions are met to ensure their use only in residences enrolled in utility electric thermal storage (ETS) programs., 63768=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including residential conventional ovens. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. DOE is proposing new and amended energy conservation standards for residential conventional ovens. DOE is also announcing a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results., 94346=On April 14, 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that proposes mathematical conversion factors for converting from the current efficiency metrics ( i.e., energy factor for residential water heaters, and thermal efficiency and standby loss for commercial water heaters) to the uniform efficiency descriptor ( i.e., uniform energy factor metric). The comment period for the NOPR pertaining to the test procedures for water heaters was scheduled to end May 14, 2015. After receiving a request for additional time to comment for stakeholders, DOE is reopening the comment period for the NOPR for the Conversion Factor for Test Procedures for Consumer and Certain Commercial Water Heaters to June 15, 2015. Additionally, at the request of stakeholders, DOE is announcing a public meeting to discuss the conversion factors for consumer and commercial water heaters., 117876=As required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to establish a mathematical conversion factor for the purpose of translating efficiency ratings for water heaters under the test method currently in effect to the ratings under the amended test method promulgated by DOE in a final rule published on July 11, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cthe July 2014 final rule\u201d). Compliance with the amended test procedure is required beginning on the later of: one year after the publication of a final rule that establishes a mathematical conversion factor, or December 31, 2015. This rulemaking document proposes a mathematical conversion factor which may be used to convert the existing efficiency ratings under the current Federal test procedure to efficiency ratings under the test procedure adopted in the July 2014 final rule for water heater basic models manufactured, tested and certified prior to the compliance date of the amended test procedure. The amended test procedure applies to all covered consumer water heaters and the covered commercial water heating equipment with residential applications defined in the July 2014 final rule as a \u201cresidential-duty commercial water heater.\u201d In addition, this document proposes amendments to the minimum energy conservation standards for consumer water heaters and residential-duty commercial water heaters to account for the impact of the new metric, but does not alter the stringency of the existing energy conservation standards. While DOE has not planned a public meeting to discuss this proposal, DOE is willing to consider a request to hold a meeting., 30915=\u00a7 2461 note - Mode of recovery, 183489=This document corrects the DATES section to a notice of proposed rulemaking and announcement of public meeting which published in the Federal Register on February 9, 2015, regarding Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy Conservation Standards for Hearth Products. The day of the week for the March 23, 2015 meeting is being corrected., 192383=The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published a preliminary technical support document (TSD) that analyzes the potential economic impacts and energy savings that could result from potential energy conservation standards for miscellaneous refrigeration products. DOE published this analysis so stakeholders can review the relevant outputs and the underlining assumptions and calculations. After receiving a request for additional time to comment on the TSD, the comment period for the TSD pertaining to the energy conservation standards for miscellaneous refrigeration products is reopened until March 2, 2015.}",
