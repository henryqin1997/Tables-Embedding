            "Cedar Rapids is a boring town, however, the Hotel at Kirkwood Center is very interesting. The restaurant is run by the students and is delicious and cheap.",
            "The Kirkwood Cafe is slightly overpriced and unhealthy, but provides good-tasting food when needed.",
            "Kirkwood is surprisingly challenging and have walked away from my classes with something applicable to my life.",
            "The first week of the first semester is the hardest. Use all of Kirkwood's resources, including the library and writing center.",
            "Kirkwood is a good transition from high school to college. There are many innovative instructors and resources to help you out. The student body is a little iffy, but the education definitely makes up for it."

Whether you are international, out of state, in state, Kirkwood is the place for you! You will have a fantastic time at Kirkwood, and you get to meet so many different types of people. Tips for prospective students Some good tips for prospective students would be to fill out as many scholarships as you can. College is not free, and you are going to want as much help as you possibly can. If you are going to live on campus, make sure you know how to cook, clean, and do your own laundry. If you do not know how to do any of those; learn now while your mom is still in the same household as you. Bang for the buck",
