(\"Bellatrix\" or the \"Company\") announces the results of an independent reserve evaluation effective December 31, 2012. The report was completed by Sproule Associates Limited (\"Sproule\").\u00a0 The evaluation encompasses 100% of Bellatrix's oil and gas properties and was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (\"NI 51-101\")., 38235=During the third quarter of 2012, Bellatrix closed on the disposition of a minor non-core property interest in the Wainwright area, Alberta for $4.25 million after adjustments.\u00a0 This non-operated unit heavy oil property had production of approximately 59 boe/d.

Readers are advised that these financial estimates are subject to audit and may be subject to change as a result, and such changes could be material., 46233=Bellatrix engaged Sproule to complete a reserve report in accordance with NI 51-101, on 100% of Bellatrix's oil and gas properties effective December 31, 2012.\u00a0 Sproule's review does not include the impact of Bellatrix's proposed Cardium Joint Venture announced subsequent to the effective date and currently estimated to close on or before April 30, 2013., 29784=SELECT 2012 OPERATING RESULTS, 207791=FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\u00a0 Statements in this document may contain forward-looking information including management's assessment of future plans and operations, expected 2013 average production and exit production, reserve estimates, anticipated additional drilling locations, the total future capital associated with development of drilling locations and reserves, 2013 capital expenditures and expected amount of total program including capital to be invested by the JV Partner, expected closing of joint venture transaction, timing of completion and testing of wells and timing of release of 2012 financial results.

Additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's operations and financial results are included in reports on file with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com), at the Company's website (www.bellatrixexploration.com.). Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained in this news release are made as at the date of this news release and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.\u00a0, 42341=Bellatrix generated funds flow from operations of $111.0 million ($1.03 per basic share and $0.96 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 18% from $94.2 million ($0.91 per basic share and $0.84 per diluted share) for the 2011 year.\u00a0 Bellatrix's cash flow from operating activities of $109.3 million ($1.02 per basic share and $0.95 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased approximately 11% from the $98.2 million ($0.95 per basic share and $0.87 per diluted share) generated in the 2011 year.\u00a0 The increase between the 2012 and 2011 years was principally due to higher net realized gains on the Company's commodity risk management contracts and higher funds from operating netbacks, despite significantly reduced commodity prices, offset partially by increased financing expenses and slightly higher general and administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011., 84873=The recycle ratio is a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of a company's re-investment program. The ratio measures the efficiency of capital investment. It accomplishes this by comparing the operating netback per BOE to that year's reserve FD&A cost per BOE. Since its conversion to a growth oriented exploration and production company, Bellatrix has successfully achieved a recycle ratio in excess of the 2.74 times recorded in 2009 for proved and probable reserves. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 the recycle ratio for proved and probable reserves was 5.02 times, 4.16 times and 4.31 times, respectively., 44536=By comparison, Bellatrix drilled or participated in 54 gross (34.84 net) wells during the year ended December 31, 2011, including 39 gross (29.04 net) oil wells, 14 gross (5.79 net) liquids-rich natural gas wells, and 1 gross (0.007 net) dry hole that was drilled in a non-operated oil unit., 21044=The Company replaced 702% of total production in 2012 with new proved and probable reserves at a finding, development and acquisition (\"FD&A\") cost of $4.28/boe, excluding future development capital (\"FDC\") requirements.\u00a0 Including FDC requirements, FD&A totaled $6.95/boe.\u00a0 Annual production was up 40% in 2012, to 6.11 million boe from 4.36 million boe., 175852=At year-end, 2012, Sproule had evaluated certain future development opportunities on Company lands including 161 gross (112.7 net) future undrilled Cardium horizontal locations and 56 gross (23.3 net) evaluated future undrilled Notikewin/Falher horizontal locations.\u00a0 Of the 161 Cardium locations, 104 were assigned proved and probable reserves, with 57 assigned probable reserves only.\u00a0 Of the 56 Notikewin/Falher locations, 41 were assigned proved and probable reserves, with the remaining 15 assigned probable reserves only., 44889=During fiscal 2012 the Company operated 24 net wells of the 28 net wells reported in the Cardium. The following average initial production (\"IP\") rates for the first 7 days (\"IP 7\"), for the first 15 days (\"IP15\") and the first 30 days (\"IP 30\") were achieved:, 29852=To assist in interpretation of the Company's reserves and key achievements, Bellatrix releases select 2012 operating results ahead of full year-end 2012 financial results including data on capital expenditures, cash flow from operating activities, and drilling results., 21722=As at December 31, 2012 proved plus probable reserves were comprised of 34.6 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids as well as 418 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with a 33% liquids weighting on a boe basis., 203358=Based on exit rate of December 2012 production volumes of approximately 19,500 boe/d annualized for 2013, Bellatrix has put in price protection on approximately 53% of 2013 production volumes, 27% for first and second quarter and 15% for third and fourth quarter 2014 production volumes., 204131=CONVERSION:\u00a0 The term barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf/bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\u00a0 All boe conversions in this report are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.}",
