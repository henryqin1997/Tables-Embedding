If all products sold in each store on each day, there would be 10\ufffd10\ufffd10=1000 fact table records. If each store sold any 5 of the 10 products each day, there would be 10\ufffd5\ufffd10=500 fact table records. The following table shows the scenario:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{156366=[0211] To get an address from the address file 10, the given index is first divided by 1024 to obtain the number of the section. Using this number, the bit vector is checked to see if the section has been initialized. If it has, a search to the location index\ufffd4 is performed and the value read, which is the address. If the section has not been initialized, a value is simply returned to indicate an invalid (or uninitialized) address., 158174=[0215] The size of the hash table is configurable. The optimal size is a function of how many master indexes will be stored; for example, 2000 entries works well in many cases. The hash values are computed by dividing the master index by a value that will yield as many hash values as the table can hold. The number of aggregates, which is also the largest possible master index, is given to the address file upon creation. Alternative hash functions which improve the scattering of entries when patterns are present in the used master synthetic index entries could clearly be used depending on the implementation., 151140=[0200] The indexing technique for this sample would generate 1320 indexes regardless of how many occurrences actually existed. The implication of this for optimal performance is that the relation list 18 provided should not contain detail keys that will never occur, so that levels will not have superfluous aggregates associated therewith., 157041=[0213] To store an address the index is first divided by 1024 to get the section number. The section number in the bit vector is then used to check if the section has been initialized. If it has, the memory location index\ufffd4 is located and the address is assigned there. If it hasn't, the entire section is initialized with invalid address values and the given address is assigned to the location index\ufffd4 when that location is reached. The bit in the bit vector is then marked to indicate that the section has been initialized.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by [0254] While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. [0253] The description of the overall operations in the previous section does not have any implications on the object containment hierarchy discussed above. [0252] Finally, the index table 6, relation table 2, rolling cache 8, and the address and aggregate files 10, 12 could each be independent objects which could all communicate through a global mediator. The disadvantage is that the communication among all the objects is unnecessarily exposed, particularly as it is not required for each object to communicate with all the other objects. [0251] Another alternative is to have a system object as a mediator between the index table object and rolling cache as shown in FIG. 15. [0250] Note that the lifetime of each of the lower level objects is shorter or the same as parent. Also, the information flow is always from top to bottom or from bottom to top in the hierarchy. This configuration has been found so far to be optimal.",
