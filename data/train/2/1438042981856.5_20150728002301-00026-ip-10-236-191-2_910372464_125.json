They offer many different styles of cafeterias such as, an all vegan hall, a Cajun hall, a general foods hall, and many others. We have many places to eat on campus and some high dollar places like Starbucks., 58465=As I am in pursuit of my B.A.A.S. degree, UNT has excellent programs that accept my credits earned at a Technical College. I am looking forward to attending in the Fall of 2009. Everyone I have met at the campus is friendly and very helpful., 867393=February is a spring month, why is there snow? My class wasn't uphill when I was on time last Monday... HOW IS IT FINALS ALREADY????, 380469=I have attended UNT since Spring 2012 including Summer after having transferred from a junior college. I attend evening classes and had been working fulltime until now. As a result I am not very involved with lot's of campus activities, my review may be limited in some aspects., 383158=There are so many things on campus to do for fun, but the Union at the 1 o'clock lounge is the place to be on campus., 755652=A variety to choose from. There is cajun cafeterias, vegan cafeterias, as well as the standard ones., 214768=unt might not have the same prestige as smu, but it is still very nice, and certainly much cheaper. expect to pay about $1300 per 4 hour class (including fees, texts, etc.). financial aid seems kind of lacking, but the fa office claims it is temporarily short on funding., 408856=UNT is the best decision I have every made! I will be graduating this December with a Bachelors in Psychology and Minor in Spanish. Its diverse, comfortable, and its a awesome school!, 449420=I do not know yet. I will start in August., 51814=well lit, unt shuttle buses run all over campus and town until like 10:30, and emergency stations are numerous., 873635=Every April there is a 12 hour concert in one of the dorms (Bruce Hall) called Bruce Jam. This concert is open to everyone and features student bands. Bruce Hall also host a haunted house every October/, 938232=If you look around, there is usually something to do every day. I'm more of a hermit and keep to my room, but I hear about a lot of different things. Andy Grammar even did a concert here the other week! Most things are free too!, 1149997=UNT is great on traditions like the Mean Green Victory march after winning football games., our Alma Mater chant at Football games. Fraternity Bid Day marches around campus in the Fall and Spring. The campus bell that rings a nice little tune every hour on the hour. And certainly the unforgettable Eagle CAWH that anyone can throw up at a given time to show school spirit., 22038=Make sure you like where you will be living first and if you need a job apply in June or July. If you don't like noise don't stay in a dorm. Best freshmen halls for walking to class are Kerr and Maple as they have food for first thing in the morning and bus stops right in front of them. Also DON'T DO MORNING CLASSES!!! It's not like high school 8am because at least there you can go to bed before oh say... midnight?}",

Because the Visual Arts program is extremely well known and growing, there are alot of artsy people. I think this school is perfect for those who may want to spend a few semesters close to home before they go further away to a different school, but definitely is worth spending all four years at as well. Tips for prospective students When coming to the University of North Texas, make sure you become a part of one of the hundreds of organizations the University has to offer. It really is helpful when it comes to meeting new people with similar interests. And also, as a first year or even second year student, having a meal plan is an excellent choice. It gives you the ability to meet others and be social, and its fairly",
