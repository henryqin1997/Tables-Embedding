    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38260=Veterans Weekend Tournament 2009 was not the exciting, enjoyable, competitive tournament we have grown accustomed to. Other than the host Tampa Bay Grasshoppers (TBG) the other clubs in attendance all showed up short of players. Present were Gray Dogs, Florida State University (FSU), Central Florida Field Hockey Association (CFFHA), for the mixed division, and University of South Florida (USF) for the all ladies division. Unfortunately Surf could not make it, and UM dropped out at the last minute, and Miami FHC could not make it. So Saturdays schedule ran 90% without a glitch. The glitch appeared in the form of CFFHA not completing their three game commitments, as half their players had to leave due to prior commitments. That really knocked the wind out of the organizing committee. However a friendly game was played in its place. On Sunday it became a hockey festival rather than a tournament. The net result being all who played enjoyed themselves to the fullest, as there were lots to eat and drink. The positives to take away with you were the first appearance of USF club team in a tournament. USF played creditably well even winning against FSU. Great for a first appearance. TBG setting standards of running a tournament, having two mixed teams for the mixed division (TBGEast & TGBWest) and two teams for the ladies division (TBGNorth & TBGSouth). A lot of hard work done by the organizing committee, great job well done. 2009 showed a disappointing year for tournaments. Although TBG kicked off the 2009 Florida Field Hockey 7X7 League in March, all clubs were not represented. Following that in April Gray Dogs tournament failed due to lack of support from our Florida based clubs. In May Surf held their memorial weekend tournament and it ran successful, but once more all clubs were not represented. In July in Orlando Central Florida Field Hockey Association tournament also failed due to lack of support. The difficulty is finding out from the current crop of players what will they support as far as tournaments or league goes! What will they commit to! Hopefully I\u2018ll get the right answers so we can move forward to a successful 2010. Thanks to the teams that participated. See you in 2010., 72637=At the end of the finals there was an after game get together where everyone in attendance were treated to some tasty Trini dish of Pelau put together by Chef Nigel Lobo. Anyone interested in the recipe can email Nigel at nlobo[at]worldnet.att.net. Irish Soda bread supplied by our one and only Irish member Susan Mulvey. Food and drinks were present and everyone had an enjoyable afternoon. The food and drinks was followed by the Awards Ceremony. Although Invited Guess Mr. Robert Carpenter was unable to attend, master of ceremonies proceeded with the program. Winners of the Six-a-side League went to TB-North, with TB-South as the runner up. Surprise awards went out to the youths of Tampa Bay Grasshoppers. In attendance to receive their award for outstanding performance for the year 2007 were the Grasshoppers bright hopefuls Lindsey Nerbonne and Thalia Chance-Chin. These are two very promising young ladies that are expected to reach great heights in this sport. Absent was our Durham sisters who have a lot of skill that the coaches would like to bring out but need their commitment. Also absent was the up and promising goal keeper Joshua Torres. This is a talented goal keeper and wonderful young gentleman. These five youngsters bring a lot of hope to the Grasshoppers who are hoping to expand on these acquisitions. In recognition for the number of year\u2019s service and dedication to the sport of Field Hockey in the Tampa and Clearwater areas the following were awarded:, 37296=July 3rd tournament was an enjoyable one. To see how this United Nations hockey team came together through the love for the game of field hockey was just wonderful and enjoyable. Sorry that more of our members were not available to join us to make it even more successful and enjoyable an event. Many thanks to all who attended and contributed to this event. A special thanks to those who volunteered to umpire and to Adeel for his tremendous marking of the field. Competition was keen with Tampa Bay Blue leading at the end of the first round, followed by Tampa Bay White who was ahead of Tampa Bay Red. Our annual Ladies versus Gents saw the men barely edging out the ladies. Indeed a fun filled day., 76113=On the weekend of November 10th and 11th 2007 in Clearwater Florida, Tampa Bay Grasshoppers hosted their third annual Veterans Weekend field hockey tournament. Defending champions Gray Dogs were taken to sudden death penalty flicks to out flick their Miami counter parts Miami Surf 3 \u2013 1., 58022=The Florida Field Hockey Association (FFHA) took a massive step in the right direction this past weekend as they fielded no fewer than three teams in the 2008 Atlanta Cup. Florida United (MEN\u2019S DIVISION) and Tampa Bay Grasshoppers (WOMEN\u2019S DIVISION) joined the well traveled Miami Flamingos at the annual event, with the Sunshine State-based teams making up 20% of the weekend\u2019s competion (a great showing by all accounts). All teams put forth great efforts and represented Florida with pride. The women\u2019s division boasted no fewer than nine teams traveling from all across the States and Bermuda. Tournament newcomers, Tampa Bay Grasshoppers, had a very tough draw facing the LUCKY DRAGONS (2007 Winners, 2006 Runners-Up), CHICAGO FHC (2006 Winners), VINTAGE ATLANTA and the ATLANTA MAJESTICKS (2005 & 2003 Runners-Up). Having put forth great efforts they finally got their reward against Vintage Atlanta. After large spells of sustained pressure the Grasshoppers were unlucky not to take all three points. It was the homeside that held on as the Lady Grasshoppers secured the first point in their team\u2019s short history. Read more at www.gfha.org., 61821=2008 Winter Results. On Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s weekend, Tampa Bay held its Six-a-side Tournament at Phillip Jones Park. Victorious was The Central Florida Field Hockey Association of Orlando lead by Samuel Jason Roberts. A great effort from CFFHA as they rose to the occasion defeating Tampa Bay ???? in a close final. Congratulations to Sammy and his Orlando members., 32306=Once more many thanks to all our members who journeyed to Atlanta for a good tournament. Our men representing Florida first team included Warren, Ravi, Phillip and Chris. These four gentlemen gave 110% as they worked extremely hard to try and bring the trophy to Florida. Indeed a pleasure to see both Phillip and Christ amongst the goal scorers. Ravi's hard work in the middle was quite fluent as his team mates looked to him quite often thus giving him the ball as often as they can. Unfortunately when it got to the finals all the above was forgotten and lack on leadership on the field cost them the trophy. Warren eventually got into his stride and played some magnificent hockey on the right flank. It was a pleasure to look at these four playing at that level. Florida second team was built around Charlie, Adeel. Rob, Adam and Thomas. Unfortunately this team never played together prior to Atlanta, and it showed by their inability to know what each other is capable of doing. Also the Cubans do not speak English nor do we speak Spanish. So it took some time to settle down. Yes they lost the first two games on Saturday but they were not blown out as they kept themselves competitive, and they were in the game to the end. Sunday morning was a sure disappointment. Tampa members were ready to play the first game which was schedule to begin at 8.30.am. Unfortunately the Miami members were not present. We were playing against Bermuda Polecats the eventual tournament winners. They game began promptly and we started with seven players Manny Morales and Sammy Roberts being the other two members. Bermuda scored twice before half time as our southern team mates arrived just before half time. At the resumption of the game Florida #2 scored and began to press as we were now a full team. We played gallantly but couldn't find the equalizer. Thus we lost a tough one 2 to 1. Another tremendous effort by all. Thomas and Rob up front, with Adam and Adeel in the midfield. And Charlie in the defense. Then to our ladies who almost gave me a heart attack. Our first game at 8.30 on Saturday morning was up against Miami. Our Argentinean neighbours. Our history showed we have never beaten them. BUT our Lady Grasshoppers went unto the field and elevated their game. I have never seen us play at that level for an entire game. We hustled, played team defense and kept them at bay. Half time came and the score remained goalless. We actually held Miami to no goals in a half. We took the field for the second half and our senior forward Tammi connected with a shot to goal to put us one up. Sure upsetting for our Miami neighbours. We had even exchange of play for the second half. Susan came up big on some penalty corners as she blocked them all. With a minute and a half left in the game a mistake in our defense allowed Miami to score to tie the game. Yes we should have won as we played extremely well. Disappointment came when our ladies allowed weaker opposition to lower our level of play. This cost us the two games against the Atlanta based teams. With the round completed we ended up with a win against last years winners Team Philly, who were without half their team, a draw and two in the lost column. This put us in fourth position. The luck of the draw has the highest ranked team Miami versus the fourth ranked team. Yes we were up against Miami again. Like the opening game we played well and forced a couple of short corners without success. The half ended goalless once more. The second half both teams went at each other and we were playing the better game as Miami began to tire. With about five minutes left the thought of sudden death penalty strokes entered my mind. Who are the confident ones are the questions. Yes we have Nicole and Sharla and others. BUT WHO is that confident to go up first as it is sudden death. While that thought hanged in my head it came down to two minutes left, and we were still giving Miami a run for their life. We made a basic mistake and Miami won the ball and little Stephanie put it past Susan... We played exceptionally well. I was quite proud as to how well we played. How together the team was. It was indeed a pleasure to be a part of this 2010 history of Tampa Bay getting into the semi finals for the first time. I do hope it will continue to foster itself into something great. Many thanks from our Ohio teammates in Melinda Curran and Shari Matkin. Unfortunately Lynda Carey was forced out due to illness. Lynda I hope you have recovered. We look forward to seeing you here in Tampa on November 6th & 7th. Last but not least thank you Adam for flying in to be a part of the Grasshoppers. Once more many thanks to all for a great weekend in Atlanta, including those who worked feverishly, 74904=Then our mother of two, when she first came out she was just a newly wed. After a second honeymoon in West Palm Beach as a member of Tampa Bay Grasshoppers at the USFHA Hockey Festival 2004 she scored some tremendous goals both on and off the field. That began the new chapter in her life of motherhood our one and only Tammi Dial., 50609=On the weekend of November 8th and 9th 2008 at Glen Oaks Park in Clearwater Florida, Tampa Bay Grasshoppers hosted their fifth Annual Veterans Weekend field hockey tournament. Defending champions Gray Dogs were taken to sudden death penalty flicks to out flick this time the host Tampa Bay Grasshoppers East after a one all tie at the end of regulation. At the end of the round robin host team Tampa Bay Grasshoppers East was in first place having finished unbeaten, drawing with Miami Surf 1 - 1, defeating Florida State University 3 - 0, University of Miami 1 - 0, and defeating Gray Dogs 2-1. In second place were Gray Dogs and Miami Surf ended in third place in Pool - A. While in Pool - B University of Miami finished first ahead of Tampa Bay Grasshoppers West followed by Florida State University. In the first semi finals host Tampa Bay Grasshoppers East came up against first Timers University of Miami. After trying to feel each other out in the first half, TBGE ended the first half three goals to one. After the interval TBGE moved the ball around much better and were later rewarded with two more goals with out reply, thus qualifying by a 5 - 1 margin.. . In the second semi-finals Miami Surf came out strong and very determined to get to the finals. But a very aggressive Gray Dogs had other ideas. The first half was even and ended in a one all tie. In the second half Gray Dogs turned up their intensity and aggression and went ahead three to one before Miami Surf began pressing back. They were rewarded with a goal from Jelle to come with in one with time running out and the game became rough and patience was running low Miami Surf allowed the umpiring to take them out of their game. Even though they had the greater opportunities they failed to score from the field of play, Jelle called his team off before the short corner was taken, thus leaving Gray Dogs to face Tampa Bay Grasshoppers East in the finals... Congratulations to Charles Sang, Michael Serrette and the Gray Dogs. A special THANKS to all those who umpired under some unwarranted abuse by the players. Umpires you must remember that the game is not a game unless there are umpires. Without the umpires it is only a scrimmage. Some of the bright spots of the tournament were: - Gray Dogs midfielder Wesley who won the MVP of the tournament with his relentless energy at both ends of the field.Tampa Bay Grasshoppers paid homage to their one and only member from Paraguay Christian Magrini who is returning to Paraguay to help develop the sport of field hockey. He was presented with a plaque and $100. gift. We will miss his strong play in the defense, his team spirit and his enthusiasm for the game. Tampa Bays ability to organize and run a tournament. once more looks quite promising. Though disappointment struck again when minute cancellation of Central Florida Field Hockey Association last. This makes it twice in two years. A SPECIAL THANKS also goes out to all the Grasshoppers for their effort in supplying food and drinks for all in attendance and their marvelous way of cleaning up after the event. Injured players Jasmine, Jermin and Roxanne thanks for coming out and contributing. Mike Hawkins and Renee Cropper on the technical table. The Friday morning team of Adam, Mike and Chris under Roxanne's directions helped tremendously in marking the field. On the whole a good job well done. Finally we like to take this opportunity to thank Devon of FSU and Josefina at UM for their hard work in getting their respective teams to their very first tournament in Tampa. We do appreciate it and we look forward to seeing you in the spring of 2009. Field Hockey is growing in Florida. We can now identify nine teams in the state and we are looking for the first event of Florida Field Hockey Association League... Congratulations to all., 79038=TB Veterans Weekend Tournament Standings At the end of play Sunday 11th November 2007:, 61076=The results of 2008 Spring tournament saw Miami Surf win both the Saturday Six-a-side tournament and the Sunday Eleven-a-side Tournaments. Credit the Surf for playing consistently at a high level and demonstrating a high level of discipline both on and off the field. Both Saturday and Sunday tournaments were conducted under a Round Robin format. Congratulations to Degsy on creating such a club and to all the members who represented them in Degsy\u2019s absence. A special congratulations goes out to Nico for leading the Miami Surf in this tournament., 23931=Tampa Bay Grasshoppers hosted its Seventh Annual Fall Tournament this past weekend. On a rather cold Saturday morning by Florida standards, the first game was played in fifty degree Fahrenheit. New comers USF was up against Miami International, Atlanta Cup Ladies Champions of last month. Miami had some difficulty beating the younger and faster USF students but prevailed by a one nothing margin. Then USF were up against Tampa Bay Ladies team. The experience Tampa Bay Ladies won comfortably by a two to nothing margin. Finally the clash between the Argentineans of Miami and Tampa Bay Ladies. A close game through out but the Miami ladies were better goal scorers and won by a two to nothing margin. Then the Mixed division began with Mia Cuba first team (MIC#1) beating Miami Surf second team (MSO) by a five to two margin. The rolls changed in the next game as Miami Surf first team (MSW) easily defeated Mia Cuba second team (MIC#2) by a seven to one margin. Then came the young and improving Ft Lauderhill Strikers up against Tampa Bay first team (TBGE). A very fast and aggressive game which resulted in a one to nothing win for the Strikers. Tampa Bay lost its captain Ravi as he got hit on the knee during a short corner attempt by Strikers. The next game saw Tampa Bay second team (TBGW) up against Mia Cuba first team. Mia Cuba continued on their victorious way by easily winning by a six to two margin. Then followed the Miami Surf first team (MSW) challenging Tampa Bay first team (TBGE). Another good game by both teams ending in a three to two victory for Miami Surf. (MSW). The final game for Saturday saw Mia Cuba second team (MIC#2) opposing Tampa Bay second team (TBGW). Tampa Bay woke up and out played Mia Cuba to a five to three margin. With three unbeaten teams in the Mixed division and one unbeaten Ladies team everyone headed to the Best Western Hotel where Tampa Bay was hosting their first Tournament social gathering for the visiting teams. Indeed a pleasure to see the presence of the visiting teams in the room with such glowing smiles of having an enjoyable time. Many thanks to the committee of Laura Roxanne and Phillip for making it happen... Sunday's temperature was the same but less windy so it was comfortable to be on the field. A disappointing start for Sunday as USF did not field a team to complete their schedule. How ever the teams were anxious to compete and we saw some great games. Miami International defeated Tampa Bay Ladies to become the 2010 Fall Ladies Champions. Mara Grossi was unopposed as the MVP of the Ladies Division. The Mixed Division had some key games that day to decide the final ranking of the teams. Miami Surf first team (MSW) completed the first round with a three win, one draw from four games amassing a total of 10 points closely followed by Miami Surf second team (MSO) with three wins and one lost with nine points. Strikers were next with seven points from four games with a two wins, one draw and one lost game to earn seven points. The toss up for the fourth position saw both Mia Cuba first team (MIC#1) and Tampa Bay first team (TBGE) tied with the six points. Tampa Bay had a better goal average and thus qualified to meet Miami Surf first team (MSW) in the first semi final. Another close game like their first encounter and similar results as MSW won by a two to one margin. In the other semi final Miami Surf second team (MSO) was up against Ft. Lauderhill Strikers. In this semi final MSO was no match for the hungry Strikers as they won by a four to nothing margin. This set up a show down between Strikers and MSW as they drew goalless in their earlier encounter. With umpires Christine Hutchinson and Clement Scantlebury in control the game began at a fast and aggressive speed. In the fourth minute of play Peter Thompson deflected a pass past kicking back Romain Lindo (Robo) to go one up. Eight minutes later Strikers got the equalizer as the fast pace and aggressive play continued. In the eighteenth minute Strikers captain Leon Kerr was given a yellow card. A minute later MSW went ahead with a goal from Nico. Half time came with the score at two to one in favour of MSW. With the resumption of play the level of play continued and within six minutes of the start of play with captain Leon Kerr back on the field Strikers got the equalizer. As Wesley found the nets. Entertaining play continued and in the thirty fifth minute Strikers went ahead as Captain Leon Kerr scored from a penalty corner. Miami Surf fought back and got the tying goal three minutes later off of Rafa De Groot. The game ended in a three all tie. Penalty strokes was the next step and without little ado Ft. Lauderhill Strikers emerge victorious scoring three of four penalty flicks as Miami Surf failed to convert on their turn. MVP of the Mixed Division was Romain Lindo better known as Robo. Many thanks to all participating clubs. A huge THANK YOU TO CHAKA BAINBRIDGE, CHRISINE HUTCHISON and CLEMENT SCANTLEBURY our officiating crew. A good tournament and an enjoyable one for all who attended. LADIES, 62400=2007 End of Season came to an exciting end as TB-North defeated TB-South 3 \u2013 2 in a close Final. The Six-a-side competition which was implemented to keep the momentum of the newly acquired membership moving forward with a competitive spirit and team camaraderie concluded on a high note. The teams as they were selected were:, 21529=Atlanta 2011 saw the largest contingent of hockey players representing Tampa Bay Grasshoppers, as we had thirty two players entered for this tournament. Last year our ladies team lost the semifinal game by a two to one margin to the eventual winners Miami International. This year we were excited at the possibility of returning to the semifinal. Unfortunately we did not make it out of the division as we failed to get amongst the winners. Indeed a huge disappointment. We didn't play up to the level we played at last year. Personally I felt the team was not committed as they were the previous year. The ladies were never out in full numbers in preparation for the tournament. Other distractions presented itself as certain members wanted to concentrate on special set plays rather than the overall game. Hopefully they learnt their lesson. However they enjoyed themselves tremendously on Saturday evening at the banquet. The Grasshoppers are known for their great display of \"How to enjoy oneself at a party\". The dance floor was never empty. The men's team lost their first game to the host team as we failed to score from numerous short corners while Atlanta scored on their two opportunities. Their second game against Miami Surf saw us play the best hockey of the tournament for the first twenty minutes. Once again we failed to convert on our penalty corners and ended up losing this game also. Their next two games they won comfortably but it was too little to late as we lost on goal average from making it into the semi final. Hopefully we know now what we have to work on prior to tournaments. A good time had by everyone. Better results next time. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail., 82708=www.tbfieldhockey.com and the tbfieldhockey logo \u00a92004 developed by: Anubanu - All Rights Reserved}",

Visiting Tampa from Miami were Miami Surf ladies and men's team, Florida International Men's team , and the young and well coached Aventuras ladies team. Both Tampa Bay ladies and Tampa Bay men got off to good starts by winning their opening games. But that was the signal for the younger teams to exploit the older teams as both Aventuras and Surf men displayed a very high level of hockey and fitness that helped propel Surf to an unbeaten six game streak. The young Aventuras defeated the older Surf Ladies team in all three rounds but suffered twice to the older Tampa Bay Ladies who in turn lost all three of their round games to Surf ladies. Aventura Ladies ended as the Ladies Champions winning four of their six games. Surf men were the victorious Men's Champion, On the whole a very clean and enjoyable tournament.
