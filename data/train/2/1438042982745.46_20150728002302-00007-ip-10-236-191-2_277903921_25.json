Relative average speed on the 10,000 operations' tests. This article presents results of Delphi client/server database speed tests of the different database operations with 1,000 and 10,000 records. It compares the latest available versions of Accuracer (v.5.30), DBISAM (v.4.29), ElevateDB (v.2.03), TurboDB (v.5.0.20) and NexusDB (v.3.04). All measurements for 1,000 operations are presented in the Table1 and for 10,000 are in the Table2. You can see that Accuracer Database System is the fastest database in any task. Test passing time for the different operations (Insert, Read, RecNo, Edit, Delete) with 10,000 records of the tested databases is shown on the Diagram 2. This diagram visually presents what product is faster (less value is better) on different operations and how much than others.",
