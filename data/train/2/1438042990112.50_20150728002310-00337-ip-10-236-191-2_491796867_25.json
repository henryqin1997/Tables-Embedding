    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20093=In fall 1999, six UHCC campuses offered adult basic education in English and mathematics resulting in approximately 3,000 class registrations. This is roughly double the 1997 volume of registrations and is another dimension of the University\u0092s commitment to access., 92844=During 1999\u00962000, the Board of Regents approved four new academic programs, moved seven programs from provisional to established status, and terminated six academic programs. The Board approved consolidation of eleven departments into six and consolidation of two departments into a new school. The administration approved eight new certificates within existing programs and authorized planning for three new programs. Five academic programs underwent name and/or structure changes, admissions to three were suspended, and 100 others underwent routine review., 56575=Of the 29 UH Hilo students who took the Principles of Learning and Teaching Exam in 1999\u00962000, 86 percent passed on their first attempt., 33800=The percentage of graduating seniors who planned to advance their higher education on the mainland decreased in 1999., 97590=The University of Hawai\u0091i has been awarded a high-performance connectivity grant by the National Science Foundation to connect Hawai\u0091i to the Next Generation Internet and Internet2 national and international networks. The high performance network links that this 1999 grant makes possible will allow researchers and research facilities to accomplish work that has not been possible up to now. These networks highlight ways in which the University of Hawai\u0091i provides critical service to the entire state. They represent an imaginative solution that will open up a world of opportunities for the University and state., 101574=In response to the need for special education teachers, an additional 65 to 100 students per year from the University of Hawai\u0091i will be eligible for an initial teaching license in Special Education. Sixty-nine students completed the program in 1999 and an additional 84 are expected to graduate in 2000., 81195=In 1998, UH M\u0101noa moved up ten spots and is ranked 54th among the top 100 research universities in the nation in federal expenditures for research and development. Among public institutions, UHM ranked 31st. UHM outranked top universities, including Princeton, Michigan State, and Georgetown., 64686=Source: Spring 1999 UHCC Survey of Former Students, 14706=In fall 1999, the University of Hawai\u0091i delivered 524, or 34 percent more, distance learning classes than two years earlier. These classes accounted for over 5,000 registrations in a variety of disciplines, including 39 graduate, bachelor, associate, and certificate programs., 116058=The Office of Technology Transfer and Economic Development serves as a gateway for access to the University\u0092s rich educational, scientific, and technical resources and facilities and facilitates technology transfer and economic development activities. The technology transfer process begins with the disclosure of discoveries and inventions by University researchers. The number of disclosures\u0097which have steadily increased since 1996 and more than doubled over the past two years\u0097bears a direct relationship to the number of patents filed, licenses executed, and spin-off companies created, all of which support economic development. These disclosures have resulted in 231 patents or patent applications filed by the University, 20 active license agreements or options for future licenses, and $1.7 million in gross licensing revenues (cumulative)., 119974=UH West O\u0091ahu is fully accredited by WASC as is UH Hilo. UHWO is preparing its self-study for a WASC visit in spring 2002., 18038=As called for in the UH Strategic Plan, an extensive review of distance learning was completed in 1997-98. This review resulted in a comprehensive plan and policy base and University system-wide coordination of distance learning policy and planning activities., 119474=In 1999, the University of Hawai\u0091i at M\u0101noa\u0092s accreditation was fully reaffirmed by WASC. The WASC commission indicated that the M\u0101noa campus excels in several areas, including the dedication of faculty and staff, efforts to strengthen the undergraduate curriculum, an increase in research generated by the faculty, and a highly enviable 11 to 1 student\u0096faculty ratio\u0097rare among nationally ranked Carnegie Research universities. The commission will conduct a follow-up visit in three years., 81636=The University of Hawai\u0091i has again received record support for research and training. Extramural funds\u0097grants and contracts from federal, private, foreign and other outside sources\u0097reached $181 million for 1999\u00962000, a 10 percent increase over the previous fiscal year and the second year in a row the University has set a new record for total extramural funds., 14552=The number of distance learning classes being delivered to students throughout the state and region has increased significantly since fall 1997., 34775=Five years after graduation, significant numbers (41%) of UH M\u0101noa alumni have completed further higher education, and nearly 60 percent of those completing advanced studies did so at UH M\u0101noa. Since 1994, there has been a steady decline in the share completing advanced studies at M\u0101noa and an increase in those doing so elsewhere., 36262=After five years, 28 percent of UH M\u0101noa alumni are still pursuing higher education and over 40 percent of these are studying at UH M\u0101noa. Between 1994 and 2000 there has been a steady decline in the share pursuing advanced studies at UHM and an increase in those doing so elsewhere., 41746=The UH transfer and articulation policy was updated in 1998 to reinforce the University\u0092s commitment to pursue and refine the procedures specified in the policy so that all aspects of transfer are made easier, simple, and predictable, and allow students to plan their course of study without unexpected changes., 33689=Fifty percent of the spring 1999 UHM graduating seniors planned to attend graduate programs at M\u0101noa., 88762=This is a strong improvement over 1996\u009697 when the library dropped to 78th after budget cuts reduced its staff and virtually eliminated its book fund. Improvements can be seen best in the recovery of annual acquisitions\u0097from 31,000 to 74,000 volumes\u0097and construction of the Hamilton Library Addition, which is scheduled for completion in late 2000., 80989=One of the goals in the UH M\u0101noa Strategic Plan is to rank by year 2007 among the top 50 public universities in research and training funds awarded. The UH may reach this target ahead of schedule., 77698=Lower division average class size has decreased slightly since fall 1995., 83530=Among the top 50 universities, the UH Ocean Sciences program ranks 6th in the nation in competitive federal grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF). UH is among the top ten nationally in Astronomy and 15th in Earth Sciences. In FY 1999, UH ranked 19th nationally in NSF funding in Atmospheric Sciences., 110232=The University of Hawai\u0091i system and its participants represent a major economic force in Hawai\u0091i. For the 1999 fiscal year:, 78506=Likewise, upper division average class size has decreased since fall 1995., 86759=Other nationally ranked programs include Botany and Architecture, ranked 30th and 31st respectively by the Gourman Report on Undergraduate Programs. Ecology, Evolution and Behavior was ranked 22nd by the Ecological Society of America in 1999., 42351=Since June 1998, UH West O\u0091ahu and selected UH Community Colleges articulated and reached agreement on the transfer of several programs and courses. Students completing the articulated associate degree program are assured of transfer, acceptance, and applicability of all credits toward the aligned bachelor degree program at UH West O\u0091ahu. Articulated programs include Administration of Justice, Office Administration & Technology, Business Careers, Accounting, Hospitality Education, Paralegal, and Television Production., 58731=At UHH, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) Major Field of Achievement Test provides national comparisons and serves as a vehicle for program improvement. UHH Computer Science Department students usually perform at or above the national norm. Students taking the test in spring 1999 achieved a mean score of 162, placing UHH in the 94th percentile of the 131 institutions making up the national norm., 56721=Residents in the Integrated Orthopaedic Residency Training Program of the John A. Burns School of Medicine consistently score well on the In-Training Exam, which is administered to orthopaedic residents across the country to promote study and discussion and to help them prepare for their board exams. A score in the 90th percentile is considered excellent. UH graduates scored 99 in 1999, 99 in 1998, and 95 the previous year., 69580=A vast majority (91%) of UHM baccalaureate alumni were Satisfied or Very Satisfied with their academic preparation. UHM Alumni Outcomes Survey findings for 1989, 1991, 1994, and 1997 were similar.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Post-baccalaureate (69%) 4-year (77%) 2-year (98%) Acceptance rates demonstrate that there is a place within the UH system for students who prepare themselves for postsecondary education. What are the chances of a Hawai\u0091i resident being admitted to the University of Hawai\u0091i system? The going rate of recent Hawai\u0091i high school graduates into University of Hawai\u0091i campuses has held steady for three years at about 36 percent. Rapid enrollment growth in the post-war era has been followed by an extended period of stable to mildly declining enrollment. Expanded access has helped the UH system post modest overall gains since the early 1970\u0092s. What is the status of access to the University of Hawai\u0091i for recent Hawai\u0091i high school graduates? ACCESS AND ENROLLMENT The University of Hawai\u0091i system provides the people of Hawai\u0091i access to quality postsecondary education. Sustaining and enriching educational experiences, advancing excellence in undergraduate education, and integrating scholarship across the undergraduate, graduate, and research components are fundamental University goals. These goals are inseparable from the goal of supporting the economic development of the state. The University of Hawai\u0091i is the state\u0092s most important \u0093high-tech industry.\u0094 The education and training of a highly skilled workforce, the provision of specialized expertise and service, and the continued development of world-class research programs fuel the economic engine that powers Hawai\u0091i\u0092s economy.
