    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{50797=For simplicity, FIG. 2A shows an embodiment of a graphics subsystem that includes only one processor (e.g., color shading processor 214). Generally, each processor includes at least one digital differential analyzer (DDA) that performs the bulk of the mathematical computations required to render a primitive. Graphics subsystems typically include a number of processors, and the processors can be arranged in various configurations. An example of a more complex graphics subsystem is described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,854. Another graphics subsystem is described in the attached Exhibit A. A class of graphics processors, referred to as the GLINT processors, is described by Baldwin D. et al. in \u201cGLINT 300SX Programmer's Reference Manual\u201d, 3Dlabs Inc., 1993 and 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference. These various embodiments of graphics subsystems are within the scope of the invention., 35515=To display the graphical objects, the high-level description is transformed into a low-level description suitable for display on, for example, a CRT. This transformation process is generally referred to as \u201crendering.\u201d The rendering process typically includes the decomposition of a high-level entity (or a graphical object) into a set of graphical primitives (e.g., lines and triangles) for further processing. Each primitive is decomposed into a series of fragments, with each fragment being a part of a primitive. Each fragment is further decomposed into a set of picture elements (or pixels) that can be displayed on the CRT. A fragment may, however, cover only part of a pixel. A more detailed description of the rendering process is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,854 entitled \u201cGRAPHICS SUBSYSTEM WITH COARSE SUBPIXEL CORRECTION\u201d, issued Jan. 14, 1997 (hereinafter, the '854 patent), and incorporated herein by reference. The rendering process is also described below.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of specific embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. For example, the DDA of the invention can be implemented within an integrated circuit. The integrated circuit can be incorporated within a circuit card that is then installed on a computer. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein, and as defined by the following claims. Conclusion These various patents are incorporated herein by reference. 6. Printing mechanism of the pattern generation apparatus, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,533,170 issued to Teitzer, et al. 5. Accelerates and decelerates a stepping motor, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,805,138 issued to Hilker. 4. A spiral sweep generator for a rectangular Cartesian coordinate PPI display in a sonar system, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,751,712 issued to Murray. 3. A digital signal processor optimized for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,283 issued to Smith. 2. Numerical control of machine",
