    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3075=The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) is an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. We have been asked by Congress to conduct a study of the education programs funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) to evaluate how these funds were used at the local level and how they impacted education programs and district budgets. The Recovery Act was enacted in response to a serious economic crisis and it seeks to promote economic recovery, make investments, and to minimize and avoid reductions in state and local government services. As part of this study, we are conducting this survey of school district superintendents across the country whose districts have received Recovery Act funding for 3 education programs - Title I, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF), to learn how these funds are being used. Our questionnaire asks about your district's use of the funding, your district's fiscal outlook, and how the level of service and education reform in your local educational agency (LEA) will continue when the funding ends. Your participation in this survey will help us inform the Congress about the impact of this legislation on school districts across the country. One of the analysts on our team would be glad to call you back if you want more information. If, in order to answer any question in this questionnaire, you need to confer with other individuals in your office or department to obtain the requested information, please feel free to do so. To determine if consultation is needed, it may be helpful to preview all questions before completing the questionnaire. We understand that there are many demands on your time. However, your participation is essential for us to provide nation-wide information to Congress about how Recovery Act funds are affecting educational reform efforts. In addition, your responses will help identify any problems that localities may have in understanding or implementing Recovery Act requirements.
