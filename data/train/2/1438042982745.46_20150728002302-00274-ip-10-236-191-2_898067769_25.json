            "Honestly, I have heard that SVSU is great for education and nursing majors.",
            "College, just like high school, is one of the best times of your life. However, the people and the relationships will either be broken or will grow stronger. Additionally, college isn't for everyone, but don't let the independence of college get in the way of the true goal of what you came here for and that is to eventually graduate.",
            "It is the cheapest school in Michigan and it also has the best housing. No other school in Michigan is going to give you a nice place.",
            "Aside from the fact that SVSU really isn't in a college town, it is a cool little place. When you live on campus it allows you to get involved in things and it honestly is what you make of it.",
            "In all honestly, I hate giving my opinion on things because my experience is different from other people. However, I love the fact that the class sizes are small, so your prof has a better chance of getting to know you."

We have Starbucks and Einstein Bagel plus Papa Johns and other eating place. You will never go hungry. There is also a convenience store called the C-Store. With later hours and great food SVSU is a great place. There is also the Ryder Gym center free for students if you are worried about the Freshman 15., 284565=There is a Drag Show every March that a Fraternity takes a part of for a fundraiser. Great time for people to come together. Students are very accepting of all lifestyles., 391415=There a plenty of resources offered so failing is never an option. It is home to the world's best dorms. The incoming freshmen class of 2013 was the largest as of 2013., 25442=I transferred back home after the fall semester of 2009. I enjoyed going to my classes. Although, i am more of a home person and did not enjoy being away from home. Another added stress was my roommates and i did not get along very well., 30029=I am currently in 14 credits and I am signed up to take 15 credits in Winter 2010. I am learning a lot at Saginaw Valley. I am taking classes that are not similar so I am in classses I have never taken before. I have learned a lot about Political Science and Communications. I have improved my writing in my English class and there is the Writing Center which is a great resource., 346601=Most of the classes at the college are the kinds of classes that don't transfer so the bang for your buck is quite irrelevant but for the classes that do transfer it is wise to dual enroll so that your classes cost in the $400 range and not the $1200 range. in all the degree you will get is worth the cost but dual enrollment is the best way to reduce that cost., 165836=Most importantly, make sure you are prepared! If you need to have classes completed before transferring, talk to them about that to make certain you do. If you don't make a lot of money, be sure to get on-top of the scholarships available to you - most are available January - May. Communicate to your instructors if you have back-to-back classes that you may be late or have to leave early because they really appreciate the heads-up. Finally, this isn't like high school - you must actually DO the work in order to get the grade you want. Sure you might be able to skate by and prove me wrong, but for the money you spend, wouldn't you want to actually learn something?, 447662=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52481=i have been at saginaw valley since 2007 and they have different varieties of food available. they are open at different hours through the night to make it more convenient for students.best school food i have ever had.}",
