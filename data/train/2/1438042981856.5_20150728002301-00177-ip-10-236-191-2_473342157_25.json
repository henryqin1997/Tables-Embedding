As determined by sequence analysis at the Mayo Clinic's Core Facility (Rochester, Minn.) and a similar facility in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at Szeged University (Szeged University, Hungary), the 80 kDa band is represented by TF, the 66-68 kDa band is composed of albumin and PALP in a ratio of about 3:1, and the 52 kDa band is represented by AT. One minor band (\u02dc43-45 kDa) is represented by \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, while the rest are proteolytic degradation products of TF.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{90983=Fetal bovine serum (FBS), fetal calf serum (FCS), and all tissue culture media were obtained from Life Technologies (formerly GIBCO BRL) (Rockville, Md.). L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts (ATCC CRL1458) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. The 3T3-L1 mouse embryo preadipocyte cell line (ATCC CCL-92.1) was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. L6 myoblasts and the differentiated myofibrils derived from them are widely used model systems to study the mechanisms involved in either maintaining the proliferative state or promote their commitment to myogenic differentiation [Kimball, S. R., Shantz, L. M., Horetsky, R. L. and Jefferson, L. S. (1999), \u201cLeucine regulates translation of specific mRNA in L6 myoblasts through mTOR-mediated changes in availability of eIF4E and phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 274, 11647-11652; DeArcangelis, V., Coletti, D., Conti, M., Lagarde, M., Molinaro, M., Adamo, S., Nemoz, G. and Naro, F. (2003), \u201cIGF-1-induced differentiation of L6 myogenic cells requires the activity of cAMP-phosphodiesterase,\u201d Mol Biol. Cell, 14, 1392-1404]. On the other hand, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the differentiated adipocytes derived from them are frequently used model systems to study the selective mechanisms required for either maintaining the proliferative state or inducing their commitment to adipogenic differentiation [Guilherme, A., Emoto, M., Buxton, J. M., Bose, S., Sabini, R., Theurkauft, W. E., Leszyk, J. and Czech, M. P. (2000), \u201cPerinuclear localization and insulin responsiveness of GLUT4 requires cytoskeletal integrity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 275, 38151-38159]., 23735=In addition to replacing dying cells as part of a normal physiological process, there are also many pathological situations when regeneration of a tissue is necessary to regain normal function. Pluripotent or multipotent embryonic and adult stem cells as well as progenitor cells hold great promise to help tissue regeneration. For example, hematopoietic stem cells have the capacity to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system of a myeloblated host [Herzog, E. L., Chai, L. and Krause, D. S. (2003), \u201cPlasticity of marrow-derived stem cells,\u201d Blood, 102, 3483-3493]. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells can also differentiate ex vivo and in vivo into multiple cell lineages including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, epithelial cells, myocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, adipocytes, pneumocytes and early neural precursors. Thus, mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to replace damaged cells with normally functioning cells in tissues such as the cartilage, skeletal and heart muscle, bone, tendon, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, liver, ligament, skin, nervous system, and adipose tissue [Seale, P., Asakura, A. and Rudnicki, M. A. (2001), \u201cThe potential of muscle stem cells,\u201d Developmental Cell, 1, 333-342; Ryan, J. M., Barry, F. P., Murphy, J. M. and Mahon, B. P. (2005), \u201cMesenchymal stem cells avoid allogeneic rejection,\u201d J. Inflammation, 2:8, 1-11; Herzog, E. L., Chai, L. and Krause, D. S. (2003), \u201cPlasticity of marrow-derived stem cells,\u201d Blood, 102, 3483-3493]., 135610=Cells were split at 1:3 and then incubated for 24 hours in 10% serum-containing medium to about 30-35% confluence. Then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum. After about 2 hours, the cells remained either untreated or were treated with 1.5 \u03bcg/ml or 15.0 \u03bcg/ml of commercial PALP, as indicated in TABLE 9. Then the incubations were continued for 2, 4 or 6 days followed by the determination of viable cell number. The data are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 3 determinations. The results in TABLE 9 show that on each day examined, the higher (15 \u03bcg/ml) concentration of commercial PALP enhanced the number of viable stem cells by 1.5-2.8-fold., 125568=Cells were split at 1:3 and then incubated for 24 hours in 10% serum-containing medium to about 30-35% confluence. Then the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After about 2 hours, the cells remained either untreated or were treated with 1.5 \u03bcg/ml or 15.0 \u03bcg/ml of commercial PALP, as indicated in TABLE 7. Then the incubations were continued for 2, 4, 6 or 8 days followed by the determination of viable cell number. The data are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 3 determinations. The results in TABLE 7 show that by day 6 the higher (15 \u03bcg/ml) concentration of commercial PALP nearly fully reversed, while at 8 days it fully reversed the decrease in the number of viable cells., 22985=Various transcription factors play key roles in the differentiation of stem cells. For example, the Runx2 and PPAR\u03b3 transcription factors along with the TAZ transcriptional modulator drive mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into either osteoblasts or adipocytes [Hong, J. H., Hwang, E. S., McManus, M. T., Amsterdam, A., Tian, Y., Kalmukova, R., Mueller, E., Benjamin, T., Spiegelman, B. M., Sharp, P. A., Hopkins, N. and Yaffe, M. B. (2005), \u201cTAZ, a transcriptional modulator of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation,\u201d Science, 309, 1074-1078]. Appropriately selective modulation of these transcription factors and other regulators will determine which cell type these stem cells will differentiate into., 20687=The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/560,167, titled \u201cCombinations of Human Proteins to Enhance Viability of Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells\u201d and filed Nov. 15, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/804,060, titled \u201cCombinations of Human Proteins to Enhance Viability of Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells\u201d and filed Jun. 6, 2006. Both of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 42660=An active derivative that is a smaller fragment of a PALP amino acid sequence and demonstrates efficacy similar to that of native PALP may be synthesized or developed. It has been demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase activity is not required in native PALP to stimulate mitogenesis. For example, both digestion of PALP with the protease bromelain and elimination of alkaline phosphatase activity through mutation provided an active derivative with respect to cell proliferation [U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/653,622, filed Sep. 2, 2003 and entitled \u201cUse of Placental Alkaline Phosphatase to Promote Skin Cell Proliferation\u201d; Pub. No. US 2005/0048046 A1, Pub. date, Mar. 3, 2005]. An active derivative may be formed by exchanging amino acids at critical sites, by modifying a PALP amino acid sequence or a sequence of smaller PALP peptides. Likewise, chemical or enzymatic changes in the level and position of glycosylation may maintain or enhance the effects of PALP or its derivatives. In the practice of embodiments of the present invention, modified PALP, smaller PALP-derived peptides, or modified PALP-derived peptides may be similarly effective or even more effective than native PALP. Each of these is considered to be an active derivative. In some embodiments of the present invention native glycosylated PALP and its active derivatives as well as non-glycosylated PALP and its active derivatives may be used. For simplicity, all the above potentially active derivatives of PALP are included in the term \u201cPALP\u201d., 170069=The experiment was performed as described in Example 17, except that the incubation medium contained 10% fetal calf serum. The results, shown in TABLE 13, indicate that commercial PALP had practically no effects on cell numbers probably because it did not contain enough PALP and TF at this concentration. In contrast, combinations of pPALP+TF and pPALP+TF+AT enhanced cell numbers between day 0 and 6, while 7.5-15 \u03bcg/ml concentrations of pPALP and TF alone had effects only between day 0 and 2. The data mean that when applied alone, pPALP and TF initially enhanced survival of cells, and when applied in combination they also enhanced cell proliferation between day 2 and 6. Overall, as expected, 10% serum was nearly optimal for the proliferation of stem cells, and it is important that PALP and TF still could exert, at least at the earlier time periods, additional effects., 21781=Replacement of mature cells in any living tissue involves a highly regulated process in which a small population of long-lived self-renewing adult stem cells gives rise to relatively short-lived proliferating progenitor cells, also called transit-amplifying cells. Progenitor cells undergo limited number of mitotic division with each successive daughter cell population expressing increasing degree of differentiation and a decreased capacity to proliferate. Eventually this process leads to the formation of fully differentiated cells that lose their ability to differentiate [Clarke, M. F. and Fuller, M. (2006), \u201cStem cells and cancer: Two faces of Eve,\u201d Cell, 124, 1111-1115]. This process ensures production of large numbers of differentiated progeny from a small number of stem cells. Nature appears to have developed such mechanism for tissue renewal to decrease the risk of cancer. Limiting the number of cells with high proliferative capacity limits the risk of developing cancer that is proportional to the number of cell proliferative events [Clarke, M. F. and Fuller, M. (2006), \u201cStem cells and cancer: Two faces of Eve,\u201d Cell, 124, 1111-1115]., 140594=Cells were split at 1:3 and then incubated for 24 hours in 10% serum-containing medium to about 30-35% confluence. Then the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After about 2 hours, the cells remained either untreated or were treated with 10.0 \u03bcg/ml of purified PALP and/or 10.0 \u03bcg/ml of partially iron-saturated human TF and/or 150 \u03bcg/ml of purified human AT as indicated in TABLE 10. Then the incubations were continued for 2, 4 or 6 days followed by the determination of viable cell number. The data are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 3 determinations. The results in TABLE 10 show that while both PALP and TF alone had well detectable protective effects on cell survival, the largest effect was obtained when cells were simultaneously treated with PALP, TF and AT., 49093=As used herein, the term \u201cTF\u201d and the phrase \u201chuman TF\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to transferrin. As used herein, active TF means the human protein, or closely related mammalian proteins, and its/their glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms as well as peptides derived from these proteins that, when administered together with PALP and/or AT, is effective to enhance the proliferation and survival of stem and progenitor cells. For these studies, partially iron-saturated (iron content: 300-600 \u03bcg per 1-g protein) that was more than 98% pure was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog numbers T 3309 according to the 2005/2006 Sigma Catalog). Because TF is a major component of human blood, and placenta always contains significant volume of blood, the placenta tissue is also a potential source for the isolation of this protein. Chromatographic separation methods are available for the purification of TF. For example, it is possible to enrich TF, along with some other glycoproteins, using a so-called Concanavalin-A-Sepharose column, which separates glycoproteins based on their ability to interact with lectins such as Concanavalin-A. This step is then followed by other column chromatography methods, such as size-exclusion chromatography, to separate glycoproteins from each other. These techniques are well within the reach of expertise of experts in the art., 55920=AT belongs to the large family of serine protease inhibitors, or serpins, that act as irreversible suicide inhibitors of proteases [Janciauskiene, S. (2001), \u201cConformational properties of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) confer multiple pathophysiological roles,\u201d Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1535, 221-235]. While AT is a particularly effective inhibitor of elastase, it also inhibits other proteases such as trypsin. AT deficiency, often caused by its oxidative damage in smokers, is causally related to emphysema due to the uncontrolled action of proteases in the lung. Other physiological effects of AT may include inhibition of cancer cell proliferation [Finlay, T. H., Tamir, S., Kadner, S. S., Cruz, M. R., Yavelow, J. and Levitz, M. (1993), \u201c\u03b11-antitrypsin- and anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells,\u201d Endocrinology, 133, 996-1002]., 92924=Bone marrow aspirates were taken from normal adult donors after informed consent according to a protocol approved by the local Ethics Committee at the National Medical Center, Budapest, Hungary. For the preparation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, essentially a widely used technique was used as described earlier by others [Pittenger, M. F., Mackay, A. M., Beck, S. C., Jaiswal, R. K., Douglas, R., Mosca, J. D., Moorman, M. A., Simonetti, D. W., Craig, S. and Marshak, D. R. (1999), \u201cMultilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells,\u201d Science, 284, 143-147]. Briefly, nucleated cells were isolated with a pre-prepared commercial density gradient (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Pharma, Oslo, Norway) and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 U/ml of penicillin, and 50 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin (GIBCO). All nucleated cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks (BD Falcon, Bedford, Mass.) at 37\ufffd C. in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 24 hours, nonadherent cells were removed and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. The remaining adherent cells were thoroughly washed with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (GIBCO). Fresh complete culture medium was added and replaced every 3 or 4 days (twice a week). When cells grew to about 80% confluence, they were suspended and harvested by incubating with a ready-made solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 5 minutes at 37\ufffd C.; this cell suspension is designated as passage 1. These cells were further expanded with 1:3-1:5 splitting in 175-cm2 flasks (BD Falcon). In the studies reported in some embodiments of the invention, mesenchymal stem cells were used between passages 3-8., 121078=3T3-L1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 8,000 cells/well. After the cells reached confluence, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium followed by treatments with purified PALP and incubations for 6 days. The relative number of viable cells (A540) was determined by the MTT assay. The data, shown in TABLE 6, are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 4 determinations. The results indicate that during the 6-day period, 2.5-15 \u03bcg/ml concentrations of PALP provided protection against cell death induced by serum-free medium., 47931=TF, the second potential component of the stem cell-stimulating composition, is also a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 80 kDa. The structure and biological effects of TF as well as the properties of transferrin receptor have recently been reviewed [Qian, Z. M., Li, H., Sun, H. and Ho, K. (2002), \u201cTargeted drug delivery via the transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway,\u201d Pharmacol Rev., 54, 561-587]. Its major function is to carry iron from the sites of intake into the systemic circulation to the cells and tissues. However, TF also serves as a growth factor for many cell types; for this reason, it is a standard component of several growth media used for cell culture. Whether the growth factor effects of TF are always mediated by iron or not is presently unclear. TF also promotes migration of endothelial cells [Carlevaro, M. F., Albini, A., Ribatti, D., Gentili, C., Benelli, R., Cermelli, S., Cancedda, R. and Cancedda, F. D. (1997), \u201cTransferrin promotes endothelial cell migration and invasion: Implication in cartilage neovascularization.\u201d J. Cell. Biol., 136, 1375-1384]., 159188=The experiment was performed as described in Example 17, except that the incubation medium contained 2% fetal calf serum. The results, shown in TABLE 12, indicate that commercial PALP (cPALP) as well as combinations of purified PALP (pPALP)+TF and pPALP+TF+AT similarly enhanced cell number (indicative of stimulation of cell proliferation) during the entire incubation period. pPALP and TF alone at 7.5-15 \u03bcg/ml concentrations were less effective and had stimulatory effects on cell proliferation only between days 0-6., 147326=Cells were split at 1:3 and then incubated for 24 hours in 10% serum-containing medium to about 30-35% confluence. Then the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After about 2 hours, the cells remained either untreated or were treated with various concentrations of commercial PALP, purified PALP, partially iron-saturated human TF, and purified human AT alone or in combinations as indicated in TABLE 11. Then the incubations were continued for up to 10 days followed by the determination of viable cell numbers. The data are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 3 determinations. The results in TABLE 11 show again that both purified PALP (pPALP) and TF, particularly in combination, can reduce initial (between 0-2 days) death of stem cells, and after the second day the pPALP+TF and pPALP+TF+AT combinations promote increase in cell numbers. It is noteworthy that commercial PALP (cPALP) was somewhat less effective than the combinations of purified protein combinations. An obvious reason is that at the concentration of 15 \u03bcg/ml, commercial PALP does not contain sufficient amounts of PALP, TF and AT to exert an optimal effect. It is also important to point out that in this experiment AT added less to the combined effects of pPALP+TF than in the experiment described in Example 16 (TABLE 10). However, in this experiment only 50 \u03bcg/ml of AT was used in contrast to 150 \u03bcg/ml used in the previous experiment (TABLE 10). Clearly, AT has greater effects at 150 \u03bcg/ml than at 50 \u03bcg/ml concentration., 130751=Cells were split at 1:3 and then incubated for 24 hours in 10% serum-containing medium to about 30-35% confluence. Then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% serum. After about 2 hours, the cells remained either untreated or were treated with 1.5 \u03bcg/ml or 15.0 \u03bcg/ml of commercial PALP, as indicated in TABLE 8. Then the incubations were continued for 2, 4 or 6 days followed by the determination of viable cell number. The data are expressed as mean values\ufffdstd. dev. of 3 determinations. The results in TABLE 8 show that on each day examined, the higher (15 \u03bcg/ml) concentration of commercial PALP doubled or tripled the number of viable stem cells., 44502=Recombinant methods of obtaining suitable preparations of PALP or active PALP derivatives are also appropriate. Using the cDNA of PALP, recombinant protein may be produced by one of the many known methods for recombinant protein expression. PALP has been cloned and expressed in cells as described by Kozlenkov, et al. [Kozlenkov, A., Manes, T., Hoylaerts, M. F. and Millan, J. L. (2002), \u201cFunction assignment to conserved residues in mammalian alkaline phosphatases,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 277, 22992-22999]. Production of recombinant PALP by bacteria [Beck, R. and Burtscher, H. (1994), \u201cExpression of human placental alkaline phosphatase in Escherichia coli,\u201d Protein Expression and Purification, 5, 192-197] and yeast [Heimo, H., Palmu, K. and Suominen, I. (1998), \u201cHuman placenta alkaline phosphatase: Expression in Pichia pastoris, purification and characterization of the enzyme,\u201d Protein Expression and Purification, 12, 85-92] is also a suitable method of obtaining PALP for use with embodiments of the present invention. For simplicity, recombinant PALP is also included in the term \u201cPALP\u201d., 79599=Human PALP (Type XXIV, 1020 units of total activity) in a partially purified form was obtained commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. A butanol extraction of placental tissue, followed by one or more chromatographic steps, was performed by Sigma-Aldrich to obtain the partially purified material., 86364=Recombinant PALP was produced following a known procedure described in Kozlenkov, A., Manes, T., Hoylaerts, M. F. and Millan, J. L. (2002), \u201cFunction assignment to conserved residues in mammalian alkaline phosphatases,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 277, 22992-22999, which is hereby incorporated by reference.}",
