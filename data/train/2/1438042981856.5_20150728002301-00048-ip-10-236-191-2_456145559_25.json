            "MULTIPLEX DETECTION ASSAY FOR INFLUENZA AND RSV VIRUSES - The present invention generally relates to a molecular test of Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus B in order to identify patients with a viral infection. Accordingly methods and compositions are disclosed to determine the presence or absence of a viral pathogen in a sample containing one or more target nucleic acids from the M gene of Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, and/or Respiratory Syncytial Virus B.",
            "METHODS OF NUCLEIC ACID QUANTIFICATION AND DETECTION USING ANOMALOUS MIGRATION - Described are approaches for the identification, detection, and quantification of nucleic acids in a biological sample. These methods are based, in part, on the elucidation of anomalous migration properties of short nucleic acid molecules when conjugated to a fluorescent label, such as fluorescein labels, such that a smaller nucleic acid reliably migrates slower than a larger nucleic acid under the same conditions of separation.",

    "textAfterTable": "Patent applications by Lilly I. Kong, Covina, CA US Lingkai Kong, Albany, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20130241772 INTEGRATED PHASE-SHIFTING-AND-COMBINING CIRCUITRY TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE ANTENNAS - The disclosed embodiments generally relate to techniques for processing signals received from multiple antennas. More specifically, the disclosed embodiments relate to a system that uses an integrated phase-shifting-and-combining circuit to process signals received from multiple antenna elements. This circuit applies a specified phase shift to the input signals, and combines the phase-shifted input signals to produce an output signal. In some embodiments, the integrated phase-shifting-and-combining circuit uses a current-steering mechanism to perform the phase-shifting-and-combining operations. This current-steering mechanism operates by converting the input signals into associated currents, and then steering each of the associated currents through multiple pathways which have different delays. Next, the currents from the multiple pathways for the associated currents are combined to produce the output signal. During this process, while steering each of the associated currents through multiple pathways to achieve different phase shifts, complementary impedance changes through the multiple pathways cause the aggregate impedance at the output to remain substantially constant. 09-19-2013 Nicholas Kong, Berkeley, CA US Patent",
