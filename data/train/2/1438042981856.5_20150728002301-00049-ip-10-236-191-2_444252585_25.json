            "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE IMPRESSIONS USING DISTRIBUTED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION - Example methods and apparatus to determine media impressions using distributed demographic information are disclosed. A disclosed example method to monitor media content exposure involves receiving, at a first internet domain, a first request from a client computer, the first request indicative of access to the media at the client computer, sending, from the first internet domain, a response to the client computer, the response to instruct the client computer to send a second request to an intermediary associated with a sub-domain of a second internet domain, the second request to be indicative of the access to the media at the client computer, the intermediary to transmit an indication of the second request to an entity of the second internet domain, and logging an impression of the media.",
            "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE MEDIA IMPRESSIONS USING DISTRIBUTED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION - Example methods involve based on a first request to log a first media impression, generating a first identifier associated with a first client device that generated the first request, and sending a communication to the first client device. The communication includes the first identifier, and the communication is to cause the first client device to send the first identifier associated with the first client device to a database proprietor in association with a cookie identifier of the first client device. Second media impressions are logged in association with the first identifier of the first client device and second identifiers associated with second client devices based on second requests received from the first and second client devices. A batch including the second media impressions and the first and second identifiers is sent to the database proprietor. Demographic information associated with the second media impressions is received from the database proprietor.",
            "SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING IN AN ONLINE SOCIAL GAMING ENVIRONMENT - Systems and methods to identify candidates for targeted advertising in an online social gaming environment are disclosed. Example methods include generating a network graph representative of relationships between users associated with an online social gaming environment, the relationships based on connections between the users. Example methods also include collecting first social gaming data corresponding to participation by a first user and a second user in the online social gaming environment during a first period of time. The example methods further include calculating a first degree of influence of the first user of the online social gaming environment on the second user of the online social gaming environment, the first degree of influence based on the first social gaming data.",
            "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE IMPRESSIONS USING DISTRIBUTED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION - Methods and apparatus to determine media impressions using distributed demographic information are disclosed. An method includes sending to a client computer, via a processor serving a first internet domain, a response to a first request, the first request sent to the first internet domain and indicative of access to media at the client computer, the response to instruct the client computer to send a second request to an intermediary serving a sub-domain of a second internet domain, the second request to be indicative of the access to the media at the client computer, wherein the intermediary is to transmit first data about the second request to a data collection server of an audience measurement entity and second data about the second request to an entity of the second internet domain and logging an impression of the media."
