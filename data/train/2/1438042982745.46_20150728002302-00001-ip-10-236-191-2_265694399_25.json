I was surprised to meet some Tyrannosaurs there. Well, I added them to the database under the Hezrou Island, but I don't know their drops. Here are their images (version 1:1 and scaled to 96x96, whichever fits better): Valley Tyrannosaur lvl 77 Spraying Tyrannosaur lvl 78 Red Tyrannosaur lvl 77 Green Tyrannosaur lvl 78, 51949=Last edited Mon, 05 Apr 2010, 6:13pm by Sarin, 68626=Last edited Sun, 14 Mar 2010, 10:03pm by Hugomka, 149853=Last edited Fri, 23 Apr 2010, 2:09pm by Hugomka, 8614=Uploaded 3/10/2010 - Thanks ret3, 85486=Last edited Fri, 19 Mar 2010, 4:38am by ret3}",

I have only PAINT XD You should drag each item to a large \"white\" area on the screen before getting a screenshot. That gets rid of the number that blocks a corner of the image, and makes it easiear to erase the background.
