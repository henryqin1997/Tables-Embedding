            "IN-VIVO VISUALIZATION SYSTEMS - In vivo visualization systems are described which facilitate tissue treatment by a user in utilizing real time visualized tissue images with generated three-dimensional models of the tissue region of interest, such as the left atrial chamber of a subject's heart. Directional indicators on the visualized tissue as well as the imaging systems may be utilized while other variations may utilize image rotation or manipulation of visualized tissue regions to facilitate catheter control. Moreover, visualized tissue regions may be combined with imaged tissue regions as well as navigational information to further facilitate tissue treatments.",
            "TISSUE CONTRAST IMAGING SYSTEMS - Tissue contrast imaging systems are described which detect differences in tissue contrasts to obtain images of the tissue region. The systems may be used to obtain images of the cardiac tissues particularly in a blood-filled environment.",
