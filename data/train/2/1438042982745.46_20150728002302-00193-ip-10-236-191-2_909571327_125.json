    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75914=I've been in contact with WSU for over a year now and it's been a huge hassle every step of the way. You have fees for this and fees for that. Classes start in August, but your academic advisor won't be back until September and you can't register because there's a new-student hold on your account, but if you don't register for the Fall semester, they'll charge you a fee and expel you from attending for two semesters., 995325=Don't take all of your clothes at once when school starts in August! In the hot months of August and September you don't need the snow gear necessary in December-February., 739077=There are a bazillion hills in Pullman, so be prepared to get a workout going to class and build up your 'Cougar Calves.' The weather is also extremely bipolar--apparently it snows in May, so be prepared for that. Also, don't feel pressured into going Greek because other reviews say that if you don't join a frat or a sorority, you're left out--both Greeks and non-Greeks have amazing opportunities., 1013715=Okay, some dorms are worth five, six, or seven stars. However, there are plenty that don't, so I'm averaging this at three stars. First of all, the August and September months are tough without air conditioning, but that's not a big fault. What is problematic, though, is the age of a few buildings, which comes with a variety of unwanted extras. Extra-strange smells, curvatures in the wood, leaks... etc. Nevertheless, WSU has extraordinary service that attempts to fix these as soon as possible. Sometimes, though, the wear on the oldest buildings show., 566046=WSU is actually getting really expensive. The tuition rate had the largest increase out of all the universities in Washington and we now have the highest tuition. It jumped about $1500., 595634=There are a couple of dinning options available on campus that can be paid with RDA (room and dinning assistance) if you are living in a dorm, Cougar Cash (gives discounted meal price), cash, or debit. The meals provided by these dining centers include breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Food include: pizza, sandwiches, burgers, fries, salad bar, fruits, cereal, pastries, cakes, ice-cream, etc. Drinks include: soda, juice, coffee, milk, tea, shakes, smoothies, etc. These dining centers are located north and south of campus and are open from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. There are late night dinning centers that are open from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. for people who plan to eat later. The best dining center in WSU is Flix which serves juicy burgers and fresh fries, milkshakes, lattes, frappes, and Italian sodas. There are two television screens for football fans and pool table. Flix also sells convince store items for students.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here As an out of state student I can say that I am SO happy here. The campus is beautiful, and with the rolling hills walking to certain places on campus can count as your workout for the day! Haha, but really, the campus is beautiful, safe and easy to navigate. The options students have are endless: intramural sports, Greek life, over 300 clubs ranging from accounting to snowboarding, ski team, etc etc. There are plenty of options for student jobs and the University even has a website to help search for them. Washington State is a fun, laid-back, academically strong, beautiful campus that I would recommend anyone to attend. Am learning a lot The professors at Washington State University are incredible, and luckily, all the ones I have had are really good at getting to know their students on a personal basis. Even with a 300 person lecture, if you're the type of student who is willing to get to know your professor (ask questions, go into office hours, etc) they're willing to help!
