In any case May 6 saw the last of the so-called insulin therapy., 390438=Earlier, April 17, Forrestal had asked that some flowers be taken out, saying (quoting the watch\ufffds account) \ufffdthey were \ufffdtoo strong\ufffd for him.\ufffd, 386815=Thus according to the Nurse\ufffds Notes these barbaric treatments took place from April 9 to May 6 for a total of 24 treatments in 28 days.\u00a0 The dose varied as follows (a question mark means that the page for that injection is missing, a blank means no treatment was given that day):, 378211=Here are the main entries for the last eight hours of Forrestal\ufffds life (all times are per the corpsmen and accurate only to the nearest five minutes). Assuming Harrison\ufffds and the other corpsmen\ufffds notes are correct, Forrestal has not been given any insulin or phenobarbital since 11:30\u00a0am and not taken any sodium amytal pills since May 19 two days ago:, 376247=The next morning, May 21 at 7:30, he is given another injection of insulin, 10 units according to Harrison.\u00a0 Thus the context of Harrison\ufffds note at 9:00\u00a0am:\u00a0 \ufffdPt seems rather depressed today.\ufffd is the same as that of the previous day with Prise:\u00a0 10 physiologically extraneous units of insulin had suddenly used up a proportional amount of his blood sugar. At first this is indeed \ufffdstimulating\ufffd as the existing sugar gets metabolized far more rapidly than normal, then the let down occurs because of the reduced sugar level., 374658=The previous watch, corpsman Prise, had come to know Forrestal quite well after having worked 51 consecutive days starting April 6. Consequently he was in a good position to judge Forrestal\ufffds moods accurately. He had written a few hours before Harrison:, 373785=The man on watch both times, the only times he was on watch, was Robert Wayne Harrison, Jr. There is another reason to mistrust Harrison\ufffds note of May 21 even if honest. Harrison had just met Forrestal and was in no position to reliably evaluate his mood. A stranger might easily confuse thoughtfulness, preoccupation, drowsiness (it was the 3rd shift), etc. with depression. And in any case in its severity clinical depression is something quite apart from merely being depressed in the colloquial sense., 389977=On April 30 and again on May 9 and 16 Forrestal complains about a strange smell in the room, an \ufffdetherish odor.\ufffd None of the staff seem to notice it. There are two possibilities:\u00a0 (1) One consequence of an assault on the central nervous system can be imagined odors, so the smell may have been imaginary.\u00a0 (2) Perhaps Forrestal was, or had become, more sensitive to odors, and smelled something the hospital personnel could not or were used to., 389520=The Notes begin April 2 at 0430 but Forrestal was not formally admitted, per the Admission Notice (exhibit 3 item 1) until 1645, suggesting a hasty admission, paperwork postponed., 388929=On May 16 Breon notes that during lunch Forrestal craved salt.\u00a0 He \ufffdsalted food with almost every bite. Couldn\ufffdt get enough from shaker top so he took it off and poured the salt on.\ufffd A craving for salt is caused by a low sodium level, which in turn could have been caused by the heavy perspiring during the worst of the earlier insulin treatments. Whatever the cause, sodium deficiency is a very serious condition. Forrestal seems to have gotten over it though because salt is not mentioned again., 393539=If Forrestal\ufffds conversations were being recorded, neither Raines nor the watch need have been privy to it. Note the temporary change of room from 1618 to 1615 on April 5th \ufffd ample opportunity to plant a listening device., 373119=The second time you find the word \ufffddepressed\ufffd is the day before Forrestal disappeared, May 21. Just what you would expect of a suicide, right?, 372867=You find the word \ufffddepressed\ufffd in two places. One is in the middle of a \ufffdsub-shock insulin therapy\ufffd treatment (April 28), the nineteenth of these barbaric \ufffdtreatments.\ufffd You \ufffd anyone \ufffd would have good reason to feel miserable at that point., 28234=A few remarks follow concerning various conventions used by the nurses when writing their notes.\u00a0 A nurse \ufffd here a male navy hospital corpsman \ufffd always refers to himself in the third person. Thus when \ufffdthe corpsman\ufffd is the subject or object of a sentence, it means \ufffdI\ufffd or \ufffdme.\ufffd\u00a0 When a nurse writes \ufffdso-and-so to see patient\ufffd he refers not to the future but to the time of writing, that is, \ufffdso-and-so in to see patient.\ufffd\u00a0 \ufffdO\ufffd in quotes indicates that the preceding medicine was given orally.\u00a0 \ufffdComplain\ufffd means to state a problem, no peevishness is implied.\u00a0 The dosage of a solid oral medicine is measured by weight in grains, one grain being about 65 mg.\u00a0 Liquid oral medicines are measured in ounces and written preceded by the apothecary symbol for ounce, which we have rendered as \ufffdZ.\ufffd\u00a0 Numerically both grains and ounces are usually written in lowercase roman numerals, with \ufffdss\ufffd meaning \ufffd\u00a0 (for example ivss means 4\u00a0\ufffd).\u00a0 Regarding an injection I.M. stands for intramuscular.\u00a0 All times are military:\u00a0 1200 is noon, 2400 midnight, and in general if the military time is 1259 or less just insert a colon (then add a.m. if less than 1200, otherwise p.m.), if 1300 or greater subtract 1200 before inserting the colon (then add p.m. if less than 2400, otherwise a.m.). Thus if military time begins with 0, 11 or 24 it is morning., 27657=David P. Hightower and Robert Reynolds Deen alternated this watch each night, except \ufffd generalizing from the Report testimony of Dr. Hightower, question 15 \ufffd watching two consecutive nights on weekends. On the night beginning Friday May 20 Dr. Hightower was on call (his Report testimony, question 13), and the night beginning Saturday May 21 Dr. Deen was on call (his Report testimony, question 14)., 393855=On April 24, after 14 \ufffdinsulin treatments,\ufffd Forrestal complained about the taste of the food given him the previous evening. Here is the note of corpsman Prise:, 390668=By mid May, into his seventh week, Forrestal has becomed concerned that his conversations with Dr. Raines might not be private. Here is the account of Prise, five days before Forrestal disappeared:, 5445=Unlike the HTML version of the body of the Willcutts Report, which scrupulously reproduces the original\ufffds capitalization, punctuation, spelling and format, in the Nurse\ufffds Notes we have silently modified these trivial aspects in the interest of readability.\u00a0 The abbreviation consisting of the letter C with a dash over it, standing for \ufffdwith\ufffd (after the Latin), has been expanded, as have a few other abbreviations, the most frequent being \ufffdask\ufffd for \ufffdasked.\ufffd\u00a0 We omit the text of the blank printed form on which the notes are written.\u00a0 We omit the number written on the front pages under \ufffdWARD NO.\ufffd \ufffd in this case the room number 1618.\u00a0 We omit the number written under \ufffdREGISTER NO.\ufffd \ufffd always 162220 (the same number typed on Forrestal\ufffds hospital Admission Notice).\u00a0 Poor grammar is retained but not sic\ufffded.\u00a0 Insubstantial corrections are silently followed.\u00a0 The apothecary symbol for oz is rendered as Z.\u00a0 Sometimes a nurse will sign his entries even when there is no change in the nurse writing the notes; these extra signatures are omitted.\u00a0 We use the date as a heading and omit it within the notes.\u00a0 X\ufffds indicate illegible manuscript. A question mark in brackets indicates some doubt about the previous word. Anything in brackets is ours., 375483=The previous day, May 20, Forrestal had become physically weak not long after a \ufffdstimulating\ufffd injection of insulin. The timeline went as follows.\u00a0 At 11:30 in the morning he is given 10 units of insulin. At this time (quoting corpsman Breon):\u00a0 \ufffdPt up walking around. Seems to be well rested.\ufffd\u00a0 But by the time lunch is served at 12:05:\u00a0 \ufffdPt seems very quiet. Looked like he didn\ufffdt have the strength to eat.\ufffd\u00a0 At 2:45\u00a0pm he is offered an extra meal, half of which he eats. When dinner is served at 5:30\u00a0pm (quoting corpsman Prise):\u00a0 \ufffdPt asked to have part of it sent back.\ufffd\u00a0 By 5:50\u00a0pm:\u00a0 \ufffdHe ate very good. Resting quietly in bed.\ufffd and 6:00\u00a0pm:\u00a0 \ufffdPt does not appear to be in a very good mood.\ufffd, 27180=At night, besides the corpsman in the room with Forrestal or at the nurse\ufffds desk right outside his door, a doctor was on call in the adjoining room, where the doctor would sleep. His shift lasted approximately from 1630 to 0830\u00a0(4:30\u00a0pm to 8:30 the next morning) \ufffd this according to the Willcutts Report testimony of Dr. Hightower, question 4. The \ufffddoctors\ufffd room,\ufffd as it was called, was separated from Forrestal\ufffds by a shared bathroom with a door on each side., 377717=Forrestal\ufffds brother Henry was to have come to Bethesda on May 22 to take Forrestal away regardless of the doctors. (See our introduction to the Willcutts Report, the section \ufffdThe World Outside the Report.\ufffd)\u00a0 Doubtless on the evening of May 21 Forrestal, anticipating his release after seven weeks of confinement, was like a horse at the starting gate champing at the bit., 396120=In Dr. Hightower\ufffds testimony before the Willcutts board, question 14, he says regarding Forrestal:\u00a0 \ufffdI saw him again Saturday morning [May 21] at which time an old friend of his from New York came down to visit, a Mister Strieffler.\ufffd\u00a0 That would be Paul Streiffler, Forrestal\ufffds financial manager and close friend. Yet in the Notes for May 21 neither Hightower nor Strieffler are mentioned. The Notes are continuous and complete during this period so their thoroughness is only apparent. (Dr. Hightower might have been taken for granted because he was the doctor on call in the doctors\ufffd room the night before.)}",
