The alma matter is very important to us and is sung at the end of every game and for other special occasions where the campus has to come together as a whole. We also have a great music program, and the world famous Jubilee Singers still sing, train, and perform.",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Self-motivated Humanitarians Hard-working Talented Creative Innovative Tips for prospective students Make sure that you have great grades because Fisk invests in it's students Fisk is all about giving back to the community, keep that in mind! Never take 18 credit hours per semester (if you plan to be involved in all the random activities at Fisk) Bang for the buck I know for a fact that I am paying for the great education that Fisk is providing. The facilities could be better but everything has it's pros and cons. Am enjoying being here I'll be honest with you, Fisk is what you make it... if you go out your way to say there is nothing going on and it's too small, you will hate it but if you put yourself out there to be apart of the true Fisk...the madness and the mayhem...then you can see the TRUE Fisk experience...and Fisk is ALWAYS changing... Then you have the teachers that are so intrigued with their students and making sure that they are prepared for after graduation! I could go on and on...it's just an all around great place... it's one of America's hidden jewels",
