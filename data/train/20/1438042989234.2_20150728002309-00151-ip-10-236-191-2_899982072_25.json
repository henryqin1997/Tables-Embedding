For other affected editions of Windows, this update is rated moderate. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section., 3426=If third-party applications use or install the affected OLE component, could I still be vulnerable even after I have installed all required Microsoft security updates?\u00a0 No, this security update replaces and re-registers the affected OLE component provided with the operating system. If third party applications follow the recommended best practices for using a shared component as a side by side assembly then they are also not affected. Customers are potentially at risk if third party applications do not follow the recommended best practices and instead redistribute a version of oleaut32.dll with their application. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 921503 also contains instructions for customers that wish to manually check for the registered affected OLE component. Customers are encouraged to contact their third party solutions developer for addition information.}",

Does this mitigate this vulnerability?\u00a0 Yes. By default, Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration., 30432=System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) 2007 uses WSUS 3.0 for detection of updates.

    "textBeforeTable": "Affected Software The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle. Affected and Non-Affected Software Known Issues.\u00a0None. Recommendation.\u00a0Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately. This security update addresses the vulnerability by adding a check on memory requests within OLE Automation. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, Vulnerability Information. This is a critical security update for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Visual Basic 6. For other affected editions of Windows, this update is rated moderate. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section. This critical security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. The vulnerability could be exploited through attacks on Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Automation. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
