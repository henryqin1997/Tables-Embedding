The southpaw rolled to his right, shed a tackle at the five and dived across the goal line to make it 14-0 only 4:43 into game., 81287=It marked a complete reversal from the first meeting when Washington needed just 4:25 to forge a 14-0 advantage., 84205=Philadelphia's last offensive thrust came when Vick moved to his right to avoid the rush, set and drilled a three-yard scoring pass to Avant in the back of the end zone to polish off an 11-play, 71-yard drive that made it 52-21 with 6:15 left in the third quarter., 83719=Vick took a shotgun snap and ran to his right six yards for the score that made it 42-14 with 3:34 to go in the quarter. David Akers field goal from 48 yards out pushed the margin to 45-14 at the intermission to establish the franchise record for points in the first half., 83318=McNabb found Anthony Armstrong deep down the left sideline for 76 yards to the Eagles five. Two plays later, Williams took a pass from McNabb six yards to paydirt to trim the lead to 35-14 with 9:39 left before halftime.}",
