    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{628433=In certain embodiments, enriched air 1170 is blended from air and oxygen streams such that the nitrogen to hydrogen ratio in the produced synthesis gas is about 1:3. The synthesis gas may be at a correct ratio of nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia. For example, it has been calculated that for a formation temperature of 700\ufffd C., a pressure of 3 bar absolute, and with 13,231 tons/day of char that will be converted into synthesis gas, one could inject 14.7 kilotons/day of air, 6.2 kilotons/day of oxygen, and 21.2 kilotons/day of steam. This would result in production of 2 billion cubic feet/day of synthesis gas including 5689 tons/day of steam, 16,778 tons/day of carbon monoxide, 1406 tons/day of hydrogen, 18,689 tons/day of carbon dioxide, 1258 tons/day of methane, and 11,398 tons/day of nitrogen. After a shift reaction (to shift the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and to produce additional hydrogen), the carbon dioxide may be removed, the product stream may be methanated (to remove residual carbon monoxide), and then one can theoretically produce 13,840 tons/day of ammonia and 1258 tons/day of methane. This calculation includes the products produced from Reactions (4) and (5) above., 683677=FIG. 55 is a view of an embodiment for treating heavy hydrocarbons in at least a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation of relatively low permeability that may include a well pattern and a vertical hydraulic fracture. Production well 2600 may be configured to create fracture 2602 by methods described in any of the embodiments herein. The width of fracture 2602 generated by hydraulic fracturing may be between about 0.3 cm and about 1 cm. In other embodiments, the width of fracture 2602 may be between about 1 cm and about 3 cm. The pyrolysis zone may be formed in a planar region on either side of the vertical hydraulic fracture by heating the planar region to an average temperature within a pyrolysis temperature range with heat sources 2604 in plane 2605 and plane 2606. Creation of a low viscosity zone on both sides of the pyrolysis zone, above plane 2605 and below plane 2606, may be accomplished by heat sources outside the pyrolysis zone. For example, heat sources 2608 in planes 2610, 2612, 2614, and 2616 may heat the low viscosity zone to a temperature sufficient to lower the viscosity of heavy hydrocarbons in the formation. Mobilized fluids in the low viscosity zone may flow to the pyrolysis zone due to the pressure differential between the low viscosity zone and the pyrolysis zone and the increased permeability from thermal fractures., 874993=FIG. 178 illustrates the production rate of carbon dioxide 5060 and methane 5070 as a function of time in the simulation. FIG. 178 shows that carbon dioxide was produced at a rate between about 0-10,000 m3/day during approximately the first 2400 days. The production rate of carbon dioxide was significantly below the injection rate. Therefore, the simulation predicts that most of the injected carbon dioxide is being sequestered in the coal formation. However, at about 2400 days, the production rate of carbon dioxide started to rise significantly due to onset of saturation of the coal formation., 403016=An appropriate configuration of an insulated conductor heater may be determined by optimizing a material cost of the heater based on a length of heater, a power required per meter of conductor, and a desired operating voltage. In addition, an operating current and voltage may be chosen to optimize the cost of input electrical energy in conjunction with a material cost of the insulated conductor heaters. For example, as input electrical energy increases, the cost of materials needed to withstand the higher voltage may also increase. The insulated conductor heaters may be configured to generate a radiant heat of approximately 650 watts/meter of conductor to approximately 1650 watts/meter of conductor. The insulated conductor heater may operate at a temperature between approximately 530\ufffd C., and approximately 760\ufffd C. within a formation., 318516=For example, fluid generated within a hydrocarbon containing formation may move a considerable distance through the hydrocarbon containing formation as a vapor. Such a considerable distance may include, for example, about 50 m to about 1000 m. The vapor may have a relatively small pressure drop across the considerable distance due to the permeability of the heated portion of the formation. In addition, due to such permeability, a production well may only need to be provided in every other unit of heat sources or every third, fourth, fifth, sixth units of heat sources. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 4, production wells 206 may extend through a hydrocarbon containing formation near the top of heated portion 208., 694844=FIG. 64 illustrates a pattern of production wells 2701 also with two hexagonal rings of heat sources surrounding each production well. Production well 2701 may be surrounded by ring 2738 of six heat sources 2732. Production wells 2701 may be spaced at a distance of 4s. Second hexagonally shaped ring 2740 may surround ring 2738. Second hexagonally shaped ring 2740 may include twelve heat sources 2732. This pattern may result in a ratio of heat sources 2732 to production wells 2701 that may approach fifteen., 616653=A hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio for synthesis gas used as a feed gas for a Fischer-Tropsch reaction may be about 2:1. In certain embodiments the ratio may range from approximately 1.8:1 to 2.2:1. Higher or lower ratios may be accommodated by certain Fischer-Tropsch systems., 852191=FIG. 159 and FIG. 160 illustrate that as the temperature increases from between about 400\ufffd C. to about 1000\ufffd C., the H2 to carbon monoxide ratio of produced synthesis gas may continuously decrease throughout this range. For example, as shown in FIG. 160, the equilibrium gas phase H2 to carbon monoxide ratio at 500\ufffd C., 660\ufffd C., and 1000\ufffd C. is about 22:1, about 3:1, and about 1:1, respectively. FIG. 160 also indicates that produced synthesis gas at lower temperatures may have a larger quantity of water and carbon dioxide than at higher temperatures. As the temperature increases, the overall percentage of carbon monoxide and hydrogen within the synthesis gas may increase., 697530=FIG. 68 illustrates a pattern of production wells with one inner triangular ring of heat sources surrounding each production well and one irregular hexagonal outer ring. Production wells 2760 may be surrounded by ring 2770 of three heat sources 2762. Production wells 2760 may be spaced at a distance of 3s. Irregular hexagonally shaped ring 2772 of nine heat sources 2762 may surround ring 2770. This pattern may result in a ratio of heat sources 2762 to production wells 2760 of nine., 639261=Low temperature heat sources 2216 and high temperature heat sources 2218 may be disposed in production well 2210. Low temperature heat sources 2216 and high temperature heat sources 2218 may be configured as described herein. Production well 2210 may be configured as described herein. Low temperature heat source 2216 may generally refer to a heat source, or heater, configured to provide heat to a selected mobilization section of formation 2200 substantially adjacent to the low temperature heat source. The provided heat may be configured to heat some or all of the selected mobilization section to an average temperature within a mobilization temperature range of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. The mobilization temperature range may be between about 75\ufffd C. to about 150\ufffd C. A selected mobilization temperature may be about 100\ufffd C. The mobilization temperature may vary, however, depending on a viscosity of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. For example, a higher mobilization temperature may be required to mobilize a higher viscosity fluid within formation 2200., 386242=An insulated conductor heater may be tested after fabrication. The insulated conductor heater may be required to withstand 2-3 times an operating voltage at a selected operating temperature. Also, selected samples of produced insulated conductor heaters may be required to withstand 1000 VAC at 760\ufffd C. for one month., 692372=FIG. 60 illustrates three rings of heat sources 2712 surrounding production well 2701. Production well 2701 may be surrounded by ring 2713 of six heat sources 2712. Second hexagonally shaped ring 2716 of twelve heat sources 2712 may surround ring 2713. Third ring 2718 of heat sources 2712 may include twelve heat sources that may provide substantially equal amounts of heat to two production wells and six heat sources that may provide substantially equal amounts of heat to three production wells. Therefore, a total of eight equivalent heat sources may be disposed on third ring 2718. Production well 2701 may be provided heat from an equivalent of about twenty-six heat sources. FIG. 61 illustrates an even larger pattern that may have a greater spacing between production wells 2701., 391697=There are a number of companies that manufacture insulated conductor heaters. Such manufacturers include, but are not limited to, MI Cable Technologies (Calgary, Alberta), Pyrotenax Cable Company (Trenton, Ontario), Idaho Laboratories Corporation (Idaho Falls, Id.), and Watlow (St. Louis, Mo.). As an example, an insulated conductor heater may be ordered from Idaho Laboratories as cable model 355-A90-310-\u201cH\u201d 30\u2032/750\u2032/30\u2032 with Inconel 600 sheath for the cold-pins, three phase Y configuration and bottom jointed conductors. The required specification for the heater should also include 1000 VAC, 1400\ufffd F. quality cable in addition to the preferred mode specifications described above. The designator 355 specifies the cable OD (0.355\u2033), A90 specifies the conductor material, 310 specifies the heated zone sheath alloy (SS 310), \u201cH\u201d specifies the MgO mix, 30\u2032/750\u2032/30\u2032 specifies about a 230 m heated zone with cold-pins top and bottom having about 9 m lengths. A similar part number with the same specification using high temperature Standard purity MgO cable may be ordered from Pyrotenax Cable Company., 699967=FIG. 71 illustrates a schematic diagram of an embodiment of surface facilities 2800 that may be configured to treat a formation fluid. The formation fluid may be produced though a production well as described herein. The formation fluid may include any of a formation fluid produced by any of the methods as described herein. As shown in FIG. 71, surface facilities 2800 may be coupled to well head 2802. Well head 2802 may also be coupled to a production well formed in a formation. For example, the well head may be coupled to a production well by various mechanical devices proximate an upper surface of the formation. Therefore, a formation fluid produced through a production well may also flow through well head 2802. Well head 2802 may be configured to separate the formation fluid into gas stream 2804, liquid hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806, and water stream 2808., 700926=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that water stream 2808 may flow from well head 2802 to a portion of a formation, to a containment system, or to a processing unit. For example, water stream 2808 may flow from well head 2802 to an ammonia production unit. The surface facilities may be configured such that ammonia produced in the ammonia production unit may flow to an ammonium sulfate unit. The ammonium sulfate unit may be configured to combine the ammonia with H2SO4 or SO2/SO3 to produce ammonium sulfate. In addition, the surface facilities may be configured such that ammonia produced in the ammonia production unit may flow to a urea production unit. The urea production unit may be configured to combine carbon dioxide with the ammonia to produce urea., 616951=FIG. 38 illustrates a flowchart of a Fischer-Tropsch process that uses synthesis gas produced from a hydrocarbon containing formation as a feed stream. Hot formation 1090 may be used to produce synthesis gas having a H2 to CO ratio of approximately 2:1. The proper ratio may be produced by operating synthesis production wells at approximately 700\ufffd C., or by blending synthesis gas produced from different sections of formation to obtain a synthesis gas having approximately a 2:1 H2 to CO ratio. Synthesis gas generating fluid 1092 may be fed into the hot formation 1090 to generate synthesis gas. H2 and CO may be separated from the synthesis gas produced from the hot formation 1090 to form feed stream 1094. Feed stream 1094 may be sent to Fischer-Tropsch plant 1096. Feed stream 1094 may supplement or replace synthesis gas 1098 produced from catalytic methane reformer 1100., 634376=N2 2004 exiting the separator may be utilized in heat exchanger 2006 to condense higher molecular weight hydrocarbons from pyrolysis stream 2008 to remove lower molecular weight hydrocarbons from the gas phase into a liquid oil phase. Upgraded gas stream 2010 containing a higher composition of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons than stream 2008 and liquid stream 2012, which includes condensed hydrocarbons, may exit heat exchanger 2006., 881210=FIG. 166 is a flowchart of an embodiment of an in situ synthesis gas production process 4510 integrated with a SMDS Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process with heat and mass balances. The synthesis gas generating fluid injected into the formation includes about 24,000 metric tons per day of water 4530, which includes about 5,500 metric tons per day of water 4540 recycled from the SMDS Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process 4520. A total of about 1700 MW of energy is supplied to the in situ synthesis gas production process. About 1020 MW of energy 4535 of the approximately 1700 MW of energy is supplied by in situ reaction of an oxidizing fluid with the formation, and approximately 680 MW of energy 4550 is supplied by the SMDS Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process 4520 in the form of steam. About 12,700 cubic meters equivalent oil per day of synthesis gas 4560 is used as feed gas to the SMDS Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process 4520. The SMDS Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process 4520 produces about 4,770 cubic meters per day of products 4570 that may include naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and about 5,880 cubic meters equivalent oil per day of off gas 4580 for a power generation facility., 702587=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that the carbon dioxide stream may flow through a conduit to a formation, to a containment system, to a disposal unit, and/or to another processing unit. In addition, the facilities may be configured such that the hydrogen sulfide stream may also flow through a conduit to a containment system and/or to another processing unit. For example, the hydrogen sulfide stream may be converted into elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit. The gas treatment unit may also be configured to separate gas stream 2804 into stream 2819 that may include heavier hydrocarbon components from gas stream 2804. Heavier hydrocarbon components may include, for example, hydrocarbons having a carbon number of greater than about 5. Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that heavier hydrocarbon components in stream 2819 may be provided to liquid hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806., 694304=FIG. 63 illustrates a pattern of production wells 2701 with inner hexagonal ring 2734 and outer hexagonal ring 2736. Production wells 2701 may be spaced at a distance of 3s. Heat sources 2732 may be located at apices of hexagonal ring 2734 and hexagonal ring 2736. Hexagonal ring 2734 and hexagonal ring 2736 may include six heat sources each. The pattern in FIG. 63 may result in a ratio of heat sources 2732 to production well 2701 of eight., 591837=FIG. 31 illustrates a schematic of an embodiment of a continuous synthesis gas production system. FIG. 31 includes a formation with heat injection wellbore 850 and heat injection wellbore 852. The wellbores may be members of a larger pattern of wellbores placed throughout a portion of the formation. A portion of a formation may be heated to synthesis gas generating temperatures by heating the formation with heat sources, by injecting an oxidizing fluid, or by a combination thereof. Oxidizing fluid 854, such as air or oxygen, and synthesis gas generating fluid 856, such as steam, may be injected into wellbore 850. In one embodiment, the ratio of oxygen to steam may be approximately 1:2 to approximately 1:10, or approximately 1:3 to approximately 1:7 (e.g., about 1:4)., 719831=The total number of heat sources is determined from adding the heat sources counted by, (a) 4, (b) 8/2=4, and (c) 4/4=1, for a total number of 9 heat sources 3000 in unit cell 3012. Therefore, a ratio of heat sources 3000 to production wells 3002 is determined as 9:1 for the pattern illustrated in FIG. 74., 418485=In an embodiment, heat may be generated in or by conduit 582. In this manner, about 10% to about 30%, or, for example, about 20%, of the total heat generated by the heater may be generated in or by conduit 582. Both conductor 580 and conduit 582 may be made of stainless steel. Dimensions of conductor 580 and conduit 582 may be chosen such that the conductor will dissipate heat in a range from approximately 650 watts per meter to 1650 watts per meter. A temperature in conduit 582 may be approximately 480\ufffd C. to approximately 815\ufffd C., and a temperature in conductor 580 may be approximately 500\ufffd C. to 840\ufffd C. Substantially uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be provided along a length of conduit 582 greater than about 300 m or, maybe, greater than about 600 m. A length of conduit 582 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a type of hydrocarbon containing formation, a depth of an opening in the formation, and/or a length of the formation desired for treating., 637017=FIG. 43 illustrates an embodiment of a method for preparing a nitrogen stream for an ammonia and urea process. Air 2060 may be injected into hot carbon containing formation 2062 to produce carbon dioxide by oxidation of carbon in the formation. In an embodiment, a heater may be configured to heat at least a portion of the carbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to support oxidation of the carbon. The temperature sufficient to support oxidation may be, for example, about 260\ufffd C. for coal. Stream 2064 exiting the hot formation may be composed substantially of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Nitrogen may be separated from carbon dioxide by passing the stream through cold spent carbon containing formation 2066. Carbon dioxide may be preferentially adsorbed versus nitrogen in the cold spent formation 2066. For example, at 50\ufffd C. and 0.35 bars, the adsorption of carbon dioxide on a spent portion of coal may be about 72 m3/metric ton compared to about 15.4 m3/metric ton for nitrogen. Nitrogen 2068 exiting the cold spent portion 2066 may be supplied to ammonia production facility 2070 with H2 stream 2072 to produce ammonia 2074. The H2 stream may be obtained by methods disclosed herein, for example, the methods described in FIGS. 41 and 42., 390611=An insulated conductor assembly may include heating sections, cold pins, splices, and termination canisters and flexible transition conductors. The insulated conductor assembly may need to be examined and electrically tested before installation of the assembly into an opening in a formation. The assembly may need to be examined for competent welds and to make sure that there are no holes in the sheath anywhere along the whole heater (including the heated section, the cold-pins, the splices and the termination cans). Periodic X-ray spot checking of the commercial product may need to be made. The whole cable may be immersed in water prior to electrical testing. Electrical testing of the assembly may need to show more than 2000 megaohms at 500 VAC at room temperature after water immersion. In addition, the assembly may need to be connected to 1000 VAC and show less than about 10 microamps per meter of resistive leakage current at room temperature. Also, a check on leakage current at about 760\ufffd C. may need to show less than about 0.4 milliamps per meter., 645627=FIG. 45 illustrates an embodiment configured to treat a relatively permeable formation without substantially pyrolyzing mobilized fluids. Low temperature heat source 2216 may be disposed in production well 2210. Low temperature heat source 2216, conduit 2212, and impermeable layers 2204 may be configured as described in the embodiment shown in FIG. 44. Low temperature heat source 2216 may be further configured to provide heat to formation 2200 to heat some or all of formation 2200 to an average temperature within the mobilization temperature range. Mobilized fluids within formation 2200 may flow towards a bottom of formation 2200 substantially by gravity. Pressurizing fluid 2214 may be provided into formation 2200 through conduit 2212 and may be configured, as described in the embodiment shown in FIG. 44, to increase a flow of the mobilized fluids towards the bottom of formation 2200. Pressurizing fluid 2214 may also be provided into formation 2200 through a conduit disposed in/or proximate to production well 2210. Formation fluids may be removed through production well 2210 at and/or near the bottom of formation 2200. Low temperature heat source 2216 may provide heat to the formation fluids removed through production well 2210. The provided heat may vaporize the removed formation fluids within production well 2210 such that the formation fluids may be removed as a vapor. The provided heat may also increase an API gravity of the removed formation fluids within production well 2210., 673286=FIG. 52 is a view of an embodiment of a heat source pattern for heating heavy hydrocarbons in a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation of relatively low permeability and producing fluids from one or more heater wells. Heat sources 2502 may be arranged in a triangular pattern and may be disposed in heater wells. The heat sources may provide heat to pyrolyze some or all of the fluid in the formation. Fluids may be produced through one or more of the heater wells., 703575=Surface facilities 2800 may also include processing unit 2821. Processing unit 2821 may be configured to separate stream 2818 into a number of streams. Each of the number of streams may be rich in a predetermined component or a predetermined number of compounds. For example, processing unit 2821 may separate stream 2818 into first portion 2820 of stream 2818, second portion 2823 of stream 2818, third portion 2825 of stream 2818, and fourth portion 2831 of stream 2818. First portion 2820 of stream 2818 may include lighter hydrocarbon components such as methane and ethane. The surface facilities may be configured such that first portion 2820 of stream 2818 may flow from gas treatment unit 2810 to power generation unit 2822., 170204=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,215 entitled \u201cIn Situ Energy Recovery,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,214 entitled \u201cIn Situ Energy Recovery From Coal,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/199,213 entitled \u201cEmissionless Energy Recovery From Coal,\u201d filed Apr. 24, 2000. The above-referenced provisional applications are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 710455=Catalyst 2854 may be located in the reaction zone to allow reactions that produce H2 to proceed at relatively low temperatures. Without a catalyst and without membrane separation of H2, a steam reformation reaction may need to be conducted in a series of reactors with temperatures for a shift reaction occurring in excess of 980\ufffd C. With a catalyst and with separation of H2 from the reaction stream, the reaction may occur at temperatures within a range from about 300\ufffd C. to about 600\ufffd C., or within a range from about 400\ufffd C. to about 500\ufffd C. Catalyst 2854 may be any steam reforming catalyst. In selected embodiments, catalyst 2854 is a group VIII transition metal, such as nickel. The catalyst may be supported on porous substrate 2864. The substrate may include group III or group IV elements, such as, but not limited to, aluminum, silicon, titanium, or zirconium. In an embodiment, the substrate is alumina (Al2O3)., 658970=In an embodiment, an in situ process for treating a relatively permeable formation may include providing heat to a portion of a formation from a plurality of heat sources. A plurality of heat sources may be arranged within a relatively permeable formation in a pattern. FIG. 49 illustrates an embodiment of pattern 2404 of heat sources 2400 and production well 2402 that may be configured to treat a relatively permeable formation. Heat sources 2400 may be arranged in a \u201c5 spot\u201d pattern with production well 2402. In the \u201c5 spot\u201d pattern, four heat sources 2400 may be arranged substantially equidistant from production well 2402 and substantially equidistant from each other as depicted in FIG. 49. Depending on, for example, the heat generated by each heat source 2400, a spacing between heat sources 2400 and production well 2402 may be determined by a desired product or a desired production rate. Heat sources 2400 may also be configured as a production well. A spacing between heat sources 2400 and production well 2402 may be, for example, about 15 m. Also, production well 2402 may be configured as a heat source., 644869=In an embodiment, pressurizing fluid 2214 may be provided to formation 2200 through a conduit disposed in/or proximate to production well 2210. The conduit may be configured to provide pressurizing fluid 2214 into formation 2200 proximate to upper impermeable layer 2204., 671846=FIG. 51 may also represent an embodiment in which at least some heavy hydrocarbons may be pyrolyzed and a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons may be vaporized at or near at least two heat sources. Heat sources 2502, 2503, and 2504 may heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to vaporize fluid in the formation. The vaporized fluid may tend to flow in a direction from the heat sources toward production well 2500, asio indicated by the arrows, where the fluid may be produced., 689814=As in other embodiments, it may be desirable to create pyrolysis zones and low viscosity zones sequentially. Heat sources 2705 nearest production well 2701 may be activated first, for example, heat sources 2705 in ring 2702. A substantially uniform temperature pyrolysis zone may be established after a period of time. Fluids that flow through the pyrolysis zone may undergo pyrolysis and vaporization. Once the pyrolysis zone is established, heat sources 2705 in the low viscosity zone substantially near the pyrolysis zone (e.g., heat sources 2705 in ring 2703) may be activated to provide heat to a portion of a low viscosity zone. Fluid may flow inward towards production well 2701 due to a pressure differential between the low viscosity zone and the pyrolysis zone, as indicated by the arrows. A larger low viscosity zone may be developed by repeatedly activating heat sources farther away from the fracture, for example, heat sources 2705 in ring 2704., 693635=FIGS. 62, 63, 64, and 65 illustrate alternate embodiments in which both production wells and heat sources may be located at the apices of a triangular grid. In FIG. 62, a triangular grid, with a spacing of s, may have production wells 2701 spaced at a distance of 2s. A hexagonal pattern may include one ring 2730 of six heat sources 2732. Each heat source 2732 may provide substantially equal amounts of heat to two production wells 2701. Therefore, each ring 2730 of six heat sources 2732 contributes approximately three equivalent heat sources per production well 2701., 389621=A splice 567 may be required to withstand 1000 VAC at 480\ufffd C. Splice material may be high temperature splices made by Idaho Laboratories Corporation or by Pyrotenax Cable Company. A splice may be an internal type of splice or an external splice. An internal splice is typically made without welds on the sheath of the insulated conductor heater. The lack of weld on the sheath may avoid potential weak spots (mechanical and/or electrical) on the insulated cable heater. An external splice is a weld made to couple sheaths of two insulated conductor heaters together. An external splice may need to be leak tested prior to insertion of the insulated cable heater into a formation. Laser welds or orbital TIG (tungsten inert gas) welds may be used to form external splices. An additional strain relief assembly may be placed around an external splice to improve the splice's resistance to bending and to protect the external splice against partial or total parting., 609434=FIG. 35 depicts an embodiment of a synthesis gas generating process from hydrocarbon containing formation 976 with flameless distributed combustor 996. Synthesis gas 980 produced from production well 978 may be fed into gas separation plant 984 where carbon dioxide 986 may be separated from synthesis gas 980. First portion 990 of carbon dioxide may be routed to a formation for sequestration. Second portion 992 of carbon dioxide may also be injected into the formation with synthesis gas generating fluid. Portion 993 of synthesis gas 988 may be fed to heater well 994 for combustion in distributed burner 996 to produce heat for the formation. Portion 998 of synthesis gas 988 may be fed to fuel cell 1000 for the production of electricity. Electricity 1002 may be routed to a power grid. Steam 1004 produced in the fuel cell and steam 1006 produced from combustion in the distributed burner may be fed to the formation for generation of synthesis gas., 614409=The synthesis gas produced by the reformer may include any of the components described above, such as methane. The produced synthesis gas 1070 may be fed to fuel cell 1072. A portion of electricity 1074 produced by the fuel cell may be sent to a power grid. In addition, a portion of electricity 1076 may be used to power electric heater 1064. Carbon dioxide 1078 exiting the fuel cell may be routed to sequestration area 1080., 706067=Third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may include liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d). Major constituents of LPG may include hydrocarbon containing three or four carbon atoms such as propane and butane. Butane may include n-butane or iso-butane. LPG may also include relatively small concentrations of other hydrocarbons such as ethene, propene, butene, and pentene. Depending on the source of LPG and how it has been produced, however, LPG may also include additional components. LPG may be a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal ambient temperatures. LPG may be liquefied, however, when moderate pressure is applied or when the temperature is sufficiently reduced. When such moderate pressure is released, LPG gas may have about 250 times a volume of LPG liquid. Therefore, large amounts of energy may be stored and transported compactly as LPG., 660217=FIG. 50 illustrates an alternate embodiment of pattern 2406 of heat sources 2400 that may be arranged in a \u201c7 spot\u201d pattern with production well 2402. In the \u201c7 spot\u201d pattern, six heat sources 2400 may be arranged substantially equidistant from production well 24O2 and substantially equidistant from each other as depicted in FIG. 50. Heat sources 2400 may also be configured as a production well. Also, production well 2402 may be configured as a heat source. A spacing between heat sources 2400 and production well 2402 may be determined as described in any of the above embodiments., 669700=FIG. 51 is a view of an embodiment of a heat source and production well pattern for heating heavy hydrocarbons in a relatively low permeability formation. Heat sources 2502, 2503, and 2504 may be arranged in a triangular pattern with the heat sources at the apices of the triangular grid. A production well 2500 may be located proximate to the center of the triangular grid. In other embodiments, production well 2500 may be placed at any location on the grid pattern. Heat sources may be arranged in patterns other than the triangular pattern shown in FIG. 51. For example, wells may be arranged in square patterns. Heat sources 2502, 2503, and 2504 may heat the formation to a temperature at which at least some of the heavy hydrocarbons in the formation can pyrolyze. Pyrolyzation fluids may tend to flow toward the production well, as indicated by the arrows, and formation fluids may be produced through production well 2500., 401772=Support member 564 and lead-in conductor 572 may be coupled to wellhead 590 at surface 550 of formation 516. Surface conductor 545 may enclose cement 544 and may couple to wellhead 590. Embodiments of heater source surface conductor 545 may have a diameter of about 10.16 cm to about 30.48 cm or, for example, a diameter of about 22 cm. Embodiments of surface casings may extend to depths of approximately 3 m to approximately 515 m into an opening in the formation. Alternatively, the surface casing may extend to a depth of approximately 9 m into the opening. Electrical current may be supplied from a power source to insulated conductor heater 562 to generate heat due to the electrical resistance of conductor 575 as illustrated in FIG. 16. As an example, a voltage of about 330 volts and a current of about 266 amps are supplied to insulated conductors 562 to generate a heat of about 1150 watts/meter in insulated conductor heater 562. Heat generated from the three insulated conductor heaters 562 may transfer (e.g., by radiation) within opening 514 to heat at least a portion of the formation 516., 631189=The amount of N2 in the enriched air may be adjusted to provide a N:H ratio of about 3:1 for ammonia production. It may be desirable to generate synthesis gas at a temperature that may favor the production of carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide. It may be advantageous for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C., and about 550\ufffd C. In another embodiment, it may be desirable for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C., and about 450\ufffd C. Synthesis gas produced at such low temperatures may be substantially composed of N2, H2, and carbon dioxide with little carbon monoxide., 865439=Computer simulations have demonstrated that carbon dioxide may be sequestered in both a deep coal formation and a post treatment coal formation. The Comet2 Simulator determined the amount of carbon dioxide that could be sequestered in a San Juan Basin type deep coal formation and a post treatment coal formation. The simulator also determined the amount of methane produced from the San Juan Basin type deep coal formation due to carbon dioxide injection. The model employed for both the deep coal formation and the post treatment coal formation was a 1.3 km2 area, with a repeating 5 spot well pattern. The 5 spot well pattern included four injection wells arranged in a square and one production well at the center of the square. The properties of the San Juan Basin and the post treatment coal formations are shown in Table 8. Additional details of simulations of carbon dioxide sequestration in deep coal formations and comparisons with field test results may be found in Pilot Test Demonstrates How Carbon Dioxide Enhances Coal Bed Methane Recovery, Lanny Schoeling and Michael McGovern, Petroleum Technology Digest, September 2000, p. 14-15., 652070=Production well 2210 may also be further configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. For example, production well 2210 may include a valve configured to alter, maintain, and/or control a pressure of at least a portion of the formation., 878097=The simulation modeled a sequestration process over a time period of about 3800 days for the post treatment coal formation model. The simulation modeled removal of water from the post treatment coal formation with production from all five wells. During about the first 200 days, the production rate of water was about 680,000 standard m3/day. From about 200-3300 days the water production rate was between about 210,000 to about 480,000 standard m3/day. Production rate of water was negligible after about 3300 days. Carbon dioxide injection was started at approximately 370 days at a flow rate of about 113,000 standard m3/day. The injection rate of carbon dioxide was increased to about 226,000 standard m3/day at approximately 1440 days. The injection rate remained at 226,000 standard m3/day until the end of the simulated injection., 341253=After the portion of the formation reaches a temperature sufficient to support oxidation, an oxidizing fluid may be provided into the opening to oxidize at least a portion of the hydrocarbons at a reaction zone, or a heat source zone, within the formation. Oxidation of the hydrocarbons will generate heat at the reaction zone. The generated heat will in most embodiments transfer from the reaction zone to a pyrolysis zone in the formation. In certain embodiments the generated heat will transfer at a rate between about 650 watts per meter as measured along a depth of the reaction zone, and/or 1650 watts per meter as measured along a depth of the reaction zone. Upon oxidation of at least some of the hydrocarbons in the formation, energy supplied to the heater for initially heating may be reduced or may be turned off. As such, energy input costs may be significantly reduced, thereby providing a significantly more efficient system for heating the formation., 658274=In addition, pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled such that a production rate of formation fluids may be controlled. The pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled through, for example, production well 2302, heat sources 2300, and/or a pressure control well disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200., 691216=In FIG. 58, production well 2701 and heat source 2712 may be located at the apices of a triangular grid. The triangular grid may be an equilateral triangular grid with sides of length, s. Production wells 2701 may be spaced at a distance of about 1.732(s). Production well 2701 may be disposed at a center of a hexagonal pattern with one ring 2713 of six heat sources 2712. Each heat source 2712 may provide substantially equal amounts of heat to three production wells. Therefore, each ring 2713 of six heat sources 2712 may contribute approximately two equivalent heat sources per production well 2701., 685160=FIG. 56 is an expanded view of an embodiment shown in FIG. 55. FIG. 56 illustrates a formation with two fractures 2645 a and 2645 b along plane 2645 and two fractures 2646 a and 2646 b along plane 2646. Each fracture may be produced using production wells 2640. Plane 2645 and plane 2646 may be substantially parallel. The length of a fracture created by hydraulic fracturing in relatively low permeability formations may be between about 75 m and about 100 m. In some embodiments, the vertical hydraulic fracture may be between about 100 m and about 125 m. Vertical hydraulic fractures may propagate substantially equal distances along a plane from a production well. Therefore, since it may be undesirable for fractures along the same plane to join, the distance between production wells along the same plane may be between about 100 m and about 150 m. As the distance between fractures on different planes increases, for example the distance between plane 2645 and plane 2646, the flow of mobilized fluids farthest from either fracture may decrease. A distance between fractures on different planes that may be economical and effective for the transport of mobilized fluids to the pyrolysis zone may be about 40 m to about 80 m., 620397=FIG. 40 depicts an embodiment of in situ synthesis gas production integrated with a catalytic methanation process. For example, synthesis gas 1140 exiting production well 1142 may be supplied to catalytic lethanation plant 1144. In some embodiments, it may be desirable for the composition of produced synthesis gas, which may be used as a feed gas for a catalytic methanation process, to have a H2 to carbon monoxide ratio of about three to one. Methane 1146 may be produced by catalytic methanation plant 1144. Steam 1148 produced by plant 1144 may be supplied to injection well 1141 for production of synthesis gas. Examples of a catalytic methanation process are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,148 to Child; U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,575 to Jorn et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,825 to Stroud et al., which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 707741=Surface facilities 2800 may also be configured such that fourth portion 2831 of stream 2818 may flow from the gas treatment unit to hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828. Hydrogen containing stream 2830 is shown exiting hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828. Examples of hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828 may include a steam reformer and a catalytic flameless distributed combustor with a hydrogen separation membrane. FIG. 72 illustrates an embodiment of a catalytic flameless distributed combustor. An example of a catalytic flameless distributed combustor with a hydrogen separation membrane is illustrated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/273,354, filed on Mar. 5, 2001, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. A catalytic flameless distributed combustor may include fuel line 2850, oxidant line 2852, catalyst 2854, and membrane 2856. Fourth portion 2831 of stream 2818 may be provided to hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828 as fuel 2858. Fuel 2858 within fuel line 2850 may mix within reaction zone in annular space 2859 between the fuel line and the oxidant line. Reaction of the fuel with the oxidant in the presence of catalyst 2854 may produce reaction products that include H2. Membrane 2856 may allow a portion of the generated H2 to pass into annular space 2860 between outer wall 2862 of oxidant line 2852 and membrane 2856. Excess fuel passing out of fuel line 2850 may be circulated back to entrance of hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828. Combustion products leaving oxidant line 2852 may include carbon dioxide and other reactions products as well as some fuel and oxidant. The fuel and oxidant may be separated and recirculated back to the hydrogen manufacturing unit. Carbon dioxide may be separated from the exit stream. The carbon dioxide may be sequestered within a portion of a formation or used for an alternate purpose., 225702=Certain embodiments may include monitoring a composition of the produced synthesis gas, and then controlling heating and/or controlling input of the synthesis gas generating fluid to maintain the composition of the produced synthesis gas within a desired range. For example, in some embodiments (e.g., such as when the synthesis gas will be used as a feedstock for a Fischer-Tropsch process) a desired composition of the produced synthesis gas may have a ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of about 1.8:1 to 2.2:1 (e.g., about 2:1 or about 2.1:1). In some embodiments (such as when the synthesis gas will be used as a feedstock to make methanol) such ratio may be about 3:1 (e.g., about 2.8:1 to 3.2:1)., 716779=FIG. 73 illustrates an embodiment of an additional processing unit that may be included in surface facilities 2800 such as the facilities depicted in FIG. 71. Air 2903 may be fed to air separation unit 2900. Air separation unit 2900 may be configured to generate nitrogen stream 2902 and oxygen stream 2905. Oxygen stream 2905 and steam 2904 may be injected into exhausted coal resource 2906 to generate synthesis gas 2907. Produced synthesis gas 2907 may be provided to Shell Middle Distillates process unit 2910 that may be configured to produce middle distillates 2912. In addition, produced synthesis gas 2907 may be provided to catalytic methanation process unit 2914 that may be configured to produce natural gas 2916. Produced synthesis gas 2907 may also be provided to methanol production unit 2918 to produce methanol 2920. Furthermore, produced synthesis gas 2907 may be provided to process unit 2922 for production of ammonia and/or urea 2924, and fuel cell 2926 that may be configured to produce electricity 2928. Synthesis gas 2907 may also be routed to power generation unit 2930, such as a turbine or combustor, to produce electricity 2932., 698099=FIG. 69 illustrates triangular patterns of heat sources with three rings of heat sources surrounding each production well. Production wells 2760 may be surrounded by ring 2774 of three heat sources 2762. Irregular hexagon pattern 2776 of nine heat sources 2762 may surround ring 2774. Third set 2778 of heat sources 2762 may surround hexagonal pattern 2776. Third set 2778 may contribute four equivalent heat sources to production well 2760. A ratio of equivalent heat sources to production well 2760 may be sixteen., 854552=FIG. 162 is an example of a low temperature in situ synthesis gas production that occurs at a temperature of about 450\ufffd C. with heat and mass balances in a hydrocarbon containing formation that was previously pyrolyzed. A total of about 42,900 metric tons per day of water is injected into formation 4100 which may be char. FIG. 162 illustrates that a portion of water 4102 at 25\ufffd C. is injected directly into the formation 4100. A portion of water 4102 is converted into steam 4104 at a temperature of about 130\ufffd C., and a pressure at about 3 bar absolute using about 1227 MWe of energy 4106 and injected into formation 4100. A portion of the remaining steam may be converted into steam 4108 at a temperature of about 450\ufffd C., and a pressure at about 3 bar absolute using about 318 MWe of energy 4110. The synthesis gas production involves about 23% conversion of 13,137 metric tons per day of char to produce 56.6 millions of cubic meters per day of synthesis gas with an energy content of 5,230 MW. About 238 MW of energy 4112 is supplied to formation 4100 to account for the endothermic heat of reaction of the synthesis gas reaction. The product stream 4114 of the synthesis gas reaction includes 29,470 metric tons per day of water at 46 volume percent, 501 metric tons per day carbon monoxide at 0.7 volume percent, 540 tons per day H2 at 10.7 volume percent, 26,455 metric tons per day carbon dioxide at 23.8 volume percent, and 7,610 metric tons per day methane at 18.8 volume percent., 660904=It is to be understood a geometrical pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 is described herein by example. A pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 may vary depending on, for example, the type of relatively permeable formation configured to be treated. For example, a pattern of heat sources 2400 and production wells 2402 may include a pattern as described in any of the embodiments herein. In addition, a location of a production well 2402 within a pattern of heat sources 2400 may be determined by, for example, a desired heating rate of the relatively permeable formation, a heating rate of the heat sources, a type of heat source, a type of relatively permeable formation, a composition of the relatively permeable formation, a viscosity of the relatively permeable formation, and/or a desired production rate., 873273=The simulation modeled a sequestration process over a time period of about 3700 days for the deep coal formation model. Removal of the water in the coal formation was simulated by production from all five wells. The production rate of water was about 40 m3/day for about the first 370 days. The production rate of water decreased significantly after the first 370 days. It continued to decrease through the remainder of the simulation run to about zero at the end. Carbon dioxide injection was started at approximately 370 days at a flow rate of about 113,000 standard (in this context \u201cstandard\u201d means 1 atmosphere pressure and 15.5 degrees Celsius) m3/day. The injection rate of carbon dioxide was doubled to about 226,000 standard m3/day at approximately 1440 days. The injection rate remained at about 226,000 standard m3/day until the end of the simulation run., 617954=Fischer-Tropsch plant 1096 may produce wax feed stream 1102. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process that produces wax feed stream 1102 is an exothermic process. Steam 1104 may be generated during the Fischer-Tropsch process. Steam 1104 may be used as a portion of synthesis gas generating fluid 1092., 569491=Removal of hydrocarbons due to treating at least a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation, as described in any of the above embodiments, may also occur on a microscopic scale. Hydrocarbons may be removed from micropores within the portion due to heating. Micropores may be generally defined as pores having a cross-sectional dimension of less than about 1000 \u212b. In this manner, removal of solid hydrocarbons may result in a substantially uniform increase in porosity within at least a selected section of the heated portion. Heating the portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation, as described in any of the above embodiments, may substantially uniformly increase a porosity of a selected section within the heated portion. In the context of this patent \u201csubstantially uniform porosity\u201d means that the assessed (e.g., calculated or estimated) porosity of any selected portion in the formation does not vary by more than about 25% from the assessed average porosity of such selected portion., 443847=Elongated members 600 may be configured to generate heat of approximately 650 watts per meter of elongated members 600 to approximately 1650 watts per meter of elongated members 600. In this manner, elongated members 600 may be at a temperature of approximately 480\ufffd C. to approximately 815\ufffd C. Substantially uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be provided along a length of elongated members 600 greater than about 305 m or, maybe, greater than about 610 m. A length of elongated members 600 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a type of hydrocarbon containing formation, a depth of an opening in the formation, and/or a length of the formation desired for treating., 652353=FIG. 47 illustrates an embodiment for treating a relatively permeable formation using horizontal heat sources. Heat source 2300 may be disposed within relatively permeable formation 2200. Relatively permeable formation 2200 may be substantially below impermeable layer 2204. Impermeable layer 2204 may include, but may not be limited to, shale or carbonate. Impermeable layer 2204 may have a thickness of about 20 m or more. As in FIG. 46, a thickness of impermeable layer 2204 may depend on, for example, a geographic location of impermeable layer 2204. Heat source 2300 may be disposed horizontally within relatively permeable formation 2200. Heat source 2300 may be configured to provide heat to a portion of relatively permeable formation 2200. Heat source 2300 may include a low temperature heat source and/or a high temperature heat source as described in any of the above embodiments. The provided heat may be configured to substantially mobilize a portion of heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200 as in any of the embodiments described herein. The provided heat may also be configured to pyrolyze a portion of heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200 as in any of the embodiments described herein. A length of heat source 2300 disposed within relatively permeable formation 2200 may be between about 50 m to about 1500 m. The length of heat source 2300 within relatively permeable formation 2200 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a width of relatively permeable formation 2200, a desired production rate, and an energy output of heat source 2300., 696083=FIGS. 66, 67, 68, and 69 illustrate patterns in which the production well may be disposed at a center of a triangular grid such that the production well may be equidistant from the apices of the triangular grid. In FIG. 66, the triangular grid of heater wells with a spacing of s may include production wells 2760 spaced at a distance of s. Each production well 2760 may be surrounded by ring 2764 of three heat sources 2762. Each heat source 2762 may provide substantially equal amounts of heat to three production wells 2760. Therefore, each ring 2764 of three heat sources 2762 may contribute one equivalent heat source per production well 2760., 686523=Plane 2648 and plane 2649 may include heat sources that may provide heat sufficient to create a pyrolysis zone between plane 2648 and plane 2649. Plane 2651 and plane 2652 may include heat sources that create a pyrolysis zone between plane 2651 and plane 2652. Heat sources in regions 2650, 2660, 2655, and 2656 may provide heat that may create low viscosity zones. Mobilized fluids in regions 2650, 2660, 2655, and 2656 may tend to flow in a direction toward the closest fracture in the formation. Mobilized fluids entering the pyrolysis zone may be pyrolyzed. Pyrolyzation fluids may be produced from production wells 2640., 713277=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806 may flow through a conduit from well head 2802 to hydrotreating unit 2834. Hydrotreating unit 2834 may be configured to hydrogenate hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806 to form hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836. The hydrotreater may be configured to upgrade and swell the hydrocarbon condensate. For example, surface facilities 2800 may also be configured to provide stream 2832 (which includes a relatively high concentration of hydrogen) to hydrotreating unit 2834. In this manner, H2 in stream 2832 may hydrogenate a double bond of the hydrocarbon condensate, thereby reducing a potential for polymerization of the hydrocarbon condensate. In addition, hydrogen may also neutralize radicals in the hydrocarbon condensate. In this manner, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate may include relatively short chain hydrocarbon fluids. Furthermore, hydrotreating unit 2834 may be configured to reduce sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatic hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon condensate stream 2806. Hydrotreating unit 2834 may be a deep hydrotreating unit or a mild hydrotreating unit. An appropriate hydrotreating unit may vary depending on, for example, a composition of stream 2832, a composition of the hydrocarbon condensate stream, and/or a selected composition of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream., 643976=In addition, pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be controlled to produce a desired quality of formation fluids. For example, the pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may be increased to produce formation fluids with an increased API gravity as compared to formation fluids produced at a lower pressure. Increasing the pressure in relatively permeable formation 2200 may increase a hydrogen partial pressure in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids. The increased hydrogen partial pressure in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids may reduce heavy hydrocarbons in mobilized and/or pyrolyzation fluids. Reducing the heavy hydrocarbons may produce lighter, more valuable hydrocarbons. An API gravity of the hydrogenated heavy hydrocarbons may be substantially higher than an API gravity of the un-hydrogenated heavy hydrocarbons., 658687=Production well 2302 may also be further configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. For example, production well 2302 may include a valve configured to alter, maintain, and/or control a pressure of at least a portion of the formation., 709831=Fuel line 2850 may be concentrically positioned within oxidant line 2852. Critical flow orifices within fuel line 2850 may be configured to allow fuel to enter into a reaction zone in annular space 2859 between the fuel line and oxidant line 2852. The fuel line may carry a mixture of water and vaporized hydrocarbons such as, but not limited to, methane, ethane, propane, butane, methanol, ethanol, or combinations thereof. The oxidant line may carry an oxidant such as, but not limited to, air, oxygen enriched air, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or combinations thereof., 642936=Production wells 2210 may be configured to remove pyrolyzation fluids and/or mobilized fluids from selected pyrolyzation section 2202. Formation fluids may be removed as a vapor. The formation fluids may be further upgraded by high temperature heat source 2218 and low temperature heat source 2216 in production well 2210. Production well 2210 may be further configured to control pressure in selected pyrolyzation section 2202 to provide a pressure gradient so that mobilized fluids flow into selected pyrolyzation section 2202 from the selected mobilization section. In some embodiments, pressure in selected pyrolyzation section 2202 may be controlled to in turn control the flow of the mobilized fluids into selected pyrolyzation section 2202. By not heating the entire formation to pyrolyzation temperatures, the drainage process may produce a substantially higher ratio of energy produced versus energy input for the in situ conversion process., 656755=In an embodiment, production well 2302 may remain closed until a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze at least a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons in the selected pyrolyzation section may be reached. Doing so may inhibit production of substantial amounts of unfavorable heavy hydrocarbons from relatively permeable formation 2200. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and/or reduce the life of production equipment., 679784=FIG. 53 is a view of an embodiment of a heat source and production well pattern illustrating a pyrolysis zone and a low viscosity zone. Heat sources 2512 along plane 2504 and plane 2506 may heat planar region 2508 to create a pyrolysis zone. Heating may create thermal fractures 2510 in the pyrolysis zone. Heating with heat sources 2514 in planes 2516, 2518, 2520, and 2522 may create a low viscosity zone with an increased permeability due to thermal fractures. Pressure differential between the low viscosity zone and the pyrolysis zone may force mobilized fluid from the low viscosity zone into the pyrolysis zone. The permeability created by thermal fractures 2510 may be sufficiently high to create a substantially uniform pyrolysis zone. Pyrolyzation fluids may be produced through production well 2500., 681625=FIG. 54 is an expanded view of the pattern shown in FIG. 53. The four planar vertical regions 2540 that correspond to region 2508 in FIG. 53, may include heat sources that may create pyrolysis zones. Regions 2548, 2550, and 2552 may include heat sources that apply heat to create a low viscosity zone. Production wells 2500 may be disposed in regions where pyrolysis occurs and may be configured to remove the pyrolyzation fluids. In one embodiment, a length of the pyrolysis zones 2540 may be between about 75 m and about 100 m. In another embodiment, a length of the pyrolysis zones may be between about 100 m and about 125 m. In another embodiment, an average distance between production wells in the same plane may be between about 100 m and about 150 m. In one embodiment, a distance between plane 2542 and plane 2544 may be between about 40 m and about 80 m. In some embodiments, more than one production well may be disposed in a region where pyrolysis occurs. Plane 2542 and plane 2544 may be substantially parallel. The formation may include additional planar vertical pyrolysis zones that may be substantially parallel to each other. Hot fluids may be provided into vertical planar regions such that in situ pyrolysis of heavy hydrocarbons may occur. Pyrolyzation fluids may be removed by production wells disposed in the vertical planar regions., 691910=FIG. 59 illustrates a pattern of production wells 2701 with an inner hexagonal ring 2713 and an outer hexagonal ring 2715 of heat sources 2712. In this pattern, production wells 2701 may be spaced at a distance of about 2(1.732)s. Heat sources 2712 may be located at all other grid positions. This pattern may result in a ratio of equivalent heat sources to production wells that may approach eleven., 688898=FIG. 57 illustrates an embodiment of a pattern of heat sources 2705 that may create a radial pyrolysis zone surrounded by a low viscosity zone. Production well 2701 may be surrounded by concentric rings 2702, 2703, and 2704 of heat sources 2705. Heat sources 2705 in ring 2702 may heat the formation to create radial pyrolysis zone 2710. Heat sources 2705 in rings 2703 and 2704 outside pyrolysis zone 2710 may heat the formation to create a low viscosity zone. Mobilized fluids may flow radially inward from the low viscosity zone to the pyrolysis zone 2710. Fluids may be produced through production well 2701. In one embodiment, an average distance between heat sources may be between about 2 m and about 10 m. Alternatively, the average distance may be between about 10 m and about 20 m., 640474=High temperature heat source 2218 may generally refer to a heat source, or heater, configured to provide heat to selected pyrolyzation section 2202 of formation 2200 substantially adjacent to the heat source 2218. The provided heat may be configured to heat selected pyrolyzation section 2202 to an average temperature within a pyrolization temperature range of the heavy hydrocarbons contained within formation 2200. The pyrolization temperature range may be between about 270\ufffd C. to about 400\ufffd C. A selected pyrolization temperature may be about 300\ufffd C. The pyrolization temperature may vary, however, depending on formation characteristics, composition, pressure, and/or a desired quality of a product produced from formation 2200. A quality of the product may be determined based upon properties of the product, (e.g., the API gravity of the product). Pyrolyzation may include cracking of the heavy hydrocarbons into hydrocarbon fragments and/or lighter hydrocarbons. Pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons tends to upgrade the quality of the heavy hydrocarbons., 650500=In another embodiment, pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons may be increased by replacing low temperature heat source 2216 with high temperature heat source 2218 within injection well 2220. High temperature heat source 2218 may provide for substantially more pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons within layers 2201 than low temperature heat source 2216. The formation fluids removed through production well 2210 may be substantially upgraded as compared to the formation fluids removed in a process using low temperature heat source 2216 within injection well 2220 as described in the embodiment shown in FIG. 46., 628085=FIG. 41 illustrates an embodiment of a method for production of ammonia and urea from synthesis gas using membrane-enriched air. Enriched air 1170 and steam, or water, 1172 may be fed into hot carbon containing formation 1174 to produce synthesis gas 1176 in a wet oxidation mode as described herein., 711482=Membrane 2856 may remove H2 from a reaction stream within a reaction zone of a hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828. When H2 is removed from the reaction stream, reactions within the reaction zone may generate additional H2. A vacuum may draw H2 from an annular region between membrane 2856 and wall 2862 of oxidant line 2852. Alternately, H2 may be removed from the annular region in a carrier gas. Membrane 2856 may separate H2 from other components within the reaction stream. The other components may include, but are not limited to, reaction products, fuel, water, and hydrogen sulfide. The membrane may be a hydrogen-permeable and hydrogen selective material such as, but not limited to, a ceramic, carbon, metal, or combination thereof. The membrane may include, but is not limited to, metals of group VIII, V, III, or I such as palladium, platinum, nickel, silver, tantalum, vanadium, yttrium, and/or niobium. The membrane may be supported on a porous substrate such as alumina. The support may separate the membrane 2856 from catalyst 2854. The separation distance and insulation properties of the support may help to maintain the membrane within a desired temperature range. In this manner, hydrogen manufacturing unit 2828 may be configured to produce hydrogen-rich stream 2830 from the second portion stream 2818. The surface facilities may also be configured such that hydrogen-rich stream 2830 may flow into hydrogen stream 2816 to form stream 2832. In this manner, stream 2832 may include a larger volume of hydrogen than either hydrogen-rich stream 2830 or hydrogen stream 2816., 649852=In another embodiment, high temperature heat source 2218 may be replaced with low temperature heat source 2216 within production well 2210. Low temperature heat source 2216 may provide for substantially less pyrolyzation of the heavy hydrocarbons within layers 2201 than high temperature heat source 2218. Therefore, the formation fluids removed through production well 2210 may not be as substantially upgraded as formation fluids removed through production well 2210 with high temperature heat source 2218, as described for the embodiment shown in FIG. 46., 856161=FIG. 163 is an example of a high temperature in situ synthesis gas production that occurs at a temperature of about 650\ufffd C. with heat and mass balances in a hydrocarbon containing formation that was previously pyrolyzed. A total of about 34,352 metric tons per day of water is injected into formation 4200. FIG. 163 illustrates that a portion of water 4202 at 25\ufffd C. is injected directly into formation 4200. A portion of water 4202 is converted into steam 4204 at a temperature of about 130\ufffd C., and a pressure at about 3 bar absolute using about 982 MW of energy 4206, and injected into formation 4200. A portion of the remaining steam is converted into steam 4208 at a temperature of about 650\ufffd C., and a pressure at about 3 bar absolute using about 413 MW of energy 4210. The synthesis gas production involves about 22% conversion of 12,771 metric tons per day of char to produce 56.6 millions of cubic meters per day of synthesis gas with an energy content of 5,699 MW. About 898 MW of energy 4212 is supplied to formation 4200 to account for the endothermic heat of reaction of the synthesis gas reaction. The product stream 4214 of the synthesis gas reaction includes 10,413 metric tons per day of water at 22.8 volume percent, 9,988 metric tons per day carbon monoxide at 14.1 volume percent, 1771 metric tons per day H2 at 35 volume percent, 21,410 metric tons per day carbon dioxide at 19.3 volume percent, and 3535 metric tons per day methane at 8.7 volume percent., 612033=As shown in FIG. 37, heater well 1060 may be located within hydrocarbon containing formation 1062. Additional heater wells may also be located within the formation. Heater well 1060 may include electric heater 1064. Pyrolysis fluid 1066 produced from the formation may be fed to a reformer, such as steam reformer 1068, to produce synthesis gas 1070. A portion of the pyrolysis products may be used as fuel in the reformer. Steam reformer 1068 may include a catalyst material that promotes the reforming reaction and a burner to supply heat for the endothermic reforming reaction. A steam source may be connected to the reformer section to provide steam for the reforming reaction. The burner may operate at temperatures well above that required by the reforming reaction and well above the operating temperatures of fuel cells. As such, it may be desirable to operate the burner as a separate unit independent of the fuel cell., 337100=The total number of heat sources 400 in unit cell 404 may include six full heat sources 400 a that are each counted as one heat source, and six partial heat sources 400 b that are each counted as one half of a heat source. Therefore, a ratio of heat sources 400 to production wells 402 in unit cell 404 may be determined as 9:1. A ratio of heat sources to production wells may vary, however, depending on, for example, the desired heating rate of the hydrocarbon containing formation, the heating rate of the heat sources, the type of heat source, the type of hydrocarbon containing formation, the composition of hydrocarbon containing formation, the desired composition of the produced fluid, and/or the desired production rate. Providing more heat sources wells per unit area will allow faster heating of the selected portion and thus hastening the onset of production, however more heat sources will generally cost more money to install. An appropriate ratio of heat sources to production wells may also include ratios greater than about 5:1, and ratios greater than about 7:1. In some embodiments an appropriate ratio of heat sources to production wells may be about 10:1, 20:1, 50:1 or greater. If larger ratios are used, then project costs tend to decrease since less wells and equipment are needed., 379108=As illustrated in FIG. 17, an insulated conductor heater 562 will in many instances be designed to operate at a power level of up to about 1650 watts/meter. The insulated conductor heater 562 may typically operate at a power level between about 500 watts/meter and about 1150 watts/meter when heating a formation. The insulated conductor heater 562 may be designed so that a maximum voltage level at a typical operating temperature does not cause substantial thermal and/or electrical breakdown of electrical insulation 576. The insulated conductor heater 562 may be designed so that the sheath 577 does not exceed a temperature that will result in a significant reduction in corrosion resistance properties of the sheath material., 906625=A three-dimensional (3-D) simulation model was used to simulate an in situ conversion process for a tar sand containing formation. A heat injection rate was calculated using a separate numerical code (CFX; AEA Technology, Oxfordshire, UK). The heat injection rate was calculated at 500 watts per foot (1640 watts per meter). The 3-D simulation was based on a dilation-recompaction model for tar sands. A target zone thickness of 50 meters was used. Input data for the simulation were as follows:, 721164=In certain embodiments, a triangular pattern of heat sources may provide advantages when compared to alternative patterns of heat sources, such as squares, hexagons, and hexagons with additional heaters installed halfway between the hexagon corners (12 to 1 pattern). Squares, hexagons, and the 12:1 patterns are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,923,535 and/or in U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,118. For example, a triangular pattern of heat sources may provide more uniform heating of a hydrocarbon containing formation resulting from a more uniform temperature distribution of an area of a formation heated by the pattern of heat sources., 631858=As illustrated in FIG. 41, a feed stream for ammonia production may be prepared by first feeding synthesis gas stream 1176 into ammonia feed stream gas processing unit 1178. In ammonia feed stream gas processing unit 1178 the feed stream may undergo a shift reaction (to shift the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and to produce additional hydrogen). Carbon dioxide can also be removed from the feed stream, and the feed stream can be methanated (to remove residual carbon monoxide)., 734744=Numerical calculations have been made for a natural distributed combustor system configured to heat a hydrocarbon containing formation. A commercially available program called PRO-II was used to make example calculations based on a conduit of diameter 6.03 cm with a wall thickness of 0.39 cm. The conduit was disposed in an opening in the formation with a diameter of 14.4 cm. The conduit had critical flow orifices of 1.27 mm diameter spaced 183 cm apart. The conduit was configured to heat a formation of 91.4 meters thick. A flow rate of air was 1.70 standard cubic meters per minute through the critical flow orifices. A pressure of air at the inlet of the conduit was 7 bars absolute. Exhaust gases had a pressure of 3.3 bars absolute. A heating output of 1066 watts per meter was used. A temperature in the opening was set at 760\ufffd C. The calculations determined a minimal pressure drop within the conduit of about 0.023 bar. The pressure drop within the opening was less than 0.0013 bar., 907348=Permeability=1000 millidarcy;, 633563=FIG. 42 illustrates a flowchart of an embodiment for production of ammonia and urea from synthesis gas using cryogenically separated air. Air 2000 may be fed into cryogenic air separation unit 2002. Cryogenic separation involves a distillation process that may occur at temperatures between about (\u2212168)\ufffd C., and (\u2212172)\ufffd C. In other embodiments, the distillation process may occur at temperatures between about (\u2212165)\ufffd C., and (\u2212175)\ufffd C. Air may liquefy in these temperature ranges. The distillation process may be operated at a pressure between about 8 bars absolute and about 10 bars absolute. High pressures may be achieved by compressing air and exchanging heat with cold air exiting the column. Nitrogen is more volatile than oxygen and may come off as a distillate product., 715637=Alternatively, surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836 may flow to a splitter or an ethene production unit. The splitter may be configured to separate the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream into a hydrocarbon stream including components having carbon numbers of 5 or 6, a naphtha stream, a kerosene stream, and a diesel stream. Streams exiting the splitter may be fed to the ethene production unit. In addition, the hydrocarbon condensate stream and the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream may be fed to the ethene production unit. Ethene produced by the ethene production unit may be fed to a petrochemical complex to produce base and industrial chemicals and polymers. Alternatively, the streams exiting the splitter may be fed to a hydrogen conversion unit. A recycle stream may be configured to flow from the hydrogen conversion unit to the splitter. The hydrocarbon stream exiting the splitter and the naphtha stream may be fed to a mogas production unit. The kerosene stream and the diesel stream may be distributed as product., 222490=Certain embodiments may include providing heat from one or more heat sources to heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation (e.g., in a range of approximately 400\ufffd C. to approximately 1200\ufffd C. or higher). At a lower end of the temperature range, generated synthesis gas may have a high hydrogen (H2) to carbon monoxide (CO) ratio. At an upper end of the temperature range, generated synthesis gas may include mostly H2 and CO in lower ratios (e.g., approximately a 1:1 ratio)., 626964=In one embodiment, the H2 to N2 ratio of the feed stream provided to the ammonia synthesis process may be approximately 3:1. In other embodiments, the ratio may range from approximately 2.8:1 to 3.2:1. An ammonia synthesis feed stream having a selected H2 to N2 ratio may be obtained by blending feed streams produced from different portions of the formation., 657253=In addition, heat may be provided within production well 2302 to vaporize the removed formation fluids. Heat may also be provided within production well 2302 to pyrolyze and/or upgrade the removed formation fluids as described in any of the embodiments herein., 655148=Heat sources 2300 may provide heat to substantially mobilize a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200. The mobilized fluids may flow towards a bottom of relatively permeable formation 2200 substantially by gravity. The mobilized fluids may be removed through production well 2302. Each of heat sources 2300 disposed at or near the bottom of relatively permeable formation 2200 may be configured to heat some or all of a section proximate the bottom of formation 2200 to a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze heavy hydrocarbons within the section. Such a section may be referred to as a selected pyrolyzation section. A temperature within the selected pyrolyzation section may be between about 270\ufffd C., and about 400\ufffd C., and may be configured as described in any of the embodiments herein. Pyrolysis of the heavy hydrocarbons within the selected pyrolyzation section may convert at least a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons into pyrolyzation fluids. The pyrolyzation fluids may be removed through production well 2302. Production well 2302 may be disposed within the selected pyrolyzation section. In some embodiments, one or more of heat sources 2300 may be turned down and/or off after substantially mobilizing the majority of the heavy hydrocarbons within relatively permeable formation 2200. Doing so may more efficiently heat the formation and/or may save on input energy costs associated with the in situ process. Also, heating during \u201coff peak\u201d times may be cheaper., 699376=FIG. 70 depicts an embodiment of a pattern of heat sources 2705 arranged in a triangular pattern. Production well 2701 may be surrounded by triangles 2780, 2782, and 2784 of heat sources 2705. Heat sources 2705 in triangles 2780, 2782, and 2784 may provide heat to the formation. The provided heat may raise an average temperature of the formation to a pyrolysis temperature. Pyrolyzation fluids may flow to production well 2701. Formation fluids may be produced in production well 2701., 657547=A pressurizing fluid may be provided into relatively permeable formation 2200 through heat sources 2300. The pressurizing fluid may increase the flow of the mobilized fluids towards production well 2302. For example, increasing the pressure of the pressurizing fluid proximate heat sources 2300 will tend to increase the flow of the mobilized fluids towards production well 2302. The pressurizing fluid may include, but may not be limited to, N2, CO2, CH4, H2, steam, and/or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the pressurizing fluid may be provided through an injection well disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200., 614905=Alternatively, in one embodiment, pyrolysis fluids 1066 produced from the formation may be fed to reformer 1068 that produces carbon dioxide stream 1082 and H2 stream 1070. For example, the reformer may include a flameless distributed combustor for a core, and a membrane. The membrane may allow only H2 to pass through the membrane resulting in separation of the H2 and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide may be routed to sequestration area 1080., 680698=In one embodiment, it may be desirable to create the pyrolysis zone and low viscosity zone sequentially over time. The heat sources nearest the pyrolysis zone may be activated first, for example, heat sources 2512 in plane 2504 and plane 2506 of FIG. 53. A substantially uniform temperature may be established in the pyrolysis zone after a period of time. Mobilized fluids that flow through the pyrolysis zone may undergo pyrolysis and vaporize. Once the pyrolysis zone is established, heat sources in the low viscosity zone (e.g., heat sources 2514 in plane 2516 and plane 2520) nearest the pyrolysis zone may be turned on and/or up to establish a low viscosity zone. A larger low viscosity zone may be developed by repeatedly activating heat sources (e.g., heat sources 2514 in plane 2518 and plane 2522) farther away from the pyrolysis zone., 433465=In another embodiment, a second conductor may be disposed in a second conduit, and a third conductor may be disposed in a third conduit. The second opening may be different from the opening for the first conduit. The third opening may be different from the opening for the first conduit and the second opening. For example, each of the first, second, and third openings may be disposed in substantially different well locations of the formation and may have substantially similar dimensions. The first, second, and third conductors may be configured as described herein. The first, second, and third conductors may be electrically coupled in a 3-phase Y electrical configuration. The outer conduits may be connected together or may be connected to the ground. The 3-phase Y electrical configuration may provide a safer, more efficient method to heat a hydrocarbon containing formation than using a single conductor. The first, second, and/or third conduits may be electrically isolated from the first, second, and third conductors, respectively. Dimensions of each conductor and each conduit may be configured such that each conductor may generate heat of approximately 650 watts per meter of conductor to approximately 1650 watts per meter of conductor. In an embodiment, a first conductor and a second conductor in a conduit may be coupled by a flexible connecting cable. The bottom of the first and second conductor may be enlarged to create low resistance sections, and thus generate less heat. In this manner, the flexible connector may be made of, for example, stranded copper covered with rubber insulation., 874203=FIG. 177 illustrates the pressure at the wellhead of the injection wells as a function of time during the simulation. The pressure decreased from 114 bars absolute to about 19 bars absolute over the first 370 days. The decrease in the pressure was due to removal of water from the coal formation. Pressure then started to increase substantially as carbon dioxide injection started at 370 days. The pressure reached a maximum of 98 bars. The pressure then began to gradually decrease after 480 days. At about 1440 days, the pressure increased again to about 98 bars absolute due to the increase in the carbon dioxide injection rate. The pressure gradually increased until about 3640 days. The pressure jumped at about 3640 days because the production well was closed off., 696835=FIG. 67 illustrates a pattern of production wells 2760 with inner triangular ring 2766 and outer hexagonal ring 2768. In this pattern, production wells 2760 may be spaced at a distance of 2s. Heat sources 2762 may be located at apices of inner ring 2766 and outer ring 2768. Inner triangular ring 2766 may contribute three equivalent heat sources per production well 2760. Outer hexagonal ring 2768 containing three heater wells may contribute one equivalent heat source per production well 2760. Thus, a total of four equivalent heat sources may provide heat to production well 2760., 647321=FIG. 46 illustrates an embodiment for treating a relatively permeable formation with layers 2201 of heavy hydrocarbons separated by impermeable layers 2204. Heat injection well 2220 and production well 2210 may be disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200. Substantially impermeable layers 2204 may separate layers 2201. Heavy hydrocarbons may be disposed in layers 2201. Low temperature heat source 2216 may be disposed in injection well 2220. Low temperature heat source 2216 may be configured as described in any of the above embodiments. Heavy hydrocarbons may be mobilized by heat provided from low temperature heat source 2216 such that a viscosity of the heavy hydrocarbons may be substantially reduced. Pressurizing fluid 2214 may be provided through openings in injection well 2220 into layers 2201. The pressure of pressurizing fluid 2214 may cause the mobilized fluids to flow towards production well 2210. The pressure of pressurizing fluid 2214 at or near injection well 2220 may be about 7 bars absolute to about 70 bars absolute. However, the pressure of pressurizing fluid 2214 may be controlled to remain below a pressure that may lift the overburden of relatively permeable formation 2200., 714814=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate stream 2836 may flow from hydrotreating unit 2834 to transportation unit 2838. Transportation unit 2838 may be configured to collect a volume of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate and/or to transport the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate to market center 2840. For example, market center 2840 may include, but may not be limited to, a consumer marketplace or a commercial marketplace. A commercial marketplace may include, but may not be limited to, a refinery. In this manner, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon condensate., 720193=FIG. 75 illustrates an example of another pattern of heat sources 3000 and production wells 3002. Midlines 3006 are formed equidistant from the two production wells 3002, and perpendicular to a line connecting such production wells. Unit cell 3014 is determined by intersection of midlines 3006 at vertices 3008. Twelve heat sources 3000 are counted in unit cell 3014 by a method as described in the above embodiments, of which six are whole sources of heat, and six are one third sources of heat (with the other two thirds of heat from such six wells going to other patterns). Thus, a ratio of heat sources 3000 to production wells 3002 is determined as 8:1 for the pattern illustrated in FIG. 75. An example of a pattern of heat sources is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2,923,535 issued to Ljungstrom, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 695452=FIG. 65 illustrates a pattern of heat sources 2732 with three rings of heat sources 2732 surrounding each production well 2701. Production wells 2701 may be surrounded by ring 2742 of six heat sources 2732. Second ring 2744 of twelve heat sources 2732 may surround ring 2742. Third ring 2746 of heat sources 2732 may surround second ring 2744. Third ring 2746 may include 6 equivalent heat sources. This pattern may result in a ratio of heat sources 2732 to production wells 2701 that is about 24:1., 875638=In addition, FIG. 178 shows that methane was desorbing as carbon dioxide was adsorbing in the coal formation. Between about 370-2400 days, the methane production rate 5070 increased from about 60,000 to about 115,000 standard m3/day. The increase in the methane production rate between about 1440-2400 days was caused by the increase in carbon dioxide injection rate at about 1440 days. The production rate of methane started to decrease after about 2400 days. This was due to the saturation of the coal formation. The simulation predicted a 50% breakthrough at about 2700 days. \u201cBreakthrough\u201d is defined as the ratio of the flow rate of carbon dioxide to the total flow rate of the total produced gas times 100%. Also, the simulation predicted about a 90% breakthrough at about 3600 days., 705242=Second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may also include light hydrocarbon components. For example, second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may include, but may not be limited to, methane and ethane. Surface facilities 2800 may also be configured such that second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be provided to natural gas grid 2827. Alternatively, surface facilities may also be configured such that second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be provided to a local market. The local market may include a consumer market or a commercial market. In this manner, the second portion 2823 of stream 2818 may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the light hydrocarbon components., 907559=Six component fluids were used based on fluids found in Athabasca tar sands. The six component fluids were: heavy fluid; light fluid; gas; water; pre-char; and char. The spacing between wells was set at 9.1 meters on a triangular pattern. Eleven horizontal heaters with a 300 m heater length were used with heat outputs set at the previously calculated value of 1640 watts per meter., 413180=As depicted in FIG. 20, sliding connector 583 may couple an end of conductor 580 disposed proximate a lowermost surface of conduit 582. Sliding connector 583 allows for differential thermal expansion between conductor 580 and conduit 582. Sliding connector 583 is attached to a conductor 580 located at the bottom of the well at a low resistance section 584 which may have a greater cross-sectional area. The lower resistance of section 584 allows the sliding connector to operate at temperatures no greater than about 90\ufffd C. In this manner, corrosion of the sliding connector components is minimized and therefore contact resistance between sliding connector 583 and conduit 582 is also minimized. Sliding connector 583 may be configured as shown in FIG. 20 and as described in any of the embodiments herein. The substantially low resistance section 584 of the conductor 580 may couple conductor 580 to wellhead 690 as depicted in FIG. 19. Wellhead 690 may be configured as shown in FIG. 21 and as described in any of the embodiments herein. As depicted in FIG. 19, electrical current may be applied to conductor 580 from power cable 585 through a low resistance section 584 of the conductor 580. Electrical current may pass from conductor 580 through sliding connector 583 to conduit 582. Conduit 582 may be electrically insulated from overburden casing 541 and from wellhead 690 to return electrical current to power cable 585. Heat may be generated in conductor 580 and conduit 582. The generated heat may radiate within conduit 582 and opening 514 to heat at least a portion of formation 516. As an example, a voltage of about 330 volts and a current of about 795 amps may be supplied to conductor 580 and conduit 582 in a 229 m (750 ft) heated section to generate about 1150 watts/meter of conductor 580 and conduit 582., 477600=In some embodiments, a power (Pwr) required to generate a heating rate (h) in a selected volume (V) of a hydrocarbon containing formation may be determined by the following equation: Pwr=h*V*CV*\u03c1B. In this equation, an average heat capacity of the hydrocarbon containing formation may be described as CV. The average heat capacity of the hydrocarbon containing formation may be a relatively constant value. Average heat capacity may be estimated or determined using one or more samples taken from a hydrocarbon containing formation, or measured in situ using a thermal pulse test. Methods of determining average heat capacity based on a thermal pulse test are described by I. Berchenko, E. Detournay, N. Chandler, J. Martino, and E. Kozak, \u201cIn-situ measurement of some thermoporoelastic parameters of a granite\u201d in Poromechanics, A Tribute to Maurice A. Biot, pages 545-550, Rotterdam, 1998 (Balkema), which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 706942=Surface facilities 2800 may also be configured such that third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may be provided to local market 2829. The local market may include a consumer market or a commercial market. In this manner, the third portion 2825 of stream 2818 may be used as an end product or an intermediate product depending on, for example, a composition of the LPG. For example, LPG may be used in applications, such as food processing, aerosol propellants, and automotive fuel. LPG may usually be available in one or two forms for standard heating and cooking purposes: commercial propane and commercial butane. Propane may be more versatile for general use than butane because, for example, propane has a lower boiling point than butane., 610543=In one embodiment, carbon dioxide generated with pyrolysis fluids as described herein may be sequestered in a hydrocarbon containing formation. FIG. 36 illustrates in situ pyrolysis in hydrocarbon containing formation 1020. Heater well 1022 with electric heater 1024 may be disposed in formation 1020. Pyrolysis fluids 1026 may be produced from formation 1020 and fed into gas separation unit 1028 where carbon dioxide 1030 may be separated from pyrolysis fluids 1032. Portion 1034 of carbon dioxide 1030 may be stored in formation 1036. The carbon dioxide may be sequestered in spent hydrocarbon containing formation 1038, injected into oil producing fields 1040 for enhanced oil recovery, or sequestered into coal bed 1042. Alternatively, carbon dioxide may also be re-injected 1044 into a section of formation 1020 through a synthesis gas production well to produce carbon monoxide. At least a portion of electricity 1035 may be used to power one or more electric heaters., 654131=FIG. 48 illustrates an embodiment for treating a relatively permeable formation using substantially horizontal heat sources. Heat sources 2300 may be disposed horizontally within relatively permeable formation 2200. Heat sources 2300 may be configured as described in the above embodiment shown in FIG. 47. Heat sources 2300 are depicted in FIG. 48 from a different perspective than the heat sources shown in FIG. 47. Relatively permeable formation 2200 may be substantially below impermeable layer 2204. Production well 2302 may be disposed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle to relatively permeable formation 2200. The location of production well 2302 within relatively permeable formation 2200 may vary depending on, for example, a desired product and a desired production rate. For example, production well 2302 may be disposed proximate to a bottom of relatively permeable formation 2200., 634897=Oxygen 2014 from cryogenic separation unit 2002 and steam 2016, or water, may be fed into hot carbon containing formation 2018 to produce synthesis gas 2020 in a continuous process as described herein. It is desirable to generate synthesis gas at a temperature that favors the formation of carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide. It may be advantageous for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C., and about 550\ufffd C. In another embodiment, it may be desirable for the temperature of the formation to be between about 400\ufffd C., and about 450\ufffd C. Synthesis gas 2020 may be substantially composed of H2 and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide may be removed from synthesis gas 2020 to prepare a feed stream for ammonia production using amine gas separation unit 2022. H2 stream 2024 from the gas separation unit and N2 stream 2026 from the heat exchanger may be fed into ammonia production facility 2028 to produce ammonia 2030. Carbon dioxide 2032 exiting the gas separation unit and ammonia 2030 may be fed into urea production facility 2034 to produce urea 2036., 638416=FIG. 44 illustrates an embodiment of a system configured to treat a relatively permeable formation. Relatively permeable formation 2200 may include heavy hydrocarbons. Production wells 2210 may be disposed in relatively permeable formation 2200. Relatively permeable formation 2200 may be enclosed between substantially impermeable layers 2204. An upper substantially impermeable layer 2204 may be referred to as an overburden of formation 2200. A lower substantially impermeable layer 2204 may be referred to as a base rock of formation 2200. The overburden and the base rock may include different types of impermeable materials. For example, the overburden and/or the base rock may include shale or wet carbonate (i.e., a carbonate without hydrocarbons in it)., 618893=FIG. 39 depicts an embodiment of in situ synthesis gas production integrated with a Shell Middle Distillates Synthesis (SMDS) Fischer-Tropsch and wax cracking process. An example of a SMDS process is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,468 to Minderhoud, and is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. A middle distillates hydrocarbon mixture may also be produced from produced synthesis gas using the SMDS process as illustrated in FIG. 39. Middle distillates may designate hydrocarbon mixtures with a boiling point range that may correspond substantially with that of kerosene and gas oil fractions obtained in a conventional atmospheric distillation of crude oil material. The middle distillate boiling point range may include temperatures between about 150\ufffd C., and about 360\ufffd C., with a fractions boiling point between about 200\ufffd C., and about 360\ufffd C., and may be referred to as gas oil. FIG. 39 depicts synthesis gas 1120, having a H2 to carbon monoxide ratio of about 2:1, that may exit production well 1128 and may be fed into SMDS plant 1122. In certain embodiments the ratio may range from approximately 1.8:1 to 2.2:1. Products of the SMDS plant include organic liquid product 1124 and steam 1126. Steam 1126 may be supplied to injection wells 1127. In this manner, steam may be used as a feed for synthesis gas production. Hydrocarbon vapors may in some circumstances be added to the steam., 641609=As shown in FIG. 44, mobilized fluids in formation 2200 may flow into selected pyrolyzation section 2202 substantially by gravity. The mobilized fluids may be upgraded by pyrolysis in selected pyrolyzation section 2202. Flow of the mobilized fluids may optionally be increased by providing pressurizing fluid 2214 through conduit 2212 into formation 2200. Pressurizing fluid 2214 may be a fluid configured to increase a pressure in formation 2200 proximate to conduit 2212. The increased pressure proximate to conduit 2212 may increase a flow of the mobilized fluids in formation 2200 into selected pyrolyzation section 2202. A pressure of pressurizing fluid 2214 provided by conduit 2212 may be between about 7 bars absolute to about 70 bars absolute. The pressure of pressurizing fluid 2214 may vary, however, depending on, for example, a viscosity of fluid within formation 2200 and/or a desired flow rate of fluid into selected pyrolyzation section 2202. Pressurizing fluid 2214 may be any gas that may not substantially oxidize the heavy hydrocarbons. For example, pressurizing fluid 2214 may include N2, CO2, CH4, hydrogen, steam, etc., 879446=FIG. 181 illustrates the production rate of carbon dioxide as a function of time in the simulation of the post treatment coal formation model. FIG. 181 shows that the production rate of carbon dioxide was almost negligible during approximately the first 2200 days. Therefore, the simulation predicts that nearly all of the injected carbon dioxide is being sequestered in the post treatment coal formation. However, at about 2240 days, the produced carbon dioxide began to increase. The production rate of carbon dioxide started to rise significantly due to onset of saturation of the post treatment coal formation., 704466=Power generation unit 2822 may be configured for extracting useable energy from the first portion of stream 2818. For example, stream 2818 may be produced under pressure. In this manner, power generation unit 2822 may include a turbine configured to generate electricity from the first portion of stream 2818. The power generation unit may also include, for example, a molten carbonate fuel cell, a solid oxide fuel cell, or other type of fuel cell. The facilities may be further configured such that the extracted useable energy may be provided to user 2824. User 2824 may include, for example, surface facilities 2800, a heat source disposed within a formation, and/or a consumer of useable energy., 645202=In another embodiment, low temperature heat source 2216 may be turned down and/or off in production wells 2210. The heavy hydrocarbons in formation 2200 may be mobilized by transfer of heat from selected pyrolyzation section 2202 into an adjacent portion of formation 2200. Heat transfer from selected pyrolyzation section 2202 may be substantially by conduction., 701799=Surface facilities 2800 may be configured such that gas stream 2804 may flow through a conduit from well head 2802 to gas treatment unit 2810. The conduit may include a pipe or any other fluid communication mechanism known in the art. The gas treatment unit may be configured to separate various components of gas stream 2804. For example, the gas treatment unit may be configured to separate gas stream 2804 into carbon dioxide stream 2812, hydrogen sulfide stream 2814, hydrogen stream 2816, and stream 2818 that may include, but may not be limited to, methane, ethane, propane, butanes (including n-butane or iso-butane), pentane, ethene, propene, butene, pentene, water or combinations thereof., 632661=Ammonia feed stream 1180 may be fed to ammonia production facility 1182 to produce ammonia 1184. Carbon dioxide 1186 exiting the gas separation unit 1178 (and/or carbon dioxide from other sources) may be fed, with ammonia 1184, into urea production facility 1188 to produce urea 1190., 377141=In some embodiments, the electrical insulation 576 may inhibit current leakage and may inhibit arcing to the sheath 577. The electrical insulation 576 may also thermally conduct heat generated in the conductor 575 to the sheath 577. The sheath 577 may radiate or conduct heat to the formation. An insulated conductor heater 562 may be 1000 m or more in length. In an embodiment of an insulated conductor heater, the insulated conductor heater 562 may have a length from about 15 m to about 950 m. Longer or shorter insulated conductors may also be used to meet specific application needs. In embodiments of insulated conductor heaters, purchased insulated conductor heaters have lengths of about 100 m to 500 m (e.g., 230 m). In certain embodiments, dimensions of sheaths and/or conductors of an insulated conductor may be formed so that the insulated conductors have enough strength to be self supporting even at upper working temperatures. Such insulated cables may be suspended from wellheads or supports positioned near an interface between an overburden and a hydrocarbon containing formation without the need for support members extending into the hydrocarbon formation along with the insulated conductors., 618315=Wax feed stream 1102 produced from Fischer-Tropsch plant 1096 may be sent to hydrocracker 1106. The hydrocracker may produce product stream 1108. The product stream may include diesel, jet fuel, and/or naphtha products. Examples of methods for conversion of synthesis gas to hydrocarbons in a Fischer-Tropsch process are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,163 to Chang et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,085,512 to Agee et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,124 to Wolflick et al., which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 648701=High temperature heat source 2218 may be disposed in production well 2210. High temperature heat source 2218 may be configured as described in any of the above embodiments. Heat provided by high temperature heat source 2218 may substantially pyrolyze a portion of the mobilized fluids within a selected pyrolyzation section proximate to production well 2210. The pyrolyzation and/or mobilized fluids may be removed from layers 2201 by production well 2210. High temperature heat source 2218 may further upgrade the removed formation fluids within production well 2210. The removed formation fluids may be removed as a vapor through production well 2210. A pressure at or near production well 2210 may be less than about 70 bars absolute. By not heating the entire formation to pyrolyzation temperatures, the process may produce a substantially higher ratio of energy produced versus energy input for the in situ conversion process. Upgrading of the formation fluids at or near production well 2210 may produce a substantially higher value product.}",
