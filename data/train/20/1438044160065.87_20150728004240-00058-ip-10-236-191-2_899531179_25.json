What you get coming in will be the extent of what you get from them, despite any tuition raises. You will also need a car when you come in order to get around. The parking fee for 2009-2010 is 85$ a year, but you're allowed to park over holidays too which is convenient if you want to take a plane somewhere. Linfield provides shuttles to and from the airport on major holidays. I would suggest going to visit the campus, and checking out all the dorms. When choosing one, make sure you know which buildings most of your classes will be in, and choose a dorm that is both close to those as well as the cafeteria., 179309=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 4186=The quality of education at Linfield is rich and diverse. The student body has very unique and open ways of thinking, making learning limitless and creative. The programs are somewhat limited, but not by much, and if Linfield does have a liberal arts program you want, you can be sure you'll learn a lot. The teachers are all incredibly helpful and many are friends of their students as well. The materials they use are up to date and filled with information. Linfield also has a Writing Center, to help with research papers and essay grammar. As a current student, I can say that I'm learning much more than I expected because Linfield makes things interesting, and the teachers are always there to help.}",
