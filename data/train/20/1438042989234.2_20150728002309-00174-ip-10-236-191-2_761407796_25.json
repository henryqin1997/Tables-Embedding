Part of USA TODAY Sports Digital Properties., 46697=Percy Harvin has evolved into the primary wideout here and has marginal competition other than defenses that know who to cover first and foremost. Jerome Simpson joins the fold and could make some impact but Harvin remains the primary here. Of course this year with Christian Ponder the starter from week one so the stats for the primary may be less. But he looked decent in the half season of starts in 2011 so the impact to Harvin may not be bad., 3040=For the 16 game season of 2011, here are which receivers were thrown the most passes in a game for their team., 41098=This was a glorified mess in 2011 with the lowest passing stats in the entire NFL. The Jaguars drafted Justin Blackmon (1.05) and brought in Laurent Robinson so the primary receiver is probably going to be someone who was not on the team last year. Robinson seems more likely since the rookie has to learn the ropes but unless Blaine Gabbert improves significantly it is not going to matter that much., 60746=Not much in the way of a primary receiver last year. Even in 2010 when Vick exploded, no receiver had more than 7 games as the primary (Jeremy Maclin). This represents the offense pretty well since it is a West Coast variant that spreads the ball around. Maclin was the closest to a primary that they had but the return of Brent Celek into the game plan has even affected Maclin., 5122=No doubt that Larry Fitzgerald remains the primary wide receiver in Arizona with nearly the same results as 2010. But this year it could actually rise for him since these last two seasons lacked any credible #2 receiver to worry the defenses. That should change at least eventually with the addition of Michael Floyd with their 1.13 pick in the draft. As he improves it will actually help Fitzgerald though at some point he'll start to cut into his stats. Back when Anquan Boldin was with the Cards, he and Fitzgerald had nearly a split of games as the primary receiver. Then again, back then those two dominated the receiving stats as no other player really mattered in the passing scheme., 30928=Calvin Johnson went from only 7 games as the primary in 2010 to 11 last year thanks to Matthew Stafford hanging around all season. Brandon Pettigrew matched his stats from the previous season but Burleson was not needed as much. No question here - it is all Megatron when possible., 50735=The Marques Colston show was shut down and the keys turned over to Jimmy Graham last year. Colston turned in 11 games as the primary in 2010 and no other receiver had more than one game as the lead receiver. But Drew Brees turned from being a master of spreading the wealth and instead relied on Graham and Colston far more than any other receiver. No reason to expect this to change and interesting how both Tom Brady and Drew Brees turned to their tight ends for historic returns last year., 13232=Steve Johnson fell back a bit last year in all categories as the Bills just did not pass as well as they did in 2010. The success of the rushing game is somewhat culprit but that doesn't really explain why Johnson was unable to remain the primary target as much and why five other receivers took turn getting the most passes in a game. Almost none of them scored or had much notable yardage anyway., 57613=The Raiders left the tight-end heavy era when they lost primary receiver Zach Miller last year and with Carson Palmer at the lead take a more normal look. Darrius Heyward-Bey was much improved with a real quarterback it ends up and should become even more so for 2012. Denarius Moore offered a speedy complement and will be working on more than the fly pattern this year but Heyward-Bey should see a likely increase to his primary status again., 65809=The departure of Vincent Jackson throws this offense into unknown territory. Robert Meachem was acquired and coaches contend that he will be the full package replacement for Jackson even though he's spent his career catching the occasional bomb from Drew Brees. Antonio Gates claims his foot is all healthy now and he could certainly take over the primary spot but there are more questions than answers on this team for 2012., 80161=Kenny Britt missed almost all of the 2011 season but even in 2010 he only was the lead receiver in five games as opposed to Nate Washington who had six that year. The new offense last year had to spread the ball around with Britt down and the result was predictable. It could be yet again a big mess to guess the primary receiver in any given game since Britt is slated to return, Williams and Washington are still there and the Titans added Kendall Wright with their first pick in the NFL draft. Hard to expect anyone to shine consistently in this offense., 71473=Had Peyton Manning joined this team, it would be an interesting discussion. Problem for 2011 is that we still have Alex Smith as the starting quarterback and Michael Crabtree and Vernon Davis has been joined by an apparently rejuvenated Randy Moss. That can only bring primary numbers down for a team that doesn't pass all that much or all that well anyway. It is the same offense but a shiny new target in Moss should only serve to bring the other's targets down., 7783=The addition of Julio Jones last year actually helped White who ticked up to 12 games as the primary instead of 11 like in 2010. But in 2009 he garnered 15 games before Tony Gonzalez showed up. This team is passing more and that \"raises all boats\" even if White has to share the ball. He has been a primary wideout since becoming the starter there and averages almost seven catches in those games. No changes this year other than possibly even more passing with an aging rushing game to rely on., 10253=This was roughly the same breakdown as 2010 only Torrey Smith took over for Derrick Mason. Boldin will remain the possession receiver and therefore get the most receptions but Smith is a definite up and comer and will cut into Mason's action. Overall - the team is below average in passing anyway.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Wide receivers are always inconsistent so learning how teams use their primary receiver can help make important decisions on valuing players. A primary receiver gets the most amount of pass targets thrown to him in a game. So in a similar vein to the running backs, I did some crunching to see which players were the primary receiver (wide receiver or tight end) in each of their games. With some teams it was a constantly changing job. For others, it mostly the same. Overall, there is more spreading the ball around than you might think since no wideout was the team primary receiver for more than 14 games and most were far below that number. For the 16 game season of 2011, here are which receivers were thrown the most passes in a game for their team. \u00a0 Print \u00a0 Follow @Dorey_TheHuddle David Dorey July 30, 2012 The 2012 Primary Receivers Report",
