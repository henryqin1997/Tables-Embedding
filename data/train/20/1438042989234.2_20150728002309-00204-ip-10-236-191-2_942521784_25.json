Since the advent of UPGMA algorithm in 1958, we have tried to find a ideal model for nearly half a century. But we failed. Evolution is so complex a thing. A model best fits in one lineage might mean a disaster in another. A unified model is far from being discovered. TreeBeST aims at improving the accuracy of tree building, but it does not try to set up a new model in a traditional way. Instead, it integrates two existing models with the help of species tree, finding the subtree that best fits the models and merging them together to build a new tree incorporating the advantages of the both.

Availability The General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS) is a flexible ab initio electronic structure program. Its latest version can perform general valence bond, multiconfiguration self-consistent field, M\u00f6ller-Plesset, coupled-cluster, and configuration interaction calculations. Geometry optimizations, vibrational frequencies, thermodynamic properties, and solution modeling are available. It performs well on open shell and excited state systems and can model relativistic effects. The GAMESS Home Page has additional information.
