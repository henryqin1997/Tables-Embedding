Power potential was always there, and this is all a guy figuring things out. Nothing fluky there, it's all real. (Kevin Goldstein) Any explanations for Travis D'Arnaud's power spike this year? Good hitter's environment, or just a talented guy figuring things out? (Nik from Hamilton) 2011-09-02 14:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) Over. Way over.

(Bobby from LA) 2011-12-14 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) If you're all in for this season, then Moore is the only one I'd say is untouchable. That said, you shouldn't need to deal some of these other guys for Hardy either. D'Arnaud and Betances should be taken off the table if at all possible.",
