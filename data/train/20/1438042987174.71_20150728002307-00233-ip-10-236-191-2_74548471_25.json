For detailed descriptions of the standard ToolTalk message sets, see the ToolTalk Reference Manual. Table A-1 lists the functions described in this chapter that partly comprise the ToolTalk Messaging Toolkit. Tools that follow the ToolTalk messaging conventions will not use the same ToolTalk syntax for different semantics, nor will tools fail to talk to each other because they use different ToolTalk syntax for identical semantics. If these protocols are observed, cooperating applications can be modified, even replaced, without affecting one another. The ToolTalk Messaging Toolkit plays a key role in application inter-operability and offers complete support for messaging. The message protocol specification includes the set of messages and how applications should behave when they receive the messages. These messages can be retrofitted to any existing application to leverage the functionality of the application. You can easily add these messages to existing applications to send, receive, and use shared information. Interoperability is an important theme if independently developed applications are to work together. The messages in the toolkit have been agreed upon by developers of interoperating applications; the protocols form a small, well-defined interface that maximizes application autonomy.
