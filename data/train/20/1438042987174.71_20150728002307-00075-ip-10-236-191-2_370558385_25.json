The ip tcp header-compression command is used to compress the TCP/IP packets of the headers. Header compression is particularly useful on networks that have a large percentage of small packets, such as those supporting many Telnet connections. The TCP header compression technique, described fully in RFC 1144, is supported on serial lines that use High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) or PPP encapsulation., 45033=Multilink PPP (MLP), standardized in RFC 1990, is similar to load-balancing techniques in that it sends packets across the individual links in a round-robin fashion. However, MLP adds three significant capabilities:, 27711=The maximum data rate between an SCC and a DSL WIC depends primarily on the maximum clock rate that the SCC can support. For example, on the Cisco 2600 series mainboard, which supports two DSL WICs, the total SCC clock rate that can be configured for both WICs is 8 Mbps. Therefore, if only one DSL WIC is present on the mainboard, AAL5 and AAL2 clock rates can be configured to 7 Mbps and 1 Mbps, respectively. If two DSL WICs are supported on the mainboard, the total of 8 Mbps should be distributed among the four SCCs., 41156=If a Cisco router terminates the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) traffic, a computer connected to the Ethernet interface may have a problem accessing websites. The solution is to manually reduce the maximum transmission unit (MTU) configured on the computer by constraining the TCP maximum segment size (MSS). To manually reduce the MTU configured on the computer, use the ip tcp adjust-msscommand. The mss argument value must be 1452 or less., 16588=Refer to the Release Notes for the Cisco 1700 Series Routers for Cisco IOS Release 12.2(8)YN document for caveat information for multiple PVCs., 48929=The Compressed Real-Time Protocol (cRTP) feature reduces bandwidth consumption on real-time applications such as voice. Thus, by using cRTP, you can further improve voice quality. Configuring cRTP can save troubleshooting time by isolating potential cRTP issues. Based on RFC 2508, the RTP header compression feature compresses the IP, User Data Protocol (UDP), and Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) header (IP/UDP/RTP header) from 40 bytes to 2 or 4 bytes, reducing unnecessary bandwidth consumption. RTP header compression is a hop-by-hop compression scheme; therefore, cRTP must be configured on both ends of the link (unless the passive option is configured)., 31358=For more information about analog voice interface support, refer to the Voice Port Testing Enhancements in Cisco 2600 and 3600 Series Routers and MC3810 Series Concentrators., 100168=Support was added for Cisco 2610-2651, Cisco 3620, Cisco 3640, and Cisco 3660., 27165=Network module SCCs also pose similar limitations. That is, on the Cisco 2600 series, the total clock rate for all four SCCs is 8 Mbps. The maximum AAL5 clock rate that may be configured on a network module is 5.3 Mbps. On the Cisco 1700 series, the maximum configurable SCC clock rate for both AAL5 and AAL2 is 8 Mbps., 79012=RFC 1483 Bridging, 78715=RFC 1483 Routing, 14221=For information about RFC 1483 bridging, refer to the following documents:, 37728=For information about virtual circuit (VC) bundling, refer to Configuring an ADSL WAN Interface Card on Cisco 1700 Series Routers ., 12085=For information about Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST), refer to the Survivable Remote Site Telephony Cisco 2600/3600 Voice Technical Marketing solutions document., 99557=Enhanced voice and QoS features were added for Cisco 1720, Cisco 1721, Cisco 1751, Cisco 1760, Cisco 2610XM-2651XM, Cisco 3640, Cisco 3640A, and Cisco 3660., 100464=This feature was introduced. The Cisco 1720 did not support voice., 39494=You can configure the size of the tx ring for each permanent virtual circuit (PVC). The default value is 60. However, the value of the setting can be 1 through 60 on Cisco 1700 series routers and 3 through 60 on Cisco 2600 and Cisco 3600 series routers. A low tx ring setting, such as 2 or 3, is required for latency-critical traffic. For example, when the tx ring limit is configured as 3 and LLQ is configured on the PVC, the worst case delay for a voice packet is the time required to transmit three data packets. When the buffering is reduced by configuring the tx ring limit, the delay experienced by voice packets is reduced by a combination of the tx ring and LLQ mechanism.}",
