    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables The catching situation in 2008 will be an improvement on the performance Cubs' catchers put up in 2007. I suspect Soto will be comparable in value to Barrett 2005, with a bit more defense and less offense. (Joe Sheehan) Everyone's projections for Geovany Soto seem to be very favorable. Care to dampen this Cubs fan's expectations? (Marc from San Antonio) 2008-01-10 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) One of the reasons it's fun to be back in Chicago is that it's just fun to see Soto play regularly. Between the sock and the paunch, he's got the sort of Hector Villanueva vibe beyond the pure production that might make him the all-time catcher in Cubs history. (Christina Kahrl) How about that Geovany Soto? That k/bb is strikingly good for someone hitting over .330. While I doubt he'll keep that up, given he's had two four hit games already, is he already the best offensive catcher in the league? (Scott from Chicago) 2008-05-09 14:00:00\u00a0(link",
