When Genesis formally entered the hard money markets in the latter half of 2004, the market was very competitive, but very fragmented. \u00a0Most hard money lenders operated on a local basis, limiting their lending to borrowers and collateral properties located a short distance from their base of operations. \u00a0They also marketed only to the retail market, ignoring brokers and dealing directly with the borrowers., 219123=2010, 51174=Beginning in late 2007, we noticed that some of the commercial lenders were cutting back and tightening their lending parameters. Some were even exiting the business, or closing operations due to high delinquencies and repossessions. \u00a0By the end of 2010, a large percentage of the lenders had exited the business or suspended operations, and virtually every remaining commercial real estate lender had severely tightened their parameters. \u00a0The Company expects this trend to continue., 269268=December 31, 2010, 108347=2010, 400332=On June 30, 2010, CFC purchased a commercial loan for $31,995, a land loan for $70,868 and a business note for $7,137 totaling $110,000., 30650=In the latter part of 2008, national economic conditions made any real estate lending very precarious, forcing the Company to again re-focus its efforts. Real estate loans again became our primary target. \u00a0The larger companies, which had dabbled in the industry, discontinued purchasing real estate loans in 2008, primarily due to the decimation of the securitization markets. \u00a0This left a huge funding void in the seller financed real estate market. \u00a0Genesis had been forced to re-focus its business towards, 35249=In regard to our commercial lending, Genesis focused on \"hard money lending\" which was typically a short term loan collateralized with non-conforming types of real property with a borrower who may have a compromised credit rating. \u00a0Genesis followed two general underwriting rules in its \"hard money\" lending, (1) only make a loan if you want to own the collateral and (2) never lend an amount of money which might exceed the price you would be willing to pay for the collateral as a purchaser. Hard money loans are normally equity based, not credit based. \u00a0Genesis originally targeted a 70% maximum loan-to-value ratio, but as the real estate markets declined from 2007 on, we have continued to reduce that maximum. \u00a0At this point, with the continued uncertainty in real estate values, we will estimate the present value of the collateral property, reduce that by 20%-30% as a contingency for future declining values, and then keep our loan to an amount that is no more than 50% of that adjusted value., 29673=In 2004, larger financial institutions, which had dabbled in the industry in the past on a smaller, wholesale scale, recognized the potential profitability from buying seller financed real estate loans directly from the sellers. These institutions entered the market. Their competitiveness drove many of the brokers out of business, and made the margin spreads so low that smaller funding companies with a higher cost of funds could not compete, or had to settle for lower quality loans. \u00a0Genesis was one of those companies, and although we believed we could maintain a presence in the industry by focusing on niche sectors of the market, such as partial purchases and non-conforming property types, management decided to expand the Company\u0092s focus, and look to other business markets as well. \u00a0Commercial real estate lending was the Company\u0092s primary choice to pursue., 88875=As of December 31, 2011 our company had approximately 157 shareholders of its common stock holding 7,863,358 shares and has approximately 51 shareholders of its Series B preferred stock holding 1,957,500 shares., 105146=General and administrative expenses (\u0093G&A\u0094) for fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $141,538 and $367,145, respectively. G&A primarily consists of executive compensation, rent and professional fees for legal, accounting and public relations, utilities, depreciation and maintenance. \u00a0The year over year increases and (decreases) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were ($225,607) and $130,990, respectively. \u00a0The primary reasons for the changes were as follows:, 170634=Investments made in two private companies of $300,000 in 2011 compared to $750,000 in 2010., 182544=March 20, 2012, 501505=** \u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Rule 406T of Regulation S-T, the XBRL related information in Exhibit 101 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K shall not be deemed to be \u0093filed\u0094 for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing., 96199=(2) \u00a0On November 5, 2010, the board of directors authorized the issuance of 250,000 common stock options each to John Coghlan, Co-president and Director of the Company, Greg M.

Coghlan purchased 500,000 Series \"B\" Preferred shares from the Company for $500,000., 402946=During the year ended December 31, 2010, Genesis Holdings, Inc. recorded $31,560 in management fees and $15,799 in servicing fees for 2010 and still owes the Company $47,240 at December 31, 2010., 494495=10-K \u00a0filed August 11, 2010, 29105=The reduction in availability of funds to purchase real estate notes created a void in the market for a few years from 2000 thru 2003, and again from 2007 thru 2010. \u00a0The brokers with product to sell were faced with limited avenues, creating a market opportunity for Genesis, and that was the focus of the Company\u0092s business plan during that period. The Company also pursued commercial real estate loans during these periods to fill the void in the contract market., 364524=During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company authorized the issuance of 250,000 common stock options each to John Coghlan, Co-president and Director of the Company, Greg M.

At December 31, 2011 the balance owing is $187,107. The line has a term of 12 months, and an origination fee of 1/2%, or $1,250. The payments are due monthly on the 1st on all accrued unpaid interest. The Riverbank line of credit is senior to the CFC line of credit, and is collateralized by the assets of Genesis. \u00a0The Riverbank line requires that the CFC line may not be paid down lower than the amount owing to Riverbank at any time during the term of the loan. \u00a0The line is payable on demand and is personally guaranteed by John R. and Wendy Coghlan., related parties of the Company.

In past market downturns, seller financed loan buyers weathered these downturns because most of our loans had high borrower\u0092s equity positions, were well-seasoned, and our investment ratios to value were much lower than in the conventional markets. However, in this present market downturn, those loans that have resulted in repossessions, in many cases, are secured by properties that have dropped in value to a level where the principal investment amount exceeds the collateral value., 118895=2008, 111850=2007, 103590=At December 31, 2011 and 2010, loans held for sale total $598,251 and $1,015,832, respectively. \u00a0Real estate owned total $1,095,353 and $1,029,362 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \u00a0These properties were listed for sale. \u00a0, 406498=We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure., 139948=2011, 7977=Indicate by check mark whether the issuer (1) filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days. Yes [X] No [ \u00a0], 417856=JOHN R. COGHLAN, President, Chief Financial Officer, Director and Chairman of the Board, age 69, became a Director on January 2, 2006. Mr. Coghlan is a retired C.P.A. Mr. Coghlan became responsible for the overall management of operations January 1, 2010. Prior to that time, he acted in an advisory capacity to the Board of Directors. Mr. Coghlan graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in Business Administration and has held the designation of Certified Public Accountant since 1966. \u00a0Mr. Coghlan was a founder of Labor Ready, Inc., a New York Stock Exchange traded company, and served as Chief Financial Officer and Director of Labor Ready from 1987 through 1996, when he retired. \u00a0Since his retirement, the Coghlan Family Corporation, a privately held family business that manages family investment accounts, has employed Mr. Coghlan. \u00a0Coghlan Family Corporation is 100% owned by the Coghlan Family LLC. \u00a0John and Wendy Coghlan, husband and wife, own minority interests in Coghlan, LLC and control both the LLC and the Corporation through the LLC management agreement. \u00a0The remaining interests in the Coghlan, LLC are owned by Mr. Coghlan\u0092s children and grandchildren., 498791=CFO Certification pursuant to Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 355021=Bank line of credit: \u00a0At December 31, 2010, the Company had a promissory note with Riverbank, with a balance owing of $286,264, with a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate index (as published in the Wall Street journal) plus 1%, with a floor of 6%. The rate at December 31, 2011 and, 2010 was 6%. The line had a term of 14 months, and an origination fee of 1/2%, or $2,369. \u00a0The payments are due quarterly in the amount of $100,000, for the first four payments, and the last payment will be $95,164. \u00a0\u00a0, 500170=The following materials from Genesis Financial, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 are formatted in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): (i) the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (ii) the Consolidated Statements of Operations, (iii) Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Deficit, (iv) the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, and (iv) Notes to consolidated Financial Statements tagged as blocks of text., 444283=On November 5, 2010, the board of directors authorized the issuance of 250,000 common stock options to John Coghlan, Co-president and Director of the Company. \u00a0The compensation expense relating to Mr. Coghlan's grant was $41,988., 483294=To our knowledge, the Company's principal accountant during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 did not engage any other persons or firms other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees., 84196=December 31, 378707=December 31,, 65261=Although diversifying, it is the intention of the Company to retain its primary focus on real estate related property and loans. During the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011 Genesis conducted a private placement of preferred stock and focused on new investments and loans on a very selective basis. It is the intention of the company to keep this type of equity investment below forty percent of total assets and confine new real estate financing to the northwest portion of the United States., 52664=In 2007, the Company started to experience increased delinquencies, primarily due to a slow-down in the borrower\u0092s business, resulting in reduced cash flows. \u00a0The prior workouts that resulted in a payoff before repossession declined dramatically. \u00a0This appeared to be due to the fact that the borrowers could not refinance their collateral properties, nor could they sell their properties to pay off the loan. \u00a0This resulted in more repossessions, and the Company learned that it could not sell those repossessed properties as easily or for their appraised values., 379778=2010, 154110=On November 11, 2010 the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation creating 2,000,000 shares of Series \u0093B\u0094 Preferred Stock. The designated Series \u0093B\u0094 Preferred Stock consists of 2,000,000 with a par value $1.00; is non-dividend bearing, convertible to common at $.40 per share subject to any recapitalization. The holders of the Preferred stock will be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distributions to the holders of the common stock. \u00a0Each share of the Preferred Stock is convertible into two and one-half common stock shares at the option of the holder. \u00a0Each share of Series \u0093B\u0094 Preferred Stock can automatically converted immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such request for such conversion from the holders of the majority of the Series \u0093B\u0094 Preferred Stock holders., 496871=Form of Security Agreement related to $250,000 Convertible Promissory Note Agreement with John R. Coghlan dated December 15, 2010, 185817=2010, 427522=In 2010 we compensated one officer with a grant of stock options. \u00a0Compensation expenses for 2011 and 2010 were $41,988 and $45,000, respectively., 155262=As of December 31, 2011, 2,000,000 shares had been sold with net proceeds of $2,000,000., 89673=There are no restrictions imposed on the Company, which limit its ability to declare or pay dividends on its common stock, except for corporate state law limitations. No cash dividends have been declared or paid to date and none are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future. \u00a0However, upon issuance of the Series \"B\" Preferred stock, the Company determined that a beneficial conversion feature of $1,102,250 and $194,833 had been realized for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a deemed dividend distribution to the preferred shareholders on the date of issuance because the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder immediately upon issuance. \u00a0As of December 31, 2011, 2,000,000 Series \"B\" preferred shares had been sold with net proceeds of $2,000,000. \u00a0, 10040=The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant on June 30, 2011, the last business day of the registrant\u0092s most recently completed fiscal year, based on the last reported trading price of the registrant\u0092s common stock on the Over the Counter Pink Sheets was $3,633,437. The sum excludes the shares held by officers, directors, and stockholders whose ownership exceeded 10% of the outstanding shares at June 30, 2011, in that such persons may be deemed affiliates of the Company. This determination of affiliate status is not necessarily a conclusive determination for other purposes. \u00a0, 387626=The Company has analyzed its filing positions in all jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns and have recognized that certain tax positions taken in the 2008 through 2010 years could result in minor adjustments to the fair value adjustments for tax purposes. \u00a0However, these adjustments would not result in a tax provision as they would result in revisions to the net operating loss carryforward amount., 375217=Outstanding and exercisable, December 31, 2010 and 2011, 300825=Genesis Financial, Inc. (\u0093the Company\u0094 or \u0093Genesis\u0094) was incorporated in Washington State on January 24, 2002. \u00a0The Company is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and selling real estate receivable loans and periodically providing bridge capital funding. \u00a0Loans consist of real estate loans and mortgage notes collateralized by primarily first position liens on residential and commercial real estate. \u00a0The loans collateralized by real estate are typically non-conventional either because they are originated as a result of seller financing, or the underlying property is non-conventional., 149802=On December 15, 2010, the Company entered into a convertible note agreement with John R. Coghlan. The note accrues interest at 8% per annum with interest and balance due on December 15, 2012. \u00a0The note is convertible at anytime by Mr. Coghlan into 1 share of the Company\u0092s Series B Preferred stock for every $1.00 outstanding of the note payable and related accrued interest. In connection with the issuance of this note, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature of $128,750 that resulted in a discount to the note payable. The discount is being amortized into earnings over the term of the note. The note is collateralized by 290,000 shares of the Company\u0092s Series B Preferred stock. Presently, the Company has insufficient authorized Series B Preferred stock and will be required to amend the Series B Preferred Stock increasing the Series B to 2,290,000 authorized shares under the terms of the loan agreement. The beneficial conversion feature was based upon the difference between the fair value of the preferred stock into which the note is convertible at the date of issue ($378,750) less the face value of the note ($250,000). \u00a0The fair value of the preferred stock at the date of issue was calculated based upon the fair value of the shares of common stock (2.5 shares of common stock for each 1 shares of preferred stock or 625,000 shares) into which the preferred stock was convertible at the date of issue., 388171=We have determined that we are subject to examination of our income tax filings in the United States for the 2008 through 2011 tax years. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense., 132951=2010, 51765=MARKET ANALYSIS. The hard money market was quite strong in 2004, at the time of the Company\u0092s increased focus in making these loans, and continued that way throughout 2006. \u00a0Frequent foreclosure litigation and repossessions are an expected part of the hard money industry, in contrast to the conventional markets. With the exception of those few deals with unusual circumstances affecting the outcome, most problem loans were eventually worked out, and paid off, or the repossession and resale resulted in a profit, broke even, or at worse, the Company experienced a small loss. \u00a0The losses were at an acceptable level, but the Company established a fair value reserve account, and started setting aside funds to cover those small losses in 2005, and continued that practice throughout 2006., 355667=On May 16, 2011, the promissory note was converted to a $250,000 line of credit on the same terms and conditions. At December 31, 2011 the balance owing is $187,107. The line has a term of 12 months, and an origination fee of 1/2%, or $1,250. The payments are due monthly on the 1st on all accrued unpaid interest. The Riverbank line of credit is senior to the CFC line of credit, and is collateralized by the assets of Genesis. \u00a0The Riverbank line requires that the CFC line may not be paid down lower than the amount owing to Riverbank at any time during the term of the loan. \u00a0The line is payable on demand and is personally guaranteed by John R. and Wendy Coghlan, related parties of the Company., 351773=On November 23, 2010, the Company closed the purchase of an equity interest in Flyback Energy, Inc., for $1,200,000. \u00a0The purchase was for $1,200,000 of Series \u0093B\u0094 Preferred Stock and Common Stock Purchase Warrants from Flyback Energy, Inc., a closely held Washington corporation payable on an installment basis. \u00a0At November 23, 2010, the purchase represented a ten percent equity interest in Flyback Energy, Inc. assuming the warrants were exercised and Series \"B\" Preferred Shares converted into 2,666,666 of common stock. \u00a0At December 31, 2011, the purchases represented an eight percent equity interest in Flyback Energy Inc., 494293=Warehousing Line of Credit Agreement with Coghlan Family Corporation dated January 1, 2010, 158549=2010, 103196=During the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized $86,246 and $135,812, respectively, of interest, processing fee and other income. The Company wrote off interest receivable of $108,412 resulting in net loss from revenues of $22,166 during the year ended December 31, 2011., 467255=(3) \u00a0In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to conversion of preferred stock and options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011. We did not deem those shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person., 490585=Promissory Note with American West Bank dated October 14, 2004, 426111=Our board of directors adopted our Code of Ethical Conduct which applies to all of our employees and directors, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. \u00a0We believe the adoption of our Code of Ethical Conduct is consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., 398361=On December 15, 2010, John R. Coghlan purchased $500,000 of the Series \u201cB\u201d Preferred Stock being offered by the Company. \u00a0(See Note 6)., 379506=2011, 351282=The Company has no investments available for sale at December 31, 2011 and 2010. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 184719=December 31,, 170939=2010, 48565=COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING. Genesis was a commercial real estate lender on a small scale prior to 2004, supplementing the Company\u0092s seller financed loan acquisitions. \u00a0In the latter part of 2004, due to the competitiveness of the seller financed loan market, management decided to expand the Company\u0092s efforts in the commercial lending market. \u00a0Our broker network supplied us with potential borrowers. Since the management and staff of Genesis had considerable previous experience with commercial lending, it was a natural and comfortable adjustment. As with any business venture, the Company looked through the commercial lending industry for a \u0093niche\u0094, and it was determined that Genesis was best suited to do \u0093Hard Money\u0094 commercial lending. Hard money lenders focus on those loans that are usually smaller in size, shorter terms (more of an interim financing), often collateralized by non-conforming property types, or the borrowers do not qualify for conventional financing due to credit history issues. \u00a0Typically, hard money loans warrant a higher interest rate providing a smaller, high cost-of-funds lender like Genesis with the opportunity to earn a favorable return on investment., 408782=Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2011 to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Chairman of the Board), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure., 102710=Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010., 82344=March 31, 158026=2011, 399601=On April 12, 2011, CFC purchased an additional 19,000 shares of Series B Preferred being offered by the company., 254173=BALANCES, DECEMBER 31, 2010, 476133=There was no purchase activity for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010., 397234=On September 1, 2010, John R Coghlan purchased a $41,980 interest in a Limited Liability Company that was applied to the CFC line of credit., 69094=As of January 1, 2011 the Company had one paid employee., 107555=2011, 3568=For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, 495283=Management and Servicing Agreement titled Corporate Restructuring Agreement with Genesis Financial Corporation dated December 27, 2008, effective January 1, 2009, 338818=December 31,, 109279=During 2011 and 2010, we outsourced our day-to-day operations to Genesis Finance Corporation, a company owned and controlled by Michael Kirk, an executive officer and director of Genesis Financial, Inc. Management believed this decision to outsource our day-to-day operations management has been very effective, and beneficial to the Company and its shareholders. \u00a0In 2006, 2007, and 2008, our operations expenses were $620,185, $576,904, and $500,415, respectively. \u00a0In 2009, 2010 and 2011 the operations expenses were $236,155, $367,145, and $141,087, respectively., 315850=2010, 414909=As of December 31, 2011, the Directors and Executive officers were as follows:, 445452=On November 5, 2010, the board of directors authorized the issuance of 250,000 common stock options to John Coghlan, Co-president and Director of the Company. The stock option, representing 250,000 common shares, has an exercise price of $.20 per share. \u00a0, 499711=CFO Certification pursuant to Section 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 320230=In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, which amends Subtopic 820 to clarify the application of existing common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. \u00a0ASU 2011-04 provides clarification for the following:, 164418=December 31,, 491047=Warehousing Line of Credit Promissory Note Agreement with Coghlan Family Corporation dated April 18, 2006, 490094=Management and Loan Servicing Agreement with Genesis Holdings II, Inc. dated July 15, 2008, 31863=COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. In this competitive environment, Genesis sought to distinguish its offering from those of our competitors through excellent service, rapid customer response, and consistent and fair underwriting evaluations and procedures. We believed that our market focus on superb service and our existing contacts in the industry would provide a sustainable competitive advantage. \u00a0We also believed that our ability to diversify into other related markets, such as commercial real estate lending, would give us a competitive advantage. Throughout 2008, the Company focused on increasing its presence in the seller financed markets, supplementing that business with the occasional commercial real estate loan. \u00a0By the third quarter of 2008, it was becoming apparent that the real estate markets were going to get worse before they got better, and the Company tightened its purchasing and lending parameters to mitigate the increasing risk. \u00a0From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, the Company out-sourced all its operations and servicing functions to reduce expenses, and further tightened underwriting parameters, while management focused on selling repossessed collateral properties and reducing company debt. We outsourced to Genesis Finance Corporation, a company owned and controlled by Mike Kirk, an executive officer and director of Genesis Financial, Inc., 470918=Genesis Financial, Inc. had the following related party transactions the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010., 491552=Promissory Note with Riverbank dated June 29, 2009, 104217=During 2011 and 2010, we repossessed one and three, respectively, properties which represented real property collateral under our purchased loans., 218294=\u00a0Year Ended December 31, 471152=Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 386715=The deferred tax assets were calculated assuming a 39% and 34% tax rate at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. \u00a0The annual tax provision (benefit) is different from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to our pretax income (loss) primarily due to net operating loss carryovers and provisions for losses., 55230=As of January 1, 2011, the Company had down-sized enough to manage a sizable portion of its own affairs, and renegotiated its outsourcing agreement with Genesis Finance Corporation, an affiliate company, lowering the monthly fee to $1,500. As of January 1, 2012 the monthly fee was removed and the outsourcing services were offset by general offices expenses paid by the Company on behalf of Genesis finance Corporation. \u00a0On January 1, 2011, Genesis hired one employee, Virginia Walters, to manage its affairs going forward., 357105=Line of credit - affiliated company: the Company had a $2,500,000 Line of Credit Agreement with the Coghlan Family Corporation, Inc. (\u0093CFC\u0094), with balances owing of $1,510,000 and $1,750,845 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. CFC is an affiliated company controlled by a John R Coghlan. If the Company defaults on the agreement, the default interest rate will be 12%. \u00a0Interest is payable monthly. The line has a term of 12 months and an origination fee of 1/2% or $12,500. The credit line is collateralized by all of Genesis\u0092 assets and is subordinate to the RiverBank line of credit. The line of credit agreement requires that the Company maintain a debt to equity ratio of no greater than 3.0. Borrowings under the line are personally guaranteed by Michael A. Kirk, the CEO of the Company. Because of the economic conditions, CFC has agreed to waive the interest starting October 1, 2010 and has also agreed to waive the 3.0 debt to equity ratio requirement as well as the 12% default rate., 369239=The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2011 was $850,000 based on our closing stock price of $1.05 per common share at December 31, 2011. \u00a0All options outstanding were fully vested and exercisable at December 31, 2011., 494791=Warehousing Line of Credit Agreement with Coghlan Family Corporation dated January 1, 2008, 371401=Outstanding and exercisable, December 31, 2009, 81646=Fiscal 2010, 475544=On September 29, 2010, CFC purchased a $54,820 interest in two properties secured by commercial real estate, a $619,103 interest in four properties secured by land, a $157,612 interest in two properties secured by residential real estate and a $2,249 interest in a business note in exchange for total reduction of $833,767 in the Company\u0092s line of credit balance with CFC.., 479081=The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by DeCoria, Maichel &Teague, P.S. for the audit or review of Genesis\u0092 financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and fees billed for other services rendered by DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. \u00a0, 268969=December 31, 2011, 363768=On April 10, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the Genesis Financial, Inc. Stock Option Plan (the Plan), and the Plan was subsequently approved by the Shareholders of the Company on May 2, 2002. \u00a0The plan allows for issuance of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Non-statutory Stock Options (NSOs). \u00a0The maximum number of shares that may be subject to option and exercised under the Plan is 1,300,000 shares (adjusted for the two for one stock split that occurred in 2007). \u00a0The ISOs and NSOs expire 30 days after the recipient ceases to be an employee for the Company, or one year after the recipient\u0092s death. \u00a0\u00a0, 33372=As of January 1, 2011 the Company was operating with one paid employee and outsourcing the property management in exchange for office expenses incurred by Genesis Finance Corporation., 49873=Although hard money loans carry a higher degree of risk, due to the non-conforming nature of the loans, that risk is partially offset with the low loan-to-value ratios, which seldom exceed 60%, providing a cushion for the lender if the property has to be repossessed and resold. Throughout 2008, as real estate values throughout the nation continued to decline, it became apparent that loan to value ratios as low as even 50%-60% were insufficient to provide that cushion for the lender, as values have dropped in some geographic areas as much as 50%-70%. \u00a0As of December 31, 2011, these values continued to decline, and the Company did not see an end to this decline., 151358=In connection with the Company\u0092s purchase of FEI\u0092s preferred stock, the Company entered into a note payable agreement with FEI, on November 23, 2010, for $700,000, to be paid in monthly installments of $140,000, through April 2011, plus interest at .035% per annum.

The seller's position in title is eliminated, and should the note go into default, the seller must either pay off our position or forfeit its rights to the remaining cash flow.
