    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7584=My research on post-colonial geographies of development and intercultural research emerges out of two successful competitive Faculty grants (FSCIT Strategic Small Grant, 2013 and FSCIT Small Research Grant, 2015) and collaborative work with a former honours student (Lillian Tait). The first project builds on the strengths, capacities and aspirations of young people in Fiji (aged 18-30) to build an adaptive typology of context-specific, culturally appropriate development frameworks. The second ongoing research project (with colleague Associate Professor Jenny Cameron), in collaborationwith the Indigenous-led Centre for Appropriate Technology (headquartered in Alice Springs), focuses on strengths-based practices for working with and sustaining Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The third project challenges conventional ways of theorising development relationships drawing on the insights of development practitioners. This research redefines the current theoretical terrain on post-development thinking by engaging emotional geographies., 1838=Discipline of Geography and Environmental Studies Seminar Series Coordinator: Since 2012, I have undertaken the role of Discipline Seminar Series Coordinator. The Seminar Series runs in both semesters and showcases the research of 12 scholars throughout the year. The role involves tapping into exiting networks with international and domestic scholars and developing new cross-institutional relationships to ensure high quality presenters., 4616=I am convenor and co-founder of the newly formed (2014) Critical Development Study Group (CDSG) of the Institute of Australian Geographers (IAG). In collaboration with a number of national and international colleagues, the Study Group is forming key trans-Tasman alliances with networks including the Political Geography Research Group (Institute of British Geographers - IBG), Aotearoa New Zealand International Development Studies Network (DevNet), the Development Studies Group of the New Zealand Geographical Society (NZGS) and the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) University Network. Our emerging research agenda involves identifying individual and collective strengths (including, crucially, post-graduate and early career colleagues) to develop strong international links and grant platforms. At the 2014 IAG Conference in Melbourne I chaired a CDSG panel on critical interventions in development studies. I am now assembling the papers as Special Issue Editor for publication in Geographical Research. Between 2011 and 2013 I worked effectively with a small editing team as Book Editor for Asia Pacific Viewpoint, an international journal based in Aotearoa/New Zealand and published by Wiley Asia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 3272=I have an active community engagement presence in environmental and social justice advocacy. I have been invited to be on Sustainability Q&A Panels (UoN Student Environment Club Environment Week, 2014; Vegan Week \u2013 Animal Liberation, 2014), co-founded and coordinated the African Australia Alliance for Peace and Reconciliation Inc (AAAPR) which identifies and builds on the strengths and capacities of newly arrived refugees and their families in Newcastle. I am an active member of Refugee Action Network Newcastle (RANN) participating in organisational processes, fundraisers and events. I am a social and political columnist for the Newcastle Leader Newspaper (Circulation 43 000). In 2011-2013 I was a volunteer Ethics Teacher and one of the original cohort of ethics teachers who rolled out the State-wide Primary Ethics curriculum for years 5 and 6 at Newcastle East Public School.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{13645=How might deeply embodied student experiences and nonhuman agency change the way we think about learning theory? Pushing the conceptual boundaries of practice-based learning and communities of practice, this chapter draws on student experiential fieldwork 'on Country' with Indigenous people in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia, to explore the peculiar silence when it comes to more-than-human1 features of situated learning models. As students engage with, and learn from, Indigenous epistemologies and ontologies, they become open to the ways their learning is co-produced in and with place. The chapter builds a case for an inclusive conceptualisation of communities of practice, one that takes seriously the material performativity of nonhuman actors - rock art, animals, plants and emotions in the 'situatedness' of socio-cultural contexts. As a co-participant in the students' community of practice, the more-than-human forms part of the process of identity formation and actively helps students learn. To shed light on the student experiences we employ Leximancer, a software tool that provides visual representations of the qualitative data drawn from focus groups with students and field diaries.
