However, his early career brought only a glimpse of his talent and he always looked a perfect Twenty20 cricketer., 65716=He made his Test debut for South Africa against Australia in the third Test in Cape Town in March 2009, replacing his brother who was dropped for the game, but his place in South Africa's one-day line-up has now started to look more uncertain after a run of unconvincing form.
