            "Can't let go of the Jeter AB. 2-0, no out, first and third, tying run. Great work by Madson--that's what he does. I really, as a baseball fan, wanted it to come down to Rodriguez. Phil Coke isn't going to sleep well. (Joe Sheehan)",

    "textBeforeTable": "BP Roundtables Absolutely. He had no reason to take Madson out, and going to Lidge--whose \"comeback\" is fictional--actively damaged the Phillies' chances. It would have been comical to see Phil Coke and Chad Durbin pitching in a tied World Series game. (Joe Sheehan) Joe, do you think Manuel should have left Madson in for the ninth last night? Even if Lidge doesn't give up a run in the top of the ninth, the pitchers' spot is due up first in the bottom of the inning, so at most Lidge was going to pitch one inning. After that, the Phillies would had to have relied on Chad Durbin, Scott Eyre and company. (philsfan from NYC) 2009-11-02 15:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) A shrug of the shoulders. Girardi could tap Hinske for an inning and it wouldn't surprise me at this point. He's shock-proofed me. The Rivera decision was the end. (Joe Sheehan) Joe: Can you share for the world what your reaction would have been if Phil Coke had entered the game in the bottom of the 9th (as he would have if the Yanks hadn't scored)?
