    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{181480=10 mg or more of the Ag base alloy portion of each thin film obtained was used as a sample, and this was dissolved in a solution of sulfuric acid:pure water=1:1. Subsequently, the resulting solution was heated on a 200\ufffd C. hot plate, and it was checked that the sample was completely dissolved. Then, the solution was cooled. Then, the amount of Bi contained in the thin film was measured by means of an ICP-mass spectrometry (SPQ-8000 manufactured by Seiko Instrument Inc.). The results are shown in Table 16., 125304=Conventionally, a study has been made to use not only pure Ag but also an Ag base alloy as an optical reflective film. However, the finding that the aggregation of Ag atoms and the growth of crystal grains of Ag are suppressed by adding Bi and Sb to Ag as defined in the present invention is not observable in the related art. As for the suppression of the aggregation of Ag atoms and the crystal grain growth of Ag, there is the invention of an optical reflective film comprising an Ag base alloy to which rare earth elements have been added (JP-B No. 01729/2002) by the present inventors. However, the optical reflective film comprising a Bi- and Sb-containing Ag base alloy in the present invention has higher reflectance and durability., 50012=As techniques for improving the aggregation of such an Ag film, various techniques have been proposed. For example, in JP-A No. 315874/1995, there is proposed a heat ray-shielding glass obtained by forming a metal thin film prepared by adding at least one element selected from the group consisting of Pd, Pt, Sn, Zn, In, Cr, Ti, Si, Zr, Nb, and Ta in an amount of 5 to 20 mol % to Ag on the surface of a glass plate., 63208=The Ag base alloy thin film having a total content of Bi and Sb of 0.01 to 10 at % is also preferably used as an electromagnetic-shielding film-formed product. The electromagnetic-shielding film-formed product can be configured such that a film containing at least one selected from the group consisting of oxide, nitride, and oxynitride is formed as an underlayer on the substrate, the Ag base alloy thin film is formed on the underlayer, and a film containing at least one selected from the group consisting of oxide, nitride, and oxynitride is formed as a protective film on the Ag base alloy thin film. Herein, it is preferable that the underlayer and the protective layer are oxides or oxynitrides. Then, it is preferable that the oxide is at least one selected from the group consisting of ITO, zinc oxide, tin oxide, and indium oxide. Further, it is preferable that the thicknesses of the underlayer and the protective layer are 10 nm or more and 1000 nm or less. The electromagnetic-shielding film-formed product is preferably configured such that the substrate is a transparent substrate; a transparent member is further stacked on the protective layer; or a transparent member is stacked on the protective layer via a spacer, and a space layer is disposed between the protective layer and the transparent member. It is preferable that, in the electromagnetic-shielding film-formed product, the thickness of the Ag base alloy thin film is 3 nm or more and 20 nm or less., 51379=Still further, the present inventors have proposed a technique for attaining the improvement of the aggregation resistance of Ag by adding Sc, Y, and rare earth elements to Ag (JP-B No. 351572/2001)., 87405=\u201cAn Ag alloy film comprising an Ag base alloy containing Sc, Y, and one or more elements of rare earth elements (JP-B No. 351572/2001)\u201d previously invented by the present inventors has more excellent Ag aggregation resistance as compared with a pure Ag film or an Ag alloy film comprising an Ag base alloy containing one or more elements of Pd, Pt, Sn, Zn, In, Cr, Ti, Si, Zr, Nb, and Ta. Therefore, it shows characteristics excellent in durability (the Ag alloy film will not be deteriorated even after long-term use) and weather resistance (Ag aggregation resistance to a high-temperature high-humidity environment)., 50922=Further, in JP-A No. 135096/1997, there is proposed an electromagnetic-shielding substrate obtained by adding one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pb, Cu, Au, Ni, Zn, Cd, Mg, and Al in an amount of 3 at % to Ag. Whereas, in JP-A No. 231122/1999, there is disclosed a technique for attaining the improvement of the aggregation resistance of Ag by adding Pb, Cu, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Zn, Cd, Mg, and Al to Ag., 55350=Whereas, in JP-A No. 230806/1997, there is disclosed a thin film made of a silver-based metal material (Ag base alloy) which is an alloy with different kinds of elements for preventing the migration of silver element, specifically, one, or two or more kinds of metals selected from the group consisting of aluminum, copper, nickel, cadmium, gold, zinc, and magnesium., 50462=Whereas, in JP-A No. 293379/1996, there is proposed a technique for stacking a metal layer containing Ag as a main component, and Pd in an amount of 0.5 to 5 at % based on the amount of Ag, and transparent dielectric layers each containing one or more metal oxides selected from the group consisting of Zn, In, and Sn on a substrate in such a manner that the metal layer is sandwiched between the transparent dielectric layers., 100727=The film thickness of the underlying film has no particular restriction, but, in general, it is recommendably set at about 10 nm to 1000 nm. If it is less than 10 nm, the intended purpose, for example, achieving of the reduction in optical reflectance while ensuring the satisfactory visible light transmittance may be impossible. Whereas, if it exceeds 1000 nm, the adhesion may be undesirably reduced due to the film stress. More preferably, it is 100 nm or less., 76864=As also disclosed in JP-A No. 184725/2001, there is known an Ag alloy which has been improved in corrosion resistance by adding at least one element selected from Al, Au, Cu, Co, Ni, Ti, V, Mo, Mn, Pt, Si, Nb, Fe, Ta, Hf, Ga, Pd, Bi In, W, and Zr in an amount of 0.5 to 5% to Ag. However, Al, Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd do not have an effect of suppressing the aggregation of Ag atoms occurring when the Ag film has been held at high temperatures. As a result, it is not possible to obtain the durability improvement effect from the viewpoint of the thermal stability mentioned as the object in the present invention. Whereas, addition of Bi in an amount of 0.5% or more reduces the thermal conductivity, and hence it is not preferred, and excluded from the present invention. Further, in JP-A No. 92959/2002, there is disclosed an Ag alloy which has been improved in chemical stability by adding Cu in an amount of 4 to 15 mass %, and Al, Zn, Cd, Sn, Sb, and Ir in an amount of 0.5 mass % or more to Ag. However, Cu, Al, Zn, Cd, Sn, and Ir do not produce an effect of suppressing the aggregation of Ag atoms due to holding under high temperatures. Whereas, addition of Sb in an amount of 0.5 mass % (0.44%) or more reduces the thermal conductivity inherent in Ag, and hence it is not preferred. Therefore, these known Ag alloys are distinctly distinguished from the present invention in terms of the specific constitution and functional effects., 55005=For example, in JP-A No. 134300/1995, there is disclosed a thin film made of a metal which is more susceptible to oxidation than silver, specifically, a silver alloy (Ag base alloy) containing one, or two or more metals selected from the group consisting of magnesium, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium., 43531=As for the means for improving the durability of such an Ag-based reflective film, the following improvement measures have been reported. For example, the durability (chemical stability) is respectively improved by adding Au, Pd, Cu, Rh, Ru, Os, Ir, and Pt to Ag in U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,889, or by adding Pd and Cu to Ag in U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,497. Further, the present inventors also have proposed a method in which the durability (thermal stability in the inhibition of grain growth, or the like) is improved by adding rare earth metal elements to Ag in JP-A 15464/2002., 103971=The film thickness of the protective layer has no particular restriction, but, in general, it is recommendably set at about 10 nm to 1000 nm. If it is less than 10 nm, the abrasion resistance and the damage resistance may not be satisfactorily obtainable, and pinholes are not satisfactorily reduced in number. Whereas, if it exceeds 1000 nm, the adhesion may be undesirably reduced due to the film stress. More preferably, it is 100 nm or less., 88558=Further, the present inventors have found as follows. The foregoing \u201cAg alloy film comprising an Ag base alloy containing Sc, Y, and one or more elements of rare earth elements (JP-B No. 351572/2001)\u201d is excellent in durability to oxygen and moisture in air. However, it cannot acquire a sufficient resistance in an atmosphere containing a halogen element such as salt water. In contrast, the Ag alloy film in accordance with the present invention also exhibits a sufficient resistance to salt water., 41286=This application is a Continuation of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 10/633,550, filed on Aug. 5, 2003, pending., 175624=On a pure Ag target, 5 mm\ufffd5 mm Bi or Sb metal chips were placed. By DC magnetron sputtering, a 100 nm-thick sample of each composition shown in test Nos. 1 to 12 of Table 1 was formed on a glass plate. As for the composition of each thin film, separately, samples with a film thickness of 1 \u03bcm were manufactured under the same conditions. Thus, the identification of each composition was carried out with an ICP-mass spectrometry (SPQ-8000 manufactured by Seiko Instrument Inc.). Specifically, 100 mg or more of the sample was dissolved in a solution of sulfuric acid: pure water=1:1 as a pretreatment. The resulting solution was heated on a 200\ufffd C. hot plate, and it was checked that the sample was completely dissolved. Then, the solution was cooled and analyzed. The target size was \u03c6100 mm, and the size of the glass substrate was \u03c650 mm. The main deposition conditions are as follows. Reached degree of vacuum: 6.67\ufffd10\u22124 Pa, Ar gas pressure during deposition: 0.267 Pa, Substrate temperature: 25\ufffd C., and Distance between target-substrate: 55 mm.}",
