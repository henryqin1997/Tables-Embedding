            "LEAD FRAME - A lead frame includes a plurality of leads electrically connected to a semiconductor chip and a lead lock including a base layer disposed over the plurality of the leads and formed of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of inner leads. An adhesive layer is disposed between the base layer and the plurality of leads to fix the plurality of leads and adhere the base layer to the leads. At least one line electrically connects the semiconductor chip to the base layer of the lead lock. Since regions for bus bars are replaced by the lead lock and are removed, the lead frame can be miniaturized and has superior thermal stability and dimension stability.",

The method includes receiving a voice message input through a terminal by a user, parsing the received voice message and extracting presence information, and publishing the extracted presence information. According to the method, a user can easily and simply publish presence information without personally using an application program based on presence service. In addition, it is possible to dynamically publish or update presence information. 05-21-2009 20120167045 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EVALUATING AUTOSAR META FILE-BASED BASIC SOFTWARE PROPERTIES - Disclosed herein is an apparatus for evaluating Automobile Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) meta file-based basic software properties. The apparatus includes a meta file generation unit, a basic software configuration unit, and a basic software property evaluation unit. The meta file generation unit generates the meta file properties of an AUTOSAR meta file. The basic software configuration unit sets the basic software properties of a basic software configuration file. The basic software property evaluation unit evaluates basic software properties using the meta file properties in order to determine whether the basic software properties were set in conformity with an AUTOSAR standard. 06-28-2012 20130103379 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR VERIFYING INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND AUTOSAR SERVICE - The present invention relates to an apparatus",
