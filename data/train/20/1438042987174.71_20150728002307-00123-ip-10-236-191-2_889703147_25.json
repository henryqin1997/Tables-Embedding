            "Oakwood is a safe environment and the Campus safety actively assist students in any way possible. To us its not just Safety officers they become apart of our family.",
            "Any type of student will be great for Oakwood. It is a school that focuses on the individual and their spiritual, emotional, social, and physical growth.",
            "Unusual locations; no not really. But if we are talking about traditions come join us at a basketball game. It will be the most fun you'll ever have.",
            "Well there are plenty of things to do. You have an engaging worship on Sunday called Sunday Evening Praise, on Mondays through Wednesdays it is pretty chill. On Thursdays there is Art and Soul and Fridays are filled with the best AYS known to man. Saturday's are when the campus can be found at the university church and Sunday's are a relaxing transition back into the busy week.",
            "Food has gotten better in the past few months. The food is vegetarian and there are also vegan options available. There is also the Market where you can get away from the food at the cafe and have a fun meal in a more relaxed environment.",
            "Dorm life is fun and exciting! No co-ed dorms so you have to opportunity to stay more focused on schoolwork when returning to your dorm. You meet the most amazing people. You may have some trouble adjusting to living with the same sex for 5-6 months straight but it is very much worth it in the end.",
            "There are challenging classes that are worth taking. The teachers that are willing to help will help but will not baby you so its best to stay on top of work and assignments. Classes are not too hard; but are far from easy.",
            "Stay focused; but allow yourself to have fun. Make it a apart to join something new; it keeps you in the social scene while not being too social. Do what you are asked when you are asked to do it in reference to attending worships and Chapels ; it will save you some trouble later when the bill comes,",
            "Great atmosphere, and lovely people. Attentive teachers that will help you not only inside but outside the classroom. Amazing spiritual programs that make you want to draw closer to God."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{110477=Oakwood is great for any christian student who has a passion for music. Oakwood produces many great musicians into the world: Musicians like Brian McKnight, Take 6, Virtue, and Commited. Oakwood University has many choirs that travel the world and many other various places. Also Oakwood University Aeolians Choirs are the reigning 2012 World Choir Olympics Champions., 304876=Oakwood is all about your perception. How you perceive it is what you will get. The friends are also what you make it. In addition, the teachers are, for the most part, supportive and caring. They want to see you succeed, and will do what ever it takes to help you reach your goal. There's also many communittee service opportunities in which you can participate. One day in October, there's something called Agape Day where the whole school shuts down and goes out in the community to help others. This year, the mayor came by to visit and share a few words before we left. You can also go on mission trips to other places to help out. Our choirs also travel to go and sing. Most of them stay in the states, however, our classical music choir (The Aeolians) travel around the world. You also get a good education and have opportunites to join programs that can help out with your future schooling (graduate school)., 231650=If your class starts at 3:30 what time should you leave Carter hall to get there?, 360683=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 236537=I stayed in Carter Hall for my freshman year, which wasn't bad. It needs a lot of work, but luckily it's getting rebuilt this year and will be ready by Spring 2014., 267205=Many may complain about the two major traditions that we have when you live on campus and you have not yet become a senior and they are worships and curfew. We are no longer required to have three worships a week in order to leave for the weekend, (after putting in a weekend leave) which may be a bother at times, but if we miss getting the three worships we do get a $10 fine. There are many opportunities to get three worships in during the week, but frankly sometimes you just forget or you just don't feel like going. When I came in, I didn't like the idea of getting three worships because I don't feel like anyone should be forced to get them, but as a matriculated through I realized it's just not that bad. It's a great way to pause from your work and refocus on God, relieving any stress that may have built up from the day. Chapel is something we have for an hour every Thursday morning at 10 AM to have praise and worship, news for students, and a positive thought for the day. If you don't have class until 2 PM it can be a drag, but it's for the good of the campus and its students. Curfew during the week for freshmen is at 12 AM and 1 AM on Saturday's, for upperclassmen its 1 AM every day of the week (except 11:30 PM for all students on Friday nights) while living on campus. This is a bother to many and on few occasions have been an issue for me, but honestly most of the time you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re in before curfew any ways because it's a school night. All in all, Oakwood is trying to enforce discipline and values into our lives., 111645=In 2012 Oakwood has won many scholastic events. We are the 2012 National Champions in division 3 basketball. We currently just won the 2012 World Choir Olympics, and we produced the great singing group Committed who won the show The Sing Off., 166518=For those that kept their gpa's up in highschool, they have an opportunity to stay in the honors wing. It is first come first serve among those who fit the criteria so don't waste time applying for the honors wing. Describing the physical condition of Carter Hall is pointless because they are renovating the dorm this summer. So the class of 2013 will be in a new building. However, the RA's and Deans are very nice. They are very reasonable and fair when it comes to issues., 128902=Oakwood University is a decent institution. It is in between. May change lives for those who are religious.}",

    "textAfterTable": "I really enjoyed being at Oakwood. When I first attended, I didn't appreciate it until I saw what the school was like. Now, that I'm officially gone, I realize how much I miss the school. The spiritual aspect is a plus! However, there were a couple issues here and there but nothing that one can't overcome and besides every school has his or her own issues. If I had the option again, I would go to Oakwood! Did learn a lot I learned a lot while attending Oakwood, both inside and outside of class. The school brings in wonderful speakers to talk to the students at different times. The motto, Enter to Learn Depart to Serve is definitely a phrase that Oakwood University stands true to.
