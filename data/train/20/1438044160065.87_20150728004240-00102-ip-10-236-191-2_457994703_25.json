In addition, a completely cyclic TNF-\u03b1 may be generated, wherein the protein contains no termini. This is accomplished utilizing intein technology. Thus, peptides can be cyclized and in particular inteins may be utilized to accomplish the cyclization., 207709=Compared to the reference standard (10 mg/mL protein in water), XENP1595 in Sodium Phosphate and Histidine buffers incubated at 4\ufffd C. displayed minimal aggregation at Three Months., 251223=The stability of XENP1595 at an API concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL in two different formulations. The effect of various formulation parameters on the degradations of the XENP1595 protein, i.e., aggregation, deamidation, and/or loss of PEG during Three Months' storage at \u221230\ufffd C., \u221220\ufffd C., 4\ufffd C., 29\ufffd C. and 37\ufffd C., 27366=In an additional aspect, the invention provides TNF-\u03b1 variants selected from the group consisting of XENP268 XENP344, XENP345, XENP346, XENP550, XENP551, XENP557, XENP1593, XENP1594, and XENP1595 as outlined in Example 3., 249434=The formulation optimization of XENP 1595 balanced the formation of soluble aggregates (seen in SEC-HPLC but not in SDS-PAGE) which occurs predominantly at lower pH, and the formation of covalent aggregates and RP-HPLC pre-peak which are accelerated at higher pH. The most stable condition was found at pH 7 with sodium chloride as an ionic tonicity modifier., 191448=In a preferred embodiment, variant TNF-\u03b1 genes are administered as DNA vaccines, either single genes or combinations of variant TNF-\u03b1 genes. Naked DNA vaccines are generally known in the art. Brower, Nature Biotechnology, 16:1304-1305 (1998), incorporated entirely by reference. Methods for the use of genes as DNA vaccines are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and include placing a variant TNF-\u03b1 gene or portion of a variant TNF-\u03b1 gene under the control of a promoter for expression in a patient in need of treatment. The variant TNF-\u03b1 gene used for DNA vaccines can encode full-length variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins, but more preferably encodes portions of the variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins including peptides derived from the variant TNF-\u03b1 protein. In a preferred embodiment a patient is immunized with a DNA vaccine comprising a plurality of nucleotide sequences derived from a variant TNF-\u03b1 gene. Similarly, it is possible to immunize a patient with a plurality of variant TNF-\u03b1 genes or portions thereof as defined herein. Without being bound by theory, expression of the polypeptide encoded by the DNA vaccine, cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells and antibodies are induced which recognize and destroy or eliminate cells expressing TNF-\u03b1 proteins., 74213=Further, triple point variants may be generated. Preferred positions include 34, 75, 87, 91, 115, 143, 145 and 146. Examples of triple point variants include V91E, N34E and one of Y115I, Y115I, D143K, D143R, A145R, A145E E146K, and E146R. Other triple point variants include L75E and Y87H and at least one of Y115Q, A145R, Also, L75K, Y87H and Y115Q. More preferred are the triple point variants V91E, N34E and either A145R or A145E. One embodiment of a more preferred variant, called XENP1595, is <001<-V001M-R031C-\u03bc031Peg10-C069V-Y087H-C101A-A0145R->157>., 247536=The optimal pH that became the focus of this study was a neutral pH 7 since all XENP 1595 formulations consistently displayed a severe form of soluble aggregation at acidic pH., 128147=Another type of covalent modification of variant TNF-\u03b1 comprises linking the variant TNF-\u03b1polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (\u201cPEG\u201d), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337, and U.S. application Ser. No. 10/956,352, filed Sep. 30, 2004, all incorporated entirely by reference. These nonproteinaceous polymers may also be used to enhance the variant TNF-\u03b1's ability to disrupt receptor binding, and/or in vivo stability. In another preferred embodiment, cysteines are designed into variant or wild type TNF-\u03b1 in order to incorporate (a) labeling sites for characterization and (b) incorporate PEGylation sites. For example, labels that may be used are well known in the art and include but are not limited to biotin, tag and fluorescent labels (e.g. fluorescein). These labels may be used in various assays as are also well known in the art to achieve characterization. A variety of coupling chemistries may be used to achieve PEGylation, as is well known in the art. Examples include but are not limited to, the technologies of Shearwater and Enzon, which allow modification at primary amines, including but not limited to, lysine groups and the N-terminus. See, Kinstler et al, Advanced Drug Deliveries Reviews, 54, 477-485 (2002) and M J Roberts et al, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54, 459-476 (2002), both incorporated entirely by reference., 125995=Addition of N-linked glycosylation sites to variant TNF-\u03b1 polypeptides may be accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence thereof. The alteration may be made, for example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more asparagine residues to the native sequence or variant TNF-\u03b1 polypeptide. The modification may be made for example by the incorporation of a canonical N-linked glycosylation site, including but not limited to, N\u2014X\u2014Y, where X is any amino acid except for proline and Y is preferably threonine, serine or cysteine. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the variant TNF-\u03b1 polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art, e.g., in WO 87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981), incorporated entirely by reference. Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the variant TNF-\u03b1 polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described, for instance, by Hakimuddin, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 259:52 (1987) and by Edge et al., Anal. Biochem., 118:131 (1981), incorporated entirely by reference. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., Meth. Enzymol., 138:350 (1987), incorporated entirely by reference. Such derivatized moieties may improve the solubility, absorption, and permeability across the blood brain barrier biological half-life, and the like. Such moieties or modifications of variant TNF-\u03b1 polypeptides may alternatively eliminate or attenuate any possible undesirable side effect of the protein and the like. Moieties capable of mediating such effects are disclosed, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1980), incorporated entirely by reference., 246432=No SEC-HPLC signal was detected for all XENP 1596 samples at pH 4-5, suggesting that the protein was precipitated at both 4\ufffd C. and 29\ufffd C. (data not shown). Formation of higher molecular weight species was observed in SEC-HPLC and in SDS-PAGE at higher pH. Two different forms of aggregation appeared to exist for XENP 1596: a non-covalent aggregate that is formed as an insoluble form at lower pHs and an aggregate that grows faster at higher pHs during incubation at 4\ufffd C. or 29\ufffd C., 179154=Pharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein a TNF-\u03b1 variant of the present invention and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing TNF-\u03b1 variant having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980, incorporated entirely by reference), in the form of lyophilized formulations incorporated entirely by reference) or aqueous solutions. Lyophilization is well known in the art, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,743, incorporated entirely by reference. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as histidine, phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\ufffd, PLURONICS\ufffd or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the TNF-\u03b1 variant of the present invention may be in a water-soluble form. The TNF-\u03b1 variant may be present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt\u201d refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts\u201d include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods., 249892=The stability of pegylated XENP1595 protein at an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL was examined under different formulation parameters (buffer composition) at various incubation temperatures., 239150=Under stress conditions of UV light and vortex, the lower pH 4-5 range for both XENP 1595 formulations containing either 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% sorbitol did not fare well as indicated by the presence of major aggregates although at higher pHs covalent aggregates can be seen., 237264=RP-HPLC data demonstrated a slightly higher degradation peak for XENP1595 samples incubated for Three Months at 4\ufffd C., which was less prominent in samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C., 250163=SEC-HPLC and SDS-PAGE were used to identify aggregation. The RP-HPLC method was used to monitor degradations of the XENP1595 protein., 38764=By \u201cprotein\u201d is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e., \u201canalogs\u201d such as peptoids [see Simon et al., Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U.S.A. 89(20:9367-71 (1992), incorporated entirely by reference], generally depending on the method of synthesis. Thus \u201camino acid\u201d, or \u201cpeptide residue\u201d, as used means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homo-phenylalanine, citrulline, and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. \u201cAmino acid\u201d also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. In addition, any amino acid representing a component of the variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins can be replaced by the same amino acid but of the opposite chirality. Thus, any amino acid naturally occurring in the L-configuration (which may also be referred to as the R or S, depending upon the structure of the chemical entity) may be replaced with an amino acid of the same chemical structural type, but of the opposite chirality, generally referred to as the D-amino acid but which can additionally be referred to as the R- or the S-, depending upon its composition and chemical configuration. Such derivatives have the property of greatly increased stability, and therefore are advantageous in the formulation of compounds which may have longer in vivo half lives, when administered by oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, topical, rectal, intraocular, or other routes. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the S- or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradations. Proteins including non-naturally occurring amino acids may be synthesized or in some cases, made recombinantly; see van Hest et al., FEBS Lett 428:(1-2) 68-70 May 22, 1998 and Tang et al., Abstr. Pap Am. Chem. S218:U138-U138 Part 2 Aug. 22, 1999, both incorporated entirely by reference., 294638=RP-HPLC data demonstrated a slightly higher degradation peak for XENP1595 samples incubated for Three Months at 4\ufffd C., which was less prominent in samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C., 62357=Homology in this context means sequence similarity or identity, with identity being preferred. As is known in the art, a number of different programs may be used to identify whether a protein (or nucleic acid as discussed below) has sequence identity or similarity to a known sequence. Sequence identity and/or similarity is determined using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence identity algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2:482 (1981), by the sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol., 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid Res., 12:387-395 (1984), all incorporated entirely by reference, preferably using the default settings, or by inspection. Preferably, percent identity is calculated by FastDB based upon the following parameters: mismatch penalty of 1; gap penalty of 1; gap size penalty of 0.33; and joining penalty of 30, \u201cCurrent Methods in Sequence Comparison and Analysis,\u201d Macromolecule Sequencing and Synthesis, Selected Methods and Applications, pp 127-149 (1988), Alan R.

In general, these applications describe a variety of computational modeling systems that allow the generation of extremely stable proteins. In this way, variants of TNF proteins were generated that act as antagonists for wild type TNF-\u03b1. Other models for assessing the relative energies of sequences with high precision include Warshel, Computer Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Enzymes and Solutions, Wiley & Sons, New York, (1991), as well as the models identified in U.S. Ser.

Rev., (1995) pp. 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C & E News, Jun. 2, 1997, page 35. All incorporated entirely by reference. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of additional moieties such as labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments. In addition, mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made. Alternatively, mixtures of different nucleic acid analogs, and mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs may be made. The nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. The nucleic acid may be DNA, both genomic and cDNA, RNA or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid contains any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xathanine hypoxathanine, isocytosine, isoguanine, 4-acetylcytosine, 8-hydroxy-N6-methyladenosine, aziridinylcytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 5-carboxymethyl-aminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methyladenine, 1-methylpseudouracil, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, oxybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, and 2,6-diaminopurine. etc., 239651=The experiments were designed to examine the effect of various formulation parameters on the degradations of the DN-TNF protein, i.e., aggregation, deamidation, and/or loss of PEG. XENP 1595 and XENP 1596 were placed into various formulations, and aggregation, deamidation, and/or loss of PEG were examined during four week storage at \u221270\ufffd C., \u221220\ufffd C., 4\ufffd C. and 37\ufffd C. (29\ufffd C. for XENP 1596)., 50309=In some embodiments, the variants of the invention are antagonists of both soluble and transmembrane TNF-\u03b1. However, as described herein, some variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins are antagonists of the activity of soluble TNF-\u03b1 but do not substantially effect the activity of transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 Thus, a reduction of activity of the heterotrimers for soluble TNF-\u03b1 is as outlined above, with reductions in biological activity of at least 10%, 25, 50 75, 80, 90, 95, 99 or 100% all being preferred. However, some of the variants outlined herein comprise selective inhibition; that is, they inhibit soluble TNF-\u03b1 activity but do not substantially inhibit transmembrane TNF-\u03b1. In these embodiments, it is preferred that at least 80%, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% of the transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 activity is maintained. This may also be expressed as a ratio; that is, selective inhibition can include a ratio of inhibition of soluble to transmembrane TNF-\u03b1. For example, variants that result in at least a 10:1 selective inhibition of soluble to transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 activity are preferred, with 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, 500:1, 1000:1 or higher find particular use in the invention. Thus one embodiment utilizes variants, such as double mutants at positions 87/145 as outlined herein, that substantially inhibit or eliminate soluble TNF-\u03b1 activity (for example by exchanging with homotrimeric wild-type to form heterotrimers that do not bind to TNF-\u03b1 receptors or that bind but do not activate receptor signaling) but do not significantly effect (and preferably do not alter at all) transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 activity. Without being bound by theory, the variants exhibiting such differential inhibition allow the decrease of inflammation without a corresponding loss in immune response., 265678=XENP1595 in Sodium Phosphate and Histidine buffers incubated at \u221220\ufffd C. displayed a more significant pre-shoulder indicating aggregation (data not shown). The total area for the two samples at \u221220\ufffd C. was observed to be lower than the 4\ufffd C. samples at this time point by SEC-HPLC., 206179=The following formulation parameters were tested in the full matrix study. All formulations contained 0.01% polysorbate 20, 150 mM sodium chloride, and the concentration of XENP1595 was approximately 100 mg/mL (94 mg/mL for protein in Sodium Phosphate buffer and 102 mg/mL for protein in Histidine buffer)., 105517=In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the expression vector contains a selectable marker gene to allow the selection of transformed host cells. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used. A preferred expression vector system is a retroviral vector system such as is generally described in PCT/US97/01019 and PCT/US97/01048, both incorporated entirely by reference. In a preferred embodiment, the expression vector comprises the components described above and a gene encoding a variant TNF-\u03b1 protein. As will be appreciated by those in the art, all combinations are possible and accordingly, as used herein, the combination of components, comprised by one or more vectors, which may be retroviral or not, is referred to herein as a \u201cvector composition\u201d., 71785=For purposes of the present invention, the areas of the wild type or naturally occurring TNF-\u03b1 molecule to be modified are selected from the group consisting of the Large Domain (also known as II), Small Domain (also known as I), the DE loop, and the trimer interface. The Large Domain, the Small Domain and the DE loop are the receptor interaction domains. The modifications may be made solely in one of these areas or in any combination of these areas. The Large Domain preferred positions to be varied include: 21, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 65, 66, 67, 111, 112, 115, 140, 143, 144, 145, 146 and/or 147. For the Small Domain, the preferred positions to be modified are 75 and/or 97. For the DE Loop, the preferred position modifications are 84, 86, 87 and/or 91. The Trimer Interface has preferred double variants including positions 34 and 91 as well as at position 57. In a preferred embodiment, substitutions at multiple receptor interaction and/or trimerization domains may be combined. Examples include, but are not limited to, simultaneous substitution of amino acids at the large and small domains (e.g. A145R and I97T), large domain and DE loop (A145R and Y87H), and large domain and trimerization domain (A145R and L57F). Additional examples include any and all combinations, e.g., I97T and Y87H (small domain and DE loop). More specifically, theses variants may be in the form of single point variants, for example K112D, Y115K, Y1151, Y115T, A145E or A145R. These single point variants may be combined, for example, Y115I and A145E, or Y115I and A145R, or Y115T and A145R or Y115I and A145E; or any other combination., 70596=In a preferred embodiment, the variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins comprise residues selected from the following positions 21, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 57, 65, 66, 67, 69, 75, 84, 86, 87, 91, 97, 101, 111, 112, 115, 140, 143, 144, 145, 146, and 147. Preferred changes include: Q21C, Q21R, E23C, N34E, V91E, Q21R, N30D, R31c, R311, R31D, R31E, R32D, R32E, R32S, A33E, N34E, N34V, A35S, D45C, L57F, L57W, L57Y, K65D, K65E, K651, K65M, K65N, K65Q, K65T, K65S, K65V, K65W, G66K, G66Q, Q67D, Q67K, Q67R, Q67S, Q67W, Q67Y, C69V, L75E, L75K, L75Q, A84V, S86Q, S86R, Y87H, Y87R, V91E, I97R, I97T, C101A, A111R, A111E, K112D, K112E, Y115D, Y115E, Y115F, Y115H, Y1151, Y115K, Y115L, Y115M, Y115N, Y115Q, Y115R, Y115S, Y115T, Y115W, D140K, D140R, D143E, D143K, D143L, D143R, D143N, D143Q, D143R, D143S, F144N, A145D, A145E, A145F, A145H, A145K, A145M, A145N, A145Q, A145R, A145S, A145T, A145Y, E146K, E146L, E146M, E146N, E146R, E146S and S147R. These may be done either individually or in combination, with any combination being possible. However, as outlined herein, preferred embodiments utilize at least 1 to 5, and preferably more, positions in each variant TNF-\u03b1 protein., 263927=The following formulation parameters were tested in the full matrix study. All formulations contained 0.01% polysorbate 20, 150 mM sodium chloride, and the concentration of XENP1595 was approximately 100 mg/mL (94 mg/mL for protein in Sodium Phosphate buffer and 102 mg/mL for protein in Histidine buffer)., 20971=The different activities of soluble TNF (solTNF) and transmembrane TNG (tmTNF), mediated through discrete interactions with receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, may account for contrasting beneficial and harmful roles reported for TNF in animal models and in human disease (Kollias, D. Kontoyiannis, Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 13, 315 (2002); M. Grell et al., Cell 83, 793 (1995); M. Grell, H. Wajant, G. Zimmermann, P. Scheurich, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95, 570 (1998); C. O. Jacob, Immunol. Today 13, 122 (1992); R. N. Saha, K. Pahan, J. Neurochem. 86, 1057 (2003); and, M. H. Holtmann, M. F. Neurath, Curr. Mol. Med. 4, 439 (2004), all incorporated entirely by reference). For example, paracrine signaling by solTNF is associated with chronic inflammation, while juxtacrine signaling by tmTNF plays an essential role in resolving inflammation and maintaining immunity to pathogens (Holtmann & Neurath, supra; S. R. Ruuls et al., Immunity 15, 533 (2001); M. Canault et al., Atherosclerosis 172, 211 (2004); C. Mueller et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274, 38112 (1999); M. L. Olleros et al., J. Immunol. 168, 3394 (2002); and, M. Pasparakis, L. Alexopoulou, V. Episkopou, G. Kollias, J. Exp. Med. 184, 1397 (1996), all incorporated entirely by reference.) Excess soluble TNF levels are associated with numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and inactivation of TNF by injectable protein inhibitors reduces symptoms and blocks disease progression (B. B. Aggarwal, A. Samanta, M. Feldmann, in Cytokine Reference J. J. Oppenheim, M. Feldmann, Eds. (Academic Press, London, 2000) pp. 413-434, incorporated entirely by reference). The three FDA-approved TNF inhibitors include a TNFR2-IgG1 Fc decoy receptor (etanercept) and two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, Remicade\ufffd (infliximab) and Humira\ufffd (adalimumab). Although effective anti-inflammatory agents, these immunosuppressive drugs can exacerbate demyelinating disease, induce lymphoma, reactivate latent tuberculosis, and increase the risk of sepsis and other infections, as indicated in their warning labels, (N. Scheinfeld, J. Dermatolog. Treat. 15, 280 (2004), incorporated entirely by reference). A possible explanation for the increased risk of infection comes from studies using TNF knockout and tmTNF knock-in mice, which demonstrate that tmTNF signaling is sufficient to maintain immunity to listerial and mycobacterial infection. In contrast, solTNF is a primary driver of inflammation. Decoy receptors and antibodies can bind to tmTNF, and that etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab inhibit tmTNF in addition to solTNF (J. Gerspach et al., Microsc. Res. Tech. 50, 243 (2000); H. Mitoma, T. Horiuchi, H. Tsukamoto, Gastroenterology 126, 934 (2004); J. Agnholt, J. F. Dahlerup, K. Kaltoft, Cytokine 23, 76 (2003); B. Scallon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 301, 418 (2002); C. Shen et al., Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 21, 251 (2005); and, H. Mitoma et al., Gastroenterology 128, 376 (2005), all incorporated entirely by reference). In view of the serious side effects of existing therapies, a therapeutic that is more potent and has a reduced side effect profile is still needed. The present invention shows that an anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits solTNF but spares tmTNF-mediated signaling will block inflammation yet preserve normal immunity to infectious agents., 35981=In addition, the TNF-\u03b1 variants may be modified to include polymers, such as PEG, to allow for altered half-lifes and stabilities within the patient. Preferred methods for identifying suitable sites for either the addition or removal of putative PEGylation sites are found in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/956,352, filed Sep. 30, 2004, and U.S. application Ser. No. 11/200,444, filed Aug. 8, 2005, both incorporated entirely by reference., 110332=The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into mammalian hosts, as well as other hosts, is well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. As outlined herein, a particularly preferred method utilizes retroviral infection, as outlined in PCT US97/01019, incorporated entirely by reference., 246949=The pH effect was dominant in XENP 1595 stability samples as well. Soluble aggregation represented the most severe degradation when the proteins were formulated at pHs lower than 6.0. After pegylation, the protein became more soluble but a large amount of soluble aggregates appeared in the lower pH 4-5 range at \u221270\ufffd C. (not shown), \u221220\ufffd C. (not shown), 4\ufffd C. and 37\ufffd C. (not shown). Results from SDS-PAGE analysis showed the formation of covalent aggregates at higher pHs. Also, the aggregation peaks for the higher pHs grew during incubation at 37\ufffd C., 250329=All samples were stored at 37\ufffd C. formed irreversible gel within a week. XENP1595 stored in Histidine buffer at \u221230\ufffd C. formed an irreversible gel after Four Weeks. XENP1595 in Phosphate buffer stored at \u221230\ufffd C. was viscous. These samples were not analyzed by HPLC or SDS-PAGE., 237472=SDS-Page data showed some signs of aggregation and de-pegylation for XENP1595 samples incubated for Three Months at 4\ufffd C., which was not as significant for samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C., 270188=No significant increase in degradation was detected in \u221220\ufffd C. samples, consistent with previous time points (data not shown). Compared to the reference standard, XENP1595 in Sodium Phosphate and Histidine buffers displayed an inherent degradation peak, resulting from process impurities that increased slightly after incubation up to Three Months at 4\ufffd C. (data not shown)., 77300=In one embodiment, the nucleic acid homology is determined through hybridization studies. Thus, for example, nucleic acids which hybridize under high stringency to the nucleic acid sequence SEQ. ID. 1 or its complement and encode a variant TNF-\u03b1 protein is considered a variant TNF-\u03b1 gene. High stringency conditions are known in the art; see for example Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Edition, 1989, and Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, ed. Ausubel, et al., both incorporated entirely by reference. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\u2014Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993), incorporated entirely by reference. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10 degrees C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 degrees C. for short probes (e.g. 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 degrees C. for long probes (e.g. greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. In another embodiment, less stringent hybridization conditions are used; for example, moderate or low stringency conditions may be used, as are known in the art; see Maniatis and Ausubel, supra, and Tijssen, supra., 238498=For XENP 1595, a pH 7 formulation with sodium chloride as the tonicity modifier emerged as a promising candidate. The formulation showed increased stability and a minimal amount of aggregation and degradation. At pHs lower than 6, major forms of soluble aggregation were dominant, whereas smaller amounts of covalent aggregation were present at higher pHs., 236989=SEC-HPLC data showed a significant pre-shoulder for XENP1595 samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C. for Three Months, while the effect was less prominent for 4\ufffd C. samples. Total area was lower for \u221220\ufffd C. samples compared to the 4\ufffd C. samples as well., 265465=Compared to the reference standard (10 mg/mL protein in water), XENP1595 in Sodium Phosphate and Histidine buffers incubated at 4\ufffd C. displayed minimal aggregation at Three Months., 18677=TNF-\u03b1 exerts its biological effects through interaction with high-affinity cell surface receptors. Two distinct membrane TNF-\u03b1 receptors have been cloned and characterized. These are a 55 kDa species, designated p55 TNF-R and a 75 kDa species designated p75 TNF-R (Corcoran. A. E., et al., (1994) Eur. J. Biochem., 223:831-840, incorporated entirely by reference). The two TNF receptors exhibit 28% similarity at the amino acid level. This is confined to the extracellular domain and consists of four repeating cysteine-rich motifs, each of approximately 40 amino acids. Each motif contains four to six cysteines in conserved positions. Dayhoff analysis shows the greatest intersubunit similarity among the first three repeats in each receptor. This characteristic structure is shared with a number of other receptors and cell surface molecules, which comprise the TNF-R/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. TNF signaling is initiated by receptor clustering, either by the trivalent ligand TNF or by cross-linking monoclonal antibodies (Vandevoorde, V., et al., (1997) J. Cell Biol., 137:1627-1638, incorporated entirely by reference)., 69509=TNF-\u03b1 proteins may be fused to, for example, to other therapeutic proteins or to other proteins such as Fc or serum albumin for therapeutic or pharmacokinetic purposes. In this embodiment, a TNF-\u03b1 protein of the present invention is operably linked to a fusion partner. The fusion partner may be any moiety that provides an intended therapeutic or pharmacokinetic effect. Examples of fusion partners include but are not limited to Human Serum Albumin, a therapeutic agent, a cytotoxic or cytotoxic molecule, radionucleotide, and an Fc, etc. As used herein, an Fc fusion is synonymous with the terms \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d, \u201cIg fusion\u201d, \u201cIg chimera\u201d, and \u201creceptor globulin\u201d as used in the prior art (Chamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200, both incorporated entirely by reference). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with the target-binding region of a TNF-\u03b1 protein, for example. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,883 and 5,876,969, both incorporated entirely by reference., 294175=The \u221220\ufffd C. samples at Three Months showed some trace of covalent aggregation. The 4\ufffd C. samples displayed aggregation and a slight hint of de-pegylation at Three Months (data not shown). SEC-HPLC data showed a significant pre-shoulder for XENP1595 samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C. for Three Months, while the effect was less prominent for 4\ufffd C. samples. Total area was lower for \u221220\ufffd C. samples compared to the 4\ufffd C. samples as well., 166630=Once made, the variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins and nucleic acids of the invention find use in a number of applications. In a preferred embodiment, the variant TNF-\u03b1 proteins are administered to a patient to treat a TNF-\u03b1 related disorder. By \u201cTNF-\u03b1 related disorder\u201d or \u201cTNF-\u03b1 responsive disorder\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d herein is meant a disorder that may be ameliorated by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a variant TNF-\u03b1 protein, including, but not limited to, inflammatory and immunological disorders. The variant TNF-\u03b1 is a major effector and regulatory cytokine with a pleiotropic role in the pathogenesis of immune-regulated diseases. In addition, the variant TNF-\u03b1 plays a role in inflammation related conditions. In a preferred embodiment, the variant TNF-\u03b1 protein is used to treat spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, sepsis and septic shock, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma (MM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), cancer and the inflammation associated with tumors, peripheral nerve injury or demyelinating diseases, and Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease. See, for example, Tsimberidou et al., Expert Rev Anticancer Ther 2002 June; 2(3):277-86, incorporated entirely by reference. It may also be used to treat multiple schlerosis, lupus, diabetes and insulin insensitivity. Inflammatory bowel disease (\u201cIBD\u201d) is the term generally applied to two diseases, namely ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology afflicting only the large bowel and, except when very severe, limited to the bowel mucosa. The course of the disease may be continuous or relapsing, mild or severe. It is curable by total colostomy which may be needed for acute severe disease or chronic unremitting disease. Crohn's disease is also a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology but, unlike ulcerative colitis, it can affect any part of the bowel. Although lesions may start superficially, the inflammatory process extends through the bowel wall to the draining lymph nodes. As with ulcerative colitis, the course of the disease may be continuous or relapsing, mild or severe but, unlike ulcerative colitis, it is not curable by resection of the involved segment of bowel. Most patients with Crohn's disease come to surgery at some time, but subsequent relapse is common and continuous medical treatment is usual. Remicade\ufffd (inflixmab) is the commercially available treatment for Crohn's disease. Remicade\ufffd is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF-\u03b1. The use of the TNF-\u03b1 variants of the present invention may also be used to treat the conditions associated with IBD or Crohn's Disease., 148455=Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology, 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody [Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990)]. Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide [Hopp et al., BioTechnology 6:1204-1210 (1988)]; the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., Science 255:192-194 (1992)]; tubulin epitope peptide [Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266:15163-15166 (1991)]; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:6393-6397 (1990)], all incorporated entirely by reference., 294846=SDS-Page data showed some signs of aggregation and de-pegylation for XENP1595 samples incubated for Three Months at 4\ufffd C., which was not as significant for samples incubated at \u221220\ufffd C., 157831=Candidate agents encompass numerous chemical classes. In one embodiment, the candidate agent is an organic molecule, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 daltons. Particularly preferred are small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,000 daltons, more preferably less than about 1500 daltons, more preferably less than about 1000 daltons, more preferably less than 500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least one of an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations lists possible variants of TNF-\u03b1 based upon this TNF-\u03b1 root sequence. FIG. 7 Therapeutics of the present invention inhibit soluble TNF-induced paracrine signaling yet spare juxtacrine signaling events mediated by transmembrane TNF. The unique ligand selectivity profile of variant TNF of the present invention contrasts with existing decoy receptor and antibody drugs that inhibit both solTNF and tmTNF activities. We demonstrate that variant TNF of the present invention has similar anti-inflammatory activity to etanercept in a murine model of arthritis, but unlike etanercept, does not compromise the normal innate immune response to Listeria infection. ). In both organs, etanercept greatly increased bacterial load (by factors of 90, 125, and 5,000 in spleen and 30, 25, and 390 in blood at the 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg doses, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated mice. In contrast, even the highest dose of variant TNF of the present invention did not significantly increase bacterial load in spleen or blood relative to vehicle. In particular, only 3 of 24 mice in XENP1595 dose groups had any detectable bacteria in the blood, vs. 23 of 24 in the etanercept groups. Listeria, like the mycobacteria, is an intracellular pathogen in mice as in humans, therefore, detectable listeremia is evidence of a severe infection. The minimal number of bacteria in the blood of variant TNF of the present invention-treated mice indicates that these mice mounted an immune response",
