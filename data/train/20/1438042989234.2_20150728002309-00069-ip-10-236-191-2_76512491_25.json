If this goes above 0.6 starting 2014-09-19, the improvement could prove to be huge: It could give us much longer lifetimes of data in freenet., 531092=I needed to convert a huge batch of mediawiki-files to html (had a 2010-03 copy of the now dead limewire wiki lying around). With a tip from RoanKattouw in #mediawiki@freenode.net I created a simple python script to convert arbitrary files from mediawiki syntax to html., 395623=Phoronix recently did a benchmark of GCC vs. LLVM on AMD hardware. Sadly their conclusion did not fit the data they showed. Actually it misrepresented the data so strongly, that I decided to speak up here instead of having my comments disappear in their forums. This post was started on 2013-05-14 and got updates when things changed - first for the better, then for the worse., 1042879=To understand this, please imagine coming back home, getting off the bike and taking 15 minutes to look at the most recent pull-request. You know that you\u2019ll need to start making dinner at 19:00, so there is no time to waste. You look into the pull-request and the explanations are longer than the code changes. You can either read half the explanations or just look at the code. So you try to understand what the code does and what it intends to do from the code alone. After 15 minutes you post a partial review and start cooking. Next slot for code review is tomorrow evening, or maybe next friday. The pull-request lies open for several weeks while more changes pile up., 913837=Date: 2013-04-17T20:39+0200, 880352=Update (2013-04-18): In #mercurial @ irc.freenode.net there were discussions yesterday for improving the help output if you do not have your username setup, yet., 107665=Naturally this technique could be used for real spamming, but to be frank: People who send spam won\u2019t need it. They will already have much more sophisticated methods. This little trick just reduces the inconvenience brought upon us by the measures which are necessary due to spam. Otherwise I could just send a mail with 1000 receivers in the BCC field - which is how it should be.\u00a0\u21a9, 875836=http://www.bitbucket.org/ArneBab/md-esw-2009, 766402=Update (2014-05-22): The performance stats are much better again and the link-length distribution recovered. We might have been hit by an attack after all (which failed to take down freenet, but hurt pretty much). With some luck we\u2019ll soon see a paper published with the evaluation of the attack and ways to mitigate it cleanly. (hint to computer scientists: we link to papers from the freenetproject.org website, so if you want to get a small boost for your chances of citation, send the link to your paper to devl@freenetproject.org), 992977=Note: If you have a huge number of small features (2000 and upwards), the number of persistent named branches can create some performance problems for listing the branches (only for the listing!) (as different example, pushing is unaffected: Linear history is just as fast as 2000 branches). For features which need no collaboration or need only a few commits, this workflow also has much unnecessary overhead. It is best used for features which will be developed side by side with default for some time (and many commits), so tracking the default branch against the feature is relevant. To mark single-commit features as belonging to a feature, just use the commit message., 819419=You can find Sone in Freenet using the key USK@nwa8lHa271k2QvJ8aa0Ov7IHAV-DFOCFgmDt3X6BpCI,DuQSUZiI~agF8c-6tjsFFGuZ8eICrzWCILB60nT8KKo,AQACAAE/sone/38/\u00a0\u21a9, 789101=Since the Google Summer of Code project from Steve Dougherty in 2013, Infocalypse supports sending pull-requests via Freemail, anonymous E-Mail over Freenet., 990906=Learning Mercurial in Workflows - A practical guide to version tracking / source code management with Mercurial Copyright \u00a9 2011 Arne Babenhauserheide (main author), David Soria Parra, Augie Fackler, Benoit Boissinot, Adrian Buehlmann, Nicolas Dumazet and Steve Losh., 393468=\u201cSupport !theora against h.264 and #flash [as video codec for the web]. Otherwise only big companies will be able to write video browsers - or we get a h.264 tax on !fs\u201d, 483115=Update (2014-10-07): Lennart hetzt (german) describes the rhetoric tricks used by Lennart Poettering to make people forget that he is a major part of the communication problems we\u2019re facing at times - and to hide valid technical, practical, pragmatical, political und strategical criticism of Systemd., 991745=You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA., 396271=Update 3 (the last straw, 2013-11-09): In the recent most blatant attack by Phoronix on copyleft programs - this time openly targeted at GNU - Michael Larabel directly misrepresented a post from Josh Klint to badmouth GDB (Josh confirmed this1). Josh gave a report of his initial experience with GDB in a Kickstarter Update in which he reported some shortcomings he saw in GDB (of which the major gripe is easily resolved with better documentation2) and concluded with \u201cthe limitations of GDB are annoying, but I can deal with it. It's very nice to be able to run and debug our editor on Linux\u201d. Michael Larabel only quoted the conclusion up to \u201cannoying\u201d and abused that to support the claim that game developers (in general) call GDB \u201ccrap\u201d and for further badmouthing of GDB. With this he provided the straw which I needed to stop reading Phoronix: Michael Larabel is hostile to copyleft and in particular to GNU and he goes as far as rigging test results3 and misrepresenting words of others to further his agenda. I even donated to Phoronix a few times in the past. I guess I won\u2019t do that again, either. I should have learned from the error of the german pirates and should have avoided reading media which is controlled by people who want to destroy what I fight for (sustainable free software). Update 2 (2013-07-06): But the next went down the drain again\u2026 \u201cOf course, LLVM/Clang 3.3 still lacks OpenMP support, so those tests are obviously in favor of GCC.\u201d \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find a better way to say that those tests are completely useless while at the same time devaluing OpenMP support as \u201cignore this result along with all others where GCC wins\u201d\u2026 Update (2013-06-21): The recent report of GCC 4.8 vs. LLVM 3.3 looks much better. Not perfect, but much better., 495004=Update 2014: Actually there is no need to guess how the systemd developers will act: They showed (again) that they will keep breaking systems of their users: \u201cudev now silently fails to do anything useful if devtmpfs is missing, almost as if resilience was a disease\u201d \u2014 bonsaikitten, Gentoo developer, 2014-01, long after udev was subsumed into systemd.\u00a0\u21a9, 436255=Just for additional Info, I found this license comparision paper by sun: http://mediacast.sun.com/share/webmink/SunLicensingWhitePaper042006.pdf, 18484=Update (2013-04-13): Kanban.el now lives in its own repository: on bitbucket and on a statically served http-repo (to be independent from unfree software)., 482742=Update (2014-10-16): There is now a vote on a General Resolution in Debian for preserving the ability to switch init systems. It is linked under \u201cAre there better solutions [\u2026]?\u201d on the site Shall we fork Debian\u2122? :^|., 481862=Update (2014-12-11): One more deconstruction of the strategies around systemd: systemd: Assumptions, Bullying, Consent. It shows that the attitude which forms the root of the dangers of systemd is even visible in its very source code., 764925=^ inserted one day ago: You see the meltdown starting in april and the improvement with the latest version: It\u2019s back on at least the level before the meltdown., 878637=PPS: md-esw-2009 is a repository in which Baddok and I planned a dual-gm roleplaying session Mechanical Dream., 293438=Update (2014-05-17): Thanks to zerwas from IRC @ freenode for the patch to guix 0.6 and nice cleanup!, 997686=Am Dienstag 03 Februar 2009 20:19:14 schrieb ... ...: > Most of the docs I can find seem to assume the reader is familiar with > existing software developemnt tools and methodologies. > > This is not the case for me., 292894=What sold it to me was \u201cGot a power-outage while updating? No problem: Everything still works\u201d from the Guix talk of Ludovico at the GNU Hacker Meeting 2013. My son once found the on-off-button of our power-connector while I was updating my Gentoo box. It took me 3 evenings to get it completely functional again. This would not have happened with Guix., 403043=Josh Klint from Leadwerks confirmed that Phoronix misrepresented his post and wrote a followup-post: \u00bb @ArneBab That really wasn't meant to be controversial. I was hoping to provide constructive feedback from the view of an Xcode / VS user.\u00ab \u00bb Slightly surprised my complaints about GDB are a hot topic. I can make just as many criticisms of other compilers and IDEs.\u00ab \u00bb The first 24 hours are the best for usability feedback.

And noone but the main developers and huge corporations could distribute the x264 library, because they\u2019d have to pay license fees for that., 809035=Now imagine that you find a link on a site which was added in 2010. It would for example link to version 4 of the site. If you access this site in 2014, freenet has to check versions 5,6,7,8...18 to find the most recent version. That requires 13 downloads - and for normal freesites the versions can be as high as 1200., 698571=The comment-system builds on the decentral, spam-resistant social features of the Freenet Project, one of the old cypherpunk creations which started in 2000 with the goal to provide true Freedom of the Press in the Internet and has been evolving ever since. It\u2019s an irony that nowadays spam became a vehicle to push people into censorship-enabling platforms, to use up their limited free time or to drown their words in a pile of dung, so other people cannot find them., 434740=----------------following is the notice----------------- /* * Your Project Name - -you slogan- * Copyright (C) 2007 - 2007 Your Name * * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or * (at your option) any later version. * * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Nov 2006 (CET), 483819=Update (2014-04-03): And now we have Julian Assange warning about NSA control over Debian, Theodore Ts\u2019o, maintainer of ext4, complaining about incomprehensible systemd, and Linus Torvalds (you know him, right?) rant against disrupting behavior from systemd developers, going as far as refusing to merge anything from the developers in question into Linux. Should I say \u201cI said so\u201d? Maybe not. After all, I came pretty late. Others saw this trend 2 years before I even knew about systemd. Can we really assume that there won\u2019t be intentional disruption? Maybe I should look for solutions. It could be a good idea to start having community-paid developers., 1038741=Date: 2013-01-12T00:18+0100, 482227=Update (2014-11-19): The Debian General Resolution resulted in \u201cWe do not need a general resolution to decide systemd\u201d.

We implemented the link length fix and this solved an issue with the network structure we had for the last few years. We\u2019re currently watching anxiously, whether the performance only comes back to the performance before the backdown or whether the lifetime actually gets much better. Watch the fetch-pull stats!, 937941=While this statement actually is true, in the context of git-vs-mercurial it is a horrible misfit: The hg-git extension shows since 2009, 3 years before Charles wrote his article, that it is possible to convert transparently from git to Mercurial and back. So the repository format of Mercurial has all capabilities of the repository format of git - and since git cannot natively store named branches, represent branches with multiple heads or push changes into a checked out branch, the capabilities of the repository format of Mercurial are actually a superset of the capabilities of the storage format of Git., 930961=On branching Charles goes deep into misinformation: He wrote his article in the year 2012, when Mercurial had already provided named branches as well as anonymous branching for 6 years, and one year after bookmarks became a core feature in hg 1.8, and he kept talking about how Mercurial advised to keep one clone per branch by referencing to a blog post which incorrectly assumed that the hg developers were using that workflow (obviously he did not bother to check that claim). Also he went on clamoring, that bookmarks initially could not be pushed between repositories, and how they were added \u201cdue to popular demand\u201d. The reality is, that at some point a developer simply said \u201cI\u2019ll write that\u201d. And within a few months, he implemented the equivalent of git branches. Before that, no hg developer saw enough need for them to excert that effort and today most still simply use named branches., 483549=Update (2014-09-24): boycott systemd calls for action with 12 reasons against systemd: \u201cWe do recognize the need for a new init system in the 21st century, but systemd is not it.\u201d, 853243=If you want to add a separate review stage, you can use a review branch1819 into which you only merge or graft reviewed changes. The review branch then acts as a staging area for all changes which might go into a release., 567828=Fast forward half a year. It\u2019s February 2013 and I started reading the readable list again after being out of touch for a few months because the birth of my daughter left little time for side-projects. And I was shocked to see that the readable folks had piled lots of additional syntax elements on their beautiful core model, which for me destroyed the simplicity and beauty of lisp. When language programmers add syntax using \\\\, $ and <>, you can be sure that it is no simple lisp anymore. To me readability does not just mean beautiful code, but rather easy to understand code with simple concepts which are used consistently. I prefer having some ugly corner cases to adding more syntax which makes the whole language more complex., 485446=Update (2013-11-20): Further reading shows that people have been giving arguments from my list since 2011, and they got answers in the range of \u201canything short of systemd is dumb\u201d, \u201cthis cannot work\u201d (while OpenRC clearly shows that it works well), requests for implementation details without justification and insults and further insults; but the arguments stayed valid for the last 2 years. That does not look like systemd has a friendly community - or is healthy for distributions adopting it. Also an OpenRC developer wrote the best rebuttal of systemd propaganda I read so far: \u201cAlternativlos\u201d: Systemd propaganda (note, though, that I am biased against systemd due to problems I had in the past with udev kernel-dependencies), 605251=In Fosdem2014 Poul-Henning Kamp talked about a hypothetical \u201cProject ORCHESTRA\u201d by the NSA with the goal of disrupting internet security: Information, Slides, Video (with some gems not in the slides)., 586=Update (2013-01-23): The new org-mode removed (org-make-link), so I replaced it with (concat) and uploaded a new example-file: org-custom-link-completion.el. Happy Hacking!, 879782=Update (2014-05-01): The Mercurial breakage is fixed in Mercurial 3.0: When you commit without username it now says \u201cAbort: no username supplied (use \"hg config --edit\" to set your username)\u201d. The editor shows a template with a commented-out field for the username. Just put your name and email after the pre-filled username = and save the file. The Git breakage still exists., 484906=Update (2014-02-18): An email to the mailing list of the technical committee of debian summarized the strategic implications of systemd-adoption for Debian and RedHat. It was called conspiracy theory right away, but the gains for RedHat are obvious: RedHat would be dumb not to try this. And only a fool trusts a company.
