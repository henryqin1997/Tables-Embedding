PCBs and pesticides are eluted from the Florosil column with hexane and 1:1 dichloromethane /hexane. For PCBs and pesticides, each analytical run consists of nine unknown specimens, one method blank, and two quality control samples. Beforequantification, the vials are reconstituted with 10\u03bcL 13C-labeled external standard. Sample extracts are then analyzed simultaneously for PCBs and pesticides by HRGC/ID-HRMS where 1 \u03bcL is injected, using a GC Pal (Leap Technology) auto sampler, into a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph operated in the splitless injection mode with a flow of 1 mL/min helium through a DB-5ms capillary column (30 m x0.25 mm x0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) where analytes are separated prior to entering a Thermo Finnigan MAT95 XP (5 kV) magnetic sector mass spectrometer operated in EI mode at 40 eV, using selected ion monitoring (SIM) at 10,000 resolving power (10% valley). Two ion current responsescorresponding to two masses are monitored for each native (12C) compound and it corresponding 13C-internal standard. The instrumental response factor for each analyte is calculated as the sum of the two 12C-isomers divided by the sum of two 13C-isomers., 9029=The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004 Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file., 13866=The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM., 8582=This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004data files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.}",
