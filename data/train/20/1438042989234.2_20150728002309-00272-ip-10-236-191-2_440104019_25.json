            "CROSSLINKING AGENT, AND CROSSLINKING POLYMER COMPOSITION AND MOLDED PRODUCT FORMED OF THE SAME - The present invention provides a crosslinking agent which is excellent in processing characteristics and crosslinking performance, and is capable of preventing staining of a molded product upon molding in a metal mold which tends to be induced when using the crosslinking agent together with a triallyl isocyanurate. The crosslinking agent of the present invention comprises an isocyanurate derivative represented by the following general formula (I):",
            "TRIALLYL ISOCYANURATE, TRIALLYL CYANURATE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING TRIALLYL ISOCYANURATE - The present invention provides triallyl isocyanurate comprising a less amount of corrosive substances by identifying the corrosive substances among impurities included in the triallyl isocyanurate. Triallyl isocyanurate of the present invention comprises an organic chlorine compound represented by the following general formula (I) in an amount of not more than 100 ppm:",

Triallyl isocyanurate of the present invention comprises an organic chlorine compound represented by the following chemical formula (I) in an amount of not more than 500 ppm:",
            "METHOD OF STORING TRIALLYL ISOCYANURATE - The present invention provides a method of storing TAIC in which TAIC is prevented from suffering from freezing and solidification during storage thereof in the winter season. In the method of the present invention, the triallyl isocyanurate is mixed with a silane coupling agent to prepare a composition comprising both thereof, and the resulting composition is stored. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the silane coupling agent is used in an amount of 5 to 30% by weight based on the weight of the triallyl isocyanurate, and \u03b3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane is used as the silane coupling agent.",
            "TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES AND APPLICATION THEREOF - The object of the present invention is to provide a novel triazine derivative which is excellent in the heat resistance and rapid in the cross-linking rate, and can be suitably used as a crosslinking agent.",
            "CROSS-LINKING AGENT FOR CROSS-LINKABLE ELASTOMER AND APPLICATION THEREOF - The object of the present invention is to provide a cross-linking agent for a cross-linkable elastomer which is rapid in the cross-linking rate in comparison with triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC).",
