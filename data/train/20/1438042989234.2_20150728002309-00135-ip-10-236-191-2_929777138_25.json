In connection with establishing these limits, the Commission proposes to update some relevant definitions; revise the exemptions from speculative position limits, including for bona fide hedging; and extend and update reporting requirements for persons claiming exemption from these limits. The Commission proposes appendices that would provide guidance on risk management exemptions for commodity derivative contracts in excluded commodities permitted under the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; list core referenced futures contracts and commodities that would be substantially the same as a commodity underlying a core referenced futures contract for purposes of the proposed definition of basis contract; describe and analyze fourteen fact patterns that would satisfy the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; and present the proposed speculative position limit levels in tabular form.
