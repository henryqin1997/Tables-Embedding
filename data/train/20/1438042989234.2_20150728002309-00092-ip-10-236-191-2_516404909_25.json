The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). For questions asking opinions of services, the results shown include in order: the average opinion score (labeled \"Average\"), the percentage of people who were satisfied with the service (graded it as a 3 or better, labeled \"Satisfaction\"), the percentage of people who use the service (which we have taken to be the percentage of people who expressed an opinion about it, labeled \"Usage\"), and the total number of respondents to each question (raw number of respondents who did not leave a given item blank, labeled \"Responses\").}",
