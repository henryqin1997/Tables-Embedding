This was the Scinde Dawk. It was followed by the East India company lithographed issues and a long series of engraved stamps portraying Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, and King George VI., 87468=India has a long and varied postal history and has produced a large number of postage stamps. These have been produced by a variety of techniques including line engraving, typography, lithography, photogravure and web-offset. Stamps have been produced both for postage and for service or revenue. Definitives and commemoratives have been issued. Stamps have been produced both as unperforated sheets, perforated sheets and miniature sheets. The stamps have been produced in a number of shapes - the Scinde Dawk being rounded and some, like the stamp on the Bombay Sappers being triangular. Recently the 2009 stamp on Louis Braille had braille imprinting on it in addition. Many cases of overprinting exist - for converting the use of domestic postage stamps to service; to earmark stamps sold by field post offices attached with international control commissions and other reasons., 58443=All four stamps were issued on 26 January., 73328=India's independence saw the postal department issue its first stamp on 21 Nov 1947 depicting the Indian flag. The Dominion of India issued stamps from 1947 to 1949 with the caption of INDIA POSTAGE. In 1950, India became a republic and the first stamps of India as a republic were a series of four issued on that very day. The stamp issues continued to be in Annas (abbreviated as \"As\") till 1957, when the Indian rupee was decimalised: the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi for \"new paise\"). In 1964, the initial \"naye\" was dropped. This change in currency is faithfully reflected in the denomination of the stamps of the time. The initial stamps were commemoratives or special issues. In 1949 the first definitive \"Archeological\" series of 16 values was issued.}",
