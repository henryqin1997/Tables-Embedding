This option also includes an additional $125 to use towards on-campus eateries such as Subway, 2Mato, Cafe, and BYOB (Build your Own Burger)., 113417=Food at the new dining hall is getting better and better as local food buying has been a new interest of 2012-2013, 113960=Fitchburg State is a great school with a beautiful and growing campus well worth the cost of attending. Professors, students and administration are what truly make the school worthwhile especially for the low costs of attending. I recommend this school to any student looking to attend college in fall or 2013, 170989=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 112903=Fitchburg is a nice small size city just 5 minutes away from the Train to Boston.
