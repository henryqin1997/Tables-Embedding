            "FIU has great campus safety. They actually have a police department on campus that can be reached by the press of a call button or at their office on campus. FIU also has safety trams if you have a late class and need to be taken to your car. Another service they have for safety is that a police will walk you to your dorm if you feel unsafe.",
            "FIU has so many clubs to offer due to the size of the student population. Some of the clubs consist of SGA, sororities, fraternities, homecoming, marching band, and hundreds more. other activities at FIU are the sporting event you can attend for free and the fitness center which is open late.",
            "Under the stone in front of the Charles Perry building has the ashes of Charles Perry supposedly on Halloween he hunts the campus.. In front of the GC building is an gold seal on the floor if you step on it you will not graduate on time. Another thing is the cube in front of DM apparently if you spin it before finals it will help you pass.",
            "Make sure to get an FIU one card. These cards are not only your student ID which can get you into events for free, it always gives you a discount every time you dine at FIU, buy materials out of the bookstore, and also when you print or fax information.",
            "FIU offers many place to eat such as Subway, Burger king, Dunkin' Donuts, Sushi Maki, Moes, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, and so much more. They have dining dollars which is cheaper than paying with cash. No way you can go hungry on campus.",
            "I personally did not live on campus. I stayed overnight once for orientation. The rooms come fully furbished and there is no community bathroom you only share one with your roommates. One tip for living on campus is that it can be fun and convenient but more on the expensive side.",
            "Academics at FIU can be challenging but then again what college isn't. Even though classes can be a bit rigorous most professor will provide extra help to student who really have the desire to get help. FIU also have tutoring sessions in multiple subject for free.",
            "One tip for If you plan on attending FIU in the future is register for classes as soon as you can place them in your shopping cart early to insure you have the class you want and not whatever is left. Also join as many clubs as you can not only will you make new friends but connections that can last a lifetime.",
            "On a Scale of one to ten I give Florida International University an eight. FIU deserves an eight because they really care about the student and try and help in everyway they can to make sure each and every student is successful. They provide resources and many activities for student to participate in which enhances your college experience even further."

Top 30% of high school class at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Sr. High. Earned Dean's List honor during Spring 2011 at Miami-Dade College., 146057=Florida International University(FIU) has been a welcoming and encouraging environment ever since i started my studies in the summer of 2012. Being a recent high school graduate, I was afraid attending this college so fast, especially during summer would be too much to handle. I was wrong, the professors and student alumni really reach out and help the freshman, in order to fit in to a more comfortable and friendly zone., 99034=There are lots of places to go eat around campus but mainly in the Graham center. They are constantly adding more and more places to eat, currently they are building a Panda Express and a Taco Bell on campus. adding these franchises to the present collection of Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Cafe Bustelo, Alamazar, Chili's, Chic-fil-a, Moe's, Dunkin Donuts, And several other franchise restaurants. there is also a cafeteria place called Fresh Foods Company, this place is a buffet and at the beginning of the semester the food here is always good, and it has many options for food, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and a variety of other hot foods. There are currently 2 Starbucks on campus and a new one is being built within a new building scheduled to be completed later in 2014. There is a salad place called Salad Creations also, and they make really delicious salads but they're kinda pricey so normally I just stick to Chic-Fil-A., 823125=FIU is the 18th largest university in the United States. FIU also has the distinction of being the largest minority-majority university in America and will have an enrollment of more than 60,000 for the 2012-2013 school year. FIU is an awesome facility and an exciting place to learn., 315685=be ready to walk or maybe even run to your classes. some may be right next to each other, but others might be on the other end of the campus. i suggest 10/11 o'clock classes. that extra hour of sleep is like heaven., 814044=FIU offers many places to eat on campus between the two campuses. On the north campus, there are many places to dine at like Moe's Southwest Grill, Bistro Subs, Grille Works, etc. On the main campus, there are twenty plus places to dine at like Chick-fil-a, Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Moe's Southwest Grill, Chili's, etc. Also, there are places on campus where you can go to get a snack at 3 o'clock in the morning and they offer cookies that are super yummy and fresh out the oven at all times of the day., 222832=I found a lot of information about this school. I am planning on attending in 2013 to study Premed. I researched their different programs and this will be a perfect school to study Premed to become a Forensic Pathologist., 129092=Florida International University was not my first choice when I was applying for schools back in 2011, but FIU has changed my life. It is a commuter school, but through my involvements I have grown as a person and as a leader. I believe that FIU is an amazing school and it is highly underrated.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students If you wish to do well, my advice would be to stay focused and involved. Although gaining experience in jobs and activities is important, how you do in school is your first priority! Study hard! Bang for the buck FIU has many opportunities for scholarships, grants and loans. They try to help you out as much as possible. And the classes are worth every cent as long as you put in the effort. Am enjoying being here The campus is simply great, especially the first week. There is so many activities and events happening all over the campus. There are many clubs and extracurricular activities to be involved in. For example, I am currently working with a group of other students to develop an on-campus series to air in FIU. The experience that is gained is simply amazing. There are a lot of opportunities that can open doors for you. Am learning a lot Florida International University is simply great. A lot of teachers care that you pass, just be sure you study a lot, do homework, and put in effort. In the end, you will truly be rewarded. Login",
