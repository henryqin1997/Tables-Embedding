RFC 3101 is backward compatible with RFC 1587. For a detailed list of differences between them, see Appendix F of RFC 3101. NSSA support was first integrated into Cisco IOS Release 11.2. OSPF NSSA is a nonproprietary extension of the existing OSPF stub area feature., 20907=Cisco supports RFC 1253, OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base, August 1991. The OSPF MIB defines an IP routing protocol that provides management information related to OSPF and is supported by Cisco routers., 17608=The Cisco implementation conforms to the OSPF Version 2 specifications detailed in the Internet RFC 2328. The following list outlines key features supported in the Cisco OSPF implementation:}",

RFC3101 replaced RFC 1587 and is backward compatible with RFC1587., 279894=In the following example, the output for the show ip ospf and show ip ospf database nssa commands shows an Open Shortest Path First Not-So-Stubby Area (OSPF NSSA) area where RFC 3101 is disabled, RFC 1587 is active, and an NSSA Area Border Router (ABR) device is configured as a forced NSSA LSA translator. If RFC 3101 is disabled, the forced NSSA LSA translator remains inactive., 291825=Consider the first network area command. Area ID 10.9.50.0 is configured for the interface on which subnet 192.168.10.0 is located. Assume that a match is determined for Ethernet interface 0. Ethernet interface 0 is attached to area 10.9.50.0 only., 290053=The following example illustrates the assignment of four area IDs to four IP address ranges. In the example, OSPF routing process 109 is initialized, and four OSPF areas are defined: 10.9.50.0, 2, 3, and 0. Areas 10.9.50.0, 2, and 3 mask specific address ranges, and area 0 enables OSPF for all other networks., 324029=The OSPF NSSA Option January 2003, 330903=The following commands were introduced or modified: area nssa translate, compatible rfc1587., 7208=The OSPF on-demand circuit is an enhancement to the OSPF protocol that allows efficient operation over on-demand circuits such as ISDN, X.25 switched virtual circuits (SVCs), and dialup lines. This feature supports RFC 1793, Extending OSPF to Support Demand Circuits., 318909=The following example prevents flooding of OSPF LSAs to point-to-multipoint networks to the neighbor at IP address 10.10.10.45:, 323673=The OSPF NSSA Option, March 1994, 19735=A link-state update packet containing a router LSA typically has a fixed overhead of 196 bytes, and an additional 12 bytes are required for each link description. With a huge buffer size of 18024 bytes, there can be a maximum of 1485 link descriptions., 14498=The default value of pacing between LSA groups is 240 seconds (4 minutes). The range is from 10 seconds to 1800 seconds (30 minutes)., 323568=RFC 1587, 71736=4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 compatible rfc1587, 332247=The area nssa translate (OSPFv3), compatible rfc1587 (OSPFv3), and show ospfv3 commands were added. The nssa-only keyword was added to the summary-prefix (OSPFv3) command., 4906=In Cisco IOS Release 10.3 and later releases, by default OSPF calculates the OSPF metric for an interface according to the bandwidth of the interface. For example, a 64-kbps link gets a metric of 1562, and a T1 link gets a metric of 64.}",
