            "GLASS WITH MOLDING AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME - Glass with molding, which does not require a holding pin, such as a metal pin, and a spacer. The glass with molding includes a resin piece. The resin piece has an embedded section embedded in resin molding, and also has a projection section projecting from the resin molding in the direction away from a glass material. The projection section has an insert-molded metal nut. The glass with molding is fastened to a vehicle body by screwing a screw into the metal nut.",
            "OTHER VIEWPOINT CLOSED SURFACE IMAGE PIXEL VALUE CORRECTION DEVICE, METHOD OF CORRECTING OTHER VIEWPOINT CLOSED SURFACE IMAGE PIXEL VALUE, USER POSITION INFORMATION OUTPUT DEVICE, METHOD OF OUTPUTTING USER POSITION INFORMATION - A technology for creating an arbitrary viewpoint image with high quality based on pixel value information as seen from a single viewpoint and real spatial positional information has not been known. A hidden point is extracted based on a relative positional relationship between a single viewpoint closed surface projection point for arbitrary measurement point and neighboring projection point, a relative positional relationship between other viewpoint closed surface projection point for arbitrary measurement point and neighboring projection point, distance from arbitrary measurement point to another viewpoint, and distance from measurement point projected onto neighboring projection point on the other viewpoint closed surface to another viewpoint. Furthermore, the projection point pixel value on the other viewpoint closed surface for the extracted hidden point is corrected using distance from measurement point projected onto neighboring projection point on the other viewpoint closed surface to the other viewpoint and the measurement point pixel value."

After the etching using the above etchant, etching is carried out using an etchant that does not form an insoluble compound through a reaction with the metal to be etched, whereby the form of an etched portion comes close to a rectangular form, and the side surface of a conductor pattern becomes smooth. Further, after the etching of one surface of a material to be etched is carried out using an etchant that reacts with a metal to be etched to form an insoluble compound nearly from below, the upper and lower sides of the material to be etched is reversed, and the etching of the opposite surface is carried out nearly from below, whereby fine conductor patterns can be formed on both of the surfaces.</td> <td>20110056910</td> <tr> </tr> <td>03-03-2011</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20110049104\">ETCHANT FOR COPPER OR COPPER ALLOY, LIQUID FOR ETCHING PRETREATMENT, AND ETCHING METHOD</a> - An etchant for copper or copper alloy, which contains water as a main component and comprises (1) 1 to 20 mass % of iron (III) chloride",

The upstream book analyzing part analyzes an upstream book about a target unit designated by the unit group input part. The unit characteristic acquiring part acquires the unit characteristics of the target unit based on a result of the analysis. The unit characteristic matching part performs matching of the unit characteristics of the target unit, and specifies a similar unit having the same unit characteristics as those of the target unit. The test table generating section acquires a test table about the similar unit, and generates a test table about the target unit based on the acquired test table. 05-31-2012 20130253667 LOGIC DIAGRAM PROCESSING DEVICE AND LOGIC DIAGRAM PROCESSING METHOD - A logic diagram processing device has a logic diagram relocating unit which relocates operation elements while maintaining control logics equivalently so that the operation elements as compared",
