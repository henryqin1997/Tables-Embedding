Nevertheless, in the revision work done since then, we have been very careful not to introduce gratuitous incompatibility. As far as possible, we have tried to ensure that clients obeying the conventions in the X11R2 draft would still work., 300462=The Consortium review was based on a draft dated July 27, 1988. This draft included several areas in which incompatibilities with the X11R2 draft were necessary:, 249447=[7] This obsolete protocol was described in the July 27, 1988, draft of the ICCCM. Windows using it can also be detected because their WM_HINTS properties are 4 bytes longer than expected. Window managers are free to support clients using the obsolete protocol in a backwards compatibility mode., 16099=December 1993, 21167=As far as possible, these conventions are upwardly compatible with those in the February 25, 1988, draft that was distributed with the X Version 11, Release 2, of the software. In some areas, semantic problems were discovered with those conventions, and, thus, complete upward compatibility could not be assured. These areas are noted in the text and are summarized in Appendix A., 2683=Copyright \u00a9 1987, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994 Sun Microsystems, Inc, 1057=Copyright \u00a9 1988, 1991, 1993, 1994 X Consortium, 85094=Adobe Systems, Incorporated.

In addition to some minor editorial changes, there were a few semantic changes since Version 1.0:, 16313=David Rosenthal had overall architectural responsibility for the conventions defined in this document; he wrote most of the text and edited the document, but its development has been a communal effort. The details were thrashed out in meetings at the January 1988 MIT X Conference and at the 1988 Summer Usenix conference, and through months (and megabytes) of argument on the wmtalk mail alias. Thanks are due to everyone who contributed, and especially to the following people., 302911=The Consortium review resulted in several incompatible changes. These changes were included in drafts that were distributed for public review during the first half of 1989., 280202=We are fortunate in this area to have a seminal work, the 1931 CIE color standard, which is nearly universally agreed upon as adequate for describing colors on CRT devices. This standard uses a tri-stimulus model called CIE XYZ in which each perceivable color is specified as a triplet of numbers. Other appropriate device-independent color models do exist, but most of them are directly traceable back to this original work.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The protocol defines six distinct spaces in which atoms are interpreted. Any particular atom may or may not have some valid interpretation with respect to each of these name spaces. Name Spaces The core protocol imposes no semantics on atoms except as they are used in FONTPROP structures. For further information on FONTPROP semantics, see the X Logical Font Description Conventions. Semantics The names were chosen in this fashion to make it easy to use them in a natural way within LISP. Keyword constructors allow the programmer to specify the atoms as LISP atoms. If the atoms were not all uppercase, special quoting conventions would have to be used. The built-in atoms are composed of uppercase ASCII characters with the logical words separated by an underscore character (_), for example, WM_ICON_NAME. The protocol specification recommends that atoms used for private vendor-specific reasons should begin with an underscore. To prevent conflicts among organizations, additional prefixes should be chosen (for example, _DEC_WM_DECORATION_GEOMETRY). Naming Conventions Language interfaces should probably cache the atom-name mappings and get them only when required. The CLX interface, for instance, makes no distinction between predefined atoms and other atoms; all atoms are viewed as symbols at the interface. However, a CLX",

This resource can be of any type. Sometimes it is simply necessary to generate a unique set of names (for example, for the properties on a window used by a MULTIPLE selection). These names should have the form:  Ud (e.g., U0 U1 U2 U3 ...) if the names stand totally alone, and the form:  name_Ud (e.g., FOO_U0 BAR_U0 FOO_U1 BAR_U1 ...) if they come in sets (here there are two sets, named \"FOO\" and \"BAR\").
