The two men were introduced with The Weather Girls' \"It's Raining Men\" played in the background. After the couple performed, judge Nigel Lythgoe said, \"I think you'd probably alienate a lot of our audience. We've always had the guys dance together on the show but they've never really done it in each other's arms before. I'm really one of those people that like to see guys be guys and girls be girls on stage. I don't think I liked it, to be frank.\"[8] He later went on to say that he'd like each man to dance with women and that: \"You never know, you might enjoy that, too.\" The segment closed, and the song \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" is played in the background, which contains the lyrics: \"This is a man's world, but it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.\" Cat Deeley went on to say that the pair were \"out.\", 2920=So You Think You Can Dance is a United States television reality program and dance competition airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company network. Season five premiered on May 21, 2009, with Nigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy returning as permanent judges and Cat Deeley returning to host.[1] Jeanine Mason was crowned America's Favorite Dancer on August 6, 2009, making her the second female to win the show. This is the first season to move the show a new stage(in order to promote Season 6 after seeing Nathan Trasoras audition for Season 5 at age 17) and last season to be in CBS Studios.[2]}",
