A user can choose to zoom in by a factor of two by choosing the zoom command from the menu bar, by using the mouse cursor to choose a point around which to zoom, and then clicking the mouse button. A user can zoom in to a rectangular area by choosing the zoom command from the menu bar and by using the mouse cursor to select a rectangular area on the map picture. A user can also zoom to a particular width by choosing the zoom width command from the menu bar and entering a width (in miles or kilometers) that will represent the width of the area displayed in the map window. A user can zoom to a scale by choosing the zoom scale command from the menu bar and entering a scale, such as 1:1000., 73568=[0096] While the installation of some Geographic Information Systems or Desktop Mapping systems require the installation of over 1000 files, which occupies a large amount of disk space, the map viewer 118 typically requires the installation of one file (the map viewer 118 \u201cdll\u201d file), making support, problem solving, and program updates fast, simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform from remote sites., 25536=[0002] Utility application Ser.
