            "njit offers a recreation center with an indoor pool, gym, dance halls, etc. in the campus center, there is a lobby with bowling allies and billiard tables. outside, there is space as well as a soccer field to play outdoor sports. around the campus, the city of newark offers museums and shopping.",
            "a large variety of food is offered on and around the campus.",
            "dorms are small and there are many mechanical complaints about the dorm buildings.",
            "the program is very time consuming and can get challenging at times.",
            "only dorm if you can manage time and money. be prepared to spend more time at school than at home.",
            "it's a small friendly campus. it's surrounded by a huge city. the academic program is more difficult than at most colleges."

The Greeks have a positive impact on the campus sponsoring safety events, raising awareness for causes and raising funds for them as well. There is a significant Greek presence on campus and a new housing facility for the Greeks will be opened fall 2013., 225328=I am currently a cadet in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) on campus and will be attending pilot training upon completion of my bachelor' in May 2014. I have received beneficial leadership and management training that no college alone can teach., 257340=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 245381=Living on campus is ideal for time purposes, but dorm life can vary depending on the building you're in. Freshman dorms tend to have more events going on in them, while the Honors dorm tends to have a more social atmosphere. The upper class dorms tend to be somewhere in between. Honors dorm is by far the nicest (just built in 2013 I think and it looks like a hotel) while the others are pretty much the same. In these dorms, yeah you'll see cockroaches, smell weird smells, hear lots of dubstep, but whatever, it's all part of the college experience. If for some reason you decide not to live in one of NJIT's halls, there is a university apartment building right next to NJIT that I hear has reasonable prices.}",
