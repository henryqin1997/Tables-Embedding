However, the fact that the proposal adopts an exception to the schedule of penalties that is substantively the same as that prescribed by the Agency does not affect the negotiability of the proposal.

The Agency notes that the Authority has held to be nonnegotiable proposals that incorporate into the parties' agreement terms governing the range of disciplinary actions that were drawn from existing agency regulations.

The Agency argues that the proposal in this case is \"more intrusive\" because the Union \"is attempting to negotiate the penalties that may be imposed for various infractions.\" Id. at 4., 93168=c. Undue hardship on an activity/command. 29 CFR 1613.704(c) provides that reasonable accommodation is not required when it would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the program of the employee's activity/command, such as continuing an unreliable employee in a critical function or in duties which could affect the health or welfare of others.}",
