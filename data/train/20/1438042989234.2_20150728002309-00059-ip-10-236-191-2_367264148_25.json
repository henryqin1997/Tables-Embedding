Before You Begin This procedure assumes that you do not have an existing backup operation for an All Configuration backup file. Creating an All Configuration Backup File If you want to integrate a rack-mount server into the Cisco UCS domain, follow the instructions in the appropriate rack-mount server installation guide for installing and integrating a rack-mount server in a system managed by Cisco UCS Manager. Verify that all servers have been discovered. They do not need to be powered on or associated with a service profile. Verify that the Cisco UCS domain does not include any critical or major faults. If such faults exist, you must resolve them before you upgrade the system. A critical or major fault may cause the upgrade to fail. Verify that all servers, I/O modules, and adapters are fully functional. An inoperable server cannot be upgraded. Verify that the data path is up and running. For more information, see Verifying that the Data Path is Ready. For a standalone configuration, verify",
