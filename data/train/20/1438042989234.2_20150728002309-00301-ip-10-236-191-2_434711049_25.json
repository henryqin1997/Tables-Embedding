After the discharging of the capacitor ends and the designated value is set, the adjusting apparatus causes the capacitor to be charged by switching the switch to a charging side. The adjusting apparatus further measures a time period from the time when the switch is switched to the charging side until an electric potential difference of the capacitor exceeds a threshold value. Based on the measured time period and the predetermined value, the adjusting apparatus calculates the designated value such that the measured time period is a predetermined time period. 03-20-2014 Masahiro Tanaka, Shizuoka JP Patent application number Description Published 20140127920 CONNECTOR - An object of the present invention is to provide a connector able to prevent a first interlock connector from making contact with a bolt, a terminal fitting, or the like, and able to position a cover for covering a bolting chamber.
