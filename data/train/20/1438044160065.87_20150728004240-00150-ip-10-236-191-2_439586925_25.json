Typically, compression and encryption are implemented in separate functional units. This has a few disadvantages: 1) encryption cannot make use of compression state to further secure the message, 2) processed data is read and written twice, 3) additional space, time, and resources are consumed, and 4) it is more prone to potential cipher-attacks since the encryption stage is independent from compression. Embodiments overcome these disadvantages by structuring these operations so that both compression and encryption is executed within the same processing loop. Thus: 1) encryption is stronger due to the dependence on the compression state, 2) I/O buffers are accessed only once reducing overhead, 3) system footprint is reduced, and 4) cipher analysis is more complex since the decryption process cannot be separated from the decompression process. 20150067339 12-04-2014 SEEDING OF A WORKSPACE TO OPTIMIZE CODEC OPERATIONS - Various embodiments are directed toward compressing and/or decompressing data communicated between one or more network devices (e.g., codec operations). In particular, embodiments are directed towards improving codec performance by seeding the computation workspace that may be used by various codec processors. The seeding data may be determined based on at least one characteristic of a particular codec and the characteristics of data that may be processed by the codec processor. Also, the codec",

The invention is further drawn to a method of producing immunoglobulin heavy and light chain libraries, particularly using the trimolecular recombination method, for expression in eukaryotic cells. The invention further provides methods of selecting and screening for antigen-specific immunoglobulin molecules, and antigen-specific fragments thereof. The invention also provides kits for producing, screening and selecting antigen-specific immunoglobulin molecules. Finally, the invention provides immunoglobulin molecules, and antigen-specific fragments thereof, produced by the methods provided herein. 10-31-2013 Mark J. Paris, Mendon, NY US Patent application number Description Published 20130202615 ANTI-VEGF ANTIBODIES AND USES THEREOF - Provided are monoclonal antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof that specifically bind vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies block VEGF binding to its receptors (e.g., VEGFR1 and/or VEGFR2) and prevent phosphorylation of VEGFR2 by VEGF. Also provided are methods of using the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibodies for treatment of disease, including cancer. 08-08-2013 Mark J.
