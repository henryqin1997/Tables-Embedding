You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page FWP-8 of this free writing prospectus, page S-3 of the prospectus supplement and page S-1 of the Equity Index Underlying Supplement, as the securities involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities.

The closing level for the SBR on March 27, 2012 was 2,564.23. We obtained the closing levels below from Bloomberg Professional\u00ae service. We make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg Professional\u00ae service., 25635=If the Reference Return is below the Buffer Level, the securities provide 1:1 exposure to the decline in the Reference Asset beyond -30%. If you lose some or a substantial portion of your initial investment, even with any Coupon payments, your yield on an investment in the securities may be negative., 31609=The graph above illustrates the daily 5-yr performance of the Reference Asset through March 27, 2012. The closing levels in the graph above were obtained from Bloomberg Professional\u00ae Service. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future results. For further information on the Reference Asset please see \u201cThe S&P BRIC 40 Index\u201d on page FWP-12 and in the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement. We have derived all disclosure regarding the Reference Asset from publicly available information. Neither HSBC USA Inc. or any of its affiliates assumes any responsibilities for the adequacy or accuracy of information about the Reference Asset., 171871=In Notice 2008-2, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the Treasury Department requested comments as to whether the purchaser of an exchange traded note or pre-paid forward contract (which may include the securities) should be required to accrue income during its term under a mark-to-market, accrual or other methodology, whether income and gain on such a note or contract should be ordinary or capital, and whether foreign holders should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accrual. Accordingly, it is possible that regulations or other guidance could provide that a U.S. holder (as defined in the prospectus supplement) of a security is required to accrue income in respect of the securities prior to the receipt of payments with respect to the securities or their earlier sale. Moreover, it is possible that any such regulations or other guidance could treat all income and gain of a U.S. holder in respect of the securities as ordinary income (including gain on a sale). Finally, it is possible that a non-U.S. holder of the securities could be subject to U.S. withholding tax in respect of the securities. It is unclear whether any regulations or other guidance would apply to the securities (possibly on a retroactive basis). Prospective investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding Notice 2008-2 and the possible effect to them of the issuance of regulations or other guidance that affects the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities., 2332=(To Prospectus dated March 22, 2012,}",
