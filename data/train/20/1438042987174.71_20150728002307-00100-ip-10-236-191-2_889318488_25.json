The classes aren't full, but aren't empty either. I'd amount the teacher to student ratio about 1:10, which is pretty good for a public university., 62072=USM is a state school so the tuition is relatively low compared to others. They have a great academic program and prove that you can get an excellent education without paying an Ivy League price. In 2010 dorms ranged from 1500 to 2500 depending on whether the room was single or double, or community or private bath. I considered this a very good price because everything's included, internet, cable, water, heat, and even laundry. The basic meal plan includes all you eat at the cafeteria called the Fresh Food Co. Also with your tuition you receive free entry into sporting events and use of the Payne Center., 9248=If you are bringing a car on campus, weekends are the time to nab the best parking spots because a lot of people leave to go home. If you become tired of eating in the cafeteria, try going to an event on campus because they usually provide food. Rent your books from the bookstore. You won't spend as much money, and it's less hassle than when you try to return books in exchange for a low buy-back cost. Also, if you are considering living in a residence hall, I urge you to do so at least one year of your college life. The people you will live with will become close friends and will help make your college experience more enjoyable. There is nothing as fun as an impromptu get-together at 2:00 am in the morning for a Just Dance competition or a little Mario Kart., 266527=Make sure to sign up for financial aid before June in the year you are planning to attend Southern Miss. Sign up for housing and new student orientation on the school website. Join clubs and other organizations to get acquainted with the campus and other students., 70294=the rose garden is very beautiful, and it is rumored that there is a $1000 fine for picking one of them. also, there is a bridge over a pond that people like to get professional photos taken. people say that new couples should never go to breakup bridge, named so because people are rumored to break up after spending time on the bridge., 108719=Live at 5 is fun. Every weekend in April and October. Lots f stuff always going on on campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It's a tad expensive if you're not a Mississippi resident or didn't get the out of state fee wavered. But it's worth it no matter how expensive it can be. Am enjoying being here One of the best things about this school is the students. There is always something going on, especially around game time. Friday Night At the Fountain (FNATF) is one of the best. Golden Eagle Welcome Week (GEWW) is another that is focused on freshmen and transfer students to help the transition to Southern Miss great; you also get to paint the Eagle Walk. But other than that, the students are nice and someone is always willing to help if you need it. Am learning a lot The Professors here are really dedicated to making sure the students understand the material. The classes are fun and easy to get to.
