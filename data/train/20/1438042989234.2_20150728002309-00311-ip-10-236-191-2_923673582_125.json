If you can think of a possible club that doesn't already exist, all it takes if 4 friends and a quick application., 695294=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 502302=Along with all of the activities and clubs constantly going on around campus, there are a ton of things to do around town. There is an area of town called Fairhaven where there are a ton of different little shops to go to as well as Boulevard Park to relax and goof off at. You can buy books, crafts, or even make your own piece of art at Creativity. In the downtown area, we have theaters (movies and plays), an imporv theater (where Ryan Stiles sometimes appears) and if you are 21 or over, this is where the bar an club scene is located. Also around town we have a mall where the discount movie theater is located, as well as the Value Village and Spirit Halloween store in October. There is also a location on Lake Watcom where you can rent Kayaks, sail boats, and wind surfers for really cheap., 362253=Apply early! Preferably before November 1st. Your application is like a place holder for housing. The earlier you submit it, the closer to the front you are in line for housing choices.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Aside from some 100 level classes, class sizes are generally small (at most 20-30 students), allowing for more one-on-one time between students and professors. In my experience, all of my professors have made themselves very available to students and have offered plenty of opportunities for extra help if needed. Classes are engaging and professors are very enthusiastic about their subjects, making learning all the more enjoyable.

Bellingham is very big on the recycling and compost and once you come an leave you will be too. It is also great for those interested in all sorts of outdoor activities because you can find about pretty much anything to do. Bellingham is",
