            "They have police everywhere. There are structures here and there that all you have to do is press a button and a guard will be there in 5 minutes to escort you. On the down side, SFA is one of the top schools for rape victims and drug abuse. So good luck!",
            "If you're a girl: You have to be skinny and wear makeup all the time to be accepted. You also have a dresscode of short shorts and their specific shirts. Dresses on special occasions. If you're a guy: I don't really know",
            "Those that are in them, like them. They have plenty for everyone. Whatever suits you. You just have to go in and get outgoing so they will accept you. Remember, they all have their own friends so it's not like they have to work for your friendship. You have to work for theirs.",
            "The ones who want to go into nursing: Take your pre-recs elsewhere. The teachers are much harder here and only accept As and Bs into the nursing program. They will gladly take a straight A student from somewhere else than a B student from SFA. The ones who want to specialize in deaf ed: It's pretty cool I hear. You have to major in it if you want the chance to get into a signing class. Or take them over the summer, they book really fast. Anyone else: Well... eh",
            "You decorate an axe handle to take to games... woopie. That's really about it. There's a bunch of school spirit here and there, you just have to find it. Oh, and all the kids sitting on government aid sit in the middle of campus yelling and laughing loud. It's no use reasoning with them, even if you're in the quiet section of the library. I'm sure it's like that at all campuses though....",
            "Don't act like you're rich and go out to eat all the time. Yes there's a starbucks and chick-fil-a on campus, but those cost more than the off campus. Go to the bike trails if you're bored. Go to walmart and buy smarter foods.",
            "Work out at the rec center. They have tons of programs (that's already been included in your tuition)... Study for classes. Join a program and make friends. It's boring going to school and having no one to talk to. Don't join Greek Life. They are known for their constant partying and low grades. You're paying for college. You can party when you have a job later.",
            "It's actually not bad at all. But if you get a meal card, use it. That's how they can afford to make nice meals. No one really uses their cards. And the meals are $10 a pop if you don't have one. The best is the 1-a-day card. You get one meal each day that you can stuff your face but you aren't oblidged to more. Then just cook at home.",
            "I commute back and forth each day but from what I hear, It's not so great. They only have one really fancy dorm. That's the one they show you on orientation day. But of course those are already filled. The ones you get are super cramped. Your beds are lifted above the desk. It's like a large closet really. The boys and girls are supposed to be in each others rooms at night. But they don't check and it's free reign in the day. Be sure you get a neat freak as a room mate or you'll never see the ground. Oh, and lock your door always because people help themselves. And at night, drunk students stumble in thinking it's theirs. The kitchen is downstairs if you want to cook. But if you cook cookies, make extra because if they smell it, they will come expecting some for them. Just get an apartment.",
            "The people that care, go to class. Those who don't, fail to show up until the testing date. It's really 50/50",
            "Don't apply unless you are certain you want to be a lumberjack. If you wanted to go somewhere better, your attitude will always be lacking because it's not that great. Try to live off campus with a friend, they get all of their money from housing and incoming freshman. Don't take the SFA 101 course. It's a waste of time and money.",
            "The greenery and surroundings are nice. I don't think the customer service is acceptable. People have been cheated out of $12,000 in scholarship because they wanted the transcript personally delivered, not faxed, and no one mentioned it until after the due date."

(1550 a semester...ridiculous), 16858=If you want a huge school with lots of actions, you may want to look elsewhere. There are certainly parties and plenty of sororities, fraternities, and other organizations, but it's a very quiet, low-key school. I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help. Considering that it's a pretty large student ratio, it's kind of amazing how helpful and patient everyone is., 561985=Stephen F. Austin State University Home of the Lumberjacks, Stephen F. Austin State University prides itself on its unique traditions and quality of education. I have never met someone who has attended SFA or is currently a student there who has not been satisfied with their college experience at SFA. Located in the oldest town in Texas, Nacogdoches, SFA makes you feel right at home in the middle of the Piney Woods. Surrounded by trees and smiling faces, the campus is just the right environment for a blooming college student. With endless amounts of student activities and organization, it is impossible for one not to get involved. From Greek Life to the Multicultural center, there is something for everyone at SFA. From their billboards that read anything from \u00c2?Lumberjacks Make Great Teachers! to Lumberjacks Make Great Geologist!, anyone who lives between Dallas and Houston should know that SFA has a wide variety of majors to choose from and small class sizes to go with them. With one of the most sought after Teaching Programs in Texas, an aspiring teacher like me is guaranteed to get the best education. With an average class size of 27 and a 20:1 student to teacher ratio, \u00c2?At SFA, you have a name; not just a number. Unlike larger state schools such as Texas A&M, the majority of classes at SFA are taught by the professors themselves, 80% of whom hold the highest degree in their field. The Academic Assistance and Resource Center or AARC is a peer-tutoring center set up to help those in higher level courses succeed. Stephen F. Austin's goal for their students is for them to be independent learners and succeed in whatever they choose to do with their life. From their welcoming campus life to their multitude of activities and majors, it is almost impossible to not feel at home., 71824=It's not a bad tuition rate. Sure it's a bit costly, but relatively speaking, for a good university, it's a decent price. The food could be a bit better for the price we pay, but the chocolate chip cookies they concoct make up for it. Plus, they offer a nice share of scholarships. :), 576668=All the dorms are in decent condition. The nicest, and most expensive, dorms for freshmen are in Lumberjack Landing. These are suite style dorms, but you have to apply really early for these because they fill up by December with athletes and honor students getting first choice. If you don't mind community bathrooms, then Hall 16 is great! There are frequent events going on and free food being given out on certain evenings., 606518=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Did learn a lot At Stephen F. Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.
