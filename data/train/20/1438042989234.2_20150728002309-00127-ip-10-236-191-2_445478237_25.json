            "Multicast data packet recovery system - Particular embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide methods and systems to support a multicast data packet recovery system. In an example embodiment, the system includes a distribution server operable to detect a missed data packet in a multicast data stream; issue a request for a retransmission of the missed data packet to an acquisition server via a unicast data channel; receive the requested data packet via a multicast data channel, in response to the request for a retransmission of the missed data packet; and send the requested data packet to one or more subscribers.",
            "Controlling multicast source selection in an anycast source audio/video network - Particular embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide methods and systems to support a multicast source selection system. In an example embodiment, the system includes a network element in data communication with a network, the network element being operable to: receive a request for withdrawal of a server as a source of a multicast data stream; and propagate information to the network indicating withdrawal of the server as a source of the multicast data stream, the propagation of information by the network element being responsive to the request for withdrawal of the server as a source of the multicast data stream.",

            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RECORDING AND TIME-SHIFTING PROGRAMMING IN A TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USING POLICIES - Various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide methods and systems to store a policy specifying rules relating to recording, storage or delivery of broadcast programming to a consumer of such programming, and to record, store or deliver broadcast programming in response to a rule. According to an example embodiment, a method and system provide for a subscriber requesting that a broadcast television program be saved for the subscriber upstream from the subscriber in a television distribution system, and that the program offered to the subscriber for saving is determined based on a policy established for the program. According to another example embodiment a system provides a computing device including a computer program to control the recording or delivery of a broadcast television program in accordance with a policy established to control the recording or delivery of the broadcast television program."

Treziak, Jr., Sturtevant, WI US Patent application number Description Published 20100101446 RAILWAY ANCHOR APPLICATOR - A railway anchor applicator for applying an anchor to a rail includes a frame configured for movement along a track, an anchor input for sequentially delivering an anchor to a workhead assembly, where the workhead assembly is movably mounted on the frame for movement toward and away from the rail. An anchor receiving arm is configured for movement between a first position receiving an anchor from an anchor input and a second position placing the anchor away from the anchor input. A main pivot arm is configured for movement between a first position generally away from the rail and a second position generally adjacent the rail. A bar clamp arm is operatively linked to the main pivot arm and is configured for movement underneath the rail, then upwards and towards the rail. An operator station is located on the gage side of the rail which the anchor is being applied. 04-29-2010 20110072998 RAIL PLATE INSERTER - A workhead assembly for use",
