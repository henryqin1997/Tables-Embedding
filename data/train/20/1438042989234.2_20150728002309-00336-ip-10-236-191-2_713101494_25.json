Qualifying losses for each occurrence are after a $100\u00a0million deductible. The treaty covers all of the Company's exposures in the United States and Canada and their territories and possessions, the Caribbean Islands, Mexico and all waters contiguous thereto. The treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. This treaty replaced the Company's General Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty, which was cancelled on a cut-off basis effective December\u00a031, 2014, and the General Catastrophe Aggregate Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty, which expired on December\u00a031, 2014., 925866=Nov.\u00a030, 2014, 177706=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following discussion reflects the Company's retention policy with respect to the Business and International Insurance segment as of January\u00a01, 2015. For third-party liability, Business and International Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $18.8\u00a0million per insured, per occurrence. For property exposures, Business and International Insurance generally limits its net retained amount per risk to $20.0\u00a0million per occurrence, after reinsurance. Business and International Insurance generally retains its workers' compensation exposures. Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. Business and International Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. Business and International Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk., 51459=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Travelers Companies,\u00a0Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) is a holding company principally engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals. The Company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the state of Minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States, dating back to 1853. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 485 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, and its telephone number is (917)\u00a0778-6000. The Company also maintains executive offices in Hartford, Connecticut, and St.\u00a0Paul, Minnesota. The term \"TRV\" in this document refers to The Travelers Companies,\u00a0Inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries., 341108=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The table that follows sets forth the year-end reserves from 2004 through 2014 and the subsequent changes in those reserves, presented on a historical basis. The original estimates, cumulative amounts paid and re-estimated reserves in the table for 2004 through 2012 have not been restated to reflect the acquisition of Dominion in November 2013. The table includes Dominion's reserves beginning at December\u00a031, 2013., 581952=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following rating agency actions were taken with respect to the Company from February\u00a013, 2014 (the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2013), through February\u00a012, 2015:, 1150968=remaining $70\u00a0million of other net realized gains in 2014 were primarily driven by $32\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $24\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities, $8\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to other investments and $6\u00a0million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales., 304215=the cost savings described above, has a lower base commission rate than the Company's existing Quantum Auto 1.0 product. These changes in cost structure enabled the Company to price Quantum Auto 2.0 more competitively while maintaining expected returns at appropriate levels. By December\u00a031, 2014, the Company offered Quantum Auto 2.0 in approximately 90% of the states where it plans to offer the product, and the Company currently expects that, by the end of 2015, it will offer the product in all of those states. The Company intends that, in approved states, all new accounts will be written using Quantum Auto 2.0. In addition, Quantum Auto 2.0 is available to agents at their discretion for existing accounts., 1115225=$941\u00a0million and $840\u00a0million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i)\u00a0earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the Company's business segments, (ii)\u00a0lower reinsurance costs and (iii)\u00a0a 2014 reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the Company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iv)\u00a0an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (v)\u00a0a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of a $63\u00a0million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013., 770365=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. Fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2014. Changes in interest rates caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby negatively impacting our net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity investments, thereby negatively impacting our book value. During 2014, the net unrealized gain in our fixed income portfolio increased from $1.76\u00a0billion to $2.67\u00a0billion as interest rates decreased. It is possible that future increases in interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads) could result in a decline in that unrealized gain position or even result in an unrealized loss, thereby adversely impacting our book value. Interest rates in recent years have been and remain at very low levels relative to historical experience, and it is possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. The value of our fixed maturity and short-term investments is also subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments of such investments. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. During an economic downturn, fixed maturity and short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of default. Rapid changes in commodity prices, such as a significant decline in oil and gas prices, could also subject certain of our investments to a higher risk of default., 927685=Dec.\u00a031, 2014, 899135=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"TRV.\" The number of holders of record, including individual owners, of the Company's common stock was 50,680 as of February\u00a06, 2015. This is not the actual number of beneficial owners of the Company's common stock, as shares are held in \"street name\" by brokers and others on behalf of individual owners. The following table sets forth the high and low closing sales prices of the Company's common stock for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of cash dividends declared per share., 331455=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business and International Insurance Earthquake Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the period July\u00a01, 2014 through June\u00a030, 2015, the Company has entered into an earthquake excess-of-loss treaty that provides for up to $150\u00a0million part of $165\u00a0million of coverage, subject to a $60\u00a0million retention, for losses arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by Technology, Public Sector Services and Commercial Accounts in the Company's Business and International Insurance segment., 756015=commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100\u00a0billion. Our estimated deductible under the program is $2.38\u00a0billion for 2015. Over the six-year life of the reauthorized program, the federal government reimbursement percentage will fall from 85% to 80%. In addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure., 342194=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For instance, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original estimates of reserves as of that year-end have changed in subsequent years. Accordingly, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for a year relates only to reserves at that year-end and those amounts are not additive. Expressed another way, if the original reserves at the end of 2004 included $4\u00a0million for a loss that is finally paid in 2008 for $5\u00a0million, the $1\u00a0million deficiency (the excess of the actual payment of $5\u00a0million over the original estimate of $4\u00a0million) would be included in the cumulative deficiency for 2004 and would also be reflected as a reduction in the cumulative redundancies in each of the years 2005 to 2007 shown in the accompanying table., 924010=Oct.\u00a031, 2014, 302779=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency Automobile line of business has been negatively impacted by various factors, including the use of price comparison technology by agents and brokers as discussed above. The Company's actions in response to these factors have included, among other things, the reduction of claim adjustment and other insurance expenses, with the majority of the impact in the Agency Automobile line of business. At December\u00a031, 2014, these actions to reduce costs have resulted in an expected annual decrease of $140\u00a0million in pre-tax expenses in 2015 when compared with expense levels prior to their implementation. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company launched its newest private passenger automobile product, Quantum Auto 2.0. This product, in addition to incorporating, 166033=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A portion of business in this segment, particularly in National Accounts and Construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. Under workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. At December\u00a031, 2014, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies and the associated receivables were each approximately $4.36\u00a0billion. Business and International Insurance also utilizes retrospectively rated policies for another portion of the business, primarily for workers' compensation coverage. Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it introduces additional credit risk to the Company. Premium receivables from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled approximately $89\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2014. Significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, cash collateral or trusts, is generally obtained for large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. The amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. Business and International Insurance continually monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral. For additional information concerning credit risk in certain of the Company's businesses, see \"Item\u00a01A\u0097Risk Factors\u0097We are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business and investment operations including reinsurance or structured settlements.\", 276635=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2009, the Company began marketing its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online channels. The investment in the direct-to-consumer initiative has generated growing but still modest premium volume for Personal Insurance in recent years, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The direct-to-consumer initiative, while intended to enhance the Company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain modest with respect to premium volume and remain unprofitable for a number of years as the Company continues to develop, test and evaluate this distribution channel., 334977=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program administered by the Department of the Treasury that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. In January 2015, the program was reauthorized through December\u00a031, 2020. For a further description of the program, including the Company's estimated deductible under the program in 2015, see note\u00a05 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements and \"Item\u00a01A\u0097Risk Factors\u0097Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\", 321586=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June\u00a06, 2012, Long Point Re III completed an offering to unrelated investors of $250\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. In connection with the offering, the Company and Long Point Re III entered into a three-year reinsurance agreement providing coverage to the Company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern United States. The proceeds of the offering were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. The attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage are reset annually to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. The attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage were reset in April 2014. Accordingly,, 332818=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canadian Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Contract.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This contract, effective for the period July\u00a01, 2014 through and including June\u00a030, 2015, covers the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence on business written by the Company's Canadian businesses. The treaty covers all property written by the Company's Canadian businesses for Canadian insureds, including, but not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto physical damages exposures, with respect to risks located worldwide, written for Canadian insureds. The treaty provides coverage for 100% of loss retained in excess of C$50\u00a0million (US$43\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2014) up to C$900\u00a0million (US$775\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2014)., 1155437=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $13.31\u00a0billion, $1.37\u00a0billion or 9% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i)\u00a0a decline in catastrophe losses and (ii)\u00a0the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of Dominion), partially offset by (iii)\u00a0the impact of loss cost trends, (iv)\u00a0the impact of the acquisition of Dominion and (v)\u00a0lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2012 primarily resulted from Storm Sandy, as well as multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42\u00a0million charge that was precipitated by legislation in New York enacted during the first quarter of 2013 related to the New York Fund for Reopened Cases for workers' compensation.

The FSOC, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, is a group of federal financial regulators, a state insurance regulator and an independent insurance expert. The FSOC considers companies for designation as a SIFI annually and finalized its first set of SIFI designations in 2013. The Company, based upon the FSOC's rules and interpretive guidance, has not been designated as a SIFI. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Council may change its rules or interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a SIFI. If we were designated as a SIFI, the Federal Reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. As a result of the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other insurers that may not be subject to the same level of regulation. Changes in the U.S. regulatory framework could impact the overall competitive environment by imposing additional burdens on us and allowing other competitors not subject to these same burdens to enter or expand their insurance businesses., 15347=As of June\u00a030, 2014, the aggregate market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates was $31,771,492,266., 330453=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Northeast General Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to its Corporate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty and its multi-year catastrophe bonds, the Company also is party to a northeast general catastrophe reinsurance treaty which provides up to $850\u00a0million of coverage, subject to a $2.25\u00a0billion retention, for certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornados, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storm or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine for the period July\u00a01, 2014 through June\u00a030, 2015. Losses from a covered event (occurring over several days) anywhere in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention.

While the FASB decided during 2014 to retain current U.S.\u00a0GAAP for property and casualty insurance contracts, the IASB is continuing its development of a new model that is significantly different than current U.S.\u00a0GAAP., 697313=For example, if cumulative paid losses for a product line XYZ for accident year 2004 were $100 as of December\u00a031, 2004 (12\u00a0months after the start of that accident year), then grew to $120 as of December\u00a031, 2005 (24\u00a0months after the start), the link ratio for that accident year from 12 to 24\u00a0months would be 1.20. If the link ratio for other recent accident years from 12 to 24\u00a0months for that product line were also at or around 1.20, then the method would assume a similar result for the most recent accident year, i.e.,\u00a0that it too would have its cumulative paid losses grow 120% from the 12\u00a0month to 24\u00a0month valuation., 1118475=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earned premiums in 2014 were $23.71\u00a0billion, $1.08\u00a0billion or 5% higher than in 2013. The increase in earned premiums in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of Dominion on November\u00a01, 2013. In the Business and International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 9% over 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. In the Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 5% over 2013.

The FIO has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers. In December 2013, the FIO released a report recommending ways to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States. While the report did not recommend full federal regulation of insurance, it did suggest an expanded federal role in some circumstances. In addition, the report suggested that Congress should consider direct federal involvement to fill regulatory gaps identified in the report, should those gaps persist, for example, by considering either establishing a federal coordinating body or a direct regulator of select aspects of the industry, such as large complex institutions or institutions that seek a federal charter, if a law is passed to allow a federal charter. It is not clear as to the extent, if any, the report will lead to regulatory changes or how any such changes would impact the Company., 1130691=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net investment income in 2014 was $2.79\u00a0billion, $71\u00a0million or 3% higher than in 2013. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $2.24\u00a0billion, $66\u00a0million lower than in 2013, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $573\u00a0million, $141\u00a0million higher than in 2013, primarily driven by higher returns from the Company's private equity investments, as well as higher returns from real estate partnership investments., 603623=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investment Regulation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments.

Distribution methods include the use of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing and/or salaried employees. According to\u00a0A.M.\u00a0Best, there are approximately 1,275 property and casualty groups in the United States, comprising approximately 2,700 property and casualty companies. Of those groups, the top 150 accounted for approximately 92% of the consolidated industry's total net written premiums in 2013. The Company competes with both foreign and domestic insurers. In addition, several property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the Company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. These products include large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups. The Company's competitive position in the marketplace is based on many factors, including the following:, 599495=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on preliminary 2014 IRIS ratios calculated by the Company for its lead domestic insurance subsidiaries, The Travelers Indemnity Company and St.\u00a0Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company had, 544865=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2014, 2013 and 2012, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) shown in the preceding table, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP reserves), were $29\u00a0million higher, $17\u00a0million higher and $22\u00a0million lower, respectively, than those reported in the Company's respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves)., 17550=The Travelers Companies,\u00a0Inc.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives (many of whom have decades of experience in the insurance industry), and the Board of Directors regularly engages in succession discussions.

For many of our senior positions, we compete for talent not just with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other businesses. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected., 1179226=2013, 94857=In December 2014, the Company announced that its joint venture with JMalucelli in Brazil will acquire a majority interest in Cardinal Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros, a Colombian start-up surety provider.

The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors., 872480=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In July 2013, the IAIS published a methodology for identifying \"global systemically important insurers\" (G-SIIs) and high level policy measures that will apply to the G-SIIs.

Net income of $3.67\u00a0billion in 2013 increased by 49% over net income of $2.47\u00a0billion in 2012. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012. The increase in net income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i)\u00a0lower catastrophe losses, (ii)\u00a0higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii)\u00a0an increase in net realized investment gains and (iv)\u00a0an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, partially offset by (v)\u00a0lower net investment income and (vi)\u00a0lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $591\u00a0million and $1.86\u00a0billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $840\u00a0million and $940\u00a0million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the Company's business segments. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above., 601185=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2014 IRIS ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries.

Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $2.31\u00a0billion, $129\u00a0million lower than in 2012, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $432\u00a0million, $44\u00a0million lower than in 2012, primarily driven by lower returns from the Company's real estate partnership investments., 15565=As of February 6, 2015, 321,368,580 shares of the registrant's common stock (without par value) were outstanding., 927413=Dec.\u00a01, 2014, 1152236=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other net realized investment gains in 2012 of $66\u00a0million were primarily driven by $61\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $19\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to real estate and $8\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. These net realized investment gains were partially offset by $14\u00a0million of net realized investment losses associated with U.S. Treasury futures contracts and $8\u00a0million of net realized investment losses related to other investments., 320582=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Catastrophe Bonds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company has catastrophe protection through two indemnity reinsurance agreements with Long Point Re III\u00a0Ltd.

For third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability, professional liability, directors' and officers' liability, and employment practices liability, Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance generally limits net retentions to $25.0\u00a0million per policy. For surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance generally retains up to $115.0\u00a0million probable maximum loss (PML) per principal but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors. Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk., 275956=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal Insurance also distributes its products through additional channels, including corporations that make the company's product offerings available to their employees primarily through payroll deduction, consumer associations and affinity groups. Personal Insurance handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or through the Company's contact center locations. In addition, since 1995, the Company has had a marketing agreement with GEICO to underwrite homeowners business for certain of their auto customers., 281999=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primary coverages in Personal Insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals.

For example, a substantial portion of the cumulative deficiency shown in the table for 2004 arise from claims on policies written prior to the mid-1980s involving liability exposures such as asbestos and environmental claims. In the post-1984 period, the Company has developed more stringent underwriting standards and policy exclusions and has significantly contracted or terminated the writing of these risks.

While the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established a Federal Insurance Office (the FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. While the FIO has limited regulatory authority, it has been active in the discussions to develop international regulatory standards for the insurance industry. In response to these international efforts, the state insurance regulators, through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, are working with the Federal Reserve and FIO to consider and develop changes to the U.S. regulatory framework. These changes are evidenced by the recent incorporation of supervisory colleges into the U.S. regulatory framework. A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional authority over a holding company's various insurance subsidiaries, including foreign insurance subsidiaries, convened to meet with the insurer's executive management, to evaluate the insurer from both a group-wide and legal-entity basis. Some of the items evaluated during the colleges include the insurer's business strategies, enterprise risk management and corporate governance. The state of Connecticut is the lead regulator for TRV and conducts the supervisory colleges for the Company., 1154134=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $13.87\u00a0billion, $563\u00a0million or 4% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting (i)\u00a0the impact of the acquisition of Dominion, (ii)\u00a0the impact of loss cost trends, (iii)\u00a0higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv)\u00a0higher catastrophe losses and (v)\u00a0a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses, partially offset by (vi)\u00a0the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of Dominion) and (vii)\u00a0higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2014 included multiple wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States and a winter storm in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. Catastrophe losses in 2013 resulted from multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as floods in Alberta, Canada and Storm Xaver in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment are discussed in more detail in note\u00a07 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements., 829001=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included in these changes is an amendment to insurance holding company regulations that require insurers who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to provide the lead insurance regulator with a summary of the company's enterprise risk management (ERM) framework including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose risk to the insurance entities within the holding company system. Beginning in 2015, insurers having premium volume above certain thresholds, including the Company, will also be required to perform at least annually a self-assessment of their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and solvency assessment or ORSA) and file a confidential report with the insurer's lead insurance regulator. The ORSA concept has two primary goals, which are to foster an effective level of ERM at all insurers within the holding company system, and to provide a group wide perspective on risk and capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. ORSA is now included in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) standards and is in various stages of implementation in the United States, Europe, Canada, and other jurisdictions. It is possible that, as a result of ORSA or other reasons, our states of domicile or other regulatory bodies will require changes in our ERM process or take other regulatory actions that could limit our ability to write additional business or reduce our capital management flexibility.

For information on dividends, as well as restrictions on the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends or otherwise, see \"Item\u00a07\u0097Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0097Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, and subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company., 520719=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December 2008, the Company completed the sale of Unionamerica Holdings Limited (Unionamerica), which comprised its United Kingdom (U.K.)-based runoff insurance and reinsurance businesses. Immediately before the sale, the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of Unionamerica totaled $790\u00a0million. As a result of the sale, those obligations ceased being the responsibility of the Company and its affiliates. The sale is reflected in the table as a reduction in December\u00a031, 2008 net reserves of $790\u00a0million and as a $790\u00a0million increase in paid losses for each of the years 2004 through 2007 to reflect the transfer (payment) of the reserves to the buyer, resulting in no impact to incurred losses., 608216=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulators in these jurisdictions require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. Each of the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December\u00a031, 2014., 520237=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For years prior to 2013, the table excludes reserves of Dominion, which were acquired by the Company on November\u00a01, 2013. Accordingly, the reserve development for years prior to 2013 does not include reserve development recorded by Dominion. At December\u00a031, 2013, Dominion's gross reserves were $2,110\u00a0million, and net reserves were $1,779\u00a0million., 284210=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following discussion reflects the Company's retention policy with respect to the Personal Insurance segment as of January\u00a01, 2015. Personal Insurance generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety. For personal property insurance, there is an $8.0\u00a0million maximum retention per risk. Personal Insurance issues umbrella policies up to a maximum limit of $10.0\u00a0million per risk. Personal Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk., 786550=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims arise under various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA and similar state laws may be imposed on certain parties even if they did not cause the release or threatened release of hazardous substances and may be joint and several with other responsible parties., 876988=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From time to time we may investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition justify the risks. For example, in November 2013, we acquired Dominion and significantly expanded our Canadian operations. The process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. For example, acquisitions may present significant risks, including:, 323502=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On May\u00a016, 2013, Long Point Re III completed a second offering to unrelated investors of $300\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. In connection with the offering, the Company and Long Point Re III entered into a three-year reinsurance agreement providing for coverage to the Company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern United States. Similar to the first arrangement with Long Point Re III, the proceeds of the offering were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. The attachment point and maximum limit are reset annually, with the ability of the Company to adjust the expected loss of the coverage layer (the difference between the attachment point and the maximum limit) within a predetermined range. The attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage were reset in April 2014. Accordingly, for the period May\u00a017, 2014 through May\u00a016, 2015, the Company will be entitled to begin recovering amounts under the reinsurance agreement if the losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an initial attachment amount of $1.222\u00a0billion. The full $300\u00a0million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until covered losses reach a maximum $1.772\u00a0billion., 94257=International also includes the Company's 49.5% ownership of the common stock of J. Malucelli Participa\u00e7\u00f5es em Seguros e Resseguros\u00a0S.A. (JMalucelli), its joint venture in Brazil. JMalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in Brazil based on market share. JMalucelli commenced writing other property and casualty insurance business in 2012. The Company's investment in JMalucelli is accounted for using the equity method and is included in \"other investments\" on the consolidated balance sheet., 1119670=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow., 1153137=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of other revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2013 also included a $91\u00a0million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note\u00a016 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, and a $20\u00a0million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the Company's National Flood Insurance Program business., 871216=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the European Union's executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II that would apply to the Company's businesses across the European Union. The implementation date of Solvency II has been delayed until January\u00a01, 2016, although some aspects, including governance guidelines, own risk assessments and regulatory reporting, are being phased in before the full implementation date. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed \"equivalent\" to Solvency II. In addition, regulators in countries where the Company has operations are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) (and with the NAIC, the Federal Reserve and FIO in the U.S.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group capital requirements., 332195=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal Insurance Earthquake Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the period January\u00a01, 2015 through December\u00a031, 2015, the Company has entered into an earthquake excess-of-loss treaty that provides for up to $200\u00a0million of coverage, subject to a $150\u00a0million retention, for losses arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by the Company's Personal Insurance segment., 1158487=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is pierced and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. The threshold for 2014 ranged from approximately $17\u00a0million to $30\u00a0million of losses before reinsurance and taxes., 339753=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted to the present value of estimated future payments using a rate of 5% at both December\u00a031, 2014 and 2013. These discounted reserves totaled $2.01\u00a0billion and $2.21\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2014 and 2013, respectively., 888574=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact our reported results.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a U.S.-based SEC registrant, we are currently required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S.\u00a0GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), subject to the accounting-related rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During the last several years, the SEC has been evaluating whether, when and how International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) should be incorporated into the U.S. financial reporting system, including for companies such as us. In December 2014, the SEC indicated that it plans to explore allowing IFRS financial statements or financial information as supplemental information in SEC filings., 1119169=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earned premiums in 2013 were $22.64\u00a0billion, $280\u00a0million or 1% higher than in 2012. In the Business and International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 4% over 2012. In the Bond\u00a0& Specialty Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 1% over 2012. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 decreased by 4% from 2012., 571205=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table summarizes the current debt, trust preferred securities and commercial paper ratings of the Company and its subsidiaries as of February\u00a012, 2015. The table also presents the position of each rating in the applicable agency's rating scale., 863925=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have increasingly outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue to do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security or service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. For example, while it did not materially and adversely impact our operations or results, we terminated a contract with one of our outsourcing vendors in the fourth quarter of 2013 because they breached that contract by providing proprietary Company information to one of our competitors. In addition to risks caused by third party providers, our ability to receive services from third party providers outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or public policy inside or outside of the United States., 873971=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IAIS also is in the process of developing the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (Comframe). The IAIS released a Consultation Draft in October 2013, which may lead to similar policy measures as those being developed for G-SIIs, including group supervision and an Insurance Capital Standard (i.e., global group capital requirement). The IAIS revised the Comframe guidance based on comments received and is currently in the process of field testing many of the requirements. The Company would be considered an Internationally Active Insurance Group under the current Consultation Draft. It is possible that Comframe, if adopted, could lead to enhanced supervision and higher capital standards on a global basis if the IAIS, the NAIC and the individual states adopt the proposed or similar provisions., 341644=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry.

The remaining $66\u00a0million of other net realized investment gains in 2013 were primarily driven by $41\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $15\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities and $10\u00a0million of net realized investment gains related to other investments., 1132311=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The National Accounts market in the Business and International Insurance segment is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business.

Some of TRV's other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, Canada. Authorized insurers in Canada are subject to change of control restrictions in Section\u00a0407 of the Insurance Companies Act, including approval of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. JMalucelli and its subsidiaries are subject to change of control and other share transfer restrictions and requirements in insurance laws and regulations in Brazil, mainly in Decree 73/1966 and CNSP Resolution no.\u00a0166/2007, which may include the need for prior approval of the insurance regulator, Superintendencia de Seguros Privados., 621354=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2014, the Company had approximately 30,200 employees.

The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at December\u00a031, 2014 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur., 554439=General Insurance Company and Travelers Insurance Company Limited as of February\u00a012, 2015.

Net income of $3.69\u00a0billion in 2014 increased slightly over net income of $3.67\u00a0billion in 2013. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The slight increase in net income was primarily driven by the pretax impacts of (i)\u00a0higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"), (ii)\u00a0higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii)\u00a0higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv)\u00a0higher catastrophe losses, (v)\u00a0a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (vi)\u00a0lower net realized investment gains.
