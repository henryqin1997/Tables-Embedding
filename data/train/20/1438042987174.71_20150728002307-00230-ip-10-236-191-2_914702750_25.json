Last year they hosted Frank Warren, the founder of PostSecret, and this year, they are going to have 3oh!3 perform on September 1st, 2012. Around campus, the mall is pretty nice and there are plenty of clubs, tattoo shops, and other fun places., 282121=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 24574=Colorado Mesa is located in the heart of outdoor recreational opportunities. This year, I have been river rafting/floating, backpacking, camping, and I am looking forward to the ski season to begin. Powder Horn is an awesome little mountain and it's only 40 minutes away. There are a few night clubs, and some good bars on Main Street. Furthermore, there is the Mesa Theater, which I have seen many good shows at from big artists including Tech N9ne, The Expendables, The Green, Reel Big Fish, exc. In conclusion, there is a popular club on campus called PAC, and their mission is to bring epic events to us for free, regularly. Some examples of this include bringing comedians in, providing stress-relief week during finals, and bringing Macklemore to preform April 20, 2013., 22207=The first stages of Greek life are beginning on campus, Fall 2012 is the first year that a Fraternity exists.}",

Mathematics majors 2.) Any kind of medical major 3.) GREAT for theatre and art majors 4.) Sports Tips for prospective students 1.) Have an idea of what you want to do 2.) Loans and grants are okay, but have a plan of how you're going to pay them back. 3.) Be open and have fun! Bang for the buck It's a little pricey, but there are several different, degree-specific and general, scholarships available for incoming freshmen and people who are in their first or second year. It's real easy to get a little help when paying for the tuition, books, and fees that are always a pain in the you-know-where to find money for. Am enjoying being here I can't count how many clubs, extracurricular activities, and",
