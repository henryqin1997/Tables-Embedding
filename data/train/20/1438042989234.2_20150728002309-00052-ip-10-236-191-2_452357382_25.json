            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - An image forming apparatus includes: a latent image bearing member on which an electrostatic latent image is to be formed; a developing unit which contains the developer and performs a development process to develop the electrostatic latent image formed on the latent image bearing member; and a movement mechanism which moves the developing unit toward the latent image bearing member when the development process is performed, and moves the developing unit away from the latent image bearing member and changes the attitude of the developing unit with, respect to the latent image bearing member when the development process is not performed.",
            "METHOD FOR PRODUCING RESIN-COATED CARRIER, RESIN-COATED CARRIER, TWO-COMPONENT DEVELOPER, DEVELOPING DEVICE, IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS AND IMAGE FORMING METHOD - A method for producing a low density resin-coated carrier having a small resin amount to a carrier core material and having a uniform resin coating layer formed on the carrier core material is provided. A resin-coated carrier has a carrier core material and a resin coating layer formed on the surface of the carrier core material. The carrier core material has pores and an apparent density of 1.6 g/cm",
            "IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS - The present invention therefore provides an image forming apparatus, comprising: a photoconductor; a charge means for charging the photoconductor; an exposure means for irradiating a surface of the photoconductor with light to form an electrostatic latent image; a development means for developing the electrostatic latent image formed; a transfer means for transferring the image developed onto a paper sheet; and a discharge means for irradiating the surface of the photoconductor with light to eliminate charges, wherein the photoconductor contains a titanylphthalocyanine having absorption bands in a wavelength region of 380 nm to 420 nm and a wavelength region of 600 nm to 850 nm as a charge generation material, the exposure means irradiates the surface of the photoconductor with light having a wavelength of 380 nm to 420 nm to form the electrostatic latent image, and the discharge means irradiates the surface of the photoconductor with light having a wavelength of 600 nm to 850 nm to eliminate the charges.",
            "TWO-COMPONENT DEVELOPER AND IMAGE FORMING METHOD - A two-component developer includes a toner and a resin-coated carrier. To the toner, a plurality of types of external additives each of which has a different average primary particle size are externally added, at least one type of the external additives having an average primary particle size of 0.1 \u03bcm or more. The resin-coated carrier includes a carrier core formed of ferrite having a volume average particle size of 25 \u03bcm or more and 90 \u03bcm or less, and a resin coating layer that is formed on the surface of the carrier core and contains a magnetic fine particle having a volume average particle size of 0.1 \u03bcm or more and 2 \u03bcm or less and a silicone resin, wherein 40 parts by weight or more and 100 parts by weight or less of the magnetic fine particle based on 100 parts by weight of the silicone resin are contained."
