It consisted of two sections: background information and the actual survey questions. The instructions read as follows: APPENDIX TWOSurvey Results Despite the fact that this sample cannot be generalized to the whole population, the results do appear to be representative of the experiences of those women who do have difficulties after an abortion. This is a legitimate reference point in and of itself. This study is analogous to studying a group of patients who all becoming ill from, for example, an artificial sweetener. It is proper scientific method to study the symptoms and experiences of this group of \u201csick\u201d patients. Only then can their \u201cillness\u201d be cataloged and a hypothesis be developed. Only after identifying the primary symptoms could one then go out and survey all users of the artificial sweetener to determine how widespread these symptoms may be. This latter stage is part of our ongoing work. In referring to the findings of this study, then, it would be most appropriate to say, for example, \u201cOf women who report post-abortion problems, 53% felt \u2018forced\u2019 to abort by one or more other people, and 39% report feeling very much \u2018forced\u2019 to abort by others.\u201d Note, this was a survey of women who had some involement with Women Exploited By Abortion, a peer support group for women who were experiencing negative post-abortion reaction.
