However, compared to other colleges, the classes and books are actually reasonable. Instead paying sometimes a $1000 for one class, you can pay as low even $100 per subject., 125329=I am guessing this is asking something about the price of the school or something? So under that interpretation it is fairly cheap, a 12 credit semester will run you about 1300 and then books which will be about another 500. One good thing is they now offer book rentals or you can always sell your old books back for about half price., 177977=I have never seen a squad car or campus safety officer in six years. I've been told parking is only enforced until 1700. If there is any campus security, I'm guessing they go home at 1700. I have almost exclusively all night classes since that is the only time they are offered. Walking around campus at night I notice the outside lights along the buildings and pathways aren't even on. This is the darkest campus I have ever seen. The school is clearly more interested in reducing costs that providing security for students., 210957=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2063=Even though it is not a huge college, it is a pretty big college for our community, allowing to attend smaller classes, which means we get to know mostly everybody. I am enrolled in the Pre-Architectural Program, which means i must take all my classes with the same class mates i started with way back in Fall-2008. We have been very helpful with each other, very friendly, etc. The one thing i enjoy the most, it my free time. The college is very flexible, is very easy to get from one building to another, it is just great.}",

Food and Dining Niceville is a small town and there are tons of restaurants nearby. Dorm Life There are apartments close to the school but being a community college there are not exactly dorms. Academic Rigor Depending on the class, more work will be expected of you then others. But if you are willing to actually read the books and pay attention in class it is not hard to pass. Tips for prospective students Attendance policy is enforced so make sure you go to school, and try to get there early if you want a good parking spot. In three sentences The campus is easy to get around and the staff and faculty are friendly. Speaking to an adviser takes time though and some classes are more challenging then others, but over all the school is nice and should be appreciated. Login to rate or flag the",
