Misfolding of this form produces a disease-associated, protease-resistant form, PRPN (Sc), accompanied by a large increase of the beta-sheet content and formation of amyloid fibrils. These fibrils consist of a cross-beta spine, formed by a steric zipper of superposed beta-strands. Disease mutations may favor intermolecular contacts via short beta strands, and may thereby trigger oligomerization. In addition, the heparan-sulfate proteoglycan, GPC1, promotes the association of PRPN (C) to lipid rafts and appears to facilitate the conversion to PRPN (Sc). Contains an N-terminal region composed of octamer repeats. At low copper concentrations, the sidechains of His residues from three or four repeats contribute to the binding of a single copper ion. Alternatively, a copper ion can be bound by interaction with the sidechain and backbone amide nitrogen of a single His residue. The observed copper binding stoichiometry suggests that two repeat regions cooperate to stabilize the binding of a single copper ion. At higher copper concentrations, each octamer can bind one copper ion by interactions with the His sidechain and Gly backbone atoms. A mixture of binding types may occur, especially in the case of",
