    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun Occasional Flag Football games, lots of events organized by the school, plays from the drama department, the town has two movie theaters and a drive-in, the town also has a put-put place and a bowling alley. There is also a large Lake nearby and plenty of woods to camp/hike through. Food and Dining The food is fairly good. The price isn't extravagant. Overall, nothing to write home to mom about. However, the Baptist Student Ministry House occasionally serves free lunches, and those are nice. Dorm Life No dorms Academic Rigor The rigor of the course depends on how you go through out it. I picked to take more difficult courses: Calculus 1 and 2, University Physics, etc... These classes were difficult, but when I took simpler classes like Developmental Psychology the class was easier to handle. (Also, George Martinez is a wonderful Psych prof) You can tailor the rigor to however much you really want. Tips for prospective students Students should just be prepared to work with their professors. The professors are so nice, and they are willing to help you out if you are in a tough spot. I",
