Each port supports full-duplex operation., 71493=The G1000-4 card requires Cisco ONS 15454 Release 3.2 or later system software and the XC10G cross-connect card. You can install the card in Slots 1 to 6 and 12 to 17, for a total shelf capacity of 48 Gigabit Ethernet ports. The practical G1000-4 port per shelf limit is 40, because at least two slots are typically filled by OC-N trunk cards such as the OC-192., 31575=The CE-MR-10 card is a ten-port Ethernet card.

This makes it compatible with the ONS 15454 CE-100T-8 and ML-Series cards. The CE-1000-4 card supports VCAT groups (VCGs) that are reconfigurable when SW-LCAS is enabled (flexible VCGs). The CE-1000-4 card does not support the standard hardware-based LCAS., 36518=G1000-4, 129314=1310 nm single-mode fiber up to 10 km long, 135498=1530 nm, 30438=See the ML1000-2 Card., 129579=1550 nm single-mode fiber, 57984=The E1000-2 card has one bicolor LED per port (Table 5-8). When the LED is solid green, it indicates that carrier is detected, meaning an active network cable is installed.
