Frozen master cell or working cells may be thawed and passed to an agar plate and cultured one or more times at 25\ufffd C. for approximately one to two weeks. The callus is then teased apart and used to inoculate a flask of liquid suspension medium to produce a working cell or production culture. Working cell cultures used as inoculum for production cultures grown at room temperature with continuous agitation and passed in liquid suspension medium. Cultures are passed approximately every 3-14 days depending on the extent of growth observed and may be split 1:3 or 1:10 at each pass., 73560=To produce a working cell line from a master cell agar plate, a healthy callus is selected, aseptically teased apart and portions placed into a flask containing liquid suspension medium. Working cell lines may also be passed from liquid culture to liquid culture using a 1:3 or 1:10 split while increasing the volume of the culture until a one liter volume is achieved in shaker flasks. One to three liters of shake flask culture may be transferred to a ten liter stirred tank as an inoculum. Production cultures are produced in a stirred tank with 100 liters working volume. A 100 liter fermenter may be inoculated at a 1:10 ratio of culture from a stirred tank or from multiple shaker flask cultures. Cultures in stirred tanks greater than ten liters are grown in liquid suspension medium without the selection agent., 66984=Agrobacterium-mediated transfer is a widely applicable system for introducing foreign DNA into plant cells because the DNA can be introduced into whole plant tissues, eliminating the need to regenerate an intact plant from a protoplast. The use of Agrobacterium-mediated plant integrating vectors to introduce DNA into plant cells is well known in the art. See, for example, the methods described in Fraley et al., 1985, Biotechnology, 3:629; Rogers et al., 1987, Meth. in Enzymol., 153:253-277. Further, the integration of the Ti-DNA is a relatively precise process resulting in few rearrangements. The region of DNA to be transferred is defined by the border sequences, and intervening DNA is usually inserted into the plant genome as described in Spielmann et al., 1986, Mol. Gen. Genet., 205:34; Jorgensen et al., 1987, Mol. Gen. Genet., 207:471., 79718=The granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) promoter, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,798 herein incorporated by reference, was used to make other vectors. These constructs were made using a promoter fragment amplified from genomic DNA of Solanum tuberosum L. cv. \u201cDesiree\u201d using primers designed from the sequence in Genbank accession X83220 for the Chinese potato cultivar \u201cDongnong\u201d. A mutagenic primer \u201cGSS-Nco\u201d (5\u2032-[TGCCATGGTGATGTGTGGTCTACAA] SEQ ID NO:7) was used to create a Nco I site overlapping the translation initiation codon, along with forward primer \u201cGSS-1.8F\u201d (5\u2032-[GATCTGACAAGTCAAGAAAATTG] SEQ ID NO:8) complimentary to the 5\u2032 region at \u22121800 bp; the 1825 bp PCR product was cloned in T-tailed pBluescriptKS to make pKS-GBN, and sequenced. A mutagenic primer \u201cGSS-Xho\u201d (5\u2032[AGCTCGAGCTGTGTGAGTGAGTG] SEQ ID NO:9) was used to create a XhoI site just 3\u2032 of the transcription start site along with primer \u201cGSS-1.8F\u201d; the 1550 bp PCR product was cloned in T-tailed pBluescriptKS to make pKS-GBX, and sequenced., 74412=The cultures are grown at ambient temperatures with continuous agitation for a period of 3-14 days for the working cell cultures. In most cases the working cell cultures are passed every 7 days with a 1:10 split. During scale-up of the working cells, the cultures are passed at a 1:10 split and are grown for at least seven days. The production cultures are grown for 7-15 days before harvest. Cultures are observed daily for characteristic growth, and samples of production cultures are aseptically removed periodically for microscopic examination and determination of packed cell volume. Cells should increase in density to a packed cell volume (PCV) of approximately 35% and should contain at least 50% healthy viable cells, based on a visual estimate, at the time of harvest. Microscopic examination of the cells should reveal a nucleus visible within the cells, but other cellular structures should not be observable., 62577=The plant cell cultures provided herein are not limited to any particular method for transforming plant cells. Technology for introducing DNA into plant cells is well-known to those of skill in the art. Four basic methods for delivering foreign DNA into plant cells have been described. Chemical methods (Graham and van der Eb, Virology, 54(02):536-539, 1973; Zatloukal, Wagner, Cotten, Phillips, Plank, Steinlein, Curiel, Bimstiel, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 660:136-153, 1992); Physical methods including microinjection (Capecchi, Cell, 22(2):479-488, 1980), electroporation (Wong and Neumann, Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 107(2):584-587, 1982; Fromm, Taylor, Walbot, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82(17):5824-5828,1985; U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,253) and the gene gun (Johnston and Tang, Methods Cell. Biol., 43(A):353-365, 1994; Fynan, Webster, Fuller, Haynes, Santoro, Robinson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90(24):11478-11482, 1993); Viral methods (Clapp, Clin. Perinatol., 20(1):155-168, 1993; Lu, Xiao, Clapp, Li, Broxmeyer, J. Exp. Med. 178(6):2089-2096, 1993; Eglitis and Anderson, Biotechniques, 6(7):608-614, 1988; Eglitis, Kantoff, Kohn, Karson, Moen, Lothrop, Blaese, Anderson, Avd. Exp. Med. Biol., 241:19-27, 1988); and Receptor-mediated methods (Curiel, Agarwal, Wagner, Cotten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88(19):8850-8854, 1991; Curiel, Wagner, Cotten, Birnstiel, Agarwal, Li, Loechel, Hu, Hum. Gen. Ther., 3(2):147-154, 1992; Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89 (13):6099-6103, 1992)., 64987=Another method for delivering foreign transforming DNA to plant cells is by microprojectile bombardment. In this method, microparticles are coated with foreign DNA and delivered into cells by a propelling force. Such micro particles are typically made of tungsten, gold, platinum, and similar metals. An advantage of microprojectile bombardment is that neither the isolation of protoplasts (Cristou et al., 1988, Plant Physiol., 87:671-674,) nor the susceptibility to Agrobacterium infection is required. An illustrative embodiment of a method for delivering DNA into maize cells by acceleration is a Biolistics Particle Delivery System, which can be used to propel particles coated with DNA or cells through a screen onto a filter surface covered with corn cells cultured in suspension. The screen disperses the particles so that they are not delivered to the recipient cells in large aggregates. For the bombardment, cells in suspension are preferably concentrated on filters or solid culture medium. Alternatively, immature embryos or other target cells may be arranged on solid culture medium. The cells to be bombarded are positioned at an appropriate distance below the macroprojectile stopping plate. In bombardment transformation, one may optimize the prebombardment culturing conditions and the bombardment parameters to yield the maximum numbers of stable transformants. Both the physical and biological parameters for bombardment are important in this technology. Physical factors are those that involve manipulating the DNA/microprojectile precipitate or those that affect the flight and velocity of either the microprojectiles. Biological factors include all steps involved in manipulation of cells before and immediately after bombardment, the osmotic adjustment of target cells to help alleviate the trauma associated with bombardment, and also the nature of the transforming DNA, such as linearized DNA or intact supercoiled plasmids., 30301=This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/733,702, filed Nov. 4, 2005., 41248=SEQ ID NO:11 is a plant-optimized DNA sequence encoding a variation of E/91 VP2 (1425 bases). The coding region for E/91 plant-optimized VP2 comprises bases 16 to 1383 (1371 bases). Six frame stops are found at bases 1384 to 1425., 68662=Transformation of plant protoplasts can be achieved using methods based on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, and combinations of these treatments (see, e.g., Potrykus et al., 1985, Mol. Gen. Genet., 199:183; Marcotte et al., Nature, 335:454, 1988). Application of these systems to different plant species depends on the ability to regenerate the particular species from protoplasts., 69138=For practice of the present invention, it is preferable to transform plant cell lines that can be cultured and scaled-up rapidly. The use of plant cell cultures avoids open field production and greatly reduces the chances of gene escape and food contamination. Tobacco suspension cell cultures such NT-1 and BY-2 (Kato et al. 1972, Proc. IV IFS: Ferment. Technol. Today 689-695; An, G., 1985 Plant Physiol. 79, 568-570; Nagata et al. 1992, International Review of Cytology 132, 1-30.) are preferred because these lines are particularly susceptible to handling in culture, are readily transformed, produce stably integrated events and are amenable to cryopreservation., 111515=Cells were transferred to a sterile, 50 ml conical centrifuge tube, and brought up to a final volume of 45 ml with NTC medium (NT-1 medium containing 500 mg/L carbenicillin, added after autoclaving). They were mixed, then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min in a centrifuge equipped with a swinging bucket rotor. The supernatant was removed, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in 45 ml of NTC. The wash was repeated. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 40 ml NTC. Aliquots of 5 ml were plated onto each Petri plate (150\ufffd15 mm) containing NTCB10 medium (NTC medium solidified with 8 g/l Agar/Agar; supplemented with 10 mg/l bialaphos, added after autoclaving). Plates were wrapped with parafilm then maintained in the dark at 25\ufffd1\ufffd C. Before transferring to the culture room, plates were left open in the laminar flow hood to allow excess liquid to evaporate. After 6 to 8 weeks, putative transformants appeared. They were selected and transferred to fresh NTCB5 (NTC medium solidified with 8 g/l Agar/Agar; supplemented with 5 mg/l bialaphos, added after autoclaving). The plates were wrapped with parafilm and cultured in the dark at 25\ufffd1\ufffd C., 70526=Many plant cell culture techniques and systems ranging from laboratory-scale shaker flasks to multi-thousand liter bioreactor vessels have been described and are well know in the art of plant cell culture. See, for example, Fischer, R. et al, 1999 Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30, 109-112 and Doran, P., 2000 Current Opinions in Biotechnology 11, 199-204. After the transformed plant cells have been cultured to the mass desired, they are harvested, gently washed and placed in a suitable buffer for disruption. Many different buffers are compatible with the present invention. In general the buffer is an aqueous isotonic buffered salt solution at or near a neutral pH value that does not contain harsh detergents that can be used to solubilize membranes. Preferred buffers include Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline and PBS containing 1 mM EDTA.}",
