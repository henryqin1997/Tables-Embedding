With only two dorm buildings not a lot of students live on campus but events are thrown on campus enough for you to get involved. The dorm I currently live in is only two years old and more of a suite than a traditional dorm setup. The campus is also preparing to make even another dorm and it will be finished by fall 2015., 56640=Most universities have restaurants and plenty of seating. The cafeteria at Rogers State is more like a small convenient store and has enough seating for about 50 people. It is actually located inside a building that has classrooms and the campus bookstore. The required meal plan is only $1500 a semester but has minimal choices. Most people would rather opt out of the meal plan completely and see it as a waste of money. They are hoping to build a new cafeteria in the future that includes more choices and is set up in a restaurant style., 125569=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 115740=The current caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the campuses Centennial Center is the only dining area at the moment, but it still is awesome yet overpriced on some items, but the food is always delicious and the sodexo workers do a great job everyday. The campus is towards the end of construction of the new dining hall building which will be done at the end of the current semester. Spring2014.}",

Lol! But I've really seen it happen....very comfortably. Tips for prospective students Relax! It's a really warm, friendly. laid-back relaxed atmosphere. Don't catastrophize. Nothing's ever really as bad as you imagine it will be. I promise these instructors will work with you if you have academic, or even personal issues interferring with your academics. They will give you every benefit of the doubt and talk you through whatever is bothering you. Bang for the buck",
