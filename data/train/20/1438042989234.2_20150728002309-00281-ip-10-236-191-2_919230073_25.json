This proposed rule would implement portions of Title XI of the MMA that pertain to provision of notice to each patent owner and the new drug application (NDA) holder of certain patent certifications made by applicants submitting 505(b)(2) applications or ANDAs; the availability of 30-month stays of approval on 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs that are otherwise ready to be approved; submission of amendments and supplements to 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs; and the types of bioavailability and bioequivalence data that can be used to support these applications. This proposed rule also would amend certain regulations regarding 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs to facilitate compliance with and efficient enforcement of the FD&C Act., 41577=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending the comment period for the proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register of February 6, 2015. In the proposed rule, FDA requested comments on its proposal to implement portions of Title XI of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which amended provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) that govern the approval of 505(b)(2) applications and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). FDA also requested comment on its proposal to amend certain regulations regarding 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs to facilitate compliance with and efficient enforcement of the FD&C Act. The Agency is taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments., 31314=Title 21 published on 2014-04-01, 18105=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a final rule entitled \u201cPostmarketing Safety Reports for Human Drug and Biological Products; Electronic Submission Requirements\u201d that appeared in the Federal Register of June 10, 2014 (79 FR 33072). The document amended FDA's postmarketing safety reporting regulations for human drug and biological products to require that persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements submit safety reports in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. The document was published with an incorrect RIN number. This document corrects the error., 3273=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is delaying the compliance date for the final rule for the electronic submission of postmarketing safety reports for human drugs and biological products that published in the Federal Register of June 10, 2014. The rule amended FDA's postmarketing safety reporting regulations for human drugs and biological products to require that persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements submit safety reports in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA is also announcing the availability of the Safety Reporting Portal (SRP), a Web-based electronic submission system, for the electronic submission of postmarketing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of adverse events for human drug and nonvaccine biological products. The SRP is intended to facilitate the secure electronic submission of postmarketing ICSRs and ICSR attachments to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The SRP creates a simple and efficient mechanism for electronic reporting of ICSRs that does not require an internal database that is compatible with the International Conference on Harmonisation-based direct submission system. FDA is delaying the compliance date for the final rule because FDA understands that not all persons subject to mandatory postmarketing reporting requirements who wish to use the newly available Safety Reporting Portal (SRP) will have the opportunity to register for an account and test the submission process prior to June 10, 2015, the effective date of the final rule., 51626=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a 1-day public meeting entitled \u201cSupplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs and Biological Products.\u201d The purpose of the meeting is to provide a public forum for FDA to listen to comments on the proposed rule on \u201cchanges being effected\u201d supplements that was published in the Federal Register of November 13, 2013, and alternatives offered to this proposed rule. FDA is also reopening the comment period for the proposed rule to receive submissions of additional written comments on the proposed rule as well as alternative proposals presented during the public meeting., 22428=The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a document entitled \u201cPostmarketing Safety Reports for Human Drug and Biological Products; Electronic Submission Requirements; Correction\u201d that appeared in the Federal Register of August 14, 2014 (79 FR 47655). The document published without the required RIN number and in the Notice category. This document corrects those errors.}",
